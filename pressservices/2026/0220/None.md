New Data Shows Smart Pricing Increases Bookings for Holiday Rental Hosts

 Edinburgh, 17 February 2026

Hosts of holiday rentals utilizing Travelnest's Smart Pricing feature are experiencing a remarkable 71% increase in bookings compared to their previous performance, according to fresh data released from the platform today.

This analysis, which encompasses over 1,000 holiday rental properties across the UK, underscores how data-driven pricing strategies are reshaping outcomes for hosts in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive for short-term rentals.

Properties that have adopted Smart Pricing have witnessed notable increases in bookings, with some hosts reporting even more extraordinary gains. Individual property owners on the platform have noted booking increases of as much as 223%, while those managing multiple properties have seen increases surpassing 130%.

The data further highlights the advantages of multi-channel distribution. Travelnest hosts who have activated all six booking channels - including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia - are earning 46% more revenue and securing 51% more bookings annually compared to those who utilize fewer channels.

"These statistics illustrate the potential for hosts when they merge innovative technology with extensive exposure," stated Cameron Boal, Chief Marketing Officer. "Relying on manual pricing and limiting listings to a single platform can result in lost revenue. Our data indicates that hosts who adopt automation and multi-channel distribution are significantly outperforming their peers who do not."

This revelation comes as an increasing number of property owners seek to optimize their returns from holiday rentals in light of rising operational costs and heightened competition from new entrants in the market.

Notes to editors:

The data is derived from Travelnest's analysis of booking performance across more than 1,000 UK holiday rental properties, comparing results before and after the implementation of Smart Pricing and across different levels of channel activation.
