# B&amp;M Electric Completes Home Build in Ensenada, Mexico

B&M Electric's Three-Day Home Build in Ensenada Highlights Philanthropy

 Torrance, United States - February 22, 2026 / B&M Electric /

 

At the core of B&M Electric lies a commitment to giving back. Over the weekend, Charles Vargas, the Founder and CEO, collaborated with Prosperity Homes and fellow members of his business coaching group, Giving Business Soul, to construct a home for a family in need in Ensenada, Mexico. The dedicated team managed to complete the home within just three days, from December 6 to December 8, and spent Sunday visiting a nearby migrant farmworker camp to provide food, clothing, and support.

"One home. Three days. Countless memories," stated Charles Vargas, the Founder and CEO of B&M Electric. "This experience was not solely about constructing a home-it was about fostering hope, dignity, and opportunity. Witnessing the hardships that many hardworking families endure was both humbling and a profound reminder of why service must be an integral part of our mission."

On Sunday, December 7, during their visit to the camp, the group interacted with families facing difficult living conditions and distributed pizza, groceries, clothing, and essential items. "We are thankful for the opportunity to arrive with open hands and open hearts," Vargas remarked. "We came to give, and we departed feeling inspired to do even more."

The build in Ensenada highlights philanthropy as a fundamental principle of B&M Electric and showcases the company's unwavering dedication to utilizing its time, skills, and resources to create a meaningful impact-both locally and internationally. B&M Electric intends to continue its collaboration with Prosperity Homes and Giving Business Soul on future construction projects.

"We are grateful to Prosperity Homes for organizing such a seamless, transformative project and to Giving Business Soul for their ongoing support in understanding the importance of giving back," Vargas expressed. "We eagerly anticipate participating in many more initiatives like this one."
