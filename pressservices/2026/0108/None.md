Signal Genesys Adds Four Major News Channels to Boost Media Visibility, Reach, and LLM Influence

 New York City, United States - January 8, 2026 / Search Atlas /

 The AI-powered PR platform now enables brands to distribute press releases across four high-traffic media outlets, enhancing visibility and citations in LLMs.

Signal Genesys, the AI-driven Digital PR platform, has significantly expanded its press release distribution network with the addition of USA Today, MarketWatch, AP News, and more high-authority U.S. news networks. This expansion gives users unprecedented access to top-tier media, enabling faster indexing, greater SEO influence, and amplified visibility for client campaigns.

USA Today provides massive domain authority and 50 million monthly organic sessions, delivering indexed, do-follow links that drive traffic, Google News alerts, and brand recognition. MarketWatch offers high authority and significant reach for financial, technology, and business announcements, helping users reinforce credibility, compete in their industries, and influence large language model (LLM) outputs.

AP News strengthens brand prestige by showcasing client achievements on a trusted platform, enhancing marketing materials and media credibility even when SEO impact is limited. The high-authority U.S. news network distributes content across 17–22 regional and local outlets, including sites like NaplesNews.com, providing authoritative backlinks, localized exposure, and measurable influence on LLM citations.

The Major U.S. News Channels Currently Live on Signal Genesys

With these channels, Signal Genesys users gain multiple advantages: approximately 88% (expected to increase) of distributions receive LLM citations, high-traffic channels move the SEO needle, and anchor text from press releases boosts local NAP profiles.

* USA Today offers DR92 authority, 679 million backlinks, and 50 million monthly organic sessions. Indexed, do-follow links trigger Google News alerts, drive traffic, and influence LLM citations, making it ideal for national campaigns.
* MarketWatch delivers high authority in finance, technology, and business sectors. Indexed, do-follow distributions allow rapid LLM influence and reinforce credibility in competitive markets.
* AP News provides strong brand prestige through non-indexed, primarily no-follow links. While limited for SEO, it elevates client-facing recognition and marketing collateral.
* The High-Authority U.S. News Network reaches 17–22 local and national outlets, including NaplesNews.com. Indexed, do-follow links support authoritative backlinks, LLM citations, and regional visibility for localized campaigns.

“Adding these four major U.S. news channels to Signal Genesys is a pivotal expansion for our users,” said Manick Bhan, CEO and Founder of Search Atlas. “With USA Today, MarketWatch, AP News, and a high-authority U.S. news network now part of the platform, clients can amplify brand visibility, influence AI-driven search results, and secure authoritative backlinks from a single, AI-powered PR workflow.
