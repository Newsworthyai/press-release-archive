# Lakeville Chiropractor One of Four in MN With ACBSP Concussion Certification

Minnesota Chiropractor Achieves Rare ACBSP Concussion Credential to Advance Brain Injury Care

 Lakeville, United States - February 3, 2026 / ALIGN Integrated Health /

 Lakeville, MN - Dr. Cody Rodewald, Lead Chiropractic Physician at ALIGN Integrated Health, has earned advanced concussion certification through the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians (ACBSP™), placing him among only four chiropractors in the state of Minnesota with this specialized credential.

Concussion care is a rapidly evolving and highly complex area of healthcare, requiring providers to stay current with evidence-based assessment, management, and recovery protocols. The ACBSP™ concussion certification is a competency-based program grounded in current scientific literature and clinical best practices. It reflects the ACBSP™’s position that effective concussion management depends on mastery of concussion-specific knowledge, skills, and clinical decision-making — not simply holding a terminal healthcare degree.

Doctors of chiropractic who maintain current ACBSP™ credentials are trained to evaluate, diagnose, and manage concussions across patient populations, including athletes and non-athletes alike. In several states, including Alaska, Arizona, and Ohio, legislation already recognizes ACBSP™-certified chiropractors as qualified providers for concussion diagnosis, management, and return-to-play decisions.

Dr. Rodewald’s certification underscores his commitment to bringing high-level, non-pharmaceutical, and patient-centered concussion care to the Lakeville and greater Twin Cities communities.

“Concussions affect far more than just athletes,” said Dr. Rodewald. “They impact students, parents, professionals, and everyday people. I’m passionate about helping our community understand concussions and recover properly using evidence-based, natural approaches that support the brain and nervous system.”

Through ALIGN Integrated Health, Dr. Rodewald continues to focus on helping patients recover from concussions safely and effectively, with individualized care plans rooted in current sports medicine and neurological research.
