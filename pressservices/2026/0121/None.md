# Who's Liable in Semi-Truck T-Bone Collisions? Big Truck Lawyer Explains

Understanding Who’s at Fault in Semi-Truck T-Bone Accidents in Georgia

 Marietta, United States - January 20, 2026 / The Graham Firm /

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

When a semi-truck crashes into the side of another vehicle at an intersection, the damage is often severe. These side-impact or t-bone crashes happen fast and hit hard, leaving people with serious injuries and complicated questions about who’s responsible. In a recent article titled T-Bone Accidents and Semi-Trucks: Who’s Really Liable?, The Big Truck Lawyers at The Graham Firm take a close look at how these crashes happen and who can be held legally accountable.

Drawing on years of experience handling truck crash cases across Georgia, The Graham Firm lays out what really happens after a wreck like this. Data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that big trucks were involved in more than 5,700 fatal crashes in 2021, and a large share of those involved side impacts. In Georgia, the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety reported more than 1,600 roadway deaths in 2023, with many caused by intersection collisions.

“Every case has people behind it who are hurting and trying to rebuild their lives,” said Atlanta, GA truck accident lawyer Charles Graham, founder of The Graham Firm and often called Big Truck Chuck. “What makes these crashes even harder is facing big trucking companies that have entire teams working against accident victims from day one.”

T-bone wrecks are especially dangerous because cars are weakest at the sides. The door and a few beams are all that stand between a driver and a truck weighing up to 80,000 pounds. The injuries people suffer are often severe, like head trauma, spine injuries, or internal bleeding. Some crashes are even deadly.

The firm’s article explains that liability in these cases isn’t always simple. While the truck driver might be at fault for running a red light or not yielding, other parties often share responsibility. The trucking company can be held accountable under Georgia law if the driver caused the crash while on the job. Maintenance contractors, loading crews, or even manufacturers can also play a role if equipment problems or bad repairs contributed to the crash.

Proving fault takes strong evidence, which can include the truck’s black box data, driver logs, and maintenance records. “We’ve seen trucking companies erase or lose key evidence if no one steps in quickly,” Graham said. “A lawyer’s letter can stop that from happening, but timing matters.”

Common causes of these wrecks include driver fatigue, speeding, distractions, poor maintenance, or missed blind spots. Federal rules limit how long truckers can drive, but those limits get broken more often than most people realize. A tired driver can misjudge timing or distance, especially at intersections.

The article also talks about mistakes people make after a crash, like taking the first settlement offer, not collecting photos or witness information, or talking to insurance adjusters without legal advice. According to Graham, early settlement offers almost always undervalue a claim and can leave victims struggling later when medical bills keep piling up.

Georgia’s comparative negligence law adds another layer of complexity. Victims who are less than 50% at fault can recover compensation, but the amount is reduced by their percentage of fault. A person found equally or more at fault can’t recover anything, which is why documentation and expert review are so critical.

For The Graham Firm, these articles aren’t just about cases. They aim to help residents understand what steps to take after serious crashes involving large trucks. Awareness, quick action, and knowledge of the law can make a big difference in how a case turns out.
