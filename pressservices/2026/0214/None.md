# Oldest AC Giveaway: A Tribute to Local Heroes

Accu-Temp Launches Giveaway for First Responders and Educators

 Flagler Beach, United States - February 13, 2026 / https://www.accutemp.pro/ /

 Accu-Temp Heating & Air Conditioning is excited to unveil its Oldest AC Giveaway, a community-focused initiative aimed at honoring and giving back to the everyday heroes serving the region. This unique campaign will award one deserving first responder or K-12 educator with a complete air conditioning system replacement valued at up to $9,000, along with additional prizes for runner-up finalists.

Based in Flagler Beach and serving neighboring communities, Accu-Temp recognizes the importance of dependable air conditioning in Florida's warm climate. Outdated systems often struggle to meet demands, resulting in increased energy costs, expensive repairs, and unexpected failures. The Oldest AC Giveaway aims to enhance comfort, boost energy efficiency, and provide peace of mind to a local hero whose current AC system is in need of replacement.

The giveaway is available to qualified first responders and K-12 teachers residing within Accu-Temp's service area. Interested participants can enter by filling out an online submission form. From the submitted entries, five finalists will be chosen and notified ahead of time.

The grand prize winner, along with the runner-up recipients, will be revealed live during First Friday Flagler Beach on October 1, 2026, in collaboration with Surf 97.3 FM WQFB. The public announcement will occur during this popular community gathering, bringing together residents to celebrate and acknowledge those who serve.

"We established the Oldest AC Giveaway to express our gratitude for the individuals who commit themselves to protecting, educating, and uplifting our community," commented a representative from Accu-Temp Heating & Air Conditioning. "This initiative is our way of giving back in a meaningful manner that directly enhances someone's home and overall quality of life."

Alongside the grand prize HVAC system replacement, four runner-up prizes will also be distributed, broadening the opportunity for community recognition and reward.

Entries will be accepted until September 20, 2026. Complete rules, eligibility criteria, and entry information can be found on the company's website.
