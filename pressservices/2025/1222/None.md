# Local Doctor Helps Diabetic Patient Avoid Foot Amputation Through Care

Lakeville Professional Assists Diabetic Patient Avoid Foot Amputation And Improves Neuropathy Symptoms

 Lakeville, United States - December 19, 2025 / ALIGN Integrated Health /

 Lakeville, MN - A Rosemount resident is walking today thanks to early intervention and coordinated care that helped him avoid a full foot amputation.

Bob, a Rosemount, Minnesota resident living with diabetes, first learned about ALIGN after reading about the clinic in a local newspaper. At the time, Bob was facing serious complications involving his foot, a common and dangerous issue for individuals with diabetes that can often lead to partial or full amputation if not addressed properly.

After seeking care at ALIGN, Bob was placed under a comprehensive treatment protocol overseen by Dr. Cody Rodewald DC, Clinical Director of ALIGN. Through consistent care, close monitoring, and Bob’s commitment to following the recommended plan, his condition stabilized and improved—ultimately preventing the need for full foot amputation.

“Bob had a number of health challenges,” said Dr. Rodewald. “But he was compliant with care, and because of that, it literally saved his foot from requiring full amputation.”

Diabetic foot complications are a leading cause of lower-extremity amputations in the United States. According to national data, many of these outcomes are preventable with early intervention, proper circulation support, inflammation management, and coordinated clinical oversight.

Dr. Rodewald emphasized that Bob’s outcome was the result of both appropriate care and patient engagement. “This is a reminder of how critical it is for patients not to ignore warning signs and to take action early. When patients partner with their care team and follow through, the results can be life-changing.”

ALIGN focuses on integrated, patient-centered care designed to address complex health challenges while helping patients maintain mobility, independence, and quality of life.

Bob’s story stands as a powerful example of what is possible when proactive care meets patient commitment.
