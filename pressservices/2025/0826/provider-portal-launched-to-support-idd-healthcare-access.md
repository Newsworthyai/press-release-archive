# Provider Portal Launched to Support IDD Healthcare Access

Special Olympics Launches First-of-Its-Kind Equitable Healthcare Initiative with help from Catalyst Marketing Agency

 Seattle, United States - August 25, 2025 / Catalyst Marketing Agency /

 Catalyst Marketing Agency is excited to unveil the Alliance for Inclusive Health Provider Portal (allianceforinclusivehealth.org/find-provider), a groundbreaking initiative developed in collaboration with Special Olympics Washington and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health. This portal aims to provide access to vetted healthcare providers for tens of thousands of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who have historically faced challenges in locating qualified and equitable healthcare options.

The Alliance for Inclusive Health (AIH) initiative commenced in 2023 with a training program designed to certify medical professionals throughout Washington state based on their understanding of individuals with IDD. The newly launched portal builds upon this foundation, utilizing a growing database of certified providers to assist patients and their families in quickly finding and connecting with a care team tailored to their specific requirements.

As a longstanding partner of Special Olympics Washington, Catalyst has been instrumental in shaping the project’s identity, website, and raising awareness among athletes and healthcare professionals across the state. The development of the portal marks a significant milestone; it not only provides individuals with IDD a reliable resource for locating qualified providers but also fosters a sense of agency that is essential to the inclusion and personal dignity championed by Special Olympics.

"Catalyst has been an essential ally in the effort to ensure that individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities can access safe and equitable healthcare," remarked Rebecca Hummer, project leader for the initiative. "Beyond the strategic, creative, and technical skills required to launch the initiative, the agency has been vital in disseminating information to both athletes and healthcare professionals statewide."

Rion Haber, CEO of Catalyst Marketing Agency, stated, “As a long-time collaborator with Special Olympics Washington, we are strong advocates for the organization's message of inclusion. We are incredibly thankful for the opportunity to contribute to a project that will significantly impact Washingtonians with IDD and help make our state a more inclusive and equitable environment.”

The Alliance for Inclusive Health “Find a Provider” feature is now accessible on the initiative's website (allianceforinclusivehealth.org/find-provider). This resource is open to everyone, not just Special Olympics athletes, and does not require registration for use. Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, along with their support networks, are encouraged to utilize the portal and provide feedback to Rebecca Hummer, the project’s lead, at rhummer@sowa.org.

As an integrated marketing agency, Catalyst does not exclusively focus on nonprofits or healthcare but is recognized for engaging in mission-driven projects that can benefit from the capabilities of an enterprise-level, for-profit marketing team. Team leaders prioritize inclusion and community building as two of their core values, and past initiatives have included award-winning work on various media, municipal, and social justice projects nationwide.
