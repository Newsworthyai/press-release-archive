It stands as the sole certifying board for endodontics, recognized by the American Dental Association. This distinction underscores the importance of the board's role in setting and maintaining rigorous standards that ensure endodontists possess the essential expertise required to provide exceptional care.

To attain diplomate status, candidates must undergo a comprehensive multi-part examination. This evaluation tests their knowledge, understanding, and clinical skills in the specialty of endodontics.
