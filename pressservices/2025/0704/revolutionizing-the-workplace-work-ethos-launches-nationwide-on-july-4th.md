# Revolutionizing the Workplace: Work Ethos Launches Nationwide on July 4th

Reclaim Time and Team Harmony: Work Ethos Launches Across the U.S this Independence Day

 Fredericksburg, United States - July 4, 2025 / Coach Todd Harris /

 As the nation celebrates Independence Day, a new kind of freedom is being declared in the world of business. Work Ethos, the transformative people system designed to empower entrepreneurs and revolutionize team dynamics, is officially launching nationwide after two years of powerful beta testing in major U.S. cities.

Spearheaded by Founder CJ Musick, Work Ethos has been quietly transforming companies in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Charlotte, Phoenix, and Newark. With resounding success across these regions, the system is now ready to serve business owners across the nation who are ready to reclaim their time, reduce internal chaos, and scale with confidence.

“Work Ethos was created to help entrepreneurs gain their independence—from firefighting, burnout, and the overwhelming weight of leading a disjointed team,” says Musick. “It’s not just about business systems. It’s about creating cultures that work.”

Work Ethos offers a proprietary People System that reshapes how businesses approach hiring, leadership development, communication, and team alignment. By helping organizations understand how their people think, feel, and solve problems, the system increases productivity, reduces friction, and transforms work culture from the inside out.

The Impact?

* Managers spend less time putting out fires
* Owners get back time to lead instead of micromanage
* Employees feel seen, supported, and empowered
* Teams thrive in environments that send them home better than they arrived

Launching on July 4th is no accident. Just as America celebrates freedom, Work Ethos invites business owners to declare their independence—from chaos, confusion, and company cultures that don’t work.
