 Colorado Springs, CO – May 13, 2025: Springs Law Group takes great pride in announcing its role as a Presenter Level Sponsor for the 2025 Pride Heart Cup, an exhilarating 6v6 soccer tournament organized by Colorado Pride WPSL. The event is scheduled for Saturday, May 24th, at UCCS Mountain Lion Stadium and will gather youth and adult teams from across the region to raise funds for the Children’s Hospital Colorado Heart Institute.

The Pride Heart Cup transcends a mere tournament; it stands as a tribute to resilience, teamwork, and community unity. Full proceeds from this event will directly aid the Heart Institute, which is dedicated to providing care, conducting research, and facilitating recovery for children and families across Colorado. The day’s activities will culminate in an engaging WPSL exhibition match, featuring Colorado Pride against FC Denver Women at 7:00 PM.

Christopher Nicolaysen, the founding partner of Springs Law Group, shared his thoughts:

“At Springs Law Group, we are committed to aligning with organizations that enhance our community. The Pride Heart Cup represents the unifying power of sports for a meaningful cause. We are delighted to support an event that not only promotes athletic achievement but also advocates for the health and welfare of children in our area.”

Members of the community are invited to partake in the festivities, witness thrilling soccer matches throughout the day, and cheer for the teams during the evening exhibition game. Donations to benefit the Children's Hospital Colorado Heart Institute will be graciously accepted on-site during the event. For those who cannot attend but wish to contribute, donations can also be made directly on the event’s official webpage at pridesoccer.com/the-pride-heart-cup.

Springs Law Group has consistently demonstrated a commitment to giving back to the Colorado Springs community. Through initiatives such as the Deserving Teacher Award, Bikes for Kids, and support for first responders and healthcare professionals, the firm aims to create a positive influence that extends beyond the courtroom.
