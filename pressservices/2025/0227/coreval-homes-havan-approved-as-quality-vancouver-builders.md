Navigating the Housing Market: Vancouver Home Builders PerspectiveVancouver's housing market is unique, to say the least. Understanding the local regulations, zoning laws, and market trends is crucial for any successful building or renovation project. Here's our take on some key aspects:

* The Push for Density: Vancouver faces increasing pressure to increase density. According to the City of Vancouver, over 70% of new housing units approved in 2023 were multi-family dwellings like condos and townhouses. CoreVal Homes is experienced in navigating the complexities of these projects.
* The Rise of Laneway Homes: Laneway homes have become increasingly popular. Since the City of Vancouver legalized laneway homes in 2009, over 4,000 have been built. CoreVal Homes can assist clients in navigating the process of building a laneway home.
* The Importance of Green Building: Vancouver is a leader in green building practices. The City of Vancouver aims to reduce carbon emissions by 50% below 2007 levels by 2030. CoreVal Homes helps clients take climate action by incorporating energy-efficient features into our projects.
* The Renovation Projects: With high housing prices, many homeowners are opting to renovate. Spending on home renovations in Metro Vancouver reached $8.9 billion in 2022. CoreVal Homes has a proven track record of transforming outdated spaces into modern, functional living areas.
* Rising Construction Costs: Construction costs continue to rise in Vancouver. The cost of construction materials in Canada increased by 11.8% in 2022. CoreVal Homes helps clients manage costs by delivering projects on time and on budget.
