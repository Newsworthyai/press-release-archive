# Abolishing the IRS: Risks for Taxpayers with Liens

Navigating Changes: The Future of Taxes and IRS

 Washington DC, United States - February 27, 2025 / J. David Tax Law /

 Navigating Changes: The Future of Taxes and IRSRecent remarks made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have ignited considerable discussion in Washington, D.C. as President Trump has proposed a revolutionary initiative to dismantle the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and establish an External Revenue Service that would be financed through tariffs on goods imported from abroad. This groundbreaking proposal aims to abolish federal income taxes, effectively redirecting the nation’s revenue generation from conventional tax collection methods to reliance on international tariffs.

As the epicenter of federal governance, Washington, D.C. is deeply embroiled in this landmark tax discussion. While the initiative seeks to relieve individuals from the burden of federal income tax, it raises considerable concerns for those who are already dealing with tax debts and liens. The existing IRS enforcement protocols and the legal structures that govern tax liens—claims against assets to ensure payment of unpaid tax liabilities—are now under critical examination in light of the potential elimination of the IRS.
