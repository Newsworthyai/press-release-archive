 Colorado Springs, United States - August 4, 2025 / Thrive Health Systems /

 COLORADO SPRINGS, CO – August 4, 2025 – Meet Dustin Lewey, a Colorado Springs construction worker and outdoor enthusiast whose life seemed to be on a downward spiral due to a series of construction-related back injuries. Faced with multiple herniated discs, Dustin’s mobility was drastically reduced, leading to feelings of hopelessness after trying seven chiropractors, 15 different specialists, and eight pain medications with, all of which had failed to solve his issues. However, all that changed when he discovered Thrive Health Systems and came under the expert care of Dr. Molly Kallenbach, DC. Dustin's journey began with a passion for adventure, often pursuing activities such as rock climbing and river rafting. Unfortunately, this all came to a halt when he found himself nearly confined to his basement, struggling not just with physical activity but also with climbing stairs. Despite his chronic pain, he persisted in his construction job, which ultimately led to even more severe damage to his back. After a series of frustrating and failed treatment attempts, Dustin’s breakthrough arrived with a unique program at Thrive Health Systems. Under Dr. Kallenbach's guidance, he participated in Functional Movement Training (FMT), Spinal Decompression, along with a very specific type of Chiropractic Adjustment. Additionally, the Thrive team provided him with at-home exercises that played a crucial role in his recovery. Most importantly, all of this was achieved through non-surgical and drug-free methods. Today, Dustin has reduced his medications from eight to just two and has fully regained his mobility. He is not only back on the water kayaking but is also doing handstands and enjoying activities with his sons. "This place has given me my life back," says Dustin, reflecting on his dramatic transformation and newfound freedom.
