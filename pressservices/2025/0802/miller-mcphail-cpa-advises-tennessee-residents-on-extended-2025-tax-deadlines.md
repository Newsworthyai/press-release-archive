 In response to the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that began on April 2, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has extended various federal tax filing and payment deadlines for all Tennessee residents and businesses. Affected taxpayers now have until November 3, 2025, to file returns and make payments originally due between April 2 and November 3, 2025 .

This extension applies to:

* Individual income tax returns and payments normally due on April 15, 2025.
* 2024 contributions to IRAs and health savings accounts (HSAs).
* Quarterly estimated tax payments due on April 15, June 16, and September 15, 2025.
* Quarterly payroll and excise tax returns due on April 30, July 31, and October 31, 2025.
* Calendar-year corporation and fiduciary returns and payments due on April 15, 2025.
