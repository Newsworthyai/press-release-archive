# Catalyst Marketing Agency Kicks Off Five Year Strategy with New Head of Growth

Catalyst Marketing Agency Taps Michael Nelson as New Head of Growth

 Seattle, United States - November 7, 2025 / Catalyst Marketing Agency /

 Catalyst Marketing Agency, the national leader in outsourced marketing services for scale-stage organizations, today announced the appointment of Michael Nelson as its next Head of Growth. Nelson brings over a decade of revenue operations leadership in the communications, technology, startup, and nonprofit spaces and was brought on to support the organization's ten-year strategy.

In this role, Nelson will work across all six of Catalyst's U.S. offices to identify growth opportunities including client acquisition and strategic partnerships, as well as playing a key role in shaping the agency's embedded offering. His experience with and deep understanding of growth-stage organizations is expected to not only solidify the agency's reputation as a leader in the marketing services space but drive stronger outcomes for its clients.

"Michael's track record of building scalable revenue strategies makes him the ideal leader for our next stage of growth," said Catalyst's President, Rion Haber. "He has a passion for supporting fast-growing teams that directly aligns with our mission—becoming the most recognized agency partner for organizations that are working to bridge the gap between their own capabilities and today's increasingly complex marketing ecosystem."

Nelson’s career has focused on shaping partnerships that amplify growth. After receiving his B.A. from Whitman College, he worked with brands like Microsoft, Goodwill, Mondavi Wines, and others as Senior Director of Sales and Marketing for an enterprise loyalty and customer retention platform. He went on to earn an MBA from the University of Washington's Foster School of Business and, most recently, led sales and account management at Engage Raise, a donor platform for public affairs professionals.

"Catalyst's ability to deliver end-to-end marketing support for teams who need the capabilities of a full-stack marketing department without the overhead, resonated deeply with me," said Nelson. "It reflects one of the most common pain points for growing teams—the ability to deliver seamless omnichannel messaging that audiences now expect, without the commitment of building a huge in-house team. That will become even more relevant as AI fundamentally shifts how business gets done.”
