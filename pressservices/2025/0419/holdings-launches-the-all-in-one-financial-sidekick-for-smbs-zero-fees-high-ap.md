 Holdings Financial Technologies Inc. is shaking up business banking for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) with a platform that finally puts owners first. Tired of low interest rates, hidden fees, and juggling disconnected financial tools? Holdings is here to make your money work harder—so you don’t have to.

Banking That Pays You Back

Holdings offers truly fee-free business banking—no monthly fees, no transaction fees, no minimums. Business owners can earn up to 3.0% APY on their balances, a rate that leaves traditional banks in the dust. That means more money stays in your account, growing while you focus on your business.

All-In-One Financial Hub

Why waste time switching between banking, accounting, and bookkeeping software? Holdings brings it all together in one easy-to-use platform. Integrated accounting and optional full-service bookkeeping mean less time on spreadsheets and more time growing your business. Automated reporting and reconciliation keep your finances organized, so you always know where you stand.

Maximum Security, Zero Stress

With up to $3 million in FDIC insurance, your funds are protected well beyond what most banks offer. Robust controls let you decide who can access your account and how money moves—giving you peace of mind and total control.

Built for Real Business Owners

Holdings was built for busy entrepreneurs who want to spend less time on banking and more time building their dreams. No more nickel-and-diming. No more outdated systems. Just a financial sidekick that rewards your hard work with perks, not penalties.
