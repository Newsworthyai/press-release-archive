 Cleveland, OH — Piscitelli Law Firm, a prominent personal injury and wrongful death law firm in Ohio, has successfully secured a $1.1 million settlement for the family of a 7-year-old boy who tragically lost his life in an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident.

This case involved an adult who was operating the ATV while under the influence, with the child positioned between his legs, leading to a collision with a chain stretched across a driveway.

Unfortunately, the incident resulted in the untimely death of the young boy.

The family pursued justice for what they believe to be a preventable tragedy, attributing it to the negligence of the ATV owner for permitting the intoxicated individual to operate the vehicle, as well as the negligence of the impaired driver.

Following a comprehensive investigation, Frank Piscitelli, the lead attorney representing the family, was able to negotiate a settlement that will provide the family with financial stability and resources to honor the memory of their child.

“Experiencing the loss of a child, brother, and grandson is a nightmare that no one should have to endure,” stated Frank Piscitelli, founding attorney of Piscitelli Law Firm.

“While no sum of money can ever replace the life that was lost, this settlement ensures that those responsible are held accountable and brings a measure of justice for our clients.”
