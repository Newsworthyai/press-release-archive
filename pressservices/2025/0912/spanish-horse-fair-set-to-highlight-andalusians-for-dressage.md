# Spanish Horse Fair Set to Highlight Andalusians for Dressage

Excitement Builds for Spanish Horse Fair Competition

 Corona, United States - September 12, 2025 / White Stallion Hay & Ranch /

 Anticipation is mounting as Bryan Gonzalez, the CEO of White Stallion Hay & Ranch, gears up to showcase his distinguished ranch at the forthcoming Spanish Horse Fair in the City of Industry, California. Set to take place on September 12, 2025, this prestigious event will host the largest morphology competition for Spanish horses in the United States. Bryan will present one of the premier PRE Andalusian horses, Dante de Castellon, and will compete against leading contenders from across the nation.

The Spanish Horse Fair is celebrated for its homage to the Andalusian breed, and this year’s competition is expected to deliver exceptional excitement. Judges hailing from Spain, who possess expertise in assessing the distinctive attributes of Andalusians, will evaluate the horses based on their movements, conformation, and overall harmony. This thorough evaluation process aims to showcase the finest qualities of these magnificent creatures, making it a vital occasion for breeders, trainers, and enthusiasts alike.

For the past five months, Bryan Gonzalez has been diligently preparing for this competition, fully committing to the rigorous training necessary to compete at such an elite level. The preparation for both Bryan and the horse mirrors that of top-tier athletes. Each training day is meticulously structured, concentrating on various facets of the horse's physical capabilities. The training program incorporates a rotation of body exercises, ensuring that every part of the horse is conditioned and primed for the competition’s demands.

The training regimen is both intense and all-encompassing. One day may prioritize strengthening the neck, while another might focus on exercises aimed at the hindquarters. The hip, torso, and back are also critical components of the training, as they play a significant role in the horse's overall performance. This systematic approach fosters the development of a long trot with a steady rhythm and enhances the cadence in the gallop, both of which are essential for success in morphology competitions.

Andalusians are celebrated for their elegance, strength, and versatility, making them ideal candidates for a variety of equestrian disciplines, including morphology competitions and dressage. The breed’s innate athleticism and eagerness to collaborate with their riders render them a favorite among trainers and competitors. Bryan’s dedication to showcasing the finest PRE Andalusian horses underscores his commitment to the breed and his passion for equestrian sports.
