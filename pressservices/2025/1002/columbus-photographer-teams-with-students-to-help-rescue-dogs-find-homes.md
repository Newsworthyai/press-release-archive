The initiative gives high school seniors the opportunity to volunteer their time to help create stunning, professional portraits of adoptable dogs, significantly increasing their chances of finding a forever home.Through this unique program, students are involved in every aspect of the photoshoot, from "wrangling" the dogs and getting them camera-ready to assisting with lighting and behind-the-scenes shots. This hands-on experience provides students with valuable skills in photography, animal handling, and community service, all while contributing to a cause that is close to Claudine's heart. "My rescue dogs are my world," says Kosier, who has been a portrait photographer since 2010. "I'm happiest outdoorsâ€”whether hiking metro parks, chasing sunsets on country roads, or photographing rescue dogs in need of homes."Claudine's approach to her work is rooted in her belief that "everyone deserves to feel beautiful, confident, and truly seen." She applies this same philosophy to her work with rescue animals, capturing their unique personalities in a way that goes beyond a simple snapshot. The result is a collection of heartwarming and professional images that showcase each dog's individuality, helping potential adopters connect with them on a deeper level.This initiative represents a natural extension of Claudine's commitment to her community. Since relocating to Dublin from Las Vegas in 2012, she has built a thriving business based on personal service, attention to detail, and a genuine desire to make a positive impact. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, including Senior Muse, Voyage Ohio Magazine, and Senior Style Guide. By involving high school seniors in her rescue dog photography, Claudine is not only helping animals in need but also inspiring the next generation of community leaders and animal advocates.![](https://press-releases-production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/KXzhTV6DKSqLM1ZgqfoRczGUjpyXYxEJ0C733Mym.jpg)

The program addresses a critical need in animal rescue efforts. Professional photography has been proven to significantly increase adoption rates for shelter animals, as high-quality images help potential adopters connect emotionally with pets before meeting them in person. By combining her professional expertise with student volunteers, Claudine creates a sustainable model that benefits multiple stakeholders while addressing a genuine community need.For animal rescue organizations interested in partnering with this program, or for high school students seeking meaningful volunteer opportunities, more information is available through [https://www.claudinekosier.com/](https://www.claudinekosier.com/).About Claudine Kosier Photography:Claudine Kosier Photography is a nationally recognized, [full-service boutique portrait studio based in Dublin, Ohio](https://share.google/aDrkpbmaX27IHPoXj).
