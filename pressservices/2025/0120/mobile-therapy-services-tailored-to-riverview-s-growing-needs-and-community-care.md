Specialized Mobile Therapy Services Expand to Meet Growing Needs in Riverview, Florida

RIVERVIEW, FL - Responding to the growing healthcare needs of Hillsborough County's rapidly expanding population, veteran therapist James Ferrara announces the extension of Functional Transportation Mobile Rehab’s therapy services to Riverview, Florida. This expansion brings essential lymphedema treatment, Parkinson's care, and comprehensive occupational and physical therapy services directly to patients' homes throughout the Riverview community.

The practice combines the expertise of two highly qualified therapists. James Ferrara, a distinguished Occupational Therapist with over two decades of experience, brings an exceptional combination of specialized certifications including Certified Lymphedema Therapy and Wound Care Certification (WCC). Kanna Shepherd, a LANA Certified Lymphedema Therapist, contributes eight years of diverse therapeutic experience with particular expertise in breast cancer-related lymphedema treatment.

"Our goal is to make specialized therapy services more accessible to Riverview residents by bringing professional care directly to their homes," says Ferrara. "This personalized approach ensures that patients receive the highest quality care in the environment where they're most comfortable."

The mobile service expansion includes:

* Specialized lymphedema therapy and management
* LSVT BIG® therapy for Parkinson's disease
* Advanced wound care services
* Comprehensive occupational therapy
* Physical therapy and rehabilitation
* Parkinson's Wellness Recovery (PWR) programs
* Oncology rehabilitation
* Ergonomic assessments and job screening
* Stroke rehabilitation
* Chronic pain management

This comprehensive team brings together extensive credentials and specialized training. Ferrara's certifications from the Academy of Lymphatic Studies and the International Lymphedema & Wound Training Institute complement Shepherd's prestigious CLT-LANA certification, representing the highest level of competency in lymphedema care. Their combined educational background includes degrees from Spalding University, Illinois State University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Louisiana at Monroe, enabling them to offer an integrated, evidence-based approach to patient care.

This service expansion comes at a crucial time for Riverview's growing population of over 76,000 residents, providing essential healthcare services to meet the community's evolving needs. The mobile nature of these services particularly benefits elderly patients, those with limited mobility, and individuals seeking convenient, professional therapy services.
