 New York, NY - 29 December 2025

Search Atlas, a leading AI-powered SEO and digital optimization platform, today introduced OTTO Page-Specific Schema powered by Atlas Brain, a major platform update that replaces static, template-based structured data with a dynamic, page-level system designed for modern search engines and AI discovery. The release enables Atlas Brain to analyze each page individually using on-page content, connected entities, site architecture, and first-party data from Google Search Console and GA4, then pre-compute the precise structured data required to describe that page clearly to search engines and large language models.

OTTO generates, updates, and governs schema as content evolves, giving teams full visibility and control while eliminating schema decay, reducing technical debt, and making comprehensive structured data execution possible across enterprise, e-commerce, and multi-vertical websites at scale.

Key Features & Benefits

* Context-Aware Schema at the Page Level: Atlas Brain analyzes each page individually, turning content, entities, and site structure into precise, page-specific schema. No templates, no guesswork.
* Pre-Computed Machine Understanding: OTTO Page-Specific Schema converts page structure, products, services, media, and authors into structured data before crawlers or AI see it, ensuring faster, accurate interpretation.
* Schema That Evolves With Your Site: Changes in content, pricing, reviews, or media automatically trigger schema updates, keeping pages current and eliminating technical debt.
* Full Audit and Control: Teams review every generated schema object, modify fields, restructure relationships, and approve deployment—combining AI speed with human oversight.
* Enterprise-Scale Automation: Over 1,000 schema types supported, including industry-specific structures. Deploy multiple schemas across tens or hundreds of thousands of pages with a single review-and-approve workflow.
* E-Commerce Precision: Product, category, offer, review, media, and support pages receive the exact schema combinations needed, preventing misalignment between content and structured data.
* Vertical-Specific Intelligence: Supports local business, healthcare, legal, hospitality, real estate, automotive, SaaS, education, media, and affiliate sites. Pages are understood by type—service, product, author, review, event, or media asset.
* AI-Optimized Structure: Explicitly defined entities and relationships reduce ambiguity for large language models, improving content trustworthiness and discovery in AI-powered search.
* Proven SEO Results: Analysis of 22,000 connected sites shows schema deployment doubles ranking keywords, making structured data a measurable performance driver.
* Real-Time Crawl Insights: Live crawl logs display discovered URLs, status codes, redirects, and indexing in real time, revealing technical debt, forgotten pages, and crawl inefficiencies instantly.
* Dynamic Execution Layer: OTTO Page-Specific Schema and Atlas Brain make structured data a continuously updated, scalable layer of the site, boosting machine readability and operational efficiency.
