# Liveops Launches Initiative for Remote Customer Support Agents

New Remote Roles Available for Tax Season

 Scottsdale, United States - December 21, 2025 / Liveops /

 SCOTTSDALE, AZ –  Liveops, a frontrunner in flexible customer experience outsourcing solutions, has unveiled a nationwide initiative aimed at recruiting thousands of remote customer support agents in preparation for the 2026 tax season. This initiative provides individuals across the United States with the opportunity to earn income from the comfort of their homes, on their own schedules, while assisting one of the leading tax software brands in the country.

“At Liveops, we hold the belief that meaningful work should be available to everyone, regardless of their location or the challenges they may face in life,” stated Molly Moore, Chief Operating Officer at Liveops. “By broadening our remote customer support roles, we are empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds—including single parents, military spouses, and caregivers—to have greater control over their work hours and earnings, enabling them to support their families while managing various life obligations.”

Broadening Access to Opportunities Through Inclusive Agent RecruitmentAs families nationwide grapple with increasing expenses and uncertain employment prospects, Liveops presents a pathway to earn income with both flexibility and purpose. Agents working independently can cultivate sustainable careers that align with their lifestyles.

Liveops is committed to recruiting agents from underrepresented and often overlooked demographics, such as bilingual candidates, women (who currently make up approximately 77 percent of the Liveops agent community), caregivers, veterans, retirees, and individuals with disabilities. Since Liveops does not mandate proximity to a physical call center, individuals can provide services from their own locations. This approach eliminates many geographic and socioeconomic barriers that typically hinder participation in remote service provision as independent agents.

“Our flexible sourcing strategy benefits both individuals and our clients,” remarked Jim Watson, Chief Executive Officer of Liveops. “We can engage a diverse and motivated talent pool from across the nation. This includes individuals who may not have had access to these opportunities otherwise. Simultaneously, we offer our clients a scalable, resilient workforce that is prepared to meet real-world demands.”

Enabling Agents to Choose Their Own SchedulesCustomer support professionals within the Liveops network have the autonomy to select the time slots during which they wish to provide services. This flexibility allows individuals to coordinate their work hours around caregiving responsibilities, family commitments, educational pursuits, or even a secondary income source.

For clients, this same model enables Liveops to align service coverage with actual demand during the tax season, all without incurring additional facility costs or long-term overhead.

Economic and Community BenefitsBy retaining income within local communities rather than centralizing work in a single location, the Liveops model bolsters local economies. Thousands of individuals will have the opportunity to earn supplemental income and gain valuable experience in customer support for a nationally recognized brand during one of the busiest customer service periods of the year.

Established Expertise in Tax Season SupportLiveops has been facilitating tax season engagements for decades. The company’s on-demand model enables it to quickly source, certify, and deploy well-suited customer support agents, ensuring that callers receive prompt, empathetic, and brand-consistent service during peak times. This methodology assists tax software clients in minimizing hold times, enhancing customer satisfaction, and safeguarding brand loyalty during the highest volume weeks of the year.
