 Houston, United States - November 2, 2025 / Law Office of Bryan Fagan PLLC /

 HOUSTON, TX – The Law Office of Bryan Fagan, PLLC is proud to announce the expansion of its probate and estate administration services throughout Texas. This initiative is designed to provide families with essential legal support as they navigate the complexities that follow the loss of a loved one. With a commitment to compassionate guidance and expert representation, the firm aims to ease the burdens that accompany these challenging times.

Probate and estate administration are critical processes under Texas law, governing the management and distribution of a deceased person’s assets. When a loved one passes away, their estate must go through probate — the legal process of validating a will and ensuring assets are distributed according to the decedent’s wishes or, if no will exists, under Texas intestacy law. This process can be both emotionally and legally complex, particularly for grieving families.

The Law Office of Bryan Fagan, PLLC understands these challenges and is dedicated to offering clear, efficient, and compassionate legal support.

“We recognize that dealing with the loss of a loved one is one of the most difficult experiences a person can face,” said a firm representative. “Our goal is to provide compassionate, efficient, and results-driven legal services that help families through this challenging time. We want our clients to feel supported, informed, and confident at every step.”

The firm’s expanded probate services are tailored to meet the diverse needs of Texas families. One of its key offerings includes the preparation and filing of affidavits of heirship — vital legal documents used to establish rightful heirs when no will exists. These affidavits can help clarify asset distribution and streamline the probate process.

In addition to affidavits of heirship, the firm also provides comprehensive estate planning services, including wills, trusts, and powers of attorney. Proactive estate planning can prevent disputes, reduce tax burdens, and ensure a person’s wishes are honored after their passing. The firm emphasizes that early planning is one of the best ways to protect loved ones and preserve family harmony.

Another critical service offered is independent administration, a simplified process that allows estates to be managed with minimal court involvement. The Law Office of Bryan Fagan guides clients through this process with care, ensuring all legal requirements are met efficiently.

This expansion underscores the firm’s continued mission to support Texas families with compassionate and results-oriented legal services. By combining extensive legal knowledge with a client-centered approach, the Law Office of Bryan Fagan, PLLC helps families make informed decisions and secure their loved ones’ legacies.
