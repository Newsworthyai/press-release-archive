Campers can anticipate a range of activities, including a haunted trail that promises to send chills down their spines, a site decorating contest with exciting prizes, and numerous opportunities for creativity and enjoyment.

A key feature of the Halloween weekends will be the site decorating contest. Campers are encouraged to transform their campsites into spooky showcases, demonstrating their creativity and Halloween spirit. Prizes will be awarded for the most impressively decorated sites, adding a competitive flair to the festivities. This contest not only nurtures a sense of community among campers but also enhances the overall Halloween vibe throughout the campground.

Alongside the decorating contest, Walnut Hills Family Campground will provide pumpkin painting sessions, allowing families to express their artistic flair. Campers can select from a variety of pumpkins and paint them in any design they wish, creating unique decorations to take home or display at their campsites. This activity is perfect for families aiming to bond over a fun and creative project while celebrating the Halloween season.

Costume contests will also be a major draw during the Halloween weekends. Campers of all ages are invited to don their favorite costumes and participate in the contests, showcasing their creativity and enthusiasm. Prizes will be awarded in various categories, including scariest costume, funniest costume, and best group costume. This is a wonderful opportunity for families to embrace the Halloween spirit and enjoy some friendly rivalry.

Trick or treating will be a highlight of the weekends, with campers having the opportunity to go door-to-door throughout the campground. Families can relish the excitement of collecting treats while exploring the beautifully adorned campsites. This traditional Halloween activity is sure to bring joy to both children and adults, creating cherished memories for everyone involved.

To maintain the festive atmosphere, Walnut Hills will also host a Halloween costume dance party. Campers can flaunt their costumes while dancing the night away to spooky music. This lively event will create a fun and energetic environment for families to enjoy together, making it a perfect way to celebrate the Halloween season.

For those wishing to personalize their Halloween gear, the campground will offer Halloween shirt tie-dyeing sessions. Campers can craft their own unique Halloween-themed shirts, which they can wear during the festivities.
