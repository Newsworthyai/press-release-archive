Exterior Signs of Roof Storm Damage in AndoverHomeowners can identify several exterior indicators that suggest their roof has sustained damage from a storm. Common exterior warning signs include:

* Leaks and water stains appearing on ceilings and walls
* Musty odors suggesting possible mold growth
* Paint or wallpaper peeling near the ceiling lines
* Drywall or ceiling materials beginning to sag
* Increased humidity levels in the upper floors
