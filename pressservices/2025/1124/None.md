 Superior Ink Introduces 'Built for the Community' Initiative to Support Local Colorado Businesses with Complimentary Custom ApparelFountain, CO - 2025 - Superior Ink, the leading screen-printing and apparel production company in Colorado, has unveiled a new community initiative named "Built for the Community." This monthly program aims to provide one local small business with complimentary, custom-designed shirts to assist in brand growth and foster local pride.

Each month, Superior Ink will choose a small business in the Colorado Springs or Fountain region and present them with a limited batch of 12 custom-branded shirts, all designed, printed, and delivered by Superior Ink's talented creative team. The initiative seeks to cultivate connections, celebrate entrepreneurship, and showcase the essence of local business ownership throughout Southern Colorado.

The inaugural recipient of this program is Happy Hour Donuts, a donut shop located in Fountain that is celebrated for its innovative flavors and welcoming community atmosphere. Superior Ink has crafted a custom graphic tee inspired by the shop's branding and will personally deliver a dozen shirts this month.

"When we relocated to Fountain, our goal was not just to establish a facility - we aimed to integrate into the community," stated Dominic Rosacci, Founder and CEO of Superior Ink. "This initiative represents our commitment to giving back, utilizing our expertise to uplift other small businesses. Happy Hour Donuts is an ideal starting point - they capture the local spirit that makes this town unique."

In addition to providing shirts, Superior Ink intends to showcase each selected business across its social media platforms, website, and newsletters, highlighting their stories and assisting them in reaching new customers. Over time, this initiative will foster a network of local makers, shop owners, and entrepreneurs connected through community-driven merchandise.

"Merchandise is impactful - it tells a story that can be worn," remarked Rosacci. "When a local business is given a tangible means to share their narrative, it generates a ripple effect that benefits the entire community."

Superior Ink plans to sustain this program throughout the year, selecting a new small business each month. Local business owners who wish to be featured can nominate themselves or others by visiting www.superiorinkprinting.com/community or tagging @superiorinkprinting on Instagram.
