One of the standout services offered at Baby Scan Studio Ashford is the early dating pregnancy scan. This scan is particularly beneficial for expectant parents who want to confirm their pregnancy and establish an accurate due date. Conducted during the early stages of pregnancy, typically between six and ten weeks, the early dating pregnancy scan provides crucial information about the development of the fetus. It allows parents to see their baby for the first time, often bringing a wave of emotions and excitement.

The early dating pregnancy scan is not just about confirming the pregnancy; it also serves to assess the health of the fetus. During the scan, the sonographer will check for a heartbeat and measure the size of the embryo. This information is vital for determining the gestational age and ensuring that the pregnancy is progressing as expected. For many parents, this early glimpse into their baby's world can be a reassuring experience, alleviating any concerns they may have about the pregnancy.

In addition to the early dating pregnancy scan, Baby Scan Studio Ashford offers a variety of other pregnancy scan services. These include gender scans, which are typically performed around 16 weeks into the pregnancy. Many parents look forward to these scans as they provide an opportunity to find out whether they are having a boy or a girl. The excitement of discovering the baby's gender adds another layer of joy to the pregnancy journey. The qualified sonographers at Baby Scan Studio Ashford are skilled at providing clear images and accurate information, ensuring that parents leave the studio with a sense of satisfaction.
