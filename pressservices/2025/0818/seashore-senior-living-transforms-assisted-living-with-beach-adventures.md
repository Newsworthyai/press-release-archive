 NEW SMYRNA BEACH, FL – August 14, 2025 – Seashore Senior Living is redefining assisted living by prioritizing fun and community engagement through exciting beach outings and weekly field trips. The vibrant community, affectionately referred to as the Seashorians, is embracing a new lifestyle that includes adventure, social connection, and exploration of local attractions. Every month, Seashore Senior Living organizes unique excursions for its residents, with one of the highlights being beach trips on the infamous Seashore bus. The opportunity to enjoy the sun, sand, and surf has become a favorite pastime for many seniors, allowing them to relax and socialize in a beautiful outdoor environment. “Exploring the beauty of New Smyrna Beach and sharing our local history with the residents enhances their quality of life significantly,” said Paul Mitchell, Executive Director of Seashore Senior Living. “We believe in offering our residents more than just a place to live; we are creating memorable experiences that foster friendships and enrich their lives.” The beach trips include tours led by Mitchell himself, a native of New Smyrna Beach, who takes residents on a journey through the city’s rich history and notable landmarks. Beyond beach outings, the Seashore team also organizes weekly visits to local restaurants and shopping centers, ensuring that the seniors remain active members of the community. With these innovative activities, Seashore Senior Living is not only enhancing the daily lives of their residents but is also setting a new standard in senior living by merging caretaking with adventure and exploration. As Seashorians continue to enjoy these fantastic outings, the positive feedback from residents and their families underscores the importance of such engaging activities for overall wellbeing and happiness in assisted living settings. The innovation has paid off, as Seashore Senior Living has quickly filled up, becoming a very popular and in-demand assisted living community in New Smyrna Beach.
