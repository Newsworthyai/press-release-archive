Harpers Ferry Adventure Company Channels Customer Fees to Potomac Conservation Efforts

 Harpers Ferry, United States - August 18, 2025 / River and Trail Outfitters /

 River & Trail Outfitters, a seasoned outdoor adventure company serving over 50,000 visitors annually, donates approximately $9,000 in both 2023 and 2024 to support water quality monitoring and environmental advocacy through its partnership with Potomac Riverkeepers. The outdoor recreation company's commitment to environmental stewardship, which began with its founding, continues to drive meaningful contributions to local waterway protection through a unique customer-based donation model that has been in place for over a decade.

For over ten years, River & Trail has donated $0.25 per customer using the Potomac River. These funds directly support Potomac Riverkeepers' vital work in monitoring river health through volunteer programs and water quality testing at multiple sites along the Potomac River.

"At River & Trail Outfitters, we believe in doing more than just providing outdoor experiences. Our partnership with Potomac Riverkeepers represents our commitment to preserving the ecological health of our local rivers while supporting critical environmental monitoring and advocacy work," said Natasha Baihly, President.

The company's environmental mission has deep roots. Founder and former CEO Lee Baihly, an Eagle Scout from Minnesota, instilled values of river protection from the company's inception. This commitment is formally embedded in River & Trail's mission statement, which pledges to "protect the rivers & trails that sustain us by educating ourselves and others about environmental concerns as well as sponsoring river clean ups, supporting organizations concerned about local waterways and trails, and picking up trash."

Potomac Riverkeepers, founded by Jeff Kelby, a former fishing guide who worked with River & Trail's shuttle service, focuses on ensuring the Potomac River remains viable for generations to come. The organization's efforts encompass water quality monitoring, environmental advocacy, and litigation when necessary to maintain clean water standards.

River & Trail's support is particularly significant given the popularity of its river-based activities. The company's Harpers Ferry tubing experience on the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers has been recognized as one of the top 10 tubing areas in the nation by US News & World Report Reader's Choice. Additionally, the iconic Harpers Ferry whitewater rafting trip has been providing beginner-level adventures since 1976.

"It makes sense for us to support those causes that support our livelihood and the future of generations of river-goers to come," the company notes, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between outdoor recreation businesses and environmental conservation.

Through this ongoing partnership, River & Trail Outfitters demonstrates that successful outdoor recreation companies can play a crucial role in protecting the natural resources that make their businesses possible, setting an example for sustainable tourism practices in the outdoor industry.
