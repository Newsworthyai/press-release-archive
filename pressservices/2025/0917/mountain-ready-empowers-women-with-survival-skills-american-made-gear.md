 Mountain Ready Empowers Women with Practical Survival Skills — Online Library + American-Made Gear, Founded by a U.S. Veteran

Founder Peter Zeppieri champions hands-on preparedness for women — from roadside emergencies and self-defense to foraging, herbal first-aid, and off-grid energy solutions.

Seneca, S.C.  — Mountain Ready (MountainReady.online), a family- and veteran-owned small business founded by U.S. Army veteran Peter Zeppieri, is launching a renewed initiative to make survival skills approachable and achievable for women of all ages. The site blends a curated shop of American-made survival gear with a free online library of how-to articles, step-by-step guides, and videos designed to teach real-world skills — not just sell products.

“Too often women are told to ‘be careful’ — we want to give them the how,” said Peter Zeppieri, founder of Mountain Ready. “Preparedness isn’t a one-size-fits-all checklist. It’s about practical skills you can use right away: changing a tire at the side of the road, identifying an edible plant, treating a wound with an herb you can harvest, or keeping a small cabin lit when the power goes out. My goal is to strip away intimidation and give women the confidence to act when it matters most.”

Mountain Ready’s Skills-Focused Resources Cover:* Roadside emergencies: step-by-step procedures and gear lists so a breakdown doesn’t become a crisis.
* Foraging & herbal medicine basics: safety-first guides to common edible and medicinal plants and how to make simple emergency remedies.
* Self-defense fundamentals: practical, scenario-based techniques and mindset training designed with accessibility and safety in mind.
* Off-grid energy solutions: small-scale strategies — from portable solar kits to hand-crank tools — so families can maintain power if the grid fails.

“People sometimes think preparedness is only for a certain type of person,” Zeppieri added. “But the best prep is simple, achievable, and focused on preserving life and dignity. I’m always happy to talk about why women might feel intimidated at first — and show how quickly that intimidation can turn into capability.”

Free Learning, Not Just ProductsMountain Ready is deliberately built as both a retailer and a teaching resource. In addition to an online store carrying trusted brands and American-made items, the site hosts a growing news and education section where in-depth guides and checklists are published — many authored by Zeppieri and other experienced contributors — so anyone can learn essential skills.

“Self-defense starts with awareness and confidence; gear is only the amplifier of what you already know,” Zeppieri said.

Media AvailabilityPeter Zeppieri is available for interviews and online live demonstrations of products. Suggested interview topics include:

* Overcoming intimidation: why women hesitate and how to make skills learning welcoming and empowering.
* Building a family-friendly emergency kit on a budget.
