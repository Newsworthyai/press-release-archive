 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEEco-Friendly Purasan EX 2 Eliminates Need for Marine Waste Holding Tanks

MILLVILLE, NJ – Waste holding has always been a challenge for small- to mid-sized vessels. Raritan Engineering’s eco-friendly Purasan EX 2 Marine Sanitation Device offers a game-changing solution: treat onboard sewage so it can be safely and legally discharged within the three-mile limit, outside of federal no-discharge zones — no holding tank or pump-out station required.

US Coast Guard-certified as a Type 1 Marine Sanitation Device, the Purasan EX 2 completes its treatment cycle in just two minutes. Compatible with fresh or saltwater, one system can service up to two marine toilets, making it ideal for cruisers, day-boats, and other mid-sized vessels seeking a sustainable upgrade.

During each flush, waste is drawn into the treatment tank where an enhanced disinfectant neutralizes harmful pathogens. A high-speed macerator liquefies waste and paper for maximum disinfectant contact, while an integrated air pump improves water flow and extends disinfectant tablet life. As treated waste is discharged overboard, the system’s control panel alerts boaters to tablet replacement needs, ensuring continuous operation.

The Purasan EX 2 comes in 12V or 24V DC models, drawing just 10 or 8 amps respectively. Its compact treatment tank (16" x 8.75" x 13.5") is designed for flexible installation, with the control module and air pump able to be positioned up to six feet away.

Assembled by hand and individually tested in the USA, the Purasan EX 2 is backed by a one-year limited warranty and priced at $3,500.
