 New York City, United States - December 26, 2025 / Search Atlas /

 New York, NY - 24 December 2025Search Atlas, an AI-powered SEO platform that combines strategy, automation, and content optimization, today announced the launch of its WordPress Plugin v3 with OTTO Persistence Settings. The update transforms WordPress into a native execution layer for Search Atlas, enabling server-side SEO changes, including metadata, schema, redirects, robots.txt, and page-level optimizations, to be deployed directly within the CMS.

By consolidating fragmented SEO workflows and eliminating conflicts between multiple plugins, the plugin accelerates content updates, enhances indexing reliability, and provides teams with full visibility and control over live SEO changes. One-click migration from existing SEO tools, direct IndexNow integration, and automated deployment of AI-generated recommendations further streamline site-wide optimization and reduce manual work.

Benefits & Features * OTTO Persistence Settings: Automates deployment of AI-generated SEO recommendations directly into WordPress, reducing manual work while allowing granular control over metadata, structured data, social tags, and in-content fixes.
* Server-Side Execution: Updates are deployed directly inside WordPress, ensuring live changes are visible to search engines and internal teams, eliminating plugin conflicts and client-side inconsistencies.
* One-Click Migration: Seamlessly import metadata, redirects, and configurations from Yoast, Rank Math, and other SEO tools without data loss or workflow disruption.
* IndexNow Integration: Push updates directly to Bing and AI-powered search platforms, accelerating indexing and improving content discoverability.
* Advanced Cache Management: Automatically clears caches across WordPress core, third-party plugins, and the Search Atlas plugin, preventing stale content and broken deployments.
* Robots.txt and Sitemap Control: Manage critical technical SEO elements directly in the plugin, consolidating governance of sitemaps and crawl instructions.
* White-Label Functionality: Agencies can brand the plugin, lock configurations, and deploy across client sites while maintaining security and consistency.
* Secure Single Sign-On: Connect Search Atlas to WordPress with one click, reducing credential sharing and simplifying multi-site management.
* Native Post Scheduling: Schedule optimized posts directly from the platform, aligning content publication with SEO workflows without extra plugins.
* Embedded Auto and Agentic Workflows: View deployment logs, optimization status, and on-page changes directly in WordPress for full transparency.
* Continuous Stability and Compatibility Updates: Weekly improvements ensure reliable operation across Gutenberg, major site builders, and diverse WordPress environments.
* Future AI Page Building: Upcoming native AI editing and content creation features aim to integrate strategy, creation, and deployment into a single seamless workflow.

"Our vision has always been to remove the friction between strategy and execution, so teams can focus on the insights that matter while letting AI and integrated workflows handle deployment,” said Manick Bhan, the CEO and Founder of Search Atlas. “The WordPress Plugin v3 is the result of years of careful development, testing, and refinement across thousands of sites.

Looking ahead, Search Atlas plans to expand the plugin’s capabilities with native AI-powered page building and content editing, enabling teams to not only optimize but also create and structure pages directly within WordPress. The update is designed to future-proof SEO workflows, supporting large-scale operations while reducing technical bottlenecks.
