# RocketCup Coffee Launches 'Cuse® Coffee: A Limited-Edition Blend

Introducing 'Cuse® Coffee: A Limited Roast Celebrating Orange Pride with Syracuse University®

 Cattaraugus, United States - August 28, 2025 / RocketCup Coffee /

 RocketCup Coffee proudly announces the launch of its licensed Syracuse University® coffee, ‘Cuse® Coffee, a custom blend created for fans, alumni, and students who live and breathe Orange pride. This specialty roast is now available at rocketcupcoffee.com/cuse and through select retail partners for a limited time.

The launch follows a United Way Day of Caring event earlier this month, where RocketCup Coffee joined the Syracuse community in celebrating service and connection. As part of the event, the team helped revitalize the area by painting a large community mural and handed out hundreds of free cups of coffee.

“Syracuse pride runs deep, and so does our mission to revitalize communities. With the ‘Cuse Blend, fans and alumni can celebrate Orange spirit every day while supporting their school and community.” Tom Cullen, RocketCup Coffee CEO.

To celebrate the launch, RocketCup Coffee is adding a surprise for lucky fans. Six bags will include a special “Orange Ticket”, a pass that entitles the winner to a free coffee for an entire year. Each ticket will be randomly placed inside bags from the first production run of 3,000 bags.

“We’re always looking for creative ways to connect with our fans and showcase the Syracuse brand. RocketCup Coffee nailed it with ‘Cuse® Coffee; a product that blends innovation, quality, and school pride.” Rachel Duffy, Director of Strategic Partnerships & Licensing.
