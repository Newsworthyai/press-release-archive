Jubna Launches Marketplace, Unlocking Powerful New Opportunities for Brands & Media Owners

 Dubai, United Arab Emirates - September 15, 2025 / Jubna /

 Jubna Pivots Beyond Native Ads with Launch of Marketplace: A Full-Spectrum Platform for Brands and Media OwnersDubai, UAE – Jubna has officially launched its Marketplace, a platform that enables advertisers to run sponsored or paid promotions of all types across websites, social media, and messaging channels, while empowering media owners to monetize every touchpoint, creating new revenue streams and fully leveraging their audience across all digital platforms.

This represents a strategic leap for Jubna, positioning the company as a forward-looking innovator in digital advertising, capable of shaping the industry landscape, unlocking new business opportunities, and delivering holistic solutions that address the evolving needs of both brands and publishers in an increasingly complex media ecosystem.

From Native Ads to Omni-Channel MonetizationJubna was founded on helping publishers monetize traffic with native advertising. With the fragmentation of digital consumption across websites, social platforms, video, and messaging channels, the need for a more versatile solution became necessary.

With Marketplace, Jubna gives publishers and creators a unified platform to:

* Host Advertorials & Sponsored Editorials — going far beyond standard paid placements, Marketplace supports in-depth interviews, thought leadership features, special coverage articles, product spotlights, and brand storytelling formats that integrate seamlessly into media outlets.
* Offer Sponsored Social & Messaging Placements — monetization through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
* Run Lead Generation Campaigns — Offer Advertisers sales leads targeted across lucrative sectors including real estate, banking, healthcare, education, e-commerce and more.
* Tap into Streamlined Revenue Streams — with one centralized system to manage campaigns and maximize earnings across all touchpoints.
* Connect Directly with Advertisers — enabling transparent deals, performance-driven campaigns, and greater control over pricing and placements.
* Guaranteed Service Delivery — every service ordered through Marketplace is backed by Jubna’s commitment to delivery, giving advertisers and publishers complete confidence.

Building on Strong Publisher RelationshipsJubna’s pivot is not starting from zero—it’s building on years of trusted partnerships with hundreds of top publishers and media owners across MENA and the world. This vast network provides a solid foundation for Marketplace, ensuring advertisers can immediately access high-quality inventory and publishers can scale revenues with proven demand.

For Advertisers: Smarter Media Buying at Your FingertipsMarketplace gives advertisers and marketing agencies direct access to a curated catalog of media services offered by trusted publishers, influencers, and content creators across diverse platforms, regions, and industries.

Whether you're targeting niche audiences or running large-scale campaigns, Marketplace makes it easy to discover high-impact media opportunities — all in one place.

Advertisers can now:

* Search and filter services by content type (e.g. social posts, branded articles, podcasts), target audience, industry vertical, region, and preferred platforms
* Browse detailed service listings with clear pricing, audience insights, and media specifications
* Purchase services directly through a transparent, streamlined process with no intermediaries
* Collaborate with publishers on campaign planning, content customization, and performance tracking

Rapid Adoption and Massive InterestThe market response has already exceeded expectations. Within the first 24 hours of launch, more than 100 new services were added to Marketplace.

For publishers, this means opening up brand-new revenue streams in fully streamlined ways, without adding operational complexity.

For advertisers, Marketplace unlocks unprecedented reach across a wide spectrum of new and diversified channels, driving far greater impact and ROI than traditional solutions, all with the assurance of guaranteed delivery.

"Our journey began with native advertising in 2014, and now we are evolving with the digital landscape to meet the new needs of the market." said Basel Sayaf, Founder & Digital Director at Jubna.

“The Marketplace is the natural progression, enabling publishers to unlock revenue across every channel, while empowering brands with scale, precision, and full transparency for 2025 and beyond. What makes Marketplace different is that it’s built on the trust and reach we’ve established with hundreds of leading publishers across MENA and globally, giving it strength from day one. The surge of interest we’ve already seen from media owners and advertisers within the first 24 hours is a clear signal of market demand. And by guaranteeing delivery, we’re solving one of the industry’s most pressing challenges: ensuring campaigns run with consistency and reliability.”

A New Chapter for JubnaThe launch of Marketplace reflects Jubna’s ambition to become a comprehensive monetization ecosystem, not just an ad network. By expanding into advertorials, interviews, special coverage, and multi-format brand storytelling, along with sponsored social content and lead generation, Jubna positions itself as a bridge between brands and the new generation of media consumption habits.
