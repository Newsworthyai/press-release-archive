The team at Lanier Orthodontics understands that a beautiful smile can significantly impact a person's confidence and overall well-being.

One of the key offerings at Lanier Orthodontics is traditional braces. These braces are designed to correct various dental issues, including misaligned teeth, overcrowding, and bite problems. The orthodontic team utilizes the latest technology and techniques to ensure that each patient receives effective treatment. The braces are customized to fit each individual's mouth, providing optimal comfort and results.

In addition to traditional braces, Lanier Orthodontics is also a provider of Invisalign, a modern alternative to metal braces. Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable aligners to gradually shift teeth into their desired positions. This option is particularly popular among adults and teens who prefer a more discreet treatment method. The aligners are virtually invisible, making them an attractive choice for those who want to maintain their appearance while undergoing orthodontic treatment.

Patients at Lanier Orthodontics can expect a comprehensive approach to their orthodontic care. The process begins with a free consultation, where the orthodontist evaluates the patient's dental health and discusses their goals. This initial visit is an opportunity for patients to ask questions and learn more about the available treatment options. The team takes the time to explain the benefits and considerations of both braces and Invisalign, ensuring that patients can make informed decisions about their care.

The practice is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, allowing for precise diagnostics and treatment planning. Digital imaging and 3D modeling are used to create customized treatment plans that cater to each patient's specific needs. This advanced technology not only enhances the accuracy of the treatment but also improves the overall patient experience.

Lanier Orthodontics is committed to making orthodontic care accessible to everyone. The practice offers flexible payment options and works with various insurance plans to help patients manage the cost of their treatment. The team believes that everyone deserves a beautiful smile, and they strive to provide affordable solutions without compromising on quality.
