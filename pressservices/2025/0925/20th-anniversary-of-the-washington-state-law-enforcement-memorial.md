Behind the Badge Foundation Commemorates the 20th Anniversary of the Washington State Law Enforcement Memorial

 Redmond, United States - September 24, 2025 / Behind the Badge Foundation /

 Behind the Badge Foundation is marking the 20th anniversary of the Washington State Law Enforcement Memorial with a yearlong campaign honoring the memory of Washington's fallen officers. The 'WSLEM20: Two Decades. One Promise.' campaign launched in June 2025 and will continue through May 2026, marking two decades since the Memorial's dedication.

Since its establishment on the Capitol Campus in Olympia, the Washington State Law Enforcement Memorial has served as Washington's most solemn tribute to fallen officers, honoring 346 law enforcement personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities. The Memorial has become a place of remembrance for families, fellow officers, and citizens seeking to pay their respects to those who gave their lives protecting others.

"This Memorial is sacred ground—not just for law enforcement families, but for every Washingtonian who understands the cost of public safety," said Brian Johnston, Executive Director of Behind the Badge Foundation. "This campaign isn't just about looking back—it's about remembering why this Memorial matters and honoring the sacrifice of every name etched in stone."

Help Us Tell the Memorial’s Story

The WSLEM20 campaign will feature previously untold stories from the Memorial's history, rare archival materials, and personal accounts from the families, colleagues, and community members whose lives have been touched by the Memorial over the past two decades. As part of that effort, the Foundation is inviting Washington residents to share their connections to the Memorial by submitting:

* Personal photographs taken at the Memorial
* Short video testimonials or reflections
* Written memories or stories about visits to the Memorial
* Accounts of how the Memorial has impacted individuals or families

Selected submissions will be featured throughout the campaign across the Foundation's social media channels, newsletters, and official website, creating a living tribute to the Memorial's impact on the community.
