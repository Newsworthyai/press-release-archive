 Hendersonville, United States - September 24, 2025 / Little Twig Homes /

 Little Twig Homes, located in Hendersonville, North Carolina, is excited to announce the introduction of its groundbreaking and budget-friendly home kits tailored for contemporary living. These energy-efficient kits are available for shipment across the nation, simplifying the process for individuals and families to construct their ideal homes, cabins, or auxiliary dwelling units (ADUs). With a strong emphasis on affordability and sustainability, Little Twig Homes is dedicated to offering intelligent, adaptable solutions for workforce housing and off-grid retreats.

The home kits offered by Little Twig Homes are available in two main styles: Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) and Northern White Cedar log kits. The SIP kits come in dimensions of 400 and 950 square feet, featuring premium Andersen windows along with robust metal siding, roofing, and trim. These kits are engineered with energy efficiency as a priority, boasting insulation ratings of R-26 and R-40 as the standard, with an option for the Northern Edition that provides R-29 and R-57 insulation. This ensures that residences constructed with these kits maintain comfort throughout the year while reducing energy expenses.

Conversely, the Northern White Cedar log kits showcase precision-milled 6x6 logs that deliver a rustic yet contemporary look. These kits also incorporate Andersen windows and doors, architectural shingles, and pine exterior trim. The interiors are designed with tongue-and-groove pine, complete with interior doors, hardware, finished stair materials, and interior railings. This meticulous attention to detail not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the homes but also contributes to their longevity and energy efficiency.

A notable feature of Little Twig Homes is the focus on DIY pre-cut kits. Each kit is crafted for simple assembly, allowing homeowners to actively participate in the construction of their new living space. This DIY approach not only lowers labor costs but also empowers individuals to design a home that reflects their personal style and requirements. Whether it is a snug cabin in the woods, a rental unit, or an auxiliary dwelling unit for family members or guests, these kits offer the versatility to accommodate various housing needs.

The resilience of the materials utilized in Little Twig Homes' kits is another key benefit. The combination of high-quality SIPs and Northern White Cedar guarantees that homes are built to endure, resisting the elements while preserving their energy efficiency. This durability is especially crucial for those seeking to invest in workforce housing or off-grid living, where dependability and sustainability are essential.

In addition to their cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency, Little Twig Homes' kits are designed for rapid construction. The pre-cut nature of the kits allows homeowners to significantly shorten the time required to build their new residence. This is particularly advantageous for those needing to relocate quickly or for builders aiming to streamline their projects.
