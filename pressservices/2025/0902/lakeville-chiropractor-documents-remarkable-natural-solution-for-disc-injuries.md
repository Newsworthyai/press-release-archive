# Lakeville Chiropractor Documents Remarkable Natural Solution for Disc Injuries

Lakeville Chiropractor Releases New Study That Demonstrates Natural Recovery From Lumbar Disc Issues

 Lakeville, United States - September 1, 2025 / ALIGN Integrated Health /

 Lakeville, MN – Dr. Cody Rodewald DC, the founder of ALIGN Integrated Health in Lakeville, is making waves in the chiropractic community with the recent publication of his study in the Journal of Contemporary Chiropractic, detailing the "Non-surgical Chiropractic Management of a Massive Lumbar Disc Extrusion." This pioneering research highlights the promising outcomes of non-surgical approaches to lumbar disc herniation (LDH), a condition that significantly burdens health systems due to its prevalence and high costs. Lumbar disc herniation affects thousands every year and is a major contributor to pain and disability, costing health systems hundreds of millions of dollars annually. With this study, Dr. Rodewald presents evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic care in managing severely sized herniations without the need for surgical intervention. The comprehensive chiropractic care plan discussed in the paper resulted in the non-surgical resorption of a significant lumbar disc herniation, showcasing the potential for natural, non-invasive techniques. The study's findings suggest that without the presence of severe neurological deficits or cauda equina syndrome, chiropractic care not only presents a viable option for managing LDH but may also serve as an effective alternative to more invasive surgical treatments. This research reinforces the growing body of evidence that emphasizes the need for conservative care approaches prior to considering surgical options. “Our industry has a passion for helping patients with conservative, effective approaches to health challenges, and this case serves as proof that they can at times be as or more effective than more invasive procedures,” said Dr. Rodewald. "There needs to be more research like this, because these stories are more common than people know...this is one of only two studies that show on MRI a disc injury healing with only chiropractic care, but it happens more than one might think," Rodewald added. With their patient-centered focus, ALIGN continues to serve as a leading Chiropractor in Lakeville and advocate for natural and holistic treatment options that prioritize the health and well-being of patients. Dr. Rodewald's findings will serve not only to enhance the credibility of non-surgical interventions but also to inspire further research in the field to better serve individuals suffering from disc-related issues.
