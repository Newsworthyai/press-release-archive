Signs You May Have a Hidden LeakLeaks often remain undetected until they’ve caused damage. Homeowners should look out for these warning signs:

* Unexplained Increase in Water Bills: A sudden spike in water usage could signal a hidden leak.
* Low Water Pressure: Decreased flow might indicate water escaping through a leak.
* Damp Spots or Puddles: Unexplained wet areas in the yard, floors, or walls are red flags.
* Mold or Mildew Growth: Persistent dampness fosters mold, which often points to a leak.
* Sound of Running Water: Hearing water even when no fixtures are in use is a common indicator.
* Hot Spots on Floors: Warm spots on your flooring, especially if you have slab foundations, could indicate a leak in your hot water line.
