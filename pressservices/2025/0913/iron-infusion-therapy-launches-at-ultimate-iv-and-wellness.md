# Iron Infusion Therapy Launches at Ultimate IV and Wellness

Boost Energy and Restore Wellness: Iron Infusion Therapy Now Available at Ultimate IV and Wellness

 Bradenton, United States - September 13, 2025 / ULTIMATE IV AND WELLNESS /

 Ultimate IV and Wellness, a premier medical spa and wellness facility catering to the Sarasota-Bradenton region, is excited to unveil its latest offering: Iron Infusion Therapy in Bradenton. This innovative treatment is designed to assist individuals in swiftly restoring their iron levels, boosting energy, and enhancing overall vitality.

Iron deficiency ranks among the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies globally, often resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and difficulties with concentration. In contrast to oral iron supplements, which may take months to yield noticeable effects and frequently lead to digestive discomfort, Iron Infusion Therapy provides a direct infusion of iron into the bloodstream, allowing for quicker, safer, and more effective absorption.

“At Ultimate IV and Wellness, we observe the significant impact that fatigue and low iron levels have on individuals’ daily experiences. Iron Infusion Therapy offers our patients a secure, rapid, and efficient method to restore their energy and regain their sense of self,” stated Erica Barshay, RN, Founder of Ultimate IV and Wellness.

This therapy utilizes Venofer® (Iron Sucrose) infusions, which are administered under medical supervision and tailored to each client’s specific requirements based on lab testing and consultations. Clients can receive treatment in a pristine, luxurious setting designed to evoke the comforts of home, or they can take advantage of the center’s mobile concierge service for added convenience.

The newly introduced therapy is particularly beneficial for those requiring rapid iron restoration, especially in cases where oral iron supplements are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or when there is an urgent need to replenish iron levels due to conditions like iron deficiency anemia or during pregnancy.
