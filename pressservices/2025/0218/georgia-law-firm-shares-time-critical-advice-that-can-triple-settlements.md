# Georgia Law Firm Shares Time-Critical Advice That Can Triple Settlements

Local Georgia Attorney Shows Why the First Three Days After Your Crash Matter More Than You Think

 Marietta, United States - February 18, 2025 / The Graham Firm /

 The Graham Firm, a well-known Georgia personal injury law office, has just shared important news about why the first 72 hours after a car accident can make or break any car accident case. Their new article, "How To Find The Best Car Accident Lawyer Near Me: Why A Local Legal Team Can Make All The Difference," offers real-world advice that could help accident victims get the money they deserve.

"Most people don't know this, but the biggest mistakes happen right after the crash," says Attorney Graham, who started The Graham Firm. "Those security cameras at nearby stores? They usually record over the footage within three days. Witnesses move on, and important evidence can disappear with just one rainstorm. We've seen too many people lose half of what their case was worth just because they waited to call a lawyer."

The article points to eye-opening numbers from the Insurance Research Council - people who work with lawyers typically get paid three and a half times more than those who try to handle things on their own. It's a stark difference that shows just how much having a good lawyer really matters when it comes to getting justice in a personal injury claim.

"Insurance companies don't waste any time," Graham points out. "While you're still trying to process what happened, they're already working hard to pay you as little as possible. This is why having a local legal team that knows the Georgia court system is absolutely critical.”

The firm's article lays out five clear tips for finding the right local car accident lawyer, focusing on real courtroom experience and actual results. They back this up with their own track record, including a recent $6 million settlement they won for someone hurt by a distracted driver.

Key findings from the article include:

* Store security videos usually get erased after 3 days
* The average injury claim is over $26,000
* Posting on social media can hurt your case
* Missing doctor appointments can lower your settlement
