 Search Atlas founders announce the opening of a permanent animal sanctuary in Colombia that is currently home to more than 30 rescued animals.

Sophia Deluz, Chief Operating Officer of Search Atlas, and Manick Bhan, Founder and CEO, announced the opening of Search Atlas Animal Sanctuary, a permanent refuge for rescued animals located in Medellín, Colombia. The sanctuary opens this month and is currently home to more than 30 animals, including donkeys, dogs, cats, sheep, chickens, a rabbit, and a mother cow with her calf rescued from a slaughterhouse.

“Caring for animals has always been central to who we are,” said Sophia Deluz, COO of Search Atlas and co-founder of Search Atlas Animal Sanctuary.

A Sustainable Model for Animal RescueSearch Atlas Animal Sanctuary was created to provide permanent care for animals requiring long-term support, including senior dogs, farm animals rescued from unsafe conditions, and animals needing specialized medical attention. The Sanctuary was established alongside the growth of Search Atlas, the AI-powered SEO platform co-led by Sophia Deluz and Manick Bhan.

“Opening an animal sanctuary has been a dream since the beginning of our relationship,” Sophia said. “We’re grateful that the success of Search Atlas has allowed us to turn that dream into a safe, permanent home for animals who need a home.”

A portion of Search Atlas proceeds supports daily operations. Each resident receives veterinary care, proper nutrition, and an environment designed around its specific needs.
