 Rogers, United States - September 11, 2025 / Keith Law Group: Rogers Injury & Accident Lawyer /

 Bentonville, AR – The Keith Law Group is excited to share the remarkable outcome of the inaugural Adoption Weekend in collaboration with Best Friends Animal Society, which took place from August 29–31, 2025, at the Best Friends Pet Resource Center in Bentonville. The event saw an overwhelming response from the community, resulting in 49 dogs and cats finding their way into loving homes, exceeding the initial target of 40 adoptions.

During the three-day event, families from all over Northwest Arkansas gathered to meet the adoptable pets, gain insights into the mission of Best Friends Animal Society, and support the Keith Law Group's dedication to local community initiatives. Adoption fees were fully sponsored by the Keith Law Group, eliminating financial barriers for families and enabling more pets to secure homes.

“Seeing 49 dogs and cats leave with their new families was incredibly touching,” remarked Amy Keith, the Marketing Director at Keith Law Group.

“We are immensely grateful to everyone who participated, to our fantastic staff for their unwavering support, and to Best Friends for facilitating this weekend. Together, we have made a significant difference for pets and families throughout Northwest Arkansas.”

“Assisting dogs and cats in finding homes is at the core of what community is all about,” stated Sean Keith, Attorney and Owner of Keith Law Group.

“Our goal was set at 40, and achieving 49 adoptions demonstrates the strength of compassion when people unite. We are proud to support Best Friends in their efforts and eagerly anticipate the opportunity to do this again next year.”

Keith Law Group extends its sincere gratitude to the families who adopted pets, the numerous community members who came out to show their support, and the dedicated staff at Keith Law Group who volunteered their time to ensure the weekend was a success. The firm also acknowledges the crucial partnership with Best Friends Animal Society, whose commitment to saving lives made this event a reality.

Plans are already in motion to further this initiative, with Keith Law Group expressing eagerness to collaborate with Best Friends once again next year to provide even more dogs and cats the opportunity to find their forever homes.
