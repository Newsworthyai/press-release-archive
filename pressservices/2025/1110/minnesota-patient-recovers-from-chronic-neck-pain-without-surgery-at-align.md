# Minnesota Patient Recovers from Chronic Neck Pain Without Surgery At ALIGN

How One Patient Defied the Odds and Overcame Years of Chronic Neck Pain at ALIGN Integrated Health

 Lakeville, United States - November 10, 2025 / ALIGN Integrated Health /

 Lakeville, MN — After suffering head and neck injuries from a fall on the ice in 2019, a Woodbury resident "Dave", endured nearly five years of chronic pain, dizziness, vertigo, and headaches. Despite visiting multiple specialists—including three neurosurgeons who recommended spinal surgery and a neurologist for nerve pain—he found that lasting relief seemed impossible. Everything changed when Dave was referred to Dr. Cody Rodewald at ALIGN Integrated Health in Lakeville. Through a comprehensive, non-surgical approach focused on restoring movement, posture, and neurological balance, Dave regained his neck mobility and returned to an active, pain-free life—without surgery or drugs. “Dave was a very unique case,” said Dr. Rodewald, clinic director at ALIGN Integrated Health. “He came to us after nearly every other treatment option had been exhausted. We were, in his words, the ‘last chance’ clinic. Recovery didn’t happen overnight, but with consistency, Dave’s body responded. Within six months, he was doing pushups again, exercising, and—most importantly—living without pain.” ALIGN Integrated Health specializes in combining advanced chiropractic care, functional movement therapy, and neurological rehabilitation techniques to help patients overcome complex conditions. For patients like Dave, the team’s integrative approach often provides an alternative to invasive procedures or long-term medication dependence. “For four to five years, I tried everything,” said Dave. “After nine injections and countless consultations, I thought surgery was my only option. Dr. Rodewald helped me get my gait back, restore my neck movement, and eliminate the pain—all naturally.” Dr. Rodewald and the ALIGN team continue to help patients throughout Minnesota regain function and quality of life through evidence-based, drug-free care.
