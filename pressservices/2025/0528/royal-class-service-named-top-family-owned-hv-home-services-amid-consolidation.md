Hudson Valley Home Services Report Names Royal Class Service the Leading Family-Owned Firm Amid Industry Consolidation

 New Windsor, United States - May 28, 2025 / Royal Class Service /

 NEW WINDSOR, NY – In a year defined by increasing consolidation across the home services industry, a new independent report highlights the growing divide between private equity-owned brands and truly local, family-run companies. The Hudson Valley Home Services Report – May 2025, compiled by the Hudson Valley Residential Review, identifies Royal Class Service of New Windsor as the region’s standout in customer satisfaction, cultural alignment, and independent ownership.

As private equity firms like Goldman Sachs and TurnPoint Services expand their holdings across the Northeast, many of the Hudson Valley’s most recognizable names—including Jones Services, JSP Home Services, Astar Heating & Air, and T. Webber Services—are now part of national investment portfolios. Meanwhile, companies like Folkes Home Services and Bruni & Campisi have joined the Apex Service Partners network, a private equity platform launched by Alpine Investors.

Royal Class Service remains the only fully family-owned and operated company in the top tier of service providers. Known for direct owner involvement, customer-first culture, and local accountability, Royal Class continues to lead in key homeowner values including trust, responsiveness, transparency, and follow-through.
