# GMB Listings Now Essential for Contractor Lead Generation

New Data Reveals 60% of All Clicks to a Local Contractor Website Are From Google My Business Listings

 Las Vegas, United States - June 4, 2025 / Blue Sky Advertisement /

 Las Vegas, Nevada - At the beginning of 2025, the digital marketing scene for local contractors has experienced a remarkable shift that is fundamentally changing the way service-oriented businesses engage with potential customers online. Blue Sky Advertisement has published a fresh analysis based on over 40 different data points sourced from actual contractor clients, highlighting an astonishing trend. The percentage of clicks directed to contractor websites originating from Google My Business (GMB) listings has dramatically increased in the last four months. Previously, an average of 40% of clicks came from GMB; now, that number frequently surpasses 60% for many clients, with some observing even higher rates.

Rising GMB Clicks for Contractors

The following are a few compelling statistics that illustrate this significant transformation:

* Excavation Company in Snohomish County, WA: Increased from 37% of clicks via GMB to 54% in just four months.
* Demolition Company in Snohomish County, WA: Grew from 31% to 58% of clicks drawn from GMB.
* Excavation Company in Pierce County, WA: Saw a rise from 27% to 61% of total clicks coming from GMB.
* Plumbing Company in Washington: Surged from 33% to 61% of clicks via GMB.
* Remodeling Company in Sacramento County, CA: Ascended from 41% to 59% of clicks originating from their GMB listing.
* Landscape Contractor in Sacramento County, CA: Increased from 33% to 64% of all clicks through GMB.

These findings are not outliers but reflect a broader trend within the industry fueled by recent Google algorithm updates and the rollout of AI Mode and AI Overviews in local search results.

All these metrics were monitored using a tracking code linked to each client's Google My Business (GMB) profile to provide exact click data from Google Search Console, as supplied by Blue Sky Advertisement.

The Map Pack Advantage as Organic Results Diminish for Contractors

For years, contractors and other local service providers have relied on a combination of organic search traffic and Google's local "map pack" to cultivate leads. The map pack, which consists of the top three local business listings appearing at the forefront of search results, has always been a highly sought-after position. However, its significance has dramatically increased following Google's latest algorithm updates and the introduction of AI Mode and AI Overviews. These innovations highlight direct, AI-generated answers and map pack results, frequently neglecting traditional organic listings altogether.

When homeowners search for phrases like “plumber near me” or “HVAC contractor Las Vegas,” they are increasingly met with results from AI Mode that pull directly from Google Maps and GMB profiles. Consequently, organic search results are pushed further down the page, sometimes to the extent of being buried below the fold or even relegated to secondary pages, rendering them nearly invisible to the majority of users. Therefore, businesses not prominently featured in the map pack are likely to miss out on the vast majority of prospective customers.

The Importance of Branding for Local Contractors

With Google’s AI Mode and AI Overviews now delivering direct results sourced from Maps and GMB, establishing a strong brand presence for local contractor businesses has become vital. The reasoning is straightforward: the complexities of Google’s verification process for a GMB profile make it nearly impossible to artificially construct a reputable brand. Google mandates accurate business details, verifiable addresses (or service areas), and customer feedback to foster trust and reliability. This process ensures that only legitimate and trustworthy contractors are displayed in prominent positions.

An effectively optimized GMB profile serves not only as a listing but also as an online storefront, showcasing available services, customer reviews, business hours, and contact details. Often, this profile becomes the first point of interaction a prospective customer has with a business, emphasizing the importance of leaving a strong first impression. Contractors who actively manage their GMB profiles, ensuring the information is current and accurate, sharing regular updates, and engaging with customer reviews, reap benefits in the form of improved rankings, increased clicks, and ultimately, more job opportunities.

How Google's AI Mode Is Transforming Contractor Lead Generation

Google’s AI Mode aims to provide instant answers to user inquiries, often summarizing insights from authoritative sources or drawing information directly from Maps and GMB profiles. For informational asks, this could lead to fewer clicks on business websites, as users can obtain information directly from the search results. However, for local intent searches, such as finding a contractor, AI Mode and AI Overviews typically prioritize the display of the map pack and GMB listings, positioning them as the primary entry point for customer acquisition.

This transition is not merely hypothetical. Recent data indicates that clicks from the map pack now constitute as much as 80% of all local service leads for various contractors, with most of these clicks originating from GMB profiles. The introduction of AI Mode and AI Overviews has only accelerated this trend, as users are provided direct options from Maps and GMB, facilitating easier communication with businesses without needing to visit their websites.

Essential Steps for Contractors Going Forward

In light of these developments, local contractors must emphasize the following strategies to maintain their competitive edge:

* Enhance Your Google My Business Profile: Ensure that your profile is thorough, accurate, and continuously updated. Utilize high-quality visuals, share regular updates, and promptly respond to customer reviews.
* Prioritize Local SEO: Invest in local link-building efforts, create pages dedicated to your service area, and incorporate location-based keywords throughout your website.
* Stay Abreast of Algorithm Changes: Remain informed regarding Google’s latest updates and adapt your strategy as required. Given the rapid evolution of the landscape, flexibility is paramount.
* Cultivate Your Brand: Develop a solid online reputation by providing exceptional services, encouraging favorable reviews, and actively participating in your community.

The Future of Lead Generation for Local Service Contractors

The approach to digital marketing for contractors has been irrevocably altered. With more than 60% of all clicks directed to contractor websites now emanating from Google My Business listings, and that number on the rise, businesses that overlook their GMB profiles face significant disadvantages. Due to Google’s AI Mode and AI Overviews, the map pack has become the forefront of local search competition, and only those willing to invest in their brand, reputation, and local SEO will succeed in this newly transformed landscape.

For contractors, the message could not be clearer. Your Google My Business profile stands as your most potent instrument for generating leads. Make certain to leverage it effectively.
