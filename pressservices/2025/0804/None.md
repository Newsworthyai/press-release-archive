# Apex Epoxy Flooring Launches New Marble Epoxy Line in Jacksonville

Expansion Meets Rising Demand for High-End Metallic Epoxy Flooring at Competitive Rates

 Jacksonville, United States - August 3, 2025 / Apex Epoxy Flooring of Jacksonville /

 Apex Epoxy Flooring of Jacksonville, a branch of Apex Flooring LLC and a recipient of the 2023 Home Advisor Top Choice Award, has introduced a new collection of marble-inspired metallic epoxy flooring, combining elegant design with industrial-grade durability for residential garages throughout Northeast Florida. Renowned for its ability to merge artistry with functionality, Apex’s newest product line addresses the increasing interest from homeowners aiming to upgrade their garages with enduring, luxurious finishes that remain budget-friendly.

The marble metallic epoxy system employs the innovative REFLECTOR™ Enhancer Flooring System developed by Elite Crete Systems, yielding stunning, high-gloss finishes that replicate the sophistication of genuine marble or granite. These floors not only enhance visual appeal but are also designed to withstand pressures up to 15,000 psi, resist UV degradation, repel water, and endure the high humidity and heat typical of Florida.

The impact of Apex’s new marble flooring has already been demonstrated in several recent projects. Following the flooding of a homeowner’s garage due to Hurricane Ian, Apex was chosen for the replacement because of their promptness, transparent pricing, and efficient process. The installation was completed in just two days and garnered widespread acclaim for its look and resilience. Another homeowner, who had recently acquired a new property, sought Apex for a garage enhancement and remarked on the numerous compliments received from neighbors shortly after the floor was installed.

These narratives underscore Apex’s dedication to not only installing top-tier products but also ensuring the process is efficient and transparent. Each project begins with a complimentary consultation and same-day estimates, followed by industrial diamond grinding for optimal surface preparation, multiple layers of epoxy coating, and a robust, high-gloss polyaspartic topcoat. Typically, installation is finalized within a single day, followed by a 24-hour curing period and a thorough final inspection.
