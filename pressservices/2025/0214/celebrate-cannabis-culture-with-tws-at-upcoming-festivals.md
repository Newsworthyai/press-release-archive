Horror Market Madness is a dynamic festival that intricately combines a passion for horror with distinctive shopping experiences. Taking place in Houston, Texas, the event promises an exhilarating environment for both horror aficionados and the intrigued public. Attendees at the TWS booth will have the chance to explore the company’s extraordinary THCA flower, celebrated for its remarkable purity and potency.

The collaboration with Saint Arnold's, known for its exceptional craft beer, enriches the festival experience.

At the Spring Stock Music Festival, TWS aims to highlight its dedication to quality and community engagement. Participants can sample the company's THCA flower, cultivated with precision and harvested at the optimal time to guarantee the freshest product available. Tasting stations will be set up for those interested in delving into the subtleties of various strains and how they can elevate the overall experience.

Besides the THCA flower, TWS will feature its popular Delta 9 gummies. These gummies are not only a delightful treat for the taste buds; they represent an enjoyable and accessible way to experience the effects of Delta 9 THC. Available in a variety of flavors, TWS’s Delta 9 gummies are crafted to simplify cannabis consumption for both seasoned users and newcomers alike. With their chewy consistency and vibrant flavors, these gummies are an ideal addition to any gathering, especially one as dynamic as the Spring Stock Music Festival.
