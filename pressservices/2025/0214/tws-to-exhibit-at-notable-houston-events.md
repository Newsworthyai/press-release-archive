 Houston, United States - February 14, 2025 / TWS /

 TWS is thrilled to share its involvement in two prominent events scheduled for February and March 2025. The company will present its exceptional lineup of products, featuring premium THCA flower and tempting Delta 9 gummies, at the Horror Market Madness on February 16 and the Spring Stock Music Festival on March 7 and 8.

The Horror Market Madness is a lively and diverse festival that intertwines a passion for horror with distinctive shopping experiences. Taking place in Houston, Texas, this event promises an electrifying atmosphere for horror aficionados and curious visitors alike. Attendees who visit the TWS booth will have the chance to explore the company's remarkable THCA flower, celebrated for its purity and strength. THCA, short for tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, is a non-psychoactive compound present in the cannabis plant, and TWS has cultivated a premium selection that encapsulates the natural flavors and aromas of each strain.

In addition to the THCA flower, TWS will also feature its delightful Delta 9 gummies. These gummies beautifully mix exceptional flavors with the potential advantages of cannabinoid compounds. Delta 9 THC is famous for its uplifting effects, making these gummies a favored choice among cannabis lovers in search of a tasty edible alternative. Guests at Horror Market Madness will have the opportunity to sample these confections, engage with knowledgeable staff regarding their benefits, and discover what makes TWS a trusted name for those who prioritize quality and reliability.

Next, TWS eagerly anticipates its participation in the Spring Stock Music Festival, set to take place at Saint Arnold's Brewery. Attendees can enjoy an exciting lineup of musical acts and the lively atmosphere offered by this beloved local brewery during the weekend of March 7 and 8. The collaboration with Saint Arnold's, renowned for its craft beer, adds an exhilarating element to the festival experience.

At the Spring Stock Music Festival, TWS will highlight its commitment to excellence and community engagement. Attendees are invited to explore the company’s THCA flower, which is cultivated with care and harvested at its prime to guarantee the freshest product available. Tasting stations will be set up for those interested in learning about the intricacies of various strains and how they can enhance the overall experience.

Alongside the THCA flower, TWS will showcase its well-loved Delta 9 gummies. These gummies offer more than just a delicious treat; they present a fun and accessible means to experience the effects of D9. With a variety of flavors available, TWS’s Delta 9 gummies are crafted to make cannabis consumption enjoyable for seasoned users and newbies alike. Their chewy texture and vibrant flavors make them an appealing addition to any social gathering, particularly one as spirited as the Spring Stock Music Festival. For those unable to attend either event, there is always the option to shop online.

Both events provide an excellent opportunity for TWS to connect with a broad audience.
