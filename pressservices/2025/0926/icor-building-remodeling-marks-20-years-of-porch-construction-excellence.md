SOUTHERN RHODE ISLAND â€“ ICOR Building & Remodeling has solidified its position as Southern Rhode Island's premier porch construction specialist, celebrating a record-breaking 2024 that included receiving the prestigious NADRA Award from the North American Deck and Railing Association and being named Connecticut Remodeler of the Year by the Home Builders Association. With over 20 years in business and more than 1,600 completed projects, the company has established itself as the definitive benchmark for porch construction excellence throughout Southern Rhode Island and surrounding regions.

The NADRA Award from the North American Deck and Railing Association represents recognition from the industry's most respected professional organization, while the Connecticut Remodeler of the Year honor demonstrates excellence that extends beyond regional boundaries.

"Receiving both the NADRA Award and Connecticut Remodeler of the Year recognition in 2024 represents the culmination of more than two decades of dedication to porch construction excellence," said a representative from ICOR Building & Remodeling. "These honors validate our commitment to delivering exceptional results while maintaining the highest professional standards in every project we complete."

The company's award recognition builds upon previous local honors, including Best of Mystic Awards in both 2022 and 2023, demonstrating consistent client satisfaction and strong community support that reflects ongoing excellence in service delivery.

Comprehensive Project Portfolio Demonstrates Market LeadershipICOR Building & Remodeling's market position is supported by an impressive portfolio of over 1,600 completed projects spanning more than 20 years of continuous operation.

"Our 1,600+ project portfolio represents two decades of continuous learning and refinement," explained ICOR representatives. "This experience enables us to anticipate challenges, recommend optimal solutions, and deliver results that consistently exceed client expectations."

The company's longevity and project volume demonstrate not only technical expertise but also the trust and satisfaction of thousands of homeowners who have chosen ICOR for their most important home improvement investments.

Specialized Focus Drives Superior Porch Construction ResultsUnlike general contractors who handle porches as occasional projects, ICOR Building & Remodeling has positioned porch construction as one of the central parts of its operations, developing specialized expertise that addresses the unique challenges of creating spaces that balance indoor and outdoor living. The company's focus encompasses front porches, covered porches, screened-in porches, retractable screen systems, sunrooms, and three-season rooms.

"Porch construction requires specialized knowledge of ventilation, weatherproofing, and indoor-outdoor integration that general contractors often lack," noted ICOR representatives. "Our specialized focus ensures that every project benefits from refined techniques and deep understanding of porch-specific requirements."

This specialization enables ICOR to deliver solutions that address complex technical challenges while creating spaces that enhance both home functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Comprehensive Material Portfolio Ensures Optimal SolutionsICOR Building & Remodeling's material expertise encompasses wood, stone, brick, concrete, composite, and PVC construction options, plus industry-leading porch screen systems including EZ-Screen porch windows, SCREENEZE, Universal Screens, Sun Coast screens, and SummerSpace systems. This comprehensive material portfolio enables customized solutions that match existing home architecture or create distinctive new design statements.

"Material selection is crucial for long-term porch performance," explained ICOR representatives. "Our extensive material partnerships provide clients with optimal solutions that balance aesthetic preferences, performance requirements, and maintenance considerations."

The company's material expertise ensures that every project utilizes products specifically suited to Southern Rhode Island's coastal climate conditions while meeting individual client preferences and budget requirements.

Industry-Leading Warranty Protection Demonstrates Quality ConfidenceICOR Building & Remodeling's confidence in its craftsmanship is reflected in comprehensive warranty protection that includes workmanship coverage and material warranties extending up to 50 years depending on selected products. This extensive warranty structure provides exceptional long-term protection for client investments while demonstrating the company's commitment to standing behind its work.

"Our warranty structure reflects absolute confidence in our work quality and material selection," noted ICOR representatives. "We understand that porch construction represents significant investment, and our protection ensures clients enjoy peace of mind long after project completion."

Client-Focused Service Approach Enhances Project ExperienceICOR Building & Remodeling's service methodology emphasizes accessibility and transparency through free estimates, financing options, and a comprehensive showroom where clients can examine materials and systems before making decisions. This client-focused approach simplifies the selection process while ensuring informed decision-making throughout every project phase.

The company's five-star Google rating validates its commitment to customer satisfaction and professional service delivery, reflecting consistent performance that exceeds client expectations across hundreds of completed projects.

Market Position Strengthened by Proven PerformanceWhile Southern Rhode Island hosts various porch construction companies, including South County Post & Beam, Rhode Island Remodeling Pros, and Ocean State Deck & Patio, ICOR Building & Remodeling's combination of specialized focus, extensive experience, industry recognition, and superior warranty protection provides distinct advantages for homeowners seeking exceptional porch construction results.

"Twenty years of specialized focus has enabled us to refine our approach and deliver results that consistently exceed industry standards," explained ICOR representatives. "Our award recognition and client satisfaction record demonstrate the value of working with true porch construction specialists."

Investment in Property Value and Lifestyle EnhancementICOR Building & Remodeling emphasizes that porch construction represents investment in both lifestyle enhancement and property value improvement. The company's approach ensures that installations provide immediate comfort and functionality benefits while contributing to long-term home value appreciation through superior design, quality materials, and expert craftsmanship.
