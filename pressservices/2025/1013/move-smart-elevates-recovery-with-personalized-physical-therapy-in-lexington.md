 LEXINGTON, Ky. — Move Smart, a leading physical therapy provider in Lexington, KY, is redefining the recovery experience through advanced, personalized care designed to help patients move better, feel stronger, and return to the activities they love. By focusing on quality of movement and one-on-one attention, Move Smart’s physical therapy services empower individuals to take charge of their health and achieve long-term wellness.

Unlike traditional clinics driven by insurance limitations, Move Smart provides individualized treatment plans that focus on the patient’s unique goals rather than arbitrary time or visit constraints. Each session is conducted in a private setting with the therapist’s full attention, ensuring every client receives expert, customized care.

“Our mission is simple - to deliver the highest quality of physical therapy in a supportive environment where every patient feels seen, heard, and guided toward lasting wellness,” said Sarah Martin, Owner and Physical Therapist at Move Smart. “We partner with people who want to live fully - whether that means returning to their favorite sport, chasing their kids, or simply moving without pain.”

Move Smart’s specialized physical therapy services in Lexington include dry needling, movement and gait analysis, sports performance training, pelvic health therapy, chronic pain management, and wellness programs designed to help patients sustain progress long after treatment ends. The practice also hosts free community workshops multiple times per month, offering education on movement, injury prevention, and whole-body wellness.

Each of Move Smart’s licensed physical therapists bring years of experience and advanced certifications, including training in dry needling, functional movement, and complex orthopedic care. Their mind-body approach addresses not only symptoms but also the root causes of pain and dysfunction, promoting lasting improvement and confidence in daily movement.
