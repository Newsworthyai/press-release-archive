# PBL Law Group's Strata Lawyers Offer Guidance on New Laws

Confused by the 2025 NSW Strata Laws? This Sydney Strata Law Firm Has the Answers

 Sydney, Australia - October 1, 2025 / PBL Law Group /

 In the wake of significant new strata legislation in NSW, numerous Owners Corporations and residents are finding it challenging to grasp their updated rights and responsibilities. This confusion, recently emphasized in the Sydney Morning Herald, has led to a pressing demand for clear and trustworthy legal advice. To meet this need, PBL Law Group has launched a collection of comprehensive guides crafted by its team of skilled strata lawyers to clarify the reforms.

The Sydney Morning Herald piece titled "New strata laws are great, but I can’t get an answer about undies on the balcony" highlighted the public's exasperation, pointing out that official resources often leave strata communities to "gamble their own time and their buildings' money" in their quest to comprehend the law. PBL Law Group's latest resources aim to fill this void by offering practical insights into the most crucial facets of the legislation.

"The 'undies on the balcony' dilemma exemplifies a much broader issue: a lack of clarity surrounding intricate new regulations," states Raea Khan, Partner and Director Lawyer at PBL Law Group. "Individuals are bewildered by everything from conducting committee meetings to managing financial difficulties and approving green initiatives. That’s why we have gone beyond mere commentary and produced a series of actionable guides to provide strata committees and owners with the definitive answers they require."

To tackle these significant areas of ambiguity, PBL Law Group has unveiled a series of thorough online resources, which include:

* A Complete Guide to Governance and Obligations: This guide addresses the new responsibilities for committee members, enhanced repair duties, and increased accountability for developers, as outlined in their Complete Guide to the 2025 NSW Strata Law Reforms.
* Capitalising on Sustainability Reforms: This resource clarifies how schemes can now more readily approve EV chargers, solar panels, and other eco-friendly enhancements, which is detailed in Boost Property Value & Sustainability: A Guide to the 2025 Reforms.
* New Protections for Owners in Financial Hardship: This guide outlines the mandatory requirements for establishing payment plans and the new, fairer procedures for levy recovery, discussed in their guide to Financial Hardship & New Owner Protections.

By offering these resources, PBL Law Group aspires to empower the entire strata community with the essential knowledge required to operate in compliance and prevent costly disputes. The firm is convinced that proactive education is the most effective strategy for navigating the changing legal environment.

"Our objective is to become the preferred resource for anyone in search of a strata lawyer in Sydney," adds Raea Khan. "This starts with delivering clear, accessible information that assists individuals in resolving issues before they escalate."

For strata committees, managers, or owners looking to comprehend the full implications of the 2025 reforms, PBL Law Group's articles provide an essential foundation.
