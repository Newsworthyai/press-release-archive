# Lee Kendall and Goliath Ads Shake Up IRE Roofing Convention with Geo Fencing

Innovative Approach at IRE Roofing Convention

 Berlin, United States - February 24, 2025 / Goliath Ads /

 In a bold move that turned heads in the roofing industry, Lee Kendall, founder of Goliath Ads, proved that you don’t have to be on the ground at the IRE Roofing Convention to make a major impact—you just have to be smarter about where you show up.

Instead of spending $25,000 on a booth, Kendall geo-fenced the entire convention, targeting attendees with highly effective digital ads and offering a first-of-its-kind incentive—$2,500 in ad spend, covered by Goliath Ads, for roofing companies ready to take their marketing to the next level.

“We didn’t need to be at IRE shaking hands when we could be in their phones, in their inboxes, and in front of them online,” said Kendall. “We strategically reached the exact same audience—without the overhead—and put that money directly into their ads instead.”

The result? Immediate traction. The offer filled up fast, with roofing contractors jumping at the chance to take advantage of high-performance ad campaigns without spending a dime upfront. Instead of paying for travel, booth space, and sponsorships, Kendall split the $25,000 ‘show cost’ into direct ad dollars for his clients, ensuring they saw an instant return.

Proving the Power of Online Marketing for RoofersGoliath Ads specializes in aggressive lead generation for roofing companies, using targeted digital campaigns that drive high-value leads at scale. By leveraging advanced online strategies, Kendall and his team continue to prove that roofing companies don’t need to rely on outdated marketing tactics to grow—they just need the right digital system in place.

“We don’t just sell marketing—we put skin in the game and prove it works,” Kendall added. “This was about making an impact that actually generates revenue for roofers, not just handing out business cards.”

With the success of this campaign, Goliath Ads is already gearing up for future events, ensuring that the roofing industry’s best marketing isn’t happening at the show—it’s happening online.
