 Woodland Hills, CA — Stairway Resource Center, a community-focused addiction and mental health treatment center in Woodland Hills, California, provides individualized recovery programs to support lasting sobriety and personal growth. Emphasizing a 12-Step philosophy, trauma-informed care, and dual diagnosis treatment, Stairway Resource Center empowers individuals from diverse backgrounds to reconnect with their communities, embrace structure, and cultivate balanced, fulfilling lives in recovery.

Community Involvement & Sober NetworkingRooted in the belief that community is at the heart of recovery, Stairway Resource Center extends its impact through active involvement in local sober events, partnerships with nonprofits serving underserved communities, and quarterly homeless drives that distribute necessities like Narcan, clothing, and first aid kits. By embracing a philosophy of community that goes beyond sober support, the center actively fosters a network of care and reintegration.

Long-Term Recovery Care & ReintegrationPatients benefit from comprehensive dual-diagnosis care, including therapies like EMDR, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neurofeedback to address conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. With a long-term approach, Stairway Resource Center allows patients to engage in treatment as long as needed, creating a foundation for stable recovery and healthy reintegration into society.

Structured Programs & Community ActivitiesA structured daily schedule lies at the heart of the Stairway experience, fostering an environment where accountability, spiritual growth, and community thrive. The dedicated treatment team, composed of in-house psychiatric and medical professionals, collaborates closely with each patient to build individualized recovery strategies.

While the center’s programs are grounded in the 12-Step model, they also embrace holistic practices such as mindfulness, breathwork, and healthy living, which promote a whole-person approach to healing. Community activities, including weekly alumni meetings and events like sober comedy nights and holiday gatherings, underscore Stairway’s commitment to ongoing support beyond treatment.

Personalized, Community-Driven Addiction RecoveryBy combining evidence-based mental health practices with a 12-Step foundation and structured spiritual support, Stairway Resource Center offers a unique approach to treating addiction and co-occurring mental health conditions.
