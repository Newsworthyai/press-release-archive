She will diligently pursue the personal injury compensation you deserve.

Truck AccidentsTruck accidents frequently result in severe or even fatal injuries for those involved, and they often present complex legal challenges.

Motorcycle AccidentsMotorcycle accidents frequently result in severe injuries.

Bias against motorcyclists is common, even when the accident was not the motorcyclist's fault.

Premise LiabilityProperty owners have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment for visitors, customers, and guests. When they fail to do so, it can lead to slip and fall accidents and other injuries. Premise liability cases can be complex because they often involve determining whether the property owner acted negligently.

Orange County personal injury lawyer Shahnaz Hussain has a deep understanding of premises liability laws and can help determine if the property owner failed to take reasonable steps to prevent your injury. These accidents can occur anywhere, from a grocery store to a private residence.

If you have been injured on someone else’s property, Orange County personal injury lawyer Shahnaz Hussain can help you determine if the owner is liable for your injuries.

Product LiabilityConsumers have a right to expect that the products they use are safe and free from dangerous defects. When companies cut corners or fail to adhere to safety standards, it can put consumers at risk. Product liability law holds manufacturers, distributors, and sellers responsible for injuries caused by defective products.

A product can be considered defective in several ways, such as a design defect, a manufacturing defect, or inadequate warnings or instructions. Orange County personal injury attorney Shahnaz Hussain has extensive experience in investigating these complex cases and can determine if the product that caused your injuries was defective.

Dog BitesDog bites can inflict serious injuries, leaving victims with lasting physical and emotional scars—and sometimes even permanent disabilities. Owners have a responsibility to prevent their animals from attacking others.

California law operates under a “strict liability” rule for dog bites, meaning that the dog’s owner is liable for the victim’s injury, even if the incident was the dog’s first bite and the owner was unaware of any previous aggression.

If you or someone you love has been injured in a dog attack, Orange County personal injury attorney Shahnaz Hussain can help determine the best course of action to recover damages.
