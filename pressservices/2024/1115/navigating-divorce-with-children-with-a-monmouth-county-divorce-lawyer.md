[]()Child Custody Standards with a Monmouth County Divorce LawyerChild custody is often one of the most contested areas of divorce involving children. Mediation is a way to way to resolve child custody disputes outside of court but is not always an option when couples have different viewpoints. In New Jersey, child custody decisions focus on the child’s best interests. New Jersey family courts consider various factors to assess which custody arrangement best supports the child. Factors include each parent’s relationship with the child, the stability each parent can provide, and each parent’s ability to meet the child’s needs.

Types of CustodyIn Monmouth County, child custody generally falls into two main types:

·      Legal Custody: This form of custody grants one or both parents the right to make significant decisions about the child’s education, healthcare, and religious upbringing. Most families benefit from joint legal custody, allowing both parents to remain involved in important decisions.

·      Physical Custody: Physical custody dictates where the child lives. This arrangement can either be joint, with the child splitting time between both parents or sole, where the child lives primarily with one parent.

Frequently Asked Questions about Divorce[]()What is the Process for Getting a Divorce in Monmouth County, New Jersey?[]()In Monmouth County, New Jersey, the legal process of ending a marriage is known as a dissolution of marriage, where either spouse can initiate the divorce proceedings. The spouse initiating the divorce is known as the petitioner, while the other spouse is referred to as the respondent.

Upon filing a Complaint for Divorce, the petitioner must serve a copy to the respondent, who then has 35 days to respond to the complaint. Prior to a court hearing being scheduled, both parties may partake in discovery, which involves the exchange of pertinent documents and information related to the case.

Furthermore, the spouses may enter settlement negotiations, with many divorce cases being resolved before reaching trial. In such instances, a divorce settlement agreement is presented to the court for approval by the judge. However, if both spouses cannot agree on all terms, the case proceeds to trial where the judge reviews evidence from both parties before issuing a final divorce judgment that addresses the outstanding issues.

Can a parenting plan be modified after the divorce is finalized?Yes, a parenting plan can be modified if there is a significant change in circumstances. The Monmouth County divorce attorneys at the Law Offices of Sylvia S. Costantino, Esq., LLC can help parents request a modification to a parenting plan if changes in employment, relocation, or the child’s needs make the current plan unworkable. With the assistance of their experienced Monmouth County divorce attorneys, parents can petition for adjustments that align with their evolving family situation.

What is the difference between legal custody and physical custody?Legal custody involves the right to make major decisions about the child’s education, healthcare, and religious upbringing, while physical custody determines where the child lives. Most parents benefit from joint legal custody, allowing both to participate in important decisions, even if one parent has primary physical custody. A Monmouth County divorce lawyer from the Law Offices of Sylvia S. Costantino, Esq., LLC can explain the details of each type of custody and help parents choose an arrangement that supports their family’s needs.

Are children considered when alimony is calculated?While children are a significant focus in divorce proceedings, their specific needs are generally not a direct factor in calculating alimony. Alimony, or spousal support, is designed to help a lower-earning spouse maintain a lifestyle similar to what they experienced during the marriage. New Jersey courts consider factors like the length of the marriage, each spouse’s financial resources, earning capacity, and standard of living. However, the presence of children can indirectly influence alimony decisions, as child-related responsibilities may impact a parent’s ability to work full-time or affect financial needs.

In cases where children’s needs substantially impact either parent’s financial situation, consulting with a Monmouth County divorce lawyer can help clarify how these unique circumstances might affect alimony.

Does domestic violence play a role in child custody matters?Yes, domestic violence is a critical factor in child custody decisions in New Jersey. Courts in Monmouth County, NJ, and throughout the state prioritize the safety and well-being of children, and any history of domestic violence is carefully considered when determining custody arrangements. If there is evidence of domestic violence, the court may limit or deny custody or visitation rights for the parent involved to protect the child and any other affected family members.

In cases where domestic violence is a concern, it’s imperative to work with a knowledgeable Monmouth County divorce lawyer who can provide the necessary support and advocacy. The experienced divorce lawyers at the Law Offices of Sylvia S. Costantino, Esq., LLC can help present relevant evidence to the court, help obtain a temporary restraining order, and ensure that custody arrangements prioritize the safety and best interests of the child.
