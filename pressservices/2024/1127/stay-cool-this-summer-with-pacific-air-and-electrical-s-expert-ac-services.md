A proactive approach to upkeep not only ensures your system's efficiency but also extends its lifespan, saving you from unexpected repairs and high energy costs.

The first step in maintaining your system is to check and clean the filters. Dirty filters can restrict airflow, reduce efficiency, and strain the unit. Depending on usage and air quality, Pacific Air and Electrical advises cleaning or replacing filters every one to three months to keep your system running smoothly.

Next, inspect the exterior unit for any debris or obstructions. Leaves, dirt, and other materials can accumulate over time, blocking airflow and causing the unit to overheat. Clearing the area around the unit ensures optimal performance and prevents unnecessary wear and tear.

Before the peak summer season, scheduling a professional inspection is highly recommended. Pacific Air and Electrical’s technicians can identify and address issues like refrigerant leaks or electrical faults before they escalate. This preemptive step minimizes the risk of breakdowns and ensures your system is ready for the hottest days.

Finally, efficient thermostat management plays a key role in system longevity and energy savings. Setting your thermostat to a comfortable yet energy-efficient temperature reduces wear on the unit. For enhanced control, Pacific Air and Electrical suggests installing a programmable or smart thermostat, allowing homeowners to optimize cooling schedules and lower energy bills.

By following these seasonal maintenance tips, homeowners can enjoy reliable cooling throughout the summer. With Pacific Air and Electrical's expert guidance and support, every air conditioning system is prepared to perform efficiently, ensuring a comfortable and worry-free summer.
