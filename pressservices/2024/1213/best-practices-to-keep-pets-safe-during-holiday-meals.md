 Summerville, United States - December 13, 2024 / Coastal Creek Animal Hospital /

 Best Practices to Keep Pets Safe During Holiday MealsAs the holiday season approaches, many families in Summerville are preparing to gather for festive meals filled with delicious food and joyful celebrations. While these gatherings are a time for enjoyment, they can also pose significant risks to pets, particularly dogs. To ensure a safe and happy holiday break steering clear of a visit to your local animal hospital, it is essential to understand the best practices for keeping pets safe during holiday meals.

The Dangers of Sharing Scrap Food with Your PetOne of the primary concerns during the holiday season is the temptation to share food scraps with pets. While it may seem harmless to offer a few bites of turkey or a taste of mashed potatoes, many common holiday foods can be harmful or even toxic to dogs. Foods that are high in fat, such as gravy and rich sauces, can lead to gastrointestinal upset or pancreatitis in dogs. Additionally, certain ingredients, such as onions, garlic, and chocolate, are toxic to dogs and should never be given to them, even in small amounts.

To keep pets out of veterinary services this holiday season, it is crucial to know which food scraps are safe for dogs.

Plain, cooked turkey without skin or seasoning can be a safe treat in moderation. "Feeding your dog items like turkey skin and gravy can trigger pancreatitis" according to Dr. Mackenzie Ciccone of Coastal Creek Animal Hospital, "which impacts over 200,000 dogs annually."

Similarly, small amounts of plain green beans or carrots can be a healthy addition to a dog's diet.

However, it is essential to avoid giving dogs any food that has been seasoned or contains additives, as these can be harmful to their health.

Handling Pet Anxiety During the HolidaysAnother important aspect of keeping pets safe during holiday meals is managing their anxiety in crowded gatherings. For instance, the Summerville Christmas Parade in Hutchinson Square is not always a relaxing, fun-filled event for every pet. Many dogs can become overwhelmed by the noise and activity of large groups of people, leading to stress and anxiety. To help pets cope with these situations, owners can take several proactive steps. Creating a quiet space for the dog away from the commotion can provide a safe haven where they can relax. This space should be equipped with their favorite toys, a comfortable bed, and access to fresh water.

Additionally, owners can help their dogs feel more secure by providing them with familiar items, such as a favorite blanket or a piece of clothing that smells like their owner. This can help to create a sense of comfort in an otherwise chaotic environment. For dogs that are particularly anxious, owners may consider using calming products, such as anxiety wraps or pheromone diffusers, which can help to reduce stress levels.

It is also essential for pet owners to establish boundaries during holiday meals. Educating guests about the importance of not feeding pets table scraps can help prevent accidental ingestion of harmful foods. Owners can designate a specific area for their pets during meals, ensuring that they are not in the way of foot traffic or potential hazards. This can also help to minimize the chances of a pet begging for food or getting into trouble while guests are distracted.

How to Avoid Veterinary Visits Due to Holiday Decorations

In addition to managing food and anxiety, pet owners should also be vigilant about keeping their dogs away from holiday decorations. Many common holiday items, such as tinsel, ornaments, and lights, can pose choking hazards or lead to gastrointestinal blockages if ingested. Keeping decorations out of reach and supervising pets during the holiday season can help to prevent accidents. The last thing anyone wants is to add a surprise visit to the veterinary clinic over the holiday break.

As families come together to celebrate the holidays, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of pets. By understanding which food scraps are safe to share, managing anxiety in crowded gatherings, and keeping pets away from potential hazards, owners can protect their dogs from holiday food dangers. This proactive approach not only helps to keep pets out of veterinary services but also ensures that everyone can enjoy a joyful and stress-free holiday season.

In conclusion, the holiday season should be a time of joy and celebration for both humans and their furry companions. By following best practices to keep pets safe during holiday meals, owners can create a festive environment that is enjoyable for everyone. With a little planning and awareness, it is possible to protect dogs from the dangers of holiday food and ensure that they remain happy and healthy throughout the festivities.
