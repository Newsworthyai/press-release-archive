# Protect Your Pipes from Freezing This Winter in Cedar City, UT: Essential Tips

Effective Ways To Prevent Frozen Pipes in Cedar City, UT: Winter Preparation Guide

 Cedar City, United States - November 29, 2024 / Roto-Rooter Plumbing Cedar City /

 Cedar City is prone to some seriously cold weather, and that puts homeowners like you at a big risk of frozen pipes. Frozen water pipes are a big deal because if they burst, you’ll have a big mess and a costly repair bill on your hands.

Luckily, frozen pipes prevention doesn’t have to be difficult. Here’s how to protect pipes from freezing when temperatures drop in Cedar City.

How To Avoid Frozen Water Lines in Cedar CityTo prevent freezing, follow these Cedar City winter plumbing tips:

1. Call a plumber to inspect your water supply lines, especially your exposed pipes, before frigid weather arrives. Scheduling maintenance is certainly cheaper than paying an emergency plumber for leak repair or water damage restoration.
2. Trap heat in your home as best as you can. Install weatherstripping around doors and windows, and if you’ve got hard floors, put down area rugs. If you have a garage, shut the door and only open it when you absolutely need to.
3. Install pipe insulation to keep pipes from freezing, especially along exterior walls and in crawl spaces. Heat tape or an electric heating pad wrapped around pipes both work well.
4. Drain water from your water sprinkler lines and swimming pool supply lines to prevent additional frozen pipes.
5. Install outdoor hose bibs before freezing temperatures arrive in Cedar City.
6. Maintain a cold water drip for all of your faucets. Moving water is less likely to result in freezing.
7. Keep your cabinets open to allow warm air to circulate around pipes.
8. Run a portable space heater near your water pipes (as long as there are no flammable materials around, of course).
9. Don’t dump household chemicals down your drains. Some can increase the risk of ending up with a frozen pipe.
10. Keep the thermostat set to at least 55 degrees, even if you’re leaving on vacation for a while.
11. Install a hot water recirculating pump, which’ll keep your water temps above freezing.

What Should You Do if Your Pipes Freeze?If these tips to prevent pipes from freezing don’t do the trick, here’s how to thaw frozen pipes:

* Determine which pipes are frozen and how badly. If you spot bulges in your pipes, call a reliable plumber ASAP because those pipes could burst at any moment.
* Shut off the water supply right away to prevent pipe bursting.
* Turn on the faucets so the water has somewhere to go when the ice begins to melt.
* Warm up your frozen pipe with a hair dryer, space heater, or heating pad.
