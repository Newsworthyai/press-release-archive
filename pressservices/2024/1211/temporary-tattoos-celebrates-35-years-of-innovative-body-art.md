 Temporary Tattoos, the pioneering force in temporary body art, is proud to celebrate its 35th anniversary since its founding in 1989. Over the past three and a half decades, the company has revolutionized the temporary tattoo industry, leaving an indelible mark on millions of customers worldwide.

Since its inception, Temporary Tattoos has achieved remarkable milestones:

* Over 14 Billion Tattoos Made: Since 1989, Temporary Tattoos has produced an astounding 14 billion temporary tattoos, with production continuing to grow every day.
* Customer Satisfaction: Over 6,000 5-star reviews and more than 8,000 verified reviews
* Charitable Contributions: $924,685+ donated to children's charities

"We're thrilled to celebrate 35 years of bringing joy and creativity to people around the world," said Riana King, Head of Marketing at Temporary Tattoos. "Our success is a testament to the passion of our team and the loyalty of our customers."

Temporary Tattoos continues to innovate with its custom tattoo options, allowing individuals of all ages to create unique designs for special events or personal expression. The company's state-of-the-art printing technology ensures vibrant colors and intricate details in every temporary tattoo.

In response to growing demand for longer-lasting temporary body art, Temporary Tattoos has introduced INKFINITY™, a line of semi-permanent tattoos. These cutting-edge products last significantly longer than traditional temporary tattoos, up to 2 weeks, providing a perfect solution for those seeking a more enduring yet non-permanent body art experience.

As Temporary Tattoos looks to the future, the company remains committed to pushing the boundaries of temporary body art, developing new products, and continuing its legacy of quality and innovation.
