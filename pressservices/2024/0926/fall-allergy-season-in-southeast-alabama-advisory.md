As expert in allergy management, ENTCare is well-equipped to assist patients in Dothan and surrounding areas in dealing with the challenges of fall allergies.

The allergists at ENTCare have identified several key allergy triggers in the region, including ragweed pollen, mold spores, tree pollens, and dust from peanut harvesting. These triggers are expected to make this year's fall allergy season particularly difficult for allergy sufferers.
