# The Importance of Iron in Strengthening the Immune System During Cold Months

As the cold and flu season fast approaches, many of us start thinking about ways to boost our immune systems to better fight off seasonal bugs. While plenty of people turn to vitamin C, zinc, and other popular immune boosters, one nutrient that often flies under the radar is iron. Research has shown that iron plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy immune system, and keeping your iron levels balanced can make a significant difference in how your body handles infections.

Why Iron is Essential for Immune HealthIron is much more than just a nutrient that supports energy and red blood cell production - it also plays a pivotal role in immune function. A recent study conducted by the University of Florida highlights how iron helps immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes function optimally to fight off infections. Macrophages are immune cells responsible for “eating” bacteria and other harmful invaders, while lymphocytes are key players in creating antibodies to defend against viruses.

When iron levels are low, the body’s ability to mount an immune response is weakened. In fact, iron deficiency can compromise almost every aspect of your immune system, from the initial recognition of pathogens to the full-blown attack needed to eliminate them. This is particularly concerning during cold months when our immune systems are already under extra stress from exposure to cold weather, seasonal viruses, and reduced sunlight.

Iron and Gut Health: The Immune System’s First Line of DefenseOne of the lesser-known ways iron supports immunity is through its impact on gut health. The gut houses a significant portion of the body’s immune cells, making it one of the first lines of defense against illness. Iron helps maintain the integrity of the gut lining and supports the production of immune cells within the gastrointestinal tract, where a lot of immune activity begins.

Dr. Emily Pratt, a naturopathic physician from Kelowna, BC, explains, “Iron plays an important role in supporting the immune system, especially in the gut, by providing the building blocks for our immune cells.”

Why Iron is Especially Important During Cold and Flu SeasonIn colder months, our bodies are exposed to more stressors, and the immune system can become more vulnerable. Low iron levels are particularly common in certain populations, such as women of childbearing age, athletes, and individuals who follow plant-based diets. Iron deficiency can make it harder for your body to defend against infections, meaning that a seasonal cold or flu could take a heavier toll on your health.

By maintaining optimal iron levels, your immune system will be better equipped to handle the added challenges of cold and flu season. It’s worth noting that getting enough iron from diet alone can be difficult, especially if you have specific dietary restrictions or health conditions that make absorption challenging.

Ferosom: A Highly Absorbable Iron SupplementIron supplements can be an effective way to ensure you’re getting enough iron, but not all supplements are created equal. Ferosom, for example, offers a highly absorbable iron supplement designed to minimize common side effects such as constipation and nausea, often associated with iron tablets.

Ferosom uses a unique liposomal delivery system that ensures iron is absorbed directly into the intestines, bypassing the stomach for maximum efficacy. This means that you get all the immune-boosting benefits of iron without the discomfort. “This is why I encourage my patients to consistently take an iron supplement like Ferosom during cold and flu season,” continues Dr. Pratt.

Available in two convenient options - berry-flavored sachets or capsules - Ferosom caters to a variety of preferences. The sachets contain 21 mg of elemental iron plus vitamins C, D, B6, B12, and folic acid for added immune support, while the capsules offer 30 mg of elemental iron with vitamin C to enhance absorption.

Whether you’re looking to prevent iron deficiency or ensure your immune system is in top shape, Ferosom offers a reliable solution, especially during the cold months when maintaining immune resilience is key.

Iron's Critical Role in ImmunityWith research backing its importance, it's clear that iron plays an integral role in maintaining a robust immune system, especially during cold and flu season. Iron supports the production and function of immune cells, and while iron-rich foods like red meat, spinach, lentils, and fortified cereals can help, food alone might not always be enough to meet our needs during colder months. This is especially true for those with increased demands or dietary restrictions. Taking an iron supplement, can help bridge that gap, ensuring our bodies have the resources to stay resilient when it matters most.
