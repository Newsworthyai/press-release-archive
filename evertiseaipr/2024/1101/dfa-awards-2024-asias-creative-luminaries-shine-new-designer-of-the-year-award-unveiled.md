 DFA Lifetime Achievement Award 2024 (DFA LAA)

 Kengo Kuma, a world-renowned architect, has made an indelible impact in the field of architecture by redefining the relationship between nature, technology, and humanity. Since the founding of Kengo Kuma & Associates in 1990, Kuma has brought his vision of blending architecture and its environment seamlessly to life. Kuma’s design philosophy, which prioritises natural materials and human-scaled spaces, can be seen in some of the world’s most iconic structures.

 He is an Honorary Professor at the University of Tokyo, and taught at prestigious institutions like Keio University. Kuma continues to share his knowledge with future generations of architects. His philosophy integrates traditional Japanese aesthetics with cutting-edge technology, creating architecture that is both grounded and forward-thinking.

 Kuma’s influential body of work includes notable publications such as “Onomatopoeia Architecture Grounding”, “Natural Architecture”, and “Small Architecture”.

 The DFA Lifetime Achievement Award 2024 celebrates Kengo Kuma’s pioneering vision and his profound contributions to the world of spatial design. His talent for blending natural materials with modern design principles offers a new perspective on how we engage with our surroundings, fostering a deeper connection between people and the environment.

 DFA Design Leadership Award 2024 (DFA DLA)

 Kikuo Ibe, known as the “Father of G-SHOCK”, successfully developed and commercialised G-SHOCK in 1981, has revolutionised the watch industry with his groundbreaking creation of G-SHOCK, a shock-resistant watch that has become an icon of durability and style that would withstand impacts and continue to function perfectly even if dropped.

 Ibe’s relentless pursuit of durability did not stop there. In 1994, he initiated the creation of a full metal G-SHOCK, the MR-G model, which was released later. His creativity continued to push boundaries, leading to the launch of the DREAM PROJECT in 2016, which culminated in the creation of the 18K-GOLD G-SHOCK in 2018 to celebrate its 35th anniversary of the G-SHOCK line. The limited run of 35 units were sold out by reservation. Now more than 1,000 CASIO shops around the world sell G-SHOCK products, and G-SHOCK has sold a total of 100 million pieces worldwide, which registered as an important historical resource for science and technology, further acknowledging his contributions to global cultural development.

 The DFA Design Leadership Award 2024 celebrates Kikuo Ibe’s extraordinary contributions to the design world, recognising his relentless pursuit of innovation, resilience, and his lasting impact on global trend and product design.
