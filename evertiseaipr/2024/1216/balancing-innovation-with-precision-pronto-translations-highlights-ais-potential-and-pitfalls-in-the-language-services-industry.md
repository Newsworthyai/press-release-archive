# Balancing Innovation with Precision: Pronto Translations Highlights AI’s Potential and Pitfalls in the Language Services Industry

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), translation and interpretation are seeing unprecedented advancements. With the release of IBM’s survey, “AI in Action,” global AI leaders highlight AI’s potential across industries, including translation and localization. Yet, as AI automates and accelerates language processing, there remain gaps that can only be filled by skilled human linguists. Pronto Translations, a New York-based translation agency, recently detailed these limitations in their article, “Pronto Translations Exposes AI Flaws,” underscoring AI’s pitfalls and why professional linguists are crucial for maintaining translation quality and cultural sensitivity.

 The Promise of AI in Translation

 AI offers considerable benefits in translation, including speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. AI-driven tools can process and translate vast amounts of text instantly, which is particularly beneficial for time-sensitive applications like e-commerce or customer service. IBM’s report highlights that top AI leaders prioritize solutions with high-impact potential, such as virtual assistants and document processing, where AI can accelerate routine translation tasks. By automating standard translations, organizations can allocate more complex projects to human translators, ensuring a hybrid approach that combines the efficiency of AI with the precision of linguistic expertise.

 According to the survey, more than 66% of AI leaders have seen at least a 25% increase in revenue growth due to AI integration. Shobhit Varshney, VP and Senior Partner at IBM Consulting, advises that AI’s success lies in identifying high-value applications rather than pursuing quick wins. This insight is especially relevant in translation, where AI’s strengths can be leveraged for repetitive tasks, while human oversight addresses nuanced content.

 The Risks and Limitations of AI in Translation

 Pronto Translations’ recent article highlights 17 significant AI pitfalls that organizations should consider when automating language services. While AI has advanced, these flaws reveal the risks of relying on AI alone for precise, culturally attuned translations.

 1. Mistranslation: AI often misinterprets terms with multiple meanings. For example, AI may confuse “nuts” used in car assembly with edible nuts, or “washer” as a laundry appliance rather than a mechanical part. In technical translations, these errors could have costly or even hazardous consequences.

 1. Fabrication of Information: AI occasionally generates “hallucinated” content when dealing with obscure terms. If data on a subject is limited, AI might invent plausible-sounding but inaccurate translations, creating unreliable or misleading information in fields where accuracy is essential, like legal or medical documents.

 1. Difficulty with Proper Names: AI struggles with company and individual names, especially across languages with different alphabets. For example, Western companies adapting their brand names for Chinese audiences often choose culturally favorable names. AI might overlook these nuances, leading to awkward or misleading translations.

 1. Failure to Identify Errors in the Original Text: AI may fail to detect and correct evident errors in the source material. Human translators often identify and flag these issues, but AI might propagate mistakes, compromising the translated document’s integrity.

 1. Overuse of Modern Jargon: AI may default to trendy terminology, leading to repetitive phrases like “pivotal” or “foundational.” For technology-related content, AI frequently uses “innovative,” resulting in monotony. A human translator would use varied language, enhancing readability and engagement.

 1. Omission of Content in Long Documents: With lengthy texts, AI may omit significant details, particularly toward the document’s end. This is particularly concerning for legal documents where overlooked terms can alter the meaning and legal standing of the entire document.

 1. Overly Literal Translations: In its attempt for accuracy, AI sometimes produces overly literal translations, losing idiomatic meaning. For instance, translating “break a leg” literally might create confusion in other languages rather than conveying its actual meaning of good luck.

 1. Difficulty with Ambiguity in Source Texts: AI struggles with ambiguous terms lacking context. For example, “the bank” may refer to a financial institution or a riverbank, leading to potential misinterpretations in the translation.

 1. Introduction of Extraneous Content: AI may “hallucinate” content based on its training, introducing unrelated material. In one case, Pronto Translations found an AI-generated translation of an article about a Nigerian artist in Italy that included irrelevant details about other Nigerian artists, deviating from the original text.

 1. Misinterpretation of Cultural and Contextual Subtleties: AI can miss cultural nuances. For example, “abrazos” in Spanish business communication is a friendly closing, often translated incorrectly as “hugs,” which is informal and unprofessional in English.

 1. Tone Mismatches: AI may misalign the tone with the intended audience. Formal languages like Korean or Japanese have distinct levels of politeness. Incorrect tone can seem overly casual or too formal, impacting the message’s reception.

 1. Exaggeration of Style: In replicating a marketing tone, AI may overdo it, leading to translations that feel exaggerated. A concise slogan like “Just do it” might become overly complex and lose impact, especially in cultures favoring brevity in advertising.

 1. Misreading of Mood: AI often misses emotional undertones in the original text, affecting how readers perceive the message. For expressive writing, where mood is essential, these misinterpretations can alter the intended impact.

 1. Singular vs. Plural Misinterpretation: Some languages use the same form for singular and plural. AI may misinterpret these, affecting clarity, particularly in contexts requiring precise detail.

 1. Inconsistent Terminology: Legal translations require consistency, yet AI may use different terms for the same concept, such as “owner” versus “landlord.” Conversely, press releases benefit from varied language, which AI may struggle to achieve, resulting in redundancy.

 1. Preference for Clichés: Even when handling polished content, AI often introduces overused phrases, stripping originality from the translation. This is especially noticeable in creative fields where nuance is valued.

 1. Challenges with Cultural Classification: AI may misclassify concepts based on cultural differences. For instance, Western countries generally do not classify nuclear energy as renewable, unlike China, where it is viewed as sustainable. This cultural variance can lead to misunderstandings.

 Striking a Balance: The Importance of Professional Linguists

 While AI brings speed and scale to translation, Pronto Translations advocates a balanced approach where human linguists play a critical role. In IBM’s survey, 84% of AI leaders emphasize the importance of collaborating with experts to mitigate risks and ensure quality. Dr. Stephan Bloehdorn, IBM’s AI and Automation Practice Leader, advises, “AI should be customized, not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution.” Translating complex content requires the cultural awareness and contextual knowledge only human translators provide.

 Cathy Reese, Senior Partner at IBM, underscores the need for ongoing improvement: “AI can yield dividends, but only if you experiment, make adjustments, and continue advancing.” In translation, this means combining AI’s strengths with human expertise for culturally nuanced and accurate content.

 The Future of AI in Translation: A Hybrid Approach

 As AI matures, it will increasingly serve as a tool for high-efficiency translation tasks. Yet, for specialized content—such as legal documents, brand messages, or culturally sensitive material—the expertise of human translators remains essential. AI can streamline translation, but the human touch ensures quality, cultural appropriateness, and the flexibility to adapt to unique language demands.

 By embracing a hybrid approach, businesses can capitalize on AI’s efficiencies while mitigating risks. With professional translators involved, organizations can deliver precise, culturally aware translations that strengthen their brand and maintain trust with global audiences.
