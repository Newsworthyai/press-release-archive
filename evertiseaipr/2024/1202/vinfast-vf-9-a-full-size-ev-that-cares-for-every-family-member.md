# VinFast VF 9: A Full-Size EV That Cares For Every Family Member

The VinFast VF 9 is a fully electric, seven-seater SUV designed to redefine the full-size segment in the U.S. With its luxurious design, spacious interior, robust performance, and emphasis on sustainability, the VF 9 captures VinFast’s philosophy of innovation and care.

 As demand for large SUVs continues to dominate the global automotive landscape—accounting for nearly half of car sales in 2023—an interesting paradox emerges. Consumers increasingly seek the spaciousness and versatility of bigger vehicles, yet concerns about greenhouse gas emissions remain pressing. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising solution, but the market for full-size electric SUVs is still relatively underserved. VinFast, a Nasdaq-listed company, aims to bridge this gap with the VF 9, now available in North America.

 Combining luxury, comfort, and a strong focus on sustainability, the VF 9 is more than just a car—it’s a vehicle designed with care, blending cutting-edge innovation with a human touch. At a recent auto show in Los Angeles, one early tester summed up the VF 9 experience perfectly: “It was surprisingly comfortable, spacious, and, even for its size, very responsive. We were just very surprised by the massage feature—I’ve never experienced it.”

 Premium Presence Through Innovation and Design

 Design, for the VF 9, begins with a clear philosophy: blend grandeur and elegance. Created by Pininfarina, the renowned design studio, the SUV features a striking LED light strip, effortlessly combining the boldness of American automotive styling with European finesse. This isn’t merely a car that demands attention; it earns admiration. Every angle of the VF 9 conveys strength and purpose, making it instantly recognizable.

 Step inside, and the opulence is unmistakable. Plush premium vegan leather upholstery graces every touchpoint, while soft-close doors hint at a thoughtful approach to detail. The three-row configuration offers flexible options for six or seven passengers, ensuring that even long journeys are comfortable. Captain seats in the second row are equipped with integrated massage and ventilation features—a rarity in the segment. Imagine a family road trip where parents can enjoy a soothing massage while children nap peacefully, cradled by the soft premium vegan leather seats. This is the essence of the VF 9: a space where every passenger, regardless of age, feels at home.  Available third row seating and second row captains chairs or three passenger bench allow multiple configuration options to meet your family or cargo loading needs.

 Beyond comfort, practicality shines. Ample storage solutions accommodate luggage for extended adventures, while an impressive head-up display (HUD) projects vital information—speed, navigation, and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) alerts—directly onto the windshield. This feature ensures drivers remain focused on the road ahead, combining safety and convenience in equal measure.

 For America, the VF 9’s message is clear: it’s possible to invest in a vehicle that reflects your values. With its spacious design, advanced features, and eco-conscious credentials, the VF 9 aligns perfectly with the aspirations of families and individuals seeking to reduce their environmental footprint. This alignment is further amplified by the lower operating costs associated with EVs, a compelling incentive for budget-conscious drivers who also want premium quality.

 Services For Customer Peace of Mind

 VinFast’s commitment to its customers doesn’t end at the point of sale; it extends into ownership with a suite of warranty coverage and after-sales policies that redefine care. “Our adaptive enhancements, sales offer, and industry-leading 10-year warranty make owning a VinFast electric car a more practical and accessible option for those seeking good value solutions,” said VinFast Chairwoman Le Thi Thu Thuy in a recent earning call.

 The VF 9 comes with an industry-leading warranty: 10 years or 125,000 miles, whichever comes first, and an unlimited-mileage battery warranty for the same duration. This assurance offers peace of mind to drivers navigating diverse terrains and weather conditions.

 Charging infrastructure is another area where the VF 9 excels. Compatible with Tesla’s extensive network and manageable through a single app, the vehicle simplifies the charging process. Coupled with roadside assistance and mobile repair services, the VF 9 ensures that drivers are supported every step of the way. Should manufacturing defects arise, VinFast’s policy of goodwill compensation underscores its philosophy of prioritizing customer trust.

 Such offerings symbolize one of the most important value for VinFast: Exceptional after-sale policy. By eliminating barriers to EV adoption, from infrastructure concerns to maintenance worries, the VF 9 invites drivers into an ownership experience that is as seamless as it is rewarding.

 It’s this unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction that has propelled VinFast to new heights. In its home market of Vietnam, the automaker has emerged as the leading automotive brand, surpassing all foreign and gasoline-powered competitors to become the first domestic EV manufacturer to achieve this milestone—an impressive feat accomplished in just over five years since market entry.

 Internationally, VinFast’s strategic focus on expanding its dealership network is delivering tangible results. September marked a record-breaking month for the company in North America, driven by its growing dealer presence and ongoing enhancements to its electric vehicle lineup.

 Against this backdrop, the VF 9’s introduction to the U.S. represents more than just a response to shifting market trends or consumer demands. It embodies VinFast’s “love & care” philosophy—a principle that informs every facet of its operations, from innovative vehicle design to exceptional customer service—solidifying its reputation as a forward-thinking, customer-focused EV manufacturer.
