# Pronto Translations Unveils AI’s Dual Impact on Language Services: Advancements and Risks in Automated Translation

New York, Nov 25, 2024, In the rapidly evolving field of AI-driven solutions, translation and interpretation stand at a crossroads. IBM’s recent survey of global AI leaders, “AI in Action,” underscores the groundbreaking potential of artificial intelligence across multiple industries, including translation and localization. With 2,000 organizations surveyed worldwide, the report sheds light on AI’s strengths, as well as the gaps that remain. As businesses look to AI for efficiency, particularly in translation, experts warn that while the technology offers powerful tools, a balanced approach that includes skilled human linguists is essential for accuracy and cultural nuance.

 The Potential of AI in Translation and Interpretation

 AI’s capabilities in translation have advanced significantly in recent years. The automation of language services can enable companies to scale operations, translating massive amounts of content in seconds—ideal for scenarios requiring real-time updates, such as e-commerce, customer support, or news dissemination. IBM’s survey highlights four primary AI applications favored by top-performing companies, including virtual assistants and customer experience, both of which are critical to the translation industry. AI-driven chatbots, for instance, allow for rapid multilingual customer support, while AI in document processing speeds up translations of legal or technical materials, bringing efficiency gains.

 More than 66% of the AI leaders surveyed report that their AI solutions have led to at least a 25% improvement in revenue growth. Shobhit Varshney, VP and Senior Partner of IBM Consulting, emphasizes the importance of selecting AI use cases based on substantial impact. “It’s tempting to start an AI journey with what’s quickest to implement,” he notes, “but leaders uncover big opportunities that are going to move the needle.” This statement resonates with translation professionals, where high-impact automation in repetitive tasks can offload mundane work, freeing up time for linguists to focus on high-value projects that require specialized expertise and contextual understanding.

 Navigating the Risks: The Flaws of AI in Translation

 Despite the promises of AI, Pronto Translations, a New York-based translation agency, highlights serious pitfalls in AI-driven translation that should give organizations pause before fully automating their language needs. The agency’s latest report, “Pronto Translations Exposes AI Flaws,” lists several risks and common AI pitfalls.

 1. Mistranslation: AI sometimes misinterprets words with multiple meanings or context-specific nuances. In a recent example, an AI system confused “nuts” used in car assembly with edible nuts in a car maintenance manual. For technical and specialized content, mistranslations like these can lead to costly errors and confusion.

 1. Fabrication of Information: AI tools, including ChatGPT, sometimes generate information that isn’t accurate, especially with obscure or specialized terms. In technical translations, this tendency to “hallucinate” can result in imprecise and misleading translations, undermining the reliability of critical documents.

 1. Inability to Recognize Proper Names: AI often needs help with names, company titles, and brand names, particularly when translating across languages with distinct alphabets, such as Chinese and English. Translating these inaccurately in business contexts, such as a press release, could risk reputational damage and erode client trust.

 1. Omission of Content in Long Documents: Lengthy texts, such as contracts and legal documents, can suffer from significant omissions if handled by AI alone. Critical terms or conditions can be accidentally left out, altering the document’s intended meaning and legal implications.

 1. Overly Literal Translations: While striving for exactitude, AI often defaults to word-for-word translations that miss idiomatic expressions and cultural subtleties, such as translating “break a leg” literally, rather than as a good-luck wish.

 1. Cultural Nuance and Tone Misalignment: AI can overlook cultural subtleties, producing translations that, while technically accurate, fail to convey the intended tone. For example, “hugs” as a closing sentiment in Spanish business communication would sound overly casual or inappropriate in English business correspondence.

 Achieving a Balanced Approach in Translation

 AI-driven translation has its advantages, but professional human translators provide irreplaceable benefits, including cultural sensitivity, contextual awareness, and the ability to customize translations for specific audiences. IBM’s report emphasizes that top AI leaders are committed to continuous improvement and flexibility in their AI approaches, adopting hybrid models that blend AI efficiency with human expertise. According to IBM, 84% of these leaders partner with specialized service providers to support and guide their AI journey, ensuring they’re addressing risks such as data security and regulatory compliance.

 Dr. Stephan Bloehdorn, AI and Automation Practice Leader at IBM, highlights the value of a custom approach over a “one-size-fits-all” mentality: “A learner will typically copy predefined scenarios using out-of-the-box technologies. But a leader develops custom innovations.” By tailoring AI models and engaging human translators, organizations can ensure that their translated content remains true to both the intent and nuances of the original message.

 The Future of AI in Translation

 As AI continues to mature, its role in translation will likely expand, particularly in areas where speed and scale are paramount. However, for high-stakes content such as legal documents, brand messaging, or culturally sensitive materials, the need for professional human translators remains vital. Cathy Reese, Senior Partner for Data & Technology Transformation at IBM, asserts, “AI is a discipline that can generate dividends in perpetuity… but for this, you need the appetite to experiment, to get things wrong, to make them right, and to always keep moving forward.” In translation, as in other industries, AI is a powerful tool that, when used judiciously, can augment human expertise rather than replace it.

 For now, organizations are advised to harness the strengths of AI in translation while keeping human linguists involved for quality assurance, context, and nuance. Embracing this balanced approach will enable companies to capitalize on AI’s potential while mitigating risks, paving the way for a future where technology and human expertise work hand in hand to deliver precise, culturally aware, and impactful translations.
