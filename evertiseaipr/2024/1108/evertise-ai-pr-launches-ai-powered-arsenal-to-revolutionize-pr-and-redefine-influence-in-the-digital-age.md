# Evertise AI PR Launches AI-Powered Arsenal to Revolutionize PR and Redefine Influence in the Digital Age

Dallas, TX – [November 7, 2024] – Evertise AI PR is shaking up the PR world. Led by a team of ambitious innovators, Evertise is rolling out a bold, AI-powered product roadmap that will fundamentally rewire how PR is done. This isn’t your grandfather’s PR playbook. Building on the success of its ChatGPT-powered PR Creation Application, Evertise is incubating three groundbreaking products – EverReach, EverInsight, and EverCreate – each designed to harness the full potential of AI to supercharge reach, deliver razor-sharp insights, and redefine content creation for the digital-first world.

 Reflecting on Evertise’s mission to change the game, Shawn Hameed, Head of Products and AI, said, “Press releases have been foundational to media strategies for B2B and B2C corporations alike. But let’s face it – the press release channel is stuck in the past. It hasn’t evolved since the days of print newspapers. At Evertise AI PR, we’re here to change that by taking press release creation, distribution, and analytics into the future. With this launch, we’re developing AI products that don’t just push the envelope – they blow the doors off the industry.”

 EverReach is where AI meets audience. This isn’t about simply casting a wider net – EverReach is engineered to put your message where it matters, across Google Ads, Google SEM, LinkedIn, X, Instagram, and Facebook. Evertise’s proprietary algorithms go beyond the ordinary, allowing brands to hit high-value audiences at the right place and the right time. “EverReach is PR reimagined. It’s not about eyeballs; it’s about attention that counts,” says Gulfam Shabbir, CEO of Evertise. “In today’s digital clutter, EverReach gives brands the power with clarity to stand out and be heard.”

 EverInsight takes data-driven decisions to a whole new level. Imagine a BI and insights tool that doesn’t just feed you data – it gets inside your competitors’ heads. With real-time analytics and fully customizable dashboards, EverInsight offers an unmatched perspective on the competitive landscape, making it an essential ally for brands looking to play offense. “EverInsight isn’t a tool; it’s a game plan. It’s where PR strategy and data collide in real time, turning information into inspiration,” Gulfam explains.

 EverCreate brings AI-powered content creation to a new frontier. Forget cookie-cutter copy. Built on powerful LLM technology, EverCreate generates PR content with real depth and precision, tailored to resonate with specific audiences across regions and industries. By leveraging natural language processing and sentiment analysis, EverCreate refines your message to make the kind of impact that resonates long after it’s read. For PR professionals aiming to reach their audiences on a human level, EverCreate is the answer.

 Future Plans

 This product roadmap is just the start. Evertise AI PR is on a relentless quest to redefine PR for the digital age, continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with EverReach, EverInsight, and EverCreate. Watch this space – we’re just getting started.
