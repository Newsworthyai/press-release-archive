 Convergence and Innovation: Building A New Platform for International Collaboration

 As an international, academic, and non-profit social organization, the establishment of the WAYS represents the birth of a new network for scientific collaboration. Focused on uniting the collective strength of young scientists worldwide, WAYS is guided by the core principle of “science and technology for good.” It is committed to providing innovative support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and actively promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. Through cross-disciplinary and cross-regional collaboration, WAYS fosters knowledge exchange and cultural understanding among young scientists, explores the potential applications of science in addressing global issues, and amplifies the voice of youth, contributing their wisdom in driving sustainable development through scientific and technological innovation.

 Chunbo Gao emphasized that WAYS will build a diverse research community that brings together young scientists from different countries and backgrounds, thereby fostering innovative thinking to address global challenges. At the same time, it will actively promote the sharing of research resources, knowledge, and technology, enabling young scientists from various nations to collaborate more easily. The presence of WAYS will not only contribute to tackling major global issues but also nurture a new generation of internationally-minded research leaders, making significant contributions to global scientific and technological progress.

 Collaboration and Interdisciplinarity: Connecting Young Scientists Worldwide

 WAYS operates through several key initiatives: actively engaging with the WYSS to foster collaboration and communication among young scientists from various countries, while building a global platform for exchange and cooperation; supporting young scientists in achieving breakthroughs to promote sustainable development through technological innovations; advancing sustainable development by initiating activities focused on science communication and public engagement; and launching collaborative efforts with relevant scientific and technological organizations. By attracting and inspiring young scientists from around the globe, WAYS enhances cross-cultural communication and encourages the active and meaningful participation of young scientists in global science and technology governance.

 Chaoyang Lu stated that the establishment of WAYS is an effective means of uniting young scientific talents. Building on the foundation of WYSS, WAYS can attract more high-level talent, gather the collective wisdom of young scientists, and contribute to scientific and technological innovation that advances sustainable development. At the same time, it represents a pragmatic effort to consolidate a shared commitment to “Technology for Good.” Responding to the aspirations of young scientists, the establishment of WAYS will help unite a cohort of young scientific leaders who are friendly toward China, harness the innovative energy of youth, and provide youth-driven solutions to enhance human well-being.
