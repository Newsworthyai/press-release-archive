# VinFast Amplifies EV Benefits with Strong Warranties and Aftersales

Los Angeles, 21st December – As electric vehicles (EVs) steadily gain ground, new discoveries are challenging past assumptions about their battery lifespan. But to ensure customers feel more confident in their EV purchase, VinFast is backing up its offering with a 10-year warranty and comprehensive aftersales support.

 When people think of electric vehicles (EVs), they often focus on their most visible advantages: silent operation, zero emissions, and the thrill of instant acceleration. With new studies emerging, however, there’s another equally compelling benefit to consider: longevity.

 

 Recent research reveals that EV batteries can last up to 38% longer than initially projected, achieving an additional lifespan of approximately 195,000 miles. This translates to potentially extending the driving range of an EV by 14 years on top of the current estimates, considering the average American drives about 14,000 miles per year. This surprising resilience challenges outdated perceptions of EV batteries as fragile or short-lived.

 Yet longevity alone is not enough to inspire trust. For car buyers, the critical question remains: how long is the manufacturer willing to stand behind its product?

 In the traditional auto market, warranties for gas-powered vehicles are typically limited to 3 years/36,000 miles for bumper-to-bumper coverage, with powertrain warranties extending to 5 years/60,000 miles. While these limits have served internal combustion vehicles adequately, they fail to address the unique needs of EVs, whose battery requires far greater protection. To meet this need, federal regulations in the U.S. now mandate a minimum battery warranty of 8 years/100,000 miles.

 Still, some automakers are going above and beyond to build trust in their technology. Among them, VinFast has distinguished itself with an industry-leading 10-year/125,000 mile vehicle warranty, 10-year/unlimited mileage battery warranty—a commitment that reflects confidence in its vehicles’ durability.

 For many customers, this makes all the difference. “The 10-year warranty helped a lot,” explained Mr. Benoit Naud, a VinFast VF 8 owner. Similarly, Mr. Dien Do, another retired VF 8 owner, noted “the 10-year warranty definitely made it an easy decision to pick up the VF8.”

 Now, as it steadily gains trust, VinFast has recently started delivering the flagship 3-row, 7-seater VF 9 in North America. With its market-leading vehicle and battery warranties and an attractive offer for the first 100 delivered vehicles, the model is poised to win over customers.

 Why Warranties Alone Aren’t Enough

 While a robust warranty is a strong foundation for trust, modern EV ownership demands much more. Customers today expect a hassle-free, seamless ownership experience—one that includes comprehensive, responsive, and convenient aftersales support. The numbers underscore its importance: according to Forbes, 83% of customers are willing to switch brands after a single bad service experience, and 79% say they would leave for a company offering better customer care.

 VinFast, understanding these shifting expectations, has taken significant strides to elevate the EV ownership experience. Its standout initiatives focus on convenience, ensuring customers feel supported well beyond the point of purchase.

 Among these offerings is VinFast’s mobile service program, which eliminates the need for customers to visit a service center for minor repairs. Instead, VinFast technicians bring the service directly to customers’ homes or workplaces.

 For Ms. Natalie Tung, a VF 8 owner from California, this service made all the difference. “[My technician] was willing to drop off the car seat I left behind at my house—even though it was my fault,” she shared. “Many times, technicians are willing to meet customers at the workplace for ease of picking up a car for service and dropping off loaners.”

 Complementing this is VinFast’s 24/7 Emergency Roadside Assistance, which ensures drivers are never left stranded. Whether it’s an unexpected breakdown or a minor hiccup, customers can count on timely help, day or night. Mr. Do also praised the program, saying, “Both roadside assistance and at-home repairs were excellent and fast.”

 The convenience extends to VinFast’s smart app, which centralizes essential ownership tools. With access to over 140,000 charging stations across North America, the app allows customers to plan and manage their trips effortlessly. It also provides real-time updates on charging, maintenance, and payments—all in one streamlined interface.

 Meeting Challenges Head-On Of course, no company is without challenges, and the EV market is particularly demanding. As VinFast rapidly scales its operations, its service infrastructure must keep pace with growing demand, a challenge shared by many other EV manufacturers.

 VinFast customers, while aware of these growing pains, recognize them as part of the journey for a young and ambitious company. “VinFast service is still the best compared to many other brands I have experienced in the past,” said Mr. Kevin Pham, another VinFast VF 8 owner.

 What sets VinFast apart is its clear focus on continuous improvement. By combining industry-leading warranties with evolving aftersales services, the brand is steadily earning the trust of its growing customer base, demonstrating a clear understanding of what modern EV buyers value most: peace of mind, convenience, and reliability./.
