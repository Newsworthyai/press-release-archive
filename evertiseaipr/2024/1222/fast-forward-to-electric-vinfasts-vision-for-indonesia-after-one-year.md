# Fast-Forward to Electric: VinFast’s Vision for Indonesia After One Year

Hanoi, 21st December – VinFast has achieved a significant milestone in Vietnam, facilitating the transition of tens of thousands of individuals to electric vehicles and thereby making a substantial contribution to the development of a green transportation sector and the preservation of the environment—an impact comparable to the positive effects of planting millions of trees. Despite being a recent entrant to the Indonesian electric vehicle market, VinFast is already articulating a compelling vision of an electrified future that closely aligns with the nation’s overarching Net-Zero objectives.

 

 The Future of Electric Driving: Experience the VinFast VF e34

 Following VinFast’s launch in Vietnam, automotive expert Tran Huy Dong lauded the VF e34 as a “groundbreaking technological achievement.” As the first electric vehicle designed and manufactured in Vietnam, the VF e34 represents a significant milestone for the region’s automotive industry. This model also serves as VinFast’s inaugural offering in the Indonesian market.

 

 Mr. Dong further elaborated on a range of features that differentiate the VF e34 from gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles within its price segment, including adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, pet mode, account management and synchronization, automatic emergency call and roadside assistance, and intrusion alert.

 The VF e34’s intelligent technology has garnered praise from experts for its adherence to international standards. The vehicle’s intuitive design and user-friendly features contribute to an enhanced driving experience, positioning it as a compelling option for Indonesian drivers.

 As described by veteran Silicon Valley expert Bui Trong Hieu, the VF e34 represents a “truly serious technology product.” With the VF e34, VinFast has made a significant entry into the electric vehicle market, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and forward-thinking design.

 The vehicle’s advanced intelligent features align with the strategies employed by leading electric car manufacturers, offering consumers a compelling and technologically advanced alternative to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles.

 However, a key differentiator for VinFast lies in the VF e34’s inclusive pricing strategy, with prices starting at IDR 408,200,000 (with battery) and IDR 314,000,000 (with battery subscription), thereby enhancing its market accessibility.

 With the introduction of the VF e34, a C-segment electric SUV, VinFast has broadened the accessibility of electric vehicles to a wider consumer base. This strategic initiative positions the company for further expansion into diverse market segments as the VF e34 gains market traction and builds consumer trust. Renowned for its commitment to customer satisfaction, VinFast’s entry into the Indonesian market is characterized by a comprehensive suite of customer-centric initiatives.

 Beyond its inclusive pricing strategy and commitment to exceptional product quality, VinFast provides comprehensive warranty coverage that surpasses industry standards. Specifically, the VF e34 is offered with a 10-year vehicle warranty.

 For customers opting for the battery subscription program, VinFast provides complimentary battery maintenance and replacement services in the event that the battery’s usable capacity falls below 70%.

 Furthermore, in a demonstration of its dedication to providing value to its customers, VinFast offers a unique 73% resale value guarantee for up to a period of three years in the Indonesian market.

 The Green Road to Electric Mobility: From Vietnam to Indonesia

 While BloombergNEF’s 2024 Outlook for Southeast Asia Electric Vehicles forecasts substantial EV sales growth over the next two decades, capitalizing on this opportunity presents a significant challenge. Automakers must demonstrate a long-term commitment to supporting consumers through the transition to electric vehicles, but the potential rewards for leading this market shift are considerable.

 VinFast’s approach in Indonesia is multifaceted, offering a range of affordable urban EVs to suit various budgets. This strategy combines premium products, inclusive pricing, and strong after-sales service, further enhanced by Indonesia-specific initiatives such as battery subscription and resale price guarantees.

 However, Pham Nhat Vuong’s entrepreneurial endeavors extend beyond vehicle manufacturing. GSM, a ride-hailing service powered by electric vehicles, offers consumers a convenient and sustainable transportation solution.

 The GSM ride-hailing service provides consumers with a convenient opportunity to experience VinFast’s modern and intelligent electric vehicles firsthand, thereby enhancing brand and product recognition within the market.

 Furthermore, V-GREEN, a subsidiary founded by Mr. Pham Nhat Vuong, will complete the final component of VinFast’s green transportation ecosystem in Indonesia.

 Reflecting on VinFast’s achievements in Vietnam, it is evident that facilitating widespread adoption of electric vehicles extends beyond the provision of a diverse, intelligent, and engaging product portfolio. A critical component of this endeavor is ensuring a smooth, convenient, and seamless transition to electric mobility for consumers.

 This transformative process hinges on the development of a robust and readily accessible charging station infrastructure.

 V-GREEN is paving the way for VinFast to replicate its approach in transforming transportation in Indonesia. By facilitating the development of a robust EV ecosystem, V-GREEN is enabling VinFast to significantly boost the market and contribute to the nation’s electrification goals.

 A major expansion of Indonesia’s EV charging infrastructure is planned: V-GREEN and the multi-industry corporation Prime Group (UAE) will collaborate to develop approximately 100,000 VinFast charging stations nationwide within three years, representing a potential investment of up to $1.2 billion. The initial phase targets key urban centers like Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bali, with expansion to other regions to follow.

 Construction and development activities are slated to commence in January 2025, with the expectation that a number of charging stations will become operational later that year.

 V-GREEN will proactively conduct market research to identify strategic locations for the establishment and operation of a comprehensive network of charging stations, thereby addressing the evolving needs of electric vehicle users in Indonesia.

 With its extensive operations in the Middle East and Africa and a strong global network of partners, Prime Group will provide the financial backing for VinFast’s EV charging station development.

 This MoU is a powerful testament to the confidence that leading international enterprises have placed in the thriving green transportation ecosystem created by V-GREEN and VinFast. It also marks a significant achievement for V-GREEN, cementing its role as a key strategic partner in the global expansion of VinFast’s EV charging network, especially within the highly promising Indonesian market.

 This partnership underscores VinFast’s dedication to driving a green revolution in Indonesia and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future for the nation
