# VinFast Joins Others in Offering Long Warranties—But Raises the Bar Higher

VinFast is reshaping the EV landscape with its extended warranties and comprehensive after-sales support. By offering industry-leading coverage and innovative services, VinFast is building trust and driving EV adoption.

 Just a few years ago, car warranties typically adhered to a modest standard of three years or 36,000 miles. As the global automotive industry undergoes transformative changes, driven by the accelerating shift toward electrification, this long-standing norm is being redefined. New entrants like VinFast, a Nasdaq-listed electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, are taking the lead in reshaping consumer expectations, particularly in after-sales services. Through comprehensive warranty offerings, 24/7 roadside assistance, and innovative app-based solutions, VinFast is setting new benchmarks in customer satisfaction while clearing obstacles for EV adoption.

 Why Long Warranties Are the Future

 Historically, automotive warranties were modest and cautious. In the early days of mass-produced cars, manufacturers offered only a few months of coverage, reflecting both the experimental nature of the technology and limited consumer protections. By the 2010s, warranties had evolved into the familiar standard of three years or 36,000 miles.However, as vehicles became more reliable, automakers began extending coverage to signal greater confidence in product quality.

 For EVs, which represent a paradigm shift in vehicle design and operation, extended warranties are not just a perk—they’re essential. Concerns over battery longevity, maintenance costs, and emerging technologies create barriers to adoption. Extended warranties alleviate these fears, promising years of trouble-free ownership.

 VinFast has taken this trend to new heights with its 10-year/125,000-mile warranty, paired with unlimited mileage coverage for batteries. This unparalleled offering demonstrates a deep commitment to quality and reliability while directly addressing consumer fears about battery degradation. The importance of such reassurances is evident from customer feedback. Dien Do, a retired VinFast VF 8 owner, shares, “The 10-year warranty gave me peace of mind,” while data analyst Natalie Tung calls it an “easy decision” to invest in an EV with such robust guarantees.

 

 Extended warranties are also a strategic move. Like an insurance policy, they provide long-term security, safeguarding owners against unexpected repair costs while fostering brand loyalty. By removing significant barriers to entry for first-time EV buyers, VinFast is building lasting relationships with its customers.

 After-Sales Support: The Ultimate Differentiator

 While extended warranties offer critical peace of mind, they represent just the foundation of an exceptional customer experience. In today’s highly competitive automotive market, the real differentiator is comprehensive after-sales support. Studies have shown that after-sales services are vital in building brand credibility and customer loyalty, significantly influencing purchase decisions.

 Recognizing this, VinFast has strategically developed a robust after-sales ecosystem designed to exceed customer expectations. This begins with convenience: VinFast’s mobile service options allow technicians to perform maintenance and minor repairs directly at the customer’s location. For busy professionals and families, this is a game-changer, eliminating the need for time-consuming trips to service centers.

 VinFast also provides 24/7 Emergency Roadside Assistance, ensuring that help is always just a phone call away. Whether it’s a flat tire or another unexpected issue, VinFast’s support network guarantees drivers won’t be stranded. This around-the-clock availability not only safeguards customers but also reinforces trust in the brand’s dedication to reliability.

 Perhaps the most notable element of VinFast’s after-sales strategy is its smart app. Seamlessly integrating charging, maintenance, and payment functionalities, the app offers unparalleled convenience. It allows users to locate and access over 140,000 public charging stations across North America. This comprehensive charging network addresses range anxiety, one of the most common concerns for EV buyers. By streamlining vehicle management, the app enhances usability, making EV ownership simpler and more accessible.

 Raising the Bar for EV Ownership

 The impact of VinFast’s customer-focused policies is already evident. In Vietnam, where the company originated, VinFast has become the dominant automotive brand during the first 10 months of 2024. By outpacing foreign competitors and traditional gas-powered automakers, it has proven its ability to win consumer trust. This momentum is now expanding into North America, where the brand is steadily gaining traction.

 In September, VinFast achieved record-breaking sales, driven by robust customer demand for its competitive offerings. The launch of the VF 9, a three-row, seven-seater SUV, marks another milestone for the company. Equipped with the same industry-leading 10-year/125,000-mile warranty as its predecessors, the VF 9 further cements VinFast’s commitment to customer satisfaction and long-term reliability.

 Such policies are more than just marketing tactics; they reflect a deep understanding of what modern consumers value most: trust, convenience, and reliability. By addressing these priorities, VinFast is transforming the EV ownership experience and positioning itself as a rising powerhouse in the global market. A New Era for Automakers

 VinFast’s approach underscores a broader shift in the automotive industry. As electrification becomes the standard, extended warranties and robust after-sales services are no longer optional—they’re essential. Traditional automakers are now being forced to adapt, either by extending their own warranties or by enhancing service offerings to compete with innovators like VinFast.

 For consumers, this evolution is a win-win. Long warranties provide peace of mind, while comprehensive after-sales support ensures a smooth and enjoyable ownership experience. For automakers, these policies foster brand loyalty, create differentiation in a crowded market, and accelerate the global transition to sustainable mobility.

 By prioritizing the customer experience through groundbreaking warranties and unmatched after-sales support, VinFast has not only set a new standard but is also reshaping what consumers expect from EV ownership. As the automotive world shifts toward a greener future, VinFast’s strategy provides a compelling blueprint for success.
