# On the Lake. Reflected Red—Wang Qingzhou’s Color Ink Works Shine at Hangzhou’s West Lake

December 23, 2024, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, On December 15, 2024, the art exhibition “Reflections on the Lake: The Color Ink Art of Wang Qingzhou” officially opened at This Moment Art Space, curated by Yang Chengjun and hosted by Deyin Cultural Workshop. Marking Wang Qingzhou’s first exhibition in Hangzhou, the event features over 20 color ink works and will run until February 15.

 

 In the exhibition preface, curator Yang Chengjun remarked, “The theme of this exhibition primarily revolves around flowers, presenting not just their tangible forms but also their imagined essence, leaving ample space for the audience’s interpretation. The artist employs the traditional Chinese technique of color ink painting while infusing it with Western sensibilities. The most significant artistic innovation lies in transcending the confines of traditional painting, integrating modern artistic forms into the works. Wang has discovered a unique visual language, striking an optimal balance among tradition, contemporaneity, and individuality.

 

 The approach is rooted in four dimensions: delving deep into tradition, expanding into the breadth of the contemporary, embracing the vastness of nature, and enriching the thickness of self-expression. This painting style represents a fresh, modern interpretation of xieyi (freehand brushwork), capturing the sensibilities of contemporary life. Through years of dedication, Wang has developed a distinctive style—fresh and elegant, yet brimming with intensity. His compositions are vibrant and dynamic while adhering to a disciplined structure, embodying the Eastern artistic philosophy of seeking spirit over mere form. This pursuit of resonance beyond representation reflects an enduring aesthetic ideal.”

 This Moment of Crimson Reflection—Wang Qingzhou’s Color Ink Art Exhibition Forward

 

 The subject of this exhibition is primarily flowers—specifically, the flowers as envisioned by the artist. These works blend the tangible and the abstract, offering the audience a vast space for imagination. Wang Qingzhou’s unique style stands out through the use of traditional Chinese color ink techniques, enriched with the perceptual depth of Western painting. His greatest artistic innovation lies in breaking free from the confines of traditional art by integrating modern forms into his work.

 The artist has discovered a distinctive visual language, a harmonious integration of tradition, contemporaneity, and individuality. His approach is grounded in four interconnected dimensions. Reaching into the depth of tradition, expanding into the breadth of the contemporary, embracing the vastness of nature, and enriching the thickness of self-expression.

 This style can be considered a new form of xieyi—a contemporary freehand expression rooted in the experiences and emotions of modern life. Through years of dedication, Wang has developed a powerful and distinctive aesthetic. His works are fresh and elegant, yet carry an undeniable intensity. The compositions are dynamic and full of life, maintaining a disciplined structure while capturing the spirit of Eastern art’s core philosophy: the pursuit of spirit over mere form.

 This aesthetic goal—of reaching beyond appearances to evoke resonance and vitality—continues to embody the timeless beauty of Chinese artistic traditions.

 Transforming the Ancient into the Contemporary

 Laozi once said, “Vague and elusive, within it there is image. Elusive and vague, within it there is substance. Obscure and profound, within it there is spirit.”

 The essence of an artist’s creation lies in emulating nature, drawing inspiration from antiquity, and learning from tradition. In these works, we witness adherence to the principles of traditional Chinese painting. Beyond mere representation, the brushstrokes echo the rhythm of calligraphy: interconnected, dynamic, and expressive from every angle. The flow of energy is seamless, the composition balanced in density, and the colors are free from artificiality—bold, crisp, and resonant, like a leaping melody.

 This melody, expressed through brush and rice paper, dances vividly across the white expanse of the medium. The depicted scenes brim with lush vegetation and vibrant hues. Between the abstract and the figurative, the works transform the ancient into the contemporary. The beauty of their color-ink imagery signifies a progression of Eastern ink art, enriching its legacy while propelling it forward.

 East Meets West

 Chinese aesthetics and philosophy differ from the West yet find points of harmony and integration. The brilliance lies in the artist’s ability to absorb Western artistic elements and, through free and expressive brushstrokes, reshape them to reflect a deeply personal spirit. This approach transforms traditional Chinese ink painting into a contemporary expression.

 In these works, one can sense the rich charm of traditional Chinese brushwork. The layered textures are achieved through the subtle interplay of light and dark, thick and thin, embodying the Chinese method of creating perspective. Simultaneously, the concept of space is reimagined through the influence of Western perspective techniques. Just as each person’s heart differs, reflected uniquely in their face, so too does the canvas become a map of the artist’s inner world. The artist integrates the calligraphic brushwork of traditional Chinese ink into their art, creating with freedom and vitality. This sparks a creative dialogue between tradition and innovation, brimming with resilience and life.

 Having practiced calligraphy from a young age, the artist possesses a profound grounding in tradition and a deep understanding of Eastern art. Yet they have also studied Western figurative art, achieving a harmonious fusion of the two. Influenced by their travels across Europe, the artist draws inspiration from Western art, particularly Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, which is evident in their use of color. Experiences in international exhibitions have given the artist a global perspective on their national and traditional culture.

 With a culturally conscious vision as a thinker, the artist continually reflects—on the present, the future, and the path of art. They bring Chinese traditional culture, rooted in their artistic practice, into a broader context, carving a unique path forward.
