Port-au-Prince, Haiti – June 13, 2025 – In its mission to promote financial inclusion in Haiti, NATCOM continues to elevate Natcash – the nation’s most widely used mobile wallet – as a key tool in daily financial transactions. This June, NATCOM highlights Natcash’s growing ecosystem, offering users powerful tools for bill payments, mobile top-ups, money transfers, and shopping.

 

 With just a few taps, Natcash users can pay utility bills for electricity, water, cable TV, and internet. Cashless purchases at Natcash-accepting merchants are safe, fast, and convenient. The wallet also allows for real-time peer-to-peer transfers, simplifying financial support for family and friends. Thanks to a nationwide network of over 3,000 agents, users can also cash in and out securely, whether they live in urban centers or remote areas.
