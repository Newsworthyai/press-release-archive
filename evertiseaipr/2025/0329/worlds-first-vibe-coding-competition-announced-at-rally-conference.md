Applications open on April 22, 2025, close on May 22, 2025 and can be accessed at www.rallyinnovation.com.

 Vibe coding will drastically accelerate the creation of our next generation tools and 12 teams of up to 3 people each will code throughout the night to show us how it’s done. The event is part of the third annual RALLY conference held on September 24-25 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

 Developers are increasingly using AI to generate code and the competition aligns with RALLY’s mission to highlight the innovations used by entrepreneurs, founders, and creators worldwide. Y Combinator, recently shared that a quarter of their startup group created 95% of their codebases via generative AI.

 “The launch of the first-ever Vibe Coding Competition at this year’s RALLY is a testament to our commitment to innovation,” said Christopher Day, CEO of Elevate Ventures and RALLY Visionary. “We constantly challenge companies and individuals to be curious, think differently, innovate and iterate. Now, we’re putting that mindset to the test. This competition will inspire the

 next generation of founders to think creatively about their next endeavor. How can you leverage AI and LLMs to accelerate your aha moment?”

 The competition, in partnership with Crafted, will happen live at RALLY and the competition kick-off will begin at 12:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday, September 24 where participants will learn more about the challenge they are solving and what they need to build. A happy hour and a break are scheduled during the event, and participants should be prepared for unexpected twists along the way.

 A panel of judges will review the submissions and the top three finalists will be announced on the Main Stage. The final three teams will be asked to demo their product to the audience and the winning team will be announced and awarded a $10,000 cash prize.
