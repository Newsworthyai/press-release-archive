Houston’s Top Home Care Provider – More Than a Ranking, A Promise

 HOUSTON, TX – May 27, 2025 – In a city with hundreds of in-home care providers, one agency now stands at the top. Homewatch CareGivers of Houston Galleria, a leading provider of in-home senior care in Houston, Texas, has been officially ranked the #1 home care provider in Houston and #7 nationwide by Activated Insights, the nation’s most respected authority on client and caregiver satisfaction.

 Awarded: 2025 Best of Home Care® – Top 100 Leader in Experience

 

 This recognition is part of the 2025 Best of Home Care® – Top 100 Leader in Experience Award, the highest honor in the home care industry. Fewer than 1% of home care agencies across North America receive this elite designation each year.

 Why It Matters: Activated Insights, formerly Home Care Pulse, surveys tens of thousands of clients and caregivers monthly. Their evaluations cover caregiver professionalism, compassion, communication, scheduling reliability, and overall satisfaction. Agencies must:

 * Rank in the top 100 for Overall Satisfaction (OSAT)
* Earn both Provider and Employer of Choice Awards
* Demonstrate excellence over a 12-month evaluation

 “Activated Insights is the gold standard in measuring home care quality,” said Serhat Bolukbasi. “This award proves that compassionate care, backed by clinical rigor, is possible at scale.”

 Built on Trust, Led with Clinical Precision When Serhat Bolukbasi, a former BCG strategist, and Andrew Harris, a former Neuro ICU nurse at Houston Methodist, acquired the agency from its founders, Sam and Ellen Moreton, they made a quiet promise: steward what’s working, and elevate what’s possible.

 Many of the agency’s caregivers have been with the team for almost a decade. That kind of consistency is rare in the home care industry; and priceless for families.

 Enhancements include:

 * Nurse-led oversight on all care plans
* Same-day care starts for urgent cases
* Long-term care insurance support
* Over 100 trained, background-checked, and insured caregivers
* Specialization in dementia, post-hospital care, and chronic condition support

 “It’s the relationships that matter most,” said Bolukbasi. “We know every client, their family, even their pets. That personal connection builds trust that makes our care feel like family.”
