# Zero-Fee Futures Are Here — PUM Slashes Trading Costs to Zero for Derivatives Traders

Los Angeles, California, 04 July,2025, PUM Exchange has made a bold move in the crypto derivatives market: starting today, users can trade futures contracts with **zero fees**. In an industry-first campaign aimed at empowering high-frequency traders, PUM is eliminating all maker and taker fees for selected perpetual contracts — a step that directly challenges the cost structures of major competitors.

 

 Leveling the Playing Field This new zero-fee model is especially attractive to active traders, scalpers, and arbitrageurs who are often burdened by high trading fees on rival platforms. By removing fees, PUM aims to increase both trade volume and user retention while giving traders more room to profit.

 “We’re not just building another futures exchange,” said Allen Oliverr, Founder at PUM. “We’re building one where users actually keep more of what they earn.”

 Supported Contracts & Pairs At launch, zero-fee trading is available for the most popular pairs, including: – BTC/USDT perpetual – ETH/USDT perpetual – SOL/USDT perpetual – XRP/USDT perpetual

 More pairs will be added based on community feedback and volume metrics.

 Terms and Conditions Zero fees apply only to standard maker and taker fees. Funding rates, liquidation fees, and spread-related costs still apply. All users must complete KYC Level 1 to participate in zero-fee trading. PUM reserves the right to modify eligible pairs and conditions based on market dynamics.
