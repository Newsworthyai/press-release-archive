# NATCOM: Revolutionizing Connectivity and Financial Inclusion in Haiti with International Top-Up and Natcash Remittance Services

Port-au-Prince, Haiti – NATCOM, Haiti’s leading telecommunications provider, continues to redefine connectivity and financial inclusion by offering innovative services tailored to the needs of both local communities and international diasporas. With a commitment to empowering Haitians through advanced technology and reliable services, NATCOM introduces two remarkable offerings: the Mobile Top-up service and the Remittance service via Natcash Mobile Wallet, designed to facilitate seamless communication and secure financial transactions for Haitians at home and abroad.

 Global Connectivity through International Top-Up

 Understanding the vital role that telecommunications play in connecting families and communities, NATCOM’s International Top-Up service allows customers living overseas to effortlessly recharge prepaid mobile accounts of their loved ones in Haiti. Available through various trusted global partners such as Ding, TransferTo, BOSS Revolution, and Prepay Nation, this service ensures convenience, security, and instant connectivity. Customers in the United States, Canada, France, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Mexico, and beyond can conveniently recharge NATCOM numbers online, via mobile apps, or directly at authorized retail outlets in Haitian communities overseas.

 

 Secure and Instant Remittances with Natcash via CAM Transfer

 NATCOM also addresses another critical need—financial inclusion—through its widely-used mobile wallet, Natcash. In a significant development, Natcash now supports receiving remittances directly from the United States via its strategic partnership with CAM Transfer, a trusted remittance company. This enhancement allows users in Haiti to receive money sent by family and friends in the U.S. directly into their Natcash wallets, facilitating instant access to funds.

 Recipients can conveniently manage their funds, pay bills, purchase goods, transfer money, or withdraw cash securely through Natcash’s extensive network of agents across Haiti. This new feature underscores NATCOM’s commitment to financial empowerment, providing a safer, faster, and more convenient alternative to traditional remittance methods.
