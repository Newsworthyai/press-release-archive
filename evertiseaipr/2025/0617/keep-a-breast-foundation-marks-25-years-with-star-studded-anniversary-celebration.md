# Keep A Breast Foundation Marks 25 Years with Star-Studded Anniversary Celebration

The Keep A Breast Foundation (KAB) is set to commemorate its 25th anniversary with a memorable celebration at Pappy & Harriet’s in Yucca Valley, California, on September 5, 2025. This event not only marks a significant milestone for the organization but also highlights its ongoing commitment to breast cancer prevention and education through innovative and art-driven initiatives. The anniversary party will feature performances by Grammy Award-winning group Arrested Development and a DJ set by renowned artist Shepard Fairey, both of whom have personal connections to the cause. Since its inception in 2000, KAB has made a profound impact on millions of young people worldwide, educating them on the importance of early detection and prevention of breast cancer. The foundation’s unique approach, which combines art and activism, has resonated with a global audience, making it a pivotal force in the fight against breast cancer. The 25th Anniversary Party serves as both a celebration of past achievements and a forward-looking event, with proceeds supporting the development of KAB Valley, a wellness retreat center aimed at providing healing and support for breast cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers.

 The significance of this event extends beyond the celebration itself. It underscores the importance of community and creativity in addressing public health challenges. The involvement of high-profile artists like Arrested Development and Shepard Fairey not only brings attention to KAB’s mission but also amplifies the message of hope and resilience. Their participation highlights the personal impact of breast cancer, bridging the gap between awareness and action.

 As KAB looks to the future with projects like KAB Valley, the 25th Anniversary Party represents a pivotal moment in the foundation’s history. It is an opportunity to reflect on the progress made in breast cancer education and prevention, while also setting the stage for the next chapter in KAB’s mission. The event promises to be a night of inspiration, unity, and celebration, bringing together supporters, survivors, and advocates under the desert stars to honor a legacy of making a difference.
