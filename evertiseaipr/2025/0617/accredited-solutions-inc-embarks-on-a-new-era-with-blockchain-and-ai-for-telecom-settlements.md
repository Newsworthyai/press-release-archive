# Accredited Solutions, Inc. Embarks on a New Era with Blockchain and AI for Telecom Settlements

Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) has made a strategic decision to pivot its operations towards the burgeoning fields of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically targeting the telecommunications sector. This shift is underscored by the company’s imminent acquisition of ItsBchain, a subsidiary renowned for its expertise in blockchain technology tailored for telecom applications. This move is not just a strategic realignment but a bold step towards addressing some of the most pressing challenges in telecom settlements, including fraud reduction and the optimization of settlement times. The integration of ItsBchain’s technology is expected to culminate in the development of a pioneering platform that leverages blockchain and AI to process voice, SMS, and data traffic settlements. This initiative represents a significant leap forward for the telecom industry, offering a solution that promises to enhance operational efficiency, security, and trust among global telecom carriers. Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions, Inc., has lauded the partnership for its potential to redefine the landscape of telecom and fintech settlements, positioning ASII at the vanguard of this rapidly evolving sector.

 This strategic pivot comes as ASII moves away from the previously contemplated acquisition of Globetopper, a decision influenced by the perceived higher strategic value and scalability offered by the ItsBchain partnership. The Globetopper deal, which would have introduced ASII to the digital gift card market, was considered less favorable due to potential shareholder dilution and the highly competitive nature of the e-gift card industry. In contrast, the ItsBchain acquisition aligns with ASII’s ambition to lead in innovation-driven markets, particularly those that promise to transform traditional industries through technology.

 As Accredited Solutions, Inc. prepares to finalize its financial audit and regain current status, the company is clearly setting its sights on a future where blockchain and AI play pivotal roles in the telecommunications industry. This strategic direction not only enhances ASII’s market position but also signals a broader shift towards the adoption of advanced technologies in telecom settlements, offering significant benefits to carriers and consumers worldwide. The implications of this announcement extend beyond the immediate stakeholders, heralding a new era of efficiency and security in global telecom operations.
