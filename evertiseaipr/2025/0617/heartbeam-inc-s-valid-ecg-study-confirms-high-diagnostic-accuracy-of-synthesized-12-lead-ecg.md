# HeartBeam Inc.’s VALID-ECG Study Confirms High Diagnostic Accuracy of Synthesized 12-Lead ECG

The recent VALID-ECG study conducted by HeartBeam Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT) has showcased the remarkable diagnostic accuracy of its synthesized 12-lead ECG device, achieving a 93.4% agreement with traditional ECG methods for arrhythmia assessment. This pivotal study, presented by Dr. Thomas Deering of the Piedmont Heart Institute at the Heart Rhythm Society’s annual meeting in San Diego, underscores the potential of HeartBeam’s compact, patient-friendly technology to revolutionize cardiac care outside conventional medical settings. HeartBeam’s device, which is credit card-sized, was tested across five U.S. clinical sites involving 198 patients. The study compared ECG intervals and amplitudes between the synthesized output and standard ECGs collected simultaneously, validating the device’s accuracy and reliability. These findings are instrumental in HeartBeam’s FDA submission for its ECG synthesis software, filed in January 2025, and pave the way for the device’s anticipated U.S. commercialization following FDA clearance.

 The implications of this advancement are profound. By enabling accurate, on-demand arrhythmia monitoring outside medical facilities, HeartBeam’s technology could significantly enhance patient care and outcomes. It promises to empower physicians with actionable heart intelligence, allowing for the timely identification of cardiac health trends and acute conditions, thereby directing patients to appropriate care more efficiently. This innovation not only represents a leap forward in portable medical technology but also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve accessibility to cardiac diagnostics for patients worldwide.

 With the launch of an Early Access Program, HeartBeam is taking proactive steps to refine clinical workflows and prepare for its entry into the U.S. market. The company’s focus on transforming cardiac care through portable, accurate, and user-friendly technology is a testament to the evolving landscape of medical diagnostics, where convenience and precision go hand in hand to benefit patients and healthcare providers alike.
