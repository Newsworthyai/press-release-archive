# CollectionPro’s Innovative Model Transforms Out-of-Network Payment Recovery for Healthcare Providers

The healthcare industry is witnessing a transformative approach to out-of-network (OON) payment recovery, thanks to CollectionPro Services LLC. In an environment where healthcare providers grapple with shrinking reimbursements and payer resistance, CollectionPro’s model offers a lifeline. By integrating legal expertise with a no-risk financial framework, the company enables providers to navigate the complexities introduced by the No Surprises Act (NSA), ensuring they can recover payments without upfront costs. CollectionPro’s model is distinguished by its flat 10% contingency fee, applied uniformly across all medical specialties, including those historically challenging to recover payments for, such as anesthesia and emergency care. This performance-based approach, devoid of setup fees or hidden costs, underscores the company’s commitment to transparency and provider empowerment. Furthermore, CollectionPro assumes all administrative and arbitration fees upfront, removing financial barriers that often deter providers from pursuing underpayment disputes.

 The significance of CollectionPro’s approach extends beyond immediate financial recovery. By specializing in the revival of previously denied or overlooked OON claims, the company leverages NSA guidelines to arbitrate claims dated January 1, 2022, or later. This capability not only recovers lost revenue but also highlights the strategic legal insight CollectionPro brings to the table. With a 92% success rate in over 10,000 arbitration cases, the company’s legal-first strategy provides providers with a critical edge in complex disputes.

 The broader implications of CollectionPro’s model are profound. By ensuring providers can effectively recover OON payments, the company plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the financial health of healthcare providers. This, in turn, supports the delivery of high-quality patient care without the burden of unexpected costs. In a healthcare landscape increasingly focused on affordability and accessibility, CollectionPro’s innovative solutions represent a vital advancement in addressing systemic payment challenges, marking a significant step forward for the industry.
