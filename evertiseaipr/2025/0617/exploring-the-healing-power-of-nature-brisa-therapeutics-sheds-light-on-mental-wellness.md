# Exploring the Healing Power of Nature: Brisa Therapeutics Sheds Light on Mental Wellness

The recent episode of the Heart of the Big Bend podcast featuring Brisa Therapeutics co-founders Toni and Jacque has brought to light the profound impact of natural environments on mental and emotional wellness. Their discussion, centered around the therapeutic benefits of nature, particularly in regions like the Big Bend, offers valuable insights into how outdoor settings contribute to emotional healing and nervous system regulation. According to the Brisa team, nature does more than provide a scenic backdrop for relaxation; it actively participates in the healing process. Techniques such as bilateral stimulation, achieved through walking rhythms and eye movement across landscapes, were highlighted as natural methods for grounding and emotional regulation. The desert environment, with its vast open spaces, was specifically noted for its unique ability to facilitate EMDR-style healing, a therapy used for processing trauma.

 The neuroscience behind these phenomena was also explored, with the experts explaining how immersion in wide, open spaces can reset the nervous system. This reset is crucial for individuals dealing with stress, anxiety, and trauma, as it promotes a state of calm and facilitates self-connection. The Brisa team’s emphasis on the direct communication between nature and the body’s rhythm underscores the importance of reconnecting with the natural world for mental health.

 This conversation is particularly relevant in today’s fast-paced world, where many individuals feel emotionally depleted. The insights shared by Brisa Therapeutics not only highlight the therapeutic potential of nature but also encourage a broader discussion on integrating natural healing methods into mental health care. For therapists, wellness seekers, and anyone interested in the intersection of nature and mental health, this episode serves as a reminder of the healing power that lies just outside our doors.
