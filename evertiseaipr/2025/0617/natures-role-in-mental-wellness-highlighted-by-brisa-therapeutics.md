# Nature’s Role in Mental Wellness Highlighted by Brisa Therapeutics

The recent insights shared by Brisa Therapeutics co-founders Toni and Jacque on the Heart of the Big Bend podcast have illuminated the significant role natural environments play in enhancing mental and emotional wellness. Their discussion sheds light on how outdoor settings, especially in areas like the Big Bend, can contribute to emotional healing and nervous system regulation, offering a natural remedy for stress, anxiety, and trauma. According to the Brisa team, nature’s therapeutic benefits extend beyond mere relaxation. Techniques such as bilateral stimulation, facilitated by walking rhythms and eye movement across landscapes, serve as natural methods for grounding and emotional regulation. The vast open spaces of the desert environment were particularly noted for their ability to support EMDR-style healing, a therapy known for its effectiveness in processing trauma.

 The neuroscience behind these effects was also a key point of discussion. The experts explained how immersion in wide, open spaces can reset the nervous system, promoting a state of calm and enhancing self-connection. This understanding underscores the importance of reconnecting with the natural world as a vital component of mental health care.

 In today’s fast-paced society, where emotional depletion is common, the insights from Brisa Therapeutics offer a timely reminder of nature’s healing potential. Their discussion not only highlights the therapeutic advantages of natural environments but also encourages a broader conversation about incorporating these methods into mental health practices. For therapists, wellness enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the intersection of nature and mental health, this perspective opens new avenues for healing and self-discovery.
