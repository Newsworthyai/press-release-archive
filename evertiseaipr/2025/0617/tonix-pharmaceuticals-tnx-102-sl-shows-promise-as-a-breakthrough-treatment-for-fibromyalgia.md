# Tonix Pharmaceuticals’ TNX-102 SL Shows Promise as a Breakthrough Treatment for Fibromyalgia

The recent presentation by Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. at the 2025 Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) in Barcelona has brought hope to millions suffering from fibromyalgia. The company showcased positive Phase 3 data for TNX-102 SL, a sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine, which demonstrated statistically significant and sustained pain reduction over 14 weeks in patients with fibromyalgia. This development is crucial as fibromyalgia, a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, has seen limited treatment advancements over the past 15 years. TNX-102 SL’s unique formulation bypasses first-pass liver metabolism, leading to higher nighttime cyclobenzaprine levels and lower accumulation of norcyclobenzaprine, a metabolite associated with side effects. This pharmacological profile not only enhances the drug’s efficacy but also its tolerability, a significant concern for fibromyalgia patients who often discontinue treatments due to adverse effects. The RESILIENT Phase 3 trial results underscore TNX-102 SL’s potential to address both pain and sleep disturbances, two of the most debilitating symptoms of fibromyalgia.

 With a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date set for August 15, 2025, TNX-102 SL is on track to become the first new fibromyalgia therapy in over a decade. The FDA’s Fast Track designation for TNX-102 SL further highlights the urgent need for effective treatments for this condition. The implications of this development extend beyond patient care, offering a glimpse into the future of pain management where targeted therapies provide relief without compromising quality of life.

 The potential approval of TNX-102 SL could mark a turning point in the treatment of fibromyalgia, offering a new option for patients who have struggled with limited and often ineffective treatments. As Tonix Pharmaceuticals prepares to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA, the medical community and patients alike await what could be a significant advancement in the management of fibromyalgia.
