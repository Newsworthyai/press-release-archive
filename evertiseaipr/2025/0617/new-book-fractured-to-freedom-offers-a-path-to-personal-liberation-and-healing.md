As the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day with fireworks and parades, a new book titled ‘Fractured to Freedom’ by Al Perry offers a different perspective on freedom. Launching on July 4, the book shifts the focus from collective celebrations to personal liberation, suggesting that true independence begins with healing from within. Perry’s work is a timely reminder that freedom isn’t always about grand gestures but can also be found in the quiet moments of self-discovery and healing. ‘Fractured to Freedom’ is structured into nine sections, each designed to guide readers through a comprehensive healing journey. From creating a healthy mindset to understanding the body’s energy anatomy, Perry combines ancient Taoist wisdom with actionable practices. The book includes journal prompts and exercises, making it an interactive guide for those seeking to reclaim their inner peace and vibrant well-being.

In a society often focused on external achievements, ‘Fractured to Freedom’ serves as a crucial reminder that true freedom starts with self-awareness and the courage to change. Its release on Independence Day symbolizes the personal liberation that comes from healing, offering a new way to celebrate freedom—by finding it within ourselves.
