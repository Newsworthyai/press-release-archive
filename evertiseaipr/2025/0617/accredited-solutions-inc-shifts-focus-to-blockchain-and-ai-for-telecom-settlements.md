# Accredited Solutions, Inc. Shifts Focus to Blockchain and AI for Telecom Settlements

Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) has announced a significant strategic pivot, centering its future operations around the acquisition of ItsBchain, a subsidiary with expertise in blockchain technology for telecommunications. This move underscores the company’s ambition to lead in the development of next-generation fintech and telecom solutions, leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency and security of carrier settlements. The acquisition of ItsBchain is poised to close imminently, marking a pivotal moment for ASII as it ventures into the telecom blockchain space. The collaboration is expected to yield a groundbreaking platform that integrates blockchain and AI to process voice, SMS, and data traffic settlements. This innovation aims to address longstanding industry challenges such as fraud reduction, settlement time optimization, and fostering trust among global telecom carriers.

 Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions, Inc., highlighted the transformative potential of this partnership, emphasizing the game-changing nature of the upcoming project. The initiative is not merely an entry into a competitive market but a strategic positioning at the forefront of a rapidly evolving sector, with the potential to redefine telecom and fintech settlements worldwide.

 The decision to shift focus away from the previously considered Globetopper acquisition reflects ASII’s commitment to pursuing opportunities with the highest strategic value and scalability. The Globetopper deal, which would have introduced ASII to the digital gift card market, was deemed less favorable due to potential shareholder dilution and the competitive nature of the e-gift card industry. In contrast, the ItsBchain partnership offers a clear path to establishing ASII as a leader in a high-demand, innovation-driven market.

 As ASII prepares to finalize its financial audit and regain current status, the company is poised to embark on this new chapter with a clear strategic direction. The integration of ItsBchain’s technology and expertise is expected to not only enhance ASII’s market position but also contribute to the broader adoption of blockchain and AI solutions in the telecommunications industry, offering tangible benefits to carriers and consumers alike.
