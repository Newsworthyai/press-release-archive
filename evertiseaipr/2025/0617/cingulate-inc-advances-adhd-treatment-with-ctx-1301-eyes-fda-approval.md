# Cingulate Inc. Advances ADHD Treatment with CTx-1301, Eyes FDA Approval

Cingulate Inc. (NASDAQ: CING) has recently been in the spotlight following the initiation of coverage by Stonegate Capital Partners, highlighting the company’s progress with its lead ADHD asset, CTx-1301. This development is crucial as it underscores the potential of CTx-1301 to address significant gaps in ADHD treatment, offering a once-daily stimulant therapy with rapid onset and sustained efficacy throughout the day. The ADHD market, estimated at $22 billion in the U.S., is in dire need of innovative treatments that can overcome the limitations of current therapies, which often require booster doses and lack flexibility in administration. The company’s recent Phase 3 pediatric study results for CTx-1301 have been promising, with all tested doses showing statistically significant improvements on the ADHD-RS-5 scale within five weeks. Additionally, the high-dose food effect study confirmed that CTx-1301 can be taken with or without food, enhancing patient adherence and flexibility. These findings are pivotal as they support the drug’s efficacy and safety profile, paving the way for its New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA in mid-2025.

 Cingulate’s financial strategy and balance sheet have also been under scrutiny, with the company reporting a net loss of $3.8M for the first quarter of 2025 and actively exploring strategic financing options to support its NDA filing and pre-launch activities. The potential approval of CTx-1301 could not only redefine the ADHD treatment paradigm but also significantly impact Cingulate’s financial standing and the broader pharmaceutical industry.

 The implications of Cingulate’s advancements extend beyond the company itself, offering hope to millions of ADHD patients seeking more effective and convenient treatment options. As the company moves closer to FDA approval, the healthcare community and investors alike are watching closely, recognizing the transformative potential of CTx-1301 in a market hungry for innovation.
