# Lantern Pharma Inc. Reports Significant Clinical Breakthrough in NSCLC Treatment

Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) has achieved a significant milestone in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a patient in its Phase 2 HARMONIC(TM) trial achieving a durable complete response. This development is particularly noteworthy as the patient, a 70-year-old never-smoker, had previously failed three lines of therapy, including treatments with Keytruda(R), radiation, and Tagrisso(R). The successful outcome underscores the potential of LP-300, developed using Lantern’s RADR(R) AI platform, to offer new hope for a growing segment of NSCLC patients who have limited treatment options. The patient’s journey through the trial revealed a 57% reduction in tumor size initially, followed by the complete resolution of lung and adrenal lesions. Remarkably, nearly two years after beginning treatment, the patient remains progression-free and has not experienced any clinically significant adverse reactions across 21 cycles of treatment. This outcome not only demonstrates the efficacy and safety of LP-300 but also highlights the innovative approach Lantern Pharma is taking in oncology drug development.

 The implications of this breakthrough extend beyond the individual patient, offering a glimpse into the future of cancer treatment. Lantern Pharma’s use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate drug development could significantly reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new therapies to market. For NSCLC patients, particularly never-smokers who represent an underserved segment with limited approved treatments, this development could herald a new era of personalized and effective treatment options.

 This clinical success story is a testament to the potential of integrating advanced technology with traditional drug development processes. As Lantern Pharma continues to explore the capabilities of its RADR(R) AI platform, the oncology community watches closely, hopeful for more breakthroughs that could transform the landscape of cancer treatment.
