﻿YUCCA VALLEY, California — November 11, 2024 — The Keep A Breast Foundation proudly announces the launch of its 2024-2025 Give Back Grant (GBG) Cycle 5, offering crucial financial support to women of color across the U.S. who are breast cancer survivors or currently in treatment. Now in its fifth year, the program continues to provide direct aid to help ease the financial and emotional strain faced by women of color survivors and patients, promoting healing and resilience within this community.

Since it was created in 2020, the Keep A Breast (KAB) GBG program has become an essential resource, awarding 1047 grants totaling $523,500 to Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) women. This cycle, KAB will grant another $100,000, providing recipients with unrestricted funds they can use to meet personal needs or uplift their lives—whether through medical bills, personal care, or even pursuing a passion.

“Keep A Breast and this program has always been about supporting and uplifting women,” says Shaney jo Darden, founder of KAB. “We are proud to be heading into the fifth year of this program and for the impact we have made in these women’s lives. This money can be life-changing and stress-relieving it can bring peace and support during the breast cancer treatment and recovery experience. And that’s invaluable.”

The GBG program is made possible by key donations from our partners Smart & Sassy and Curvy Couture as well as from generous donations from one-time and recurring donors.

Women of color face higher mortality rates upon breast cancer diagnosis than White women, a statistic that drives the GBG program’s mission to address these disparities by providing flexible financial support. Each eligible applicant will receive a $500 grant to be used as they see fit—whether for essential expenses like housing and groceries, restorative experiences like a spa day, or personal projects like starting a small business.

Marquita Goodluck, the GBG program manager and a past recipient, explains: “As both a breast cancer survivor and advocate, I understand the financial and emotional challenges that come long after active treatment ends. The Give Back Grant has been a beacon for BIPOC survivors, allowing us to feel seen, respected, and supported through our journey.”

How to Apply

Applications for the 2024 GBG cycle are now open through December 31, 2024, 11:59 p.m. PST. Women of color in the U.S. diagnosed with breast cancer or who have survived breast cancer are encouraged to apply on the Keep A Breast website.
