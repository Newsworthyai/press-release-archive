# Industry Leader Climet Partners with Phizzle; First Joint TCO/ROI Value Proposition in Pharma Manufacturing

San Francisco, CA – December 19, 2024 - This week, Climet officially announced Phizzle, Inc as an authorized software partner.

Climet Instruments Company located in Redlands, California, a Division of Venturedyne Ltd, is the leading manufacturer of pharmaceutical grade cleanroom particle counters and microbial air samplers. Climet sets the industry standard for data integrity with high-quality products that significantly minimize failure investigations and deviation reports, which have a significant impact on reducing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

Following a year of collaboration with Phizzle, the two companies are launching a strategic partnership to deliver even more value to users of Climet particle counters and air samplers – with a particular focus on data integrity, risk mitigation, and labor savings.

"We always try to raise the bar at Climet on behalf of customers, and our partnership with Phizzle takes our value proposition to the next level,” said Jim Strachan, Climet’s General Manager. “Together, we deliver the industry's first offer that combines total cost of ownership with return on investment.”

The strategic partnership delivers a unique TCO and ROI value proposition. Climet's product line can now be operated remotely with automated routine monitoring using Phizzle’s GxP-compliant software. Gone are the days of manual data collection and entry. Phizzle’s platform seamlessly integrates with Climet particle counters to capture sample data and push it directly to any Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), enhancing operational efficiency and enabling digitization.

Users can now leverage Phizzle's software to capture and route metadata from Climet's continuous monitoring particle counters, portable particle counters, and the CI-97 intelligent microbial air sampler. The end result is an even greater reduction in the incidence rate of deviation reports and a significant improvement in audit readiness.

On the partnership, Phizzle CEO Ben Davis noted, “Climet is the industry leader in providing Life Science organizations the lowest TCO and a brand name trusted for quality across pharma manufacturing. Combined with our software, we address key pain points like data integrity and manual sampling – and create an ROI that pays for the investment in less than 12 months.”

Interested life science companies can review the ROI generated by pairing Climet with Phizzle. Cost savings, avoidance, and risk mitigation contribute to an ROI frequently exceeding 1000%. Try Phizzle's ROI calculator here.
