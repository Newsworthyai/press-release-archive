# Top AI Talent Converge at Silicon Valley’s Sushi Hackathon

SILICON VALLEY, Calif., November 7, 2024: The Inaugural Sushi AI Hackathon brought together top global talent to compete against Stanford and UC Berkeley teams and junior engineers from tech giants like Google and Meta to drive generative AI innovation. With more than 300 applicants vying for 20 spots, this event highlights strong interest in using AI to enhance business efficiency. The winning team received $30,000, an exclusive sushi dinner by a renowned Japanese sushi chef, and a study trip to Japan, celebrating their achievements and offering them a unique cultural experience.

Audrey Tang, a Taiwanese politician and free software programmer who served as the first Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan from August 2022 to May 2024, was a keynote speaker. Audrey has been described as one of the "ten greatest Taiwanese computing personalities." In her keynote, Audrey emphasized that AI’s strength lies in fostering human creativity and connection, empowering individuals while celebrating diverse perspectives. Tang highlighted that AI should augment—not replace—human decision-making, creating inclusive spaces where every voice contributes to innovation. Drawing a parallel between sushi-making’s precise, thoughtful craft and technology, Tang stressed the importance of building collaborative AI systems that align with the hackathon’s goal of creating technology to benefit all.

The Hackathon’s top prize went to "Neural Network Ninjas," a team of four Stanford students who developed "Banana AI," an AI-driven platform to support product designers. This application predicts the customer segments likely to adopt new products, gathering vital feedback through simulations in the early development stages. With this data, designers can make customer-focused adjustments, ultimately fine-tuning product design to increase its success upon market launch.

Due to the overwhelming response, the Sushi AI Hackathon team is excited to expand globally with a virtual event in spring 2025, inviting participants worldwide to exchange cutting-edge ideas in generative AI and business innovation. Building on this in-person success, the Silicon Valley Sushi Hackathon is set to become an annual flagship event, providing a dynamic platform to showcase emerging talent, engage with industry leaders, and drive the future of AI-driven business transformation.
