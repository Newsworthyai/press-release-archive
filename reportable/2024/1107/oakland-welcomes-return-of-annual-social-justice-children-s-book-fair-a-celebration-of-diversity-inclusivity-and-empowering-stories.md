# Oakland Welcomes Return of Annual Social Justice Children's Book Fair: A Celebration of Diversity, Inclusivity, and Empowering Stories

Oakland, CA November 7, 2024 -- The Social Justice Children's Book Fair is back in Oakland, marking its annual return on December 7, 2024, at Emerson Elementary School. This year's event promises to be an opportunity for fun, learning, and social justice, co-hosted with the Emerson PTA.

The fair is a celebration of diversity and inclusivity, shining a spotlight on the transformative power of storytelling. Peter Limata, popularly known for his Story Time with Mr. Limata initiative, will guide the attendees as the master of ceremonies. With an extensive selection of children's books that foster empathy, equality, and understanding, the event is a treasure trove for avid young readers, parents, and educators.

The Social Justice Children's Book Fair is committed to creating a space that is inclusive and inviting for families, teachers, and book enthusiasts of all ages. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore inspiring narratives, interact with local authors, and enjoy music-filled book readings.

The fair brings together a diverse group of authors, including Abby Rocha, Afro Urban Society, Aida Salazar, Ajuan Mance, Alejandra Domenzain, and that’s just the A’s!. With its broad range of books tackling subjects like gender, racial equality, and environmental consciousness, there's something for everyone.

Robert Liu-Trujillo, co-director of the 2024 Social Justice Book Fair and author/illustrator, believes that "the power of storytelling can help shape the minds of the younger generation to understand and champion social justice." Innosanto Nagara, fair organizing team member and children's author, activist, and graphic designer, adds, "Through these books, we aim to spark conversations about equality and justice." Laura Atkins, fair co-director and children's book author and editor, echoes this sentiment, stating that, "We all have stories to tell and deserve to gift them to the world."

Join us in this celebration of literature and social justice. Tune in to Mr. Limata's livestream on the day through Facebook or YouTube.
