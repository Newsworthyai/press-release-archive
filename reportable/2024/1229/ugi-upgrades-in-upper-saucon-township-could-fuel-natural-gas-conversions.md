# UGI Upgrades in Upper Saucon Township Could Fuel Natural Gas Conversions

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a gas main replacement project in Upper Saucon Township on November 19. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The work is expected to be completed by the end of January and impact Lanark Road between West Hopewell Road and Cumorah Avenue.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
