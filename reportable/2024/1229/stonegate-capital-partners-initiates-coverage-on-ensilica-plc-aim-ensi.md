DALLAS, TX -- November 14th, 2024 -- EnSilica PLC (AIM: ENSI): Stonegate Capital Partners initiates their coverage on EnSilica PLC (AIM: ENSI).

In 2H24, EnSilica PLC continued to build on its strategic initiatives and market strengths, achieving significant milestones. The Company's strong position and intellectual property in automotive, industrial, healthcare, and satellite connectivity applications for mixed-signal ASICs continue to provide a competitive edge. We believe that ENSI is well positioned to capitalize on the global ASIC market, which is projected to reach $25.0B by 2030. EnSilica is well-positioned to benefit from this expansion, particularly in high-demand sectors such as telecommunications, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. EnSilica pursued expansion through consolidation and vertical integration, enhancing its market position and comprehensive service offerings. The successful completion of equity fundraisings totaling £6.5M and the refinancing of external loans with a £6.0M facility further strengthened its financial foundation, enabling continued investment in intellectual property and operational capabilities.
