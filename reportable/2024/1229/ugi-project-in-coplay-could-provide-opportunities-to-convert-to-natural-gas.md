# UGI Project in Coplay Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a gas main replacement project in Coplay on November 19. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The work is expected to be completed by the end of December and impact the following streets:

* Magna Drive between Coplay Street and Keystone Alley
* North 11th Street between Magna Drive and Echo Alley
* South 12th Street between Magna Drive and Coplay Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 740,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
