# UGI Offers Simple Tips to Help Make the Holiday Season Safe

The next several weeks are a busy time for many people traveling to celebrate the holidays or hosting gatherings at home. As UGI Utilities continues to focus on delivering safe and reliable energy services, the natural gas and electric provider offers these safety tips to remember and share with others:

A crowded house means more noses, and if any of them smell gas, everyone should act fast! If you detect the rotten egg smell added to natural gas, everyone should evacuate and get at least the length of a football field away before calling 911 or UGI at 800-276-2722. Do not turn anything on or off on the way out.

Don’t wait to have your heating system professionally serviced. Malfunctioning heating units and fuel-burning appliances can create a dangerous built up of carbon monoxide. Make sure you have working carbon monoxide detectors on each floor. If one goes off, evacuate immediately and call UGI or 911. Also, consider an extra layer of safety with a natural gas detector in your home.

Your kitchen will likely be a busy place, and a potential source of a fire. According to the National Fire Protection Association, Thanksgiving is the nation’s leading day for cooking fires. Keep flammable items away from hot surfaces. Clean-up to prevent grease build-up. Turn your stove and oven off when done. And make sure your smoke detectors are working and you have a fire extinguisher nearby.

Make a turkey delicious, not dangerous. If fried turkey is on your holiday menu, always thaw it out before frying. Keep the fryer at least 10 feet away from your home. Keep children and pets away from the fryer. And never leave a frying turkey unattended.

Avoid decorating dangers. Make sure Christmas trees, gifts, decorations and wrapping paper are kept away from fireplaces, radiators, and other heating sources. Turn off tree lights and lit decorations when you go to bed or leave the house. If you have a live tree, make sure it is watered every day. Also, discard any lights that are damaged or show excessive wear. Do not string a series of extension cords together. And unplug extension cords when not in use.
