# UGI Project Now Underway in Emmaus Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

UGI Utilities, Inc. is starting a gas main replacement project in Emmaus on Monday, December 2. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The work is expected to be completed by the end of January and impact the following streets:

* South 4th Street between Minor Street and Fairview Street
* Furnace Street between South 4th Street and South Lehigh Street
* Wood Street between South 4th Street and South Mountain Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
