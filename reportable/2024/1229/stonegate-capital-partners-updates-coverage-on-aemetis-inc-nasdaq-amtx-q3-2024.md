# Stonegate Capital Partners Updates Coverage On Aemetis, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMTX) Q3 2024

DALLAS, TX -- November 13th, 2024 -- Aemetis, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMTX): Stonegate Capital Partners updates coverage on Aemetis, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMTX). Aemetis outlined a 5-year plan to reach $2.0B in revenue and $644M in adjusted EBITDA by 2028 vs F23 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $186.7M and $(22.4)M. respectively. While this is a long-term plan, AMTX has demonstrated its capability to achieve its targets with several key developments this quarter. The Company has successfully increased revenue across all segments. The Keyes Ethanol Plant generated $45.0M in revenue with the production of 15.5M gallons of ethanol. Additionally, AMTX has made significant progress in its carbon sequestration efforts, with the approval of 20 years of Low Carbon Fuel Standard mandates by CARB, which is expected to enhance revenue and earnings from its U.S. projects. We anticipate several regulatory catalysts to be resolved within the next 12 months, further supporting AMTX’s growth trajectory.

These digesters operate in conjunction with a 40-mile gas pipeline that AMTX built in 2023. In FY28, Aemetis is expecting revenue of $190.0M and adjusted EBITDA of $122.6M. AMTX is expected to have an additional 10 dairy’s completed or in progress by FY25.
* Jet/diesel Plant: Aemetis announced in January 2021 that it is planning to build a 90M gallon renewable jet and diesel plant using below zero carbon intensity cellulosic hydrogen produced from waste almond orchard wood. The plant is expected to supply the aviation and truck markets with ultra-low carbon renewable fuels. In 1Q24 AMTX received the important Authority to Construct air permit to build its renewable diesel plant. Aemetis expects revenue of $643.1M and adjusted EBITDA of $165.1M by FY28.

We anticipate that capacity at this site will reach 100M gallons in FY25, with more information expected in the near future as the Company is currently negotiating its next years’ worth of contracts.
* Valuation – We are using a SOTP analysis. We are applying various EV/EBITDA multiples to Aemetis’ F28 projections and apply a discount range of 32.5% to 37.5%. As a result, we arrive at a valuation range of $15.69 to $22.93 with a midpoint of $18.94.
