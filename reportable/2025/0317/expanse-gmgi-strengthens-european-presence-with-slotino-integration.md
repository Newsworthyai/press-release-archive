# Expanse (GMGI) Strengthens European Presence with Slotino Integration

Las Vegas, 17 March 2025 - Expanse Studios, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), continues its international expansion with a new partnership with Slotino, one of Bulgaria’s leading online casino operators. Facilitated by Dench eGaming Solutions, this integration strengthens Expanse Studios’ presence in Europe’s fast-growing iGaming sector, following its successful entry into the U.S. social casino and sweepstakes market.

A High-Growth European iGaming Market

Bulgaria's iGaming sector has seen steady growth, with projections estimating the market will reach USD 680 million by 2025 according to Statista. The country’s progressive regulatory environment and increasing online player adoption make it an attractive market for expansion.

Through Slotino, Expanse Studios gains access to a well-established operator with strong player engagement, positioning its portfolio of 55+ premium slot, crash, and table games in a key Eastern European jurisdiction.

This development follows Expanse Studios’ recent filing for a Romanian Class 2 B2B iGaming license, further expanding its European presence alongside its ongoing success in the U.S. sweepstakes and social casino industry, where its games are now available in 40+ states.

The partnership with Slotino via Dench eGaming Solutions highlights Expanse’s strategy of expanding its B2B content distribution while optimizing cost efficiency. By integrating through Dench’s advanced gaming platform, Expanse Studios reduces reliance on third-party suppliers, ensuring higher margins and greater scalability across multiple regulated markets.

"Our partnership with Slotino marks another key milestone in our global expansion," said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios. "Bulgaria’s iGaming market presents immense opportunities, and through this collaboration, we are strengthening our foothold in Europe. With the scalability of our proprietary content, we remain committed to delivering top-tier gaming experiences that drive value for our partners and investors."
