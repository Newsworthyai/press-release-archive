# UGI System Upgrades Set to Begin Next Week in Bethlehem

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 13, 2025

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin additional system upgrades in Bethlehem on Monday, May 19. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by early July and impact travel on the following roads:

* East Third Street between South New Street and Webster Street
* South New Street between Mechanic Street and East Third Street
* Columbia Street between Webster Street and Adams Street
* Adams Street between Columbia Street and East Third Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities is available at www.ugi.com.
