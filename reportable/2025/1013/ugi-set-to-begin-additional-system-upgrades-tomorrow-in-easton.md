# UGI Set to Begin Additional System Upgrades Tomorrow in Easton

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 13, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project in Easton on Tuesday, October 14. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will occur on William Penn Highway, from Indiana Street to South Nulton Avenue

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers may experience lane restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service that will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main and temporary restoration of the area are expected to be completed by late December. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
