# UGI System Upgrades Underway Along Route 249 in Tioga County

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 13, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. just began a natural gas main replacement project along Route 249, near Middlebury Center, Tioga County. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.

Underground work will happen on Route 249 between Hughes Road and Button Hollow Road.

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers may experience lane restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by late November. Temporary restoration of the area will occur immediately afterwards. Final paving will happen at a later date.
