# UGI Set to Begin  Upgrades in Bethlehem Next Week

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a gas main replacement project in Bethlehem March 3. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by late October and impact the following streets:

* East Washington Avenue between Linden Street and Stefko Boulevard
* Millard Street between East Washington Avenue and Edgeboro Boulevard
* Elm Street between East Washington Avenue and Heller Street
* Linwood Street between East Washington Avenue and Heller Street
* Stefko Boulevard between Pembroke Road and East Washington Avenue
* Wallace Street between East Washington Avenue and Minsi Trail Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
