# UGI Beginning Additional System Upgrades Next Week in Coplay

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a gas main replacement project in Coplay on March 3. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-May and will impact the following streets:

* Center Street between Peach Alley and South 12th Street
* Center Circle between Center Street and End of Center Circle
* South 10th Street between Center Street and Hokendauqua Street
* South 12th Street between Center Street and Magna Drive
* Magna Drive between South 12th Street and Coplay Street
* Coplay Street between Magna Drive and Peach Alley
* Saylor Drive between Magna Drive and Coplay Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
