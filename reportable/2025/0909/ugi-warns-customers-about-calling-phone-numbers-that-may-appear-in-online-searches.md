# UGI Warns Customers About Calling Phone Numbers That May Appear in Online Searches

UGI Utilities, Inc. has been alerted that sponsored online ads created by scammers are tricking people into calling the wrong number when they need help.

In some cases, customers called the scam phone numbers to report the smell of gas and were tricked into thinking they must pay someone to investigate a possible leak. If someone thinks they smell natural gas, or that there is a leak, they should evacuate immediately and get at least the length of a football field away before calling UGI at 800-276-2722 or 911. There is never a cost to the customer for UGI to investigate a potential leak.

Customers have also called the scam phone numbers in the sponsored ads to ask about account issues. If someone needs help with their UGI account, there is only one number to call: 800-276-2722.

The Federal Trade Commission also continues to warn about scammers creating sponsored ads that turn up in online searches, or on social media, that contain fraudulent phone numbers. UGI reminds everyone, if you need to contact UGI, only call 800-276-2722.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available atÂ www.ugi.com.
