# Former NASA Space Shuttle Engineer Releases Groundbreaking Book on Anxiety Relief Through Energy Therapy

Cocoa Beach, FL -- Mark L. Fox, former Space Shuttle Chief Engineer and inventor of the VIBE pocket-sized Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) device, announces the release of his new book, Go Find Joy: The Science of Calm: Erasing Anxiety with Energy Therapy. The book offers a science-based approach to managing anxiety without pharmaceutical intervention, introducing readers to the revolutionary potential of energy therapy.

With anxiety affecting millions worldwide, Fox draws on his background in engineering and two decades of research to present PEMF therapy as an accessible, drug-free solution for those seeking relief from chronic anxiety, pain, PTSD, and sleep disorders. The book features a foreword by Dr. Pedram Shojai, The Urban Monk, who praises Fox's work as "revolutionary" and notes that "finding joy is much easier when we feel safe."

"After 20 years of working with people who've tried every medication and treatment available, I've seen firsthand how PEMF therapy can transform lives," says Fox. "This book isn't just about technology—it's about giving people their joy back."

The book is structured in three parts:

* Part One: Rethink Anxiety – Understanding the modern anxiety epidemic
* Part Two: Ready to Reboot? – Introduction to PEMF therapy and nervous system healing
* Part Three: Make Room for Joy – Practical applications and building a calm practice

Fox's unique perspective combines his engineering expertise with compassionate insight into the struggles of anxiety sufferers. He addresses common skepticism head-on, providing scientific evidence while acknowledging that pharmaceutical companies' dominance in healthcare has kept alternative therapies like PEMF largely unknown to mainstream medicine.

The VIBE device, Fox's invention, operates at frequencies 100,000 times lower than a cell phone and can be worn throughout daily activities. Users have reported relief from conditions including chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, ADD/ADHD, and fibromyalgia.

"Go Find Joy" includes testimonials from clients who have experienced life-changing results, such as a woman who resolved decade-long post-chemotherapy insomnia and another who eliminated 17 years of chronic back pain after just two sessions.

With practical tools, resources, and a 30-day money-back guarantee on the VIBE device, Fox invites readers to take ownership of their health and explore the possibilities of energy therapy.
