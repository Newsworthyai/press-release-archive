# Ceres Holographics, Appotronics combine industry leading display and projection technology to strengthen transparent HUD supply chain for automotive applications

LIVINGSTON, Scotland and SHENZHEN, China – January 07, 2025 - Ceres Holographics, a pioneer in the development of holographic-enabled transparent displays, and Appotronics, a leader in laser display industry, today announced the signing of an agreement to combine their technologies for in-car display solutions, including driver and passenger transparent heads-up display (HUDs). The agreement expands Appotronics’ already strong and growing foothold in automotive laser display and illumination and provides Ceres and its other holographic windshield partners with another key link in the supply chain required to deliver complete systems to its expanding base of OEM customers.

Together the extended partnership combines two proven industry leaders in automotive display technology to provide more intuitive, flexible, and distraction-free high resolution display solutions for next generation vehicles.

A demonstration of the combined HUD system will be shown at CES 2025 at Appotronics demo suite, located at the Ren Boardroom, 2nd floor, Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel, from January 7 to 10, 2025.

“This is a unique combination of strengths that directly responds to OEMs’ need to deliver new innovative experiences to their customers,” said Andy Travers, CEO of Ceres. “This combined offering will bring together proven commercial-ready, automotive-grade projection and hologram manufacturing and accelerate the adoption of advanced transparent display solutions.”

A proven route to manufacturability

The partnership leverages Ceres’ design capability and its HoloFlext™ manufacturing technology and Appotronics’ high-performance ALPD® (Advanced Laser Phosphor Display) projection technology, to meet the size, cost, reliability and viewability requirements of the most innovative automotive OEMs. The two companies have the manufacturing infrastructure in place to quickly implement optimized solutions to address a range of vehicle types and use cases.

Expanding the benefits of ALPD

Appotronics invented the ALPD® technology in 2007, which dramatically reduces the cost of laser light sources. ALPD® has become the mainstream technology in the global laser display industry, and is widely used in cinema, professional AV applications, and smart home solutions. Now the company is creating new applications and markets in automotive illumination and display, developing several innovative automotive-grade display products.

Appotronics has developed a range of innovative solutions for the fast-growing EV market in China and beyond, driving a renaissance in in-cabin experiential technology that goes beyond traditional LED displays. Its projection systems have been implemented in a variety of use cases and it has demonstrated an ability to meet the demanding specifications of automotive applications.

The pairing of a Ceres holographic-enabled windshield or side window and Appotronics high resolution projectors allows car makers to introduce automotive-qualified, safety-oriented, and highly differentiated displays in their vehicles.

“We have seen much interest in our projectors and displays to enhance the user experience in vehicles. With Ceres’ technology, we can leverage our expertise in developing projection systems that meet the needs of automotive use and apply that to transparent displays which provide drivers with safer and more intuitive ways to view critical operational information such as speed, navigation and safety alerts without taking their eyes off the road. The display quality, field of view, and transparency that the Ceres’ holographic films allow creates new and exciting ways for people to consume content from our systems in vehicles of all types.” said Dr. Meng Han, Senior Director of Business Development and Product Marketing of Appotronics Automotive BU.

HOE-enabled displays offer the perfect canvas for ALPD® projector output

Ceres’ precision digital mastering and replication technology overcomes the traditional barriers to the design and manufacture of very large-format Holographic Optical Elements (HOEs) in high volume. HOEs are key to enabling configurable high performance transparent displays for both automotive and other display applications in adjacent markets such as transportation, industrial and consumer. Seamlessly embedded into a windscreen as a thin film over the entire windshield, each precision engineered HOE functional area is paired with a high-resolution Appotronics projector which is discreetly integrated in the vehicle’s instrument panel, making this innovative solution viable for mass adoption.

“This partnership will allow us to offer OEMs a practical and scalable way to deliver display systems with differentiated HMI and UX features that enhance safety and enjoyment. The competitive landscape has shifted, and automakers are taking on more consumer product-like mindsets in terms of the required pace of innovation and feature adoption required for success,” said Travers. “Appotronics has a proven track record of deploying their technology to implement creative and immersive display solutions using non- or semi-transparent surfaces. Now their projector output can be used on fully transparent surfaces such as windshields and side windows, opening up a new realm of user experience opportunities for OEMs.”

Multiple displays possible on a single glass panel

Ceres HoloFlekt® film technology can transform any windscreen or other glass structure into an ultra-bright, full color display. In car windshields it can realize large format pillar-to-pillar HUDs where safety, operational, navigation and infotainment content can all be shown directly to the intended viewer in a clear and non-distractive manner regardless of external light conditions.

Ceres advanced manufacturing technology allows multiple display areas to be implemented into one windshield sized film. Each active display area is paired with its own projector, and its viewing geometry customized for the intended viewer, making it only visible to them, ensuring safety, comfort and optimal UX while keeping the driver’s attention on the road ahead. By enabling multiple display areas in a single sheet of film it saves on total system cost and simplifies the manufacturing process to implement a multi-display transparent HUD.
