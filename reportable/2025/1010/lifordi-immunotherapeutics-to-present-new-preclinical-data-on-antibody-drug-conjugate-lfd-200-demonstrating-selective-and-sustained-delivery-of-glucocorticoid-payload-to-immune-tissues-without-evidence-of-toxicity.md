# Lifordi Immunotherapeutics to Present New Preclinical Data on Antibody Drug Conjugate LFD-200 Demonstrating Selective and Sustained Delivery of Glucocorticoid Payload to Immune Tissues Without Evidence of Toxicity

BURLINGTON, MA – October 10, 2025 -- Lifordi Immunotherapeutics, Inc., a biotech company developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, will present additional preclinical data on its lead candidate LFD-200, an ADC delivering a potent glucocorticoid (GC) directly to immune cells. Results of multiple in vitro and in vivo studies in non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrated that LFD-200 achieves targeted and sustained delivery of its GC payload to immune cells without concurrent safety signals, thus providing the efficacy of steroids without systemic toxicity. These data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2025 meeting taking place October 24-29, 2025 in Chicago, IL.

Consistent with prior studies, these new NHP study data showed that LFD-200 provides targeted and sustained anti-inflammatory effects and a favorable safety profile at clinically relevant doses. Specifically, LFD-200 selectively delivered GC to immune tissues and resulted in inhibition of ex vivo induced inflammatory cytokines with no observed systemic toxicity. LFD-200 has the potential to provide a safer, less frequently dosed GC treatment option for patients living with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
