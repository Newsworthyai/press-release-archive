# UGI System Upgrades Underway in Loyalsock Township Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 10, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. began a natural gas main replacement project in Loyalsock Township this week. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* Country Club Drive between Edercrest Road and East Third Street
* Saint Davids Road between Edercrest Road and East Third Street
* Edercrest Road between Saint Davids Road and Country Club Drive

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane restrictions, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

When installation of the new natural gas main is completed, temporary restoration of the area will occur. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
