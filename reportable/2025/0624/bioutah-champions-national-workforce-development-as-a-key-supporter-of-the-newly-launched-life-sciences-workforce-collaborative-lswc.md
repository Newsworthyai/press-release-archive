# BioUtah Champions National Workforce Development as a Key Supporter of the Newly Launched Life Sciences Workforce Collaborative (LSWC)

Salt Lake City, Utah, June 24, 2025 – BioUtah, Utah's life sciences trade association, today announced its enthusiastic support as an Investor-level contributor to the newly launched Life Sciences Workforce Collaborative (LSWC), a national nonprofit initiative dedicated to strengthening talent pipelines across the U.S. The LSWC, formerly known as the Coalition of State Bioscience Institutes (CSBI), debuted at the recent 2025 BIO International Convention in Boston, MA.

This partnership underscores BioUtah's commitment to fostering a robust and skilled workforce, a critical component of Utah's thriving life sciences ecosystem, recognized as one of the fastest-growing in the nation. The mission of the LSWC to drive life sciences workforce development complements initiatives already underway in Utah. For instance, last year, the Utah state legislature adopted a $4 million workforce program supported by BioUtah to enhance life sciences training at Utah colleges and universities. This year, BioUtah worked with lawmakers to create the Talent Hub program, which targets industry internships as well as a specialized placement program. The Utah Center for Global Talent, part of the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity, promotes job opportunities for new Americans and legal immigrant communities throughout the state, creating career pathways to Utah’s most in-demand sectors.

Along with a stable, strong workforce, Utah's pro-business environment is fertile ground for bioscience companies. The state has been named the #1 state for business by U.S. News and World Report for three consecutive years.

"Utah is a hotbed for life sciences innovation, and our success is deeply intertwined with the strength of our workforce," said Kelvyn Cullimore, president and CEO of BioUtah. "The LSWC aligns perfectly with BioUtah’s efforts to cultivate a skilled talent pool by working with government, education, and industry. Moreover, as life-changing technologies continue to advance, the demand for biomanufacturing and regulatory expertise will only increase, making our participation in this national collaborative more important than ever."

Recent reports have highlighted the demand for life sciences talent in Utah. For example, a 2024 analysis by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah noted that while Utah's overall job growth has slowed, the professional, scientific, and technical services sector, which includes many life sciences roles, continues to be a significant contributor to employment. Furthermore, data from the Utah Department of Workforce Services consistently shows low unemployment rates in the state, indicating a competitive talent market that necessitates proactive workforce strategies. By joining forces with the LSWC, BioUtah will help shape best practices for Utah workforce development and benefit from national insights to further the state's talent pipeline.
