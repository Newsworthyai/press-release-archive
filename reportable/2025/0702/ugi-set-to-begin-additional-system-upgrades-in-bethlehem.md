# UGI Set to Begin Additional System Upgrades in Bethlehem

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 2, 2025

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin system upgrades in Bethlehem on July 9. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. This may also be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The replacement of a gas main will have an impact on the following streets:

* West Graham Place between Brodhead Avenue and Vine Street
* Vine Street between West Graham Place and West Morton Street
* Rink Street between Broadhead Avenue and Vine Street

Construction hours are 7am to 5pm Monday through Friday. Parking will also be restricted during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The underground work is expected to be completed by the early August. Weather and working conditions could delay completion. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
