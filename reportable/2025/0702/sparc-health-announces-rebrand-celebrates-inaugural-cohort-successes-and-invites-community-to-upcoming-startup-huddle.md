# SPARC Health Announces Rebrand, Celebrates Inaugural Cohort Successes, and Invites Community to Upcoming Startup Huddle

SALT LAKE CITY, UT – July 2, 2025 – SPARC Health, a collaborative effort between Park City Angels (PCA), BioUtah, BioHive, and in partnership with the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity (GOEO), announced today its official rebrand from the Utah Healthcare Innovation Network. This strategic change allows SPARC Health to more holistically capture its mission and vision, adopting a name that is both friendlier and more reflective of its core purpose: a “Startup Platform for Advice, Resources, and Community.” The rebrand signifies the organization's growing traction and commitment to fostering innovation within Utah's life science/healthcare ecosystem.

Currently, SPARC Health is halfway through their inaugural cohort program where nine health tech companies are learning about crucial aspects for early-stage company success. Topics of the first five sessions include: Structured Growth Strategies, Avoiding Common Pitfalls such as poor product market fit, running out of cash and assembling the wrong team, Fundraising Fundamentals and Entrepreneurial Skill Development. The cohort’s programming is scheduled to conclude by the end of August, with applications for a second cohort anticipated to open later this year.

Notable cohort company successes include:

* Bloom Surgical successfully closed their seed funding round, raising an impressive one million dollars. They have also expanded their operations team by hiring a business operations manager.
* A second cohort company, RefloDx recently secured $250,000 in investments after winning a competition for the Trans-Atlantic Angel Group, and presenting at an otolaryngology conference in Paris, France.
* A third cohort company is in negotiations to take on a new member of the executive team.

Invitation to the Upcoming Startup Huddle:

SPARC Health is pleased to invite the community to its next "Startup Huddle" on Monday, July 7th, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, at the Salt Mine productive workspace in Sandy. This huddle provides a unique platform to highlight emerging startup companies within the ecosystem. Unlike traditional fundraising pitches, companies are encouraged to present specific challenges they are facing—whether business, regulatory, or intellectual property issues. The audience will comprise experienced Health tech operational leaders, mentors and angel investors who will offer free guidance, advice, and diverse perspectives. This innovative approach not only offers companies valuable visibility but also provides health tech investors with an early look at promising ventures.

Two companies from the current cohort will be highlighted at the upcoming huddle: Diagnostic Ventures and RefloDx.
