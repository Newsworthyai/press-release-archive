# VueReal Expands Reference Design Kit Portfolio with Industry-Specific Bundles to Accelerate MicroLED Commercialization

Waterloo, Ontario – April 29, 2025—VueReal, the pioneer of MicroSolid Printing™, today announced a significant expansion of its Reference Design Kit (RDK) portfolio with new industry-specific bundles. Purpose-built for automotive and consumer electronics, the vertical RDKs are designed to fast-track microLED product development and commercialization with unprecedented speed and integration readiness. The next-gen bundles, debuting at Display Week 2025 in San Jose, validate VueReal’s mission to unlock scalable, sustainable microLED adoption across global markets.

By delivering comprehensive, ready-to-integrate kits tailored to the unique requirements of automotive and consumer electronics, VueReal enables customers to move from evaluation to product launch faster and with lower risk—while supporting the industry’s shift toward more eco-friendly manufacturing.

VueReal’s RDKs further propel the microLED display market toward a projected $30 billion valuation by 2030. VueReal’s RDK bundles are the first to offer fully integrated, application-optimized microLED displays that can be directly incorporated into real-world products. This is enabled by the company’s patented MicroSolid Printing™ platform, which serves as the technological foundation for high-yield, scalable microdevice integration.

“These new RDKs are more than evaluation kits—they’re plug-and-play blueprints for real product development,” said Dr. Reza Chaji, Founder and CEO of VueReal. “By introducing tailored reference design bundles for automotive and consumer electronics, we enable engineering and design to move from concept to scalable production faster and more reliably. This evolution reflects our commitment to making microLED and broader micro semiconductor innovation accessible and practical for real-world applications.”

Purpose-Built Kits for Automotive and Consumer ElectronicsEach RDK bundle includes pre-configured, integration-ready microLED displays tailored for:

●     Automotive applications: intelligent taillights, in-glass applications, AR heads-up displays (HUDs), interior lighting, and infotainment systems

●     Consumer electronics: wearables, embedded smart displays, and AR interfaces

Unlike traditional demo kits, these new bundles are designed for direct integration. Product teams can evaluate performance, test real-world use cases, and begin scaling with fewer iterations and less guesswork. At the core of every kit is MicroSolid Printing™, a cartridge-based platform that transfers millions of microdevices—LEDs, chiplets, and sensors—with unmatched precision, yield, and throughput.

Accelerating Product Development and InnovationWith these new vertical RDK bundles, VueReal helps partners:

●     Validate products faster, with ready-to-integrate, application-specific designs

●     Reduce development risk, by leveraging proven, production-grade platforms

●     Expand design possibilities, due to transparent, ultra-bright, and low-power microLED options

●     Scale efficiently, using a platform that grows with demand without requiring high capital investment

MicroSolid Printing™: Solving the Transfer ProblemMass transfer has long been the primary challenge of mass adoption of microLED. VueReal’s MicroSolid Printing™ solves this through:

●     Parallel, additive transfer with >99.999% yield

●     Up to 5x faster throughput than laser or pick-and-place

●     Modular printer architecture for seamless reconfiguration

●     Scalable from prototyping to high-volume production

●     Compatible with multiple device types (LEDs, chiplets, sensors, photonics)

This platform powers VueReal’s own production and is available to OEMs and fabs as a licensable blueprint, enabling localized, cost-effective scaling of advanced microdevice technologies.

Live at SID Display Week 2025VueReal will showcase its new industry RDK bundles and the MicroSolid Printing™ platform at Booth 1447 during Display Week 2025. To book a demo or meeting, visit: www.vuereal.com/sid2025. Additionally, for media interviews, please contact Katherine Waite.
