# UGI System Upgrades Underway in Emmaus Could Fuel Natural Gas Conversions

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: April 7, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. has started additional system upgrades in Emmaus. The gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by early August and will impact travel on the following streets:

* Minor Street between Seventh Street and South 5th Street
* Seventh Street between Furnace Street and Minor Street
* Furnace Street between Seventh Street and John Street
* Palencar Street between Furnace Street and Iron Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
