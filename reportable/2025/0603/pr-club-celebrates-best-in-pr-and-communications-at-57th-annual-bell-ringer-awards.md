# PR Club Celebrates Best in PR and Communications at 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards

BOSTON, MA — On June 3, 2025 the PR Club welcomed more than 200 public relations and communications professionals to the Museum of Science for the 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards, marking its return to pre-pandemic attendance levels and debut at the iconic Boston venue. The celebration—”A Night at the Bell Ringers”—was hosted by Emily Schario, an Emmy-nominated multimedia journalist and Head of Content for The B-Side, a Boston Globe Media newsletter. The event spotlighted the region’s most impactful PR campaigns as well as the professionals and teams behind them. The Bell Ringer Awards honor excellence across the full spectrum of communications, from single-tactic executions to comprehensive, multi-channel campaigns.

“Bringing the Bell Ringers to the Museum of Science for the first time felt like a milestone—and the energy in the room reflected that,” said Kaitlynn Cooney, PR Club President. “It was incredible to gather with our community, recognize truly outstanding work, and celebrate how far the industry has come. From students and rising stars to veterans and visionaries, the Bell Ringers showcased the best of New England’s communications talent.”

Agencies across New England were recognized for their outstanding work, with several firms standing out for both the volume and quality of their winning entries. Duffy & Shanley led the evening with 12 awards, including four Gold Bells. Their campaign, “Dunkin’ Launches the Dunkalatte,” submitted in the Single-Item – Events category, was the only entry of the night to receive a perfect score. RDW Group followed with 10 wins, showcasing consistent strength in campaign execution. 360PR+ earned nine awards, including four Gold Bells, all of which qualified for the prestigious Platinum Super Bell, demonstrating consistent excellence across some of the year’s most competitive categories. A full list of all winners is available here.

Top Honors at the 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards

The evening’s top honor, the Platinum Super Bell Award, went to 360PR+ for “Steering CarGurus Thought Leadership,” an executive thought leadership campaign that elevated CarGurus’ media presence. By positioning Director of Industry Analytics Kevin Roberts as a go-to expert, the agency secured over 600 media placements, more than 6 billion impressions, and coverage in top outlets including CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, and the Associated Press.

The John J. Molloy Crystal Bell Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Amy Shanler, associate professor at Boston University’s College of Communication and a past PR Club president.

Known as the “heart and soul” of the Club, she has contributed over 25 years of tireless volunteer service, mentoring rising professionals, managing rebrands and budgets, and ensuring the Club’s programs and events thrived—even during the Club’s most challenging moments.

The Striker Award, recognizing early-career achievement, was presented to Erin Fennell of V2 Communications. Since joining the firm in 2023, Fennell has played a critical role across multiple high-impact client accounts, led award-winning media campaigns and helped mentor the next generation of V2 talent.

Julianna Sheridan, Vice President at Matter Communications, received the Ringer Award, which celebrates a mid-career professional who is not only excelling in client service and leadership, but also shaping agency strategy and culture. Sheridan was honored for spearheading Matter’s growing crisis communications practice while mentoring rising talent and driving business growth.

New this year, the Carillonneur Professional Award celebrates outstanding workplace culture in PR and communications. The inaugural honor went to V2 Communications for its people-first approach to leadership, growth, and development. Inspired by the carillonneur—a symbol of unity and collaboration—the award recognizes organizations where employees thrive, and V2’s intentional investment in mentorship, mobility, and culture made it a standout.
