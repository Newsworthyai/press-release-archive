# UGI System Upgrades Set to Start Tomorrow in Topton Borough

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: November 11, 2025

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin a system upgrade project in Topton Borough on Wednesday, November 12. The natural gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.  The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-December and have an impact on the following streets:

* Intersection of Weis Street and South Home Avenue
* South Home Avenue and Home Avenue from Weis Street
* Reinert Drive at Tower Drive
* Rear Parking Lot of Brandywine Community Library and Diakon Lutheran Ministries

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may have an impact on the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
