# From Mindset to Mastery: The Conscious Revolution Behind Zionix Global

Phuket, Thailand -- Visionary entrepreneur and transformational leader Jenna Zwagil, CEO of Zionix Global, is leading a new wave of conscious innovation that’s capturing global attention. After a landmark debut in Dubai, Zionix now takes its movement to Phuket, Thailand on February 27–28, 2026 — an immersive two-day experience uniting personal growth, community, and transformation.

Where Mindset Meets FrequencyZionix Global is redefining how the world experiences success. Built on three pillars — automation, education, and alignment — the company empowers individuals to adapt to the digital age while reprogramming their inner blueprint for abundance.

“Technology can support transformation — but mindset changes your reality,” says Jenna Zwagil. “Zionix was designed to merge human potential with conscious innovation. When you align your frequency, your actions become a multiplier.”

A Transformational Keynote: Reprogramming the Subconscious Mind for Freedom and FulfillmentAt the heart of the Phuket summit, Zwagil will deliver a Bob Proctor–inspired keynote on Reprogramming the Subconscious Mind for Freedom and Fulfillment, a talk that bridges neuroscience, quantum law, and practical personal empowerment.

Attendees will learn how to shift limiting beliefs that block abundance, align vibration with purpose, integrate mindset mastery into daily life, and bridge the gap between energy and achievement.

This keynote experience will remind participants that real transformation begins within — and that the mind is the most powerful tool for change.

A Global Experience Like No OtherThe Zionix Global Thailand Summit offers two immersive days of transformation and conscious leadership:

* Mindset & Frequency Activation — live coaching experiences inspired by Bob Proctor and other legendary thought leaders.
* Leadership & Community Training — for educators, coaches, and conscious entrepreneurs expanding the movement.
* Personal Mastery Sessions — led by the Zionix executive team, exploring inner alignment, resilience, and energetic flow.
* Cultural Immersion & Connection — a chance to recharge, realign, and build meaningful relationships in one of the world’s most breathtaking destinations.
