# Stonegate Updates Coverage on Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TCBX) Q4 2024

DALLAS, TX -- January 27th, 2024 -- Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TCBX): Stonegate Capital Partners updates their coverage on Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. For 4Q24, Third Coast reported net income of $13.7M, up from $12.8M in 3Q24. This was equal to a basic and diluted EPS of $0.92 and $0.79, respectively. The Q/Q growth was primarily attributed to higher net interest income, driven by loan growth and increased investments in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with correspondent banks. However, this increase was partially offset by a slightly higher provision for credit losses and rising expenses related to salaries and employee benefits. We anticipate that the Company will continue prioritizing operational efficiency by sustaining its 1% improvement initiative. This strategy is expected to support Third Coast in the current macroeconomic landscape.

We note that this remains elevated compared to the median comps NIM of 3.39%. Year over year NIM increased 10bps from 3.61%.
