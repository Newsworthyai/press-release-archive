# New Entrepreneur Article: Three Women Who Turned Personal Loss into Leadership, Purpose, and Legacy

Entrepreneur has published a new article to inspire readers, “How Loss Can Become the Fuel for Your Legacy,” by exploring how three women — Lindsay O’Neill-O'Keefe, Pam Gold, and Jenna Zwagil — rebuilt their lives and careers after major personal disruption. Read the full article HERE.

Written by Wellness Eternal founder Lindsay O’Neill-O'Keefe, the article traces how back-to-back divorces, pandemic uncertainty, and the collapse of a business partnership became the unexpected foundation for rebuilding her company and redefining her mission.

The story also highlights two women whose paths of reinvention helped shape Lindsay's own:

* Pam Gold, founder of HACKD Fitness (now PRTL), who evolved her NYC performance-tech studio into a space centered on nervous system regulation, clarity, and whole-person wellness as the post-pandemic world shifted away from “faster” toward “fuller.”
* Jenna Zwagil, who moved from homelessness to multimillion-dollar entrepreneurship, later losing her marriage and sense of identity — then rebuilding her life around three principles: wisdom, wealth, and wellness, while raising four children and speaking publicly about sovereignty and alignment.

Together, the narratives reflect a broader trend among women entrepreneurs. As the article cites, single mothers now lead one in three women-owned businesses in the U.S., with the majority pursuing growth not for vanity metrics but for generational impact.

The piece underscores a shared theme: reinvention isn’t a dramatic pivot — it’s a series of small, values-driven decisions shaped by truth, resilience, and community.

 Wellness Eternal is led by Lindsay O'Neill, a visionary and dynamic leader who has earned recognition in some of the most prestigious outlets. Lindsay is one of MSN’s 2025 Top 10 Notable Women, recognized by NY Weekly Mag, Business Insider, Crain’s NY and Forbes as a Top Entrepreneur, a TEDx and Gaia speaker, and a Harvard Certified Culinary Medicine Chef. She was also featured in Women's Health Magazine 2025 for her expertise in Biohacking & Wellness.
