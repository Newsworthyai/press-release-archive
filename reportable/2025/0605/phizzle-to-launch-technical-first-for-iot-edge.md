# Phizzle to Launch Technical First for IoT Edge

San Francisco, CA – June 5, 2025– Phizzle, Inc., will launch on June 10th a technical first for the IoT Edge: the industry’s only purpose-built computer inside a gateway that is malware-hardened to format and normalize data from any device or machine in edge use cases, including pharma manufacturing, building automation and AI systems, among others.

“The promise of the IoT Edge has been limited by the problem of data formatting, making it nearly impossible to automate workflows without some kind of manual intervention,” said Ben Davis, Phizzle Founder and CEO. Davis added: "That’s why we are working with pharma manufacturers like Merck to format and normalize data from air particle counters into LIMS systems."

According to Phizzle’s Chief Innovation Officer, Michael Patrick, the EDGE Puck has three fundamental innovations in one integrated platform:

1. A computer system is housed within the puck, which contains Phizzle’s software solution, including a device agent and a data formatting engine that normalizes data for any database system.
2. The puck itself is a gateway that solves the problem of connectivity to both any instrument and the necessary IT infrastructure.
3. The software is read-only, meaning it can’t be altered or manipulated by malware.

“Our microservices architecture software is at the heart of the innovation in the EDGE Puck,” said Patrick. “Data formatting in a vendor-agnostic way isn’t possible with traditional architectures.”

Product Features & Specs:

1. Malware-Hardened - Secure by Nature
2. Easy Connectivity - 5 Simple Steps
3. Data Normalization - Vendor-Agnostic Data Formatting Engine
