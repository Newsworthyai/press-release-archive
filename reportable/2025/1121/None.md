# Safe Streets, Strong Economies: How Community Safety Drives  Business Growth

The Southern California Wine Country region is not only a scenic and lifestyle-rich place — it is also rapidly becoming a business destination thanks to a strong emphasis on community safety and livability. As companies look to relocate or expand, the region’s reputation for safe streets, stable neighborhoods and responsive local governments is proving to be a key differentiator.

“In today’s competitive marketplace for business expansion, community safety is no longer optional—it’s foundational. When a company considers our region, they’re looking for certainty: safe infrastructure, stable neighborhoods, a workforce that feels invested. Our region delivers on all of those. We believe that safe streets create strong economies, and we see that dynamic playing out in every business we recruit, every expansion we support,” stated Connie Stopher, CEcD, Executive Director, SoCal Wine Country EDC.

In cities like Temecula, public safety is recognized as the foundation of economic vitality. “Our City’s beauty and safeness fuel the local economy and continue to attract upscale development, redevelopment projects, and new business establishments, which is why Temecula invests heavily into public safety,” stated Mayor Brenden Kalfus.

In Temecula, the latest crime index registers at 123 — nearly half the national average for similar‐sized U.S. cities. City of Menifee’s, violent crime rates are reported at less than 9 per 1,000 residents, significantly below county and national average. Riverside County’s violent crime rate is approximately 65 per 100,000 – more than 38% below the U.S. average

For the Southern California Wine Country Economic Development Coalition (SoCal Wine Country EDC), safety is not simply a social good — it is a business catalyst. Firms relocating or expanding often ask: Will our employees feel safe? Will supply-chain logistics operate smoothly? Will our site recruit talent easily? The region answers “yes” to all three.

"As someone who works with the community along with programs for youth, teens, adults, mainstream and special needs, it's important to be in an area that represents safety. I want families to feel safe when dropping off their kids and family members for creative programs, events and classes. Being located inside a city that understands that and makes it a priority is important when relocating and or expanding a business," shared Diane Strand, Executive Producer JDS Studio & nonprofit founder JDS Creative Academy, in Temecula.

Why Safety Equals Business Growth

1. Talent attraction and retention.

Companies relocating want regions where employees will stay, feel safe, invest in the community and thrive. With a business environment that emphasizes safe neighborhoods and quality-of-life, the region becomes more attractive to both employers and employees.

2. Operational reliability and cost-efficiency.

Fewer disruptions, lower security costs, stable infrastructure and less turnover all support strong business operations. Firms in advanced manufacturing, distribution, logistics and other sectors benefit when local government and partners champion infrastructure, safety and community stability.

3. Site selection advantage.

When site selectors or corporate real estate teams evaluate regions, they look for “business-friendly, safe and welcoming” places. Regions that tie safety, quality of life and business-development incentives create a powerful narrative. The SoCal Wine Country region offers targeted incentives for companies in advanced manufacturing, aerospace, life sciences and cleantech — in addition to a dedicated site-selection platform that gives real-time access to available properties and workforce/demographic data. Through programs like the Business Assistance NOW Program, firms relocating or expanding here can access financial resources, training subsidies and streamlined permitting support — all of which stem from the region’s emphasis on safe, stable communities as a foundation for business growth.

4. Community and brand strength.

A region known for safety strengthens its brand: for residents, visitors, businesses and investors alike. That positive image further attracts investment, which fuels expansion, talent and further improvements — a virtuous cycle.

Regional Efforts and Projects

The Southern California Wine Country EDC represents a region encompassing Temecula, Menifee, Lake Elsinore and unincorporated areas of southwestern Riverside County. While the specific redevelopment and safety-infrastructure projects in the public domain are still being communicated, the region’s public-safety and economic-development strategies point clearly toward alignment and regional collaboration.

SoCal Wine Country region offers not only lifestyle and location advantages but business-friendly policies and infrastructure oriented toward manufacturing, distribution and tech. In the region, firms in advanced manufacturing, distribution and high-tech benefit from:

• A dedicated site-selection portal (RivCoSites.com)

• Major transportation infrastructure linking to Los Angeles, San Diego and the ports.

• Incentives and specialized support programs for sectors like aerospace, cleantech and advanced manufacturing.

• A well-established manufacturing/distribution base and business environment characterized by expedited permitting, pro-active city and county economic-development teams and a strong local workforce.

Looking Ahead

As SoCal Wine Country EDC focuses on expanding business attraction and retention, the theme of safe streets equating to strong businesses will be front and center. Highlighting the intersection of public-safety investment and business growth, the EDC will continue to work with municipalities in the region to showcase safety-driven infrastructure and community development projects. For firms exploring new sites in advanced manufacturing, logistics, life sciences or tech — or looking to expand an existing presence — the message is clear: a region where community safety is a priority is a region where businesses can grow.
