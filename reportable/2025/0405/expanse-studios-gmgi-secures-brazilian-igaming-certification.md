# Expanse Studios (GMGI) Secures Brazilian iGaming Certification

Las Vegas, April 5, 2025 — Expanse Studios, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), has received the game certification for the Brazilian market. Issued by Gaming Laboratories International (GLI). The certification covers Expanse’s proprietary crash game Super Heli, one of the company’s best-performing titles globally. The game was certified under GLI Report Number MO-711-MEN-24-03-711, in full compliance with Brazil’s federal iGaming technical standards.

The certification, formally requested by Brazil’s Secretariat of Prizes and Betting (SPA/MF), authorizes the distribution of Super Heli in the country’s newly regulated iGaming market. Additional Expanse Studios games are currently in the process of certification.

Strategic Significance

Brazil represents one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing regulated gaming markets. According to industry projections, the Brazilian iGaming and sports betting market is expected to exceed the worth of USD 9 billion by 2029. Expanse Studios’ certification provides a direct pathway to capturing a share of this market, strengthening the company’s international presence following its successful social casino expansion across the U.S., where Expanse games are available in over 40 states.

The certification complements Golden Matrix Group’s broader Brazilian market strategy. In March 2025, Golden Matrix subsidiary Meridianbet received a definitive federal license (No. 0086/2024) from Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, authorizing nationwide online and retail betting operations until December 31, 2029. This dual advancement—both B2C (Meridianbet) and B2B (Expanse Studios)—reinforces the group’s long-term positioning in Brazil’s regulated gaming ecosystem.

About Super Heli

Super Heli is an innovative crash-type iGaming title where players bet on a rising multiplier and attempt to cash out before it crashes. The game offers a return-to-player (RTP) rate ranging from 85.90% to 97.00% and a maximum win potential of 10,000x, combining high-risk excitement with scalable entertainment value.

“Our first certification in Brazil marks a significant milestone in our global expansion strategy,” said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios. “Brazil’s regulated iGaming market offers substantial growth potential, and Super Heli’s certification opens the door for the broader deployment of our proprietary content. Together with Meridianbet’s definitive betting license, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders in this important market.”
