# Adelaide Perez Brings Ocean Beauty to the Canvas

Who is Adelaide Janet Perez?

At just 17, Adelaide Janet Perez is already making waves (pun absolutely intended) with her paintings — vivid, emotional works that blend realism with a deep love for nature. Her art doesn’t just show you the sea’s beauty; it makes you feel it, and maybe even think a little more about how we protect it.

Adelaide’s journey started young at eight-years-old, sketching characters from TV shows and her own imagination. She experimented with all sorts of styles over the years, but around fifteen, something clicked. She found herself drawn to scenic and realistic pieces. Specifically focusing on capturing the beauty of people, places, and, most of all, the natural world.

“Art has made a huge impact on how I see the world today,” Adelaide says. “It’s inspired me to focus on the beauty of people, places, and even the world itself.”

Life With the Ocean

The ocean has always been in Adelaide’s life. Childhood beach trips were fun, but they also showed her the inspiration that can come from nature. It’s easy to see that in her paintings: shimmering blues, playful light, and the kind of detail that makes you want to reach out and touch the water.

“Since I was little, going to the beach had always been a favorite trip of mine. I’d always been fascinated with the ocean and continue to have a deep love for ocean life,” she shares.

She hopes her work stirs up the same feelings. Maybe nostalgia for sandy days, or a curiosity to explore the ocean. Maybe the feeling of reigniting your passion for a project and using the inspiration to create your own work.

Where Mountains Meet the Sea

For Adelaide, painting isn’t just about creating something beautiful. It’s about connection and awareness to the life around her.

“I want people to see how magnificent the ocean can truly be through my art,” she says. “But I also want people to be aware that such a beautiful place could be easily mistreated if ignored.”

She’s inspired by stories of small acts of care because they show that even tiny efforts can add up to something meaningful.

Advice for Younger Artists

Adelaide is a young artist and has inspired many others to pursue art and to try new things. Her advice is simple yet powerful:

“Anything is possible if you put in the work. If you keep telling yourself you want to be an artist or learn art, just go ahead and do it! It doesn’t matter how talented you are as long as you don’t give up.”

Looking ahead, Adelaide hopes her work inspires people to see and protect the planet, and maybe even book that trip they’ve been dreaming about to experience these places firsthand.
