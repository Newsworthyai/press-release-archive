# UGI Set to Make System Upgrades Next Week on Manheim Pike in Lancaster County

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 22, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project on Monday, July 28, 2025, along Manheim Pike. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-September and impact travel on the following streets:

* Manheim Pike between Abraso Street and Dexter Avenue
* Dexter Avenue between Manheim Avenue and Manheim Pike

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday from 6:00pm until 6:00am. On August 18, work hours are expected to shift to daytime, between 7:00am and 3:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
