# Canadian Club Signs on as Official Partner of Canada Soccer and Canadian Premier League

TORONTO, ON – October 16, 2025 – Canadian Club has joined the starting lineup as an Official Partner of Canada Soccer and the Canadian Premier League. This marks the beginning of a spirited three-year partnership with soccer’s national governing body and its domestic men’s professional league at a time when the sport is experiencing unprecedented growth in Canada and igniting hearts across the country.

For generations, Canadian Club has been a symbol of pride and connection for Canadians. With a long history of bringing people together, the brand is stepping onto the field with a deep desire to support something bigger than itself and unite fans from coast to coast. With a powerful line-up of assets and a proudly Canadian voice, Canadian Club is championing the sport’s momentum, showing up where it matters most to fans, celebrating the energy, passion, and identity Canadian soccer inspires as it approaches a monumental moment.

“Canadian Club has always stood for the pride and resilience of Canada, and we’re honoured to bring that same energy to Canadian soccer,” said Deepti Gurkar, Senior Director, National Marketing and Global Canadian Brands, Suntory Global Spirits. “This partnership is about more than just showing up on the sidelines, it brings Canadian Club into the heart of the action in immersive ways that are uniquely Canadian.”

Canadian Club will join the millions of fans who are already pouring passion and pride into Canadian soccer as the exclusive whisky and whisky-based RTD beverage partner of Canada Soccer and the Canadian Premier League (CPL) through 2027.

Celebrating Canadian Spirit on the World’s Stage with Canada Soccer

It’s a meaningful move for a brand that’s long celebrated Canadian identity. Canadian Club will support Canada’s international and professional players from the pitch to the retail floor as the country prepares to take centre stage on home turf next year, creating content shaped by what happens on the field, and connecting with fans through real-world activations and digital storytelling.

Fans won’t have to look far to spot Canadian Club at Canada Soccer National Team home matches. Canadian Club will be present with branded LED signage around the stadium and on-site activations, sampling opportunities at select fanfests and VIP events, and pouring rights at marquee Canada Soccer events next year. These touchpoints will bring supporters closer to the energy and emotion building across Canada and help celebrate a sport that’s bringing the country together in powerful ways.

“We are thrilled to welcome Canadian Club to the Canada Soccer partner family at such a monumental moment for our sport,” said Dominic Martin, Canada Soccer Director, Marketing. “With Canadian Club’s deep connection to Canadian heritage and bold national presence, this is a partnership that will elevate the fan experience in stadiums and communities across the country.”

Kicking Off Coast to Coast with the Canadian Premier League

Canadian Club’s presence on the country’s soccer scene will also extend from coast to coast through its partnership with the Canadian Premier League. The brand will have a visible presence in stadiums from Halifax, NS to Vancouver Island, BC through signage, matchday sampling and in-person experiences such as pre-game gatherings and special touches in select VIP suites. Canadian Club will activate at marquee events such as the CPL Final and its VIP reception, as well as the CPL Awards.

“Canadian Club is a brand that, like soccer, is woven into the fabric of our country. As the game in Canada reaches unprecedented heights, we’re proud to welcome such an iconic Canadian partner to both Canada Soccer and the Canadian Premier League,” said Glen Johnson, Executive Vice President, Canadian Premier League and Canadian Soccer Business. “Together, we’ll elevate the fan experience and create memorable moments that celebrate our shared pride, passion, and identity on home soil and beyond.”
