# UGI Set to Begin Additional System Upgrades Next Week in the City of Lancaster

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: November 7, 2025

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin a system upgrade project in Lancaster on Monday, November 10th. The natural gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-January and have an impact on the following streets:

* West Mifflin Street between South Mulberry Street and South Water Street
* Hoffman Terrace
* South Water Street between West King Street and West Mifflin Street
* West Grant Street between North Arch Street and North Water Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may have an impact on the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
