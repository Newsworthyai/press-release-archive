# The Sovereign AI Access Company Nominates 0G Labs and Manifest Network to Chair “DeAI Industry Steering Committee”

MIAMI – Sept. 19, 2025 – The Sovereign AI Access Company (SAAC) announces the addition of two founding members to its Decentralized AI Steering Committee and Treasury. The Steering Committee is composed of industry leaders working at the intersection of AI and Blockchain that each represents a unique component of the Decentralized AI (DeAI) technology stack. Manifest Network will represent the DeAI Compute sector with ZeroG Labs, the parent company of the 0G blockchain, representing DeAI Training.

The DeAI Steering Committee seeks interoperability and commercialization of Decentralized AI platforms, applications and agents, seeking to standardize and vertically align the components of the rapidly evolving blockchain-based AI industry. “The collaboration of 0G, a decentralized Layer1, and Manifest Network, a decentralized Layer0 is a great example of vertical alignment that will benefit both projects.”, says Sovereign AI Access Company CEO John Sarson

As recognized leaders in decentralized AI, 0G and Manifest bring next-gen blockchain solutions to the market.

0G’s AI-optimized blockchain operating system unlocks unprecedented large-scale AI model training directly on-chain for the first time, introducing essential speed, scalability, and robust process controls that bring new guardrails to the AI sector.

Manifest Network’s "Sovereign Soldiers” have built and deployed a first-of-its-kind, distributed, enterprise-grade, AI server network. Its permissionless compute network provides the security and performance of private AI infrastructure while maintaining the same ease-of-use and on-demand scalability of traditional cloud services.

The Sovereign AI Access Company (SAAC) serves as an implementation and commercialization team for the projects it holds in its Treasury. This unique framework enables infrastructure deployment at scale, strategic investment, and broad investor participation in the DeAI economy. Its carefully curated DeAI Steering Committee provides strategic direction for the broader DeAI community with the ability to directly assist and incentivize projects to adopt the technical standards set by the committee, thereby improving the vertical alignment of the broader DeAI industry.

“This is about creating durable infrastructure and interoperability standards that will allow DeAI to grow outside the boundaries of big tech and centralized clouds,” said Eric Bravick of Manifest Network. “We are designing a system that benefits developers, operators, and institutional partners alike.”

As a “Layer1”, 0G Labs has pioneered the first high-speed, low-latency blockchain, 0G. 0G delivers decentralized, scalable, web3 infrastructure optimized for AI workloads, with a token-driven ecosystem supporting applications, agents, and trusted execution environments. Together with other Steering Members, OG and Manifest will steward capital allocations, set technology standards, and drive ecosystem adoption and expansion,

“We see this as a turning point for decentralized AI,” said John Sarson, CEO and Founder of the Sovereign AI Access Company. “By combining public company structure with real-world infrastructure deployment, we are creating a framework that can support both innovation and collaboration. Technology stacks need to stabilize and standardize. Manifest and 0G each represent the leading technologies in their segments of the market.”

Sarson Funds, Inc, serves as the company’s financial partner and Treasury manager assisting with capital market transactions, compliance, and operational support for SAAC. Sarson Funds has organized a 50-person team of veteran Web2 and Web3 operators to assist with adoption and commercialization of DeAI and Web3 protocols. With active guidance from the DeAI Steering Committee, SAAC and Sarson Funds collaborate to standardize the DeAI Industry and drive vertical integration.

Members of the SAAC share a common vision that fair and open access to AI and compute will be a fundamental need in the protection of personal liberty. According to DeAI Steering Committee member W. Reed Baum, “In order to effectively compete with AI offerings from already vertically-aligned big tech competitors, the DeAI industry needs to build systems that are interoperable and easily accessible. [sic] In a world where training AI models can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, effective decentralized, permissionless networks are humanity’s best chance to preserve the individual’s ability to access private AI solutions.”.
