# Wendt Partners Expands Toronto Office to Support Canadian Growth

October 28th, 2025, New York, NY- Wendt Partners is excited to announce the relocation and exposition of it's Toronto office as part of the Company's ongoing growth across Canada. Our new space at 180 John Street, just off Queen Street West in Old Toronto, places us right in the heart of the city’s creative and business community, just ten minutes from Union Station via TTC Line 1.

This move reflects our continued investment in serving Canadian enterprises with world-class HubSpot CRM implementation, integration, and strategy.

“With our team frequently traveling in and out of Toronto via Union Station and Pearson Airport, this new location perfectly positions us for even stronger collaboration with our Canadian clients,” - Doug Wendt, President, Wendt Partners

A Decade of Canadian Partnership

For nearly ten years, Wendt Partners has supported hundreds of Canadian companies, from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, helping them optimize their sales, marketing, and operations through the HubSpot Enterprise CRM platform.

With the expansion of our Toronto operations, we’re proud to continue that mission with an even stronger local presence and on-the-ground expertise.

Supporting Canadian Clients, Dollar-for-Dollar

To further simplify business for our Canadian clients, Wendt Partners offers US Dollar (USD) to Canadian Dollar (CAD) pricing parity, meaning the same dollar amount applies in either currency. This approach provides an immediate cost advantage of up to 30% versus standard exchange rates.

“Whatever we charge in USD, we’ll charge the same in CAD. It’s our way of making world-class HubSpot services more accessible to Canadian businesses.” -Doug Wendt

Leading Our Growth in Toronto

We’re also pleased to announce the appointment of Samantha Canon as Toronto Office Lead.

A seasoned UX strategist and long-time member of the Wendt Partners team, Samantha brings years of experience helping Canadian businesses grow smarter through CRM transformation.

“As a proud Torontonian, I’m thrilled to see this city’s innovation scene thrive, and to help more Canadian businesses tap into the power of HubSpot.” - Samantha Canon, Toronto Office Lead

In her new role, Samantha will lead local client relationships, growth strategy, and in-market resources for organizations nationwide.

Growing Globally, Rooted Locally

With headquarters in New York City and offices in Toronto, London, and Melbourne, plus Centers of Excellence in Colombia and South Africa, Wendt Partners continues to serve enterprise clients around the world.

We’re proud to bring that global expertise and multilingual team to every Canadian engagement, ensuring that our clients benefit from both local insight and international best practices.
