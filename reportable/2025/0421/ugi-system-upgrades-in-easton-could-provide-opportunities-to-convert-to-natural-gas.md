# UGI System Upgrades in Easton Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: April 21, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin system upgrades in Easton on April 23, 2025. The gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by mid-September and will impact travel on the following streets:

* Northampton Street between Wood Ave and North 6th Street
* North Union Street between Northampton Street and Church Street
* North 6th Street between Northampton Street and Church Street
* Church Street between North 6th Street and North 5th Street
* North 5th Street between Church Street and End of North 5th Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
