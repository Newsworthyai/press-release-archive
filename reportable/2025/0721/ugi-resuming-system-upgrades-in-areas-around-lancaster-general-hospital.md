# UGI Resuming System Upgrades in Areas Around  Lancaster General Hospital

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 21, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is resuming a natural gas main replacement project on Monday, July 21, 2025, in Lancaster City, including the area around Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by the end of September and will impact travel on the following streets:

* North Duke Street between East Clay Street and East Chestnut Street
* East Frederick Street between North Christian Street and North Duke Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
