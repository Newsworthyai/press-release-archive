# UGI’s Natural Gas Supply Costs Rise,                Customers to See 0.9% Bill Increase

UGI Utilities, Inc. is announcing a smaller-than-expected increase in the purchased gas cost rate beginning on December 1, 2025. As a result, the average residential heating customer receiving gas supply from UGI will see their total bill increase 0.9%, raising their total average monthly bill from $118.43 per month to $119.49 per month.

Utilities are required by law to pass the cost of the natural gas they purchase directly through to customers without any markup.

UGI recognizes some customers may have difficulty paying their heating bill. Customers with a limited or fixed income should visit www.ugi.com/customerassistance or call UGI at 1-800-UGI-WARM to determine if they are eligible for one of several energy assistance programs. UGI can also assist eligible customers in applying for federally funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grants when the application process opens on December 3.

In addition, UGI offers budget billing, as well as multiple payment options such as via UGI’s online account center and app, and an auto-pay program to assist customers in managing bill payments.

UGI encourages customers to use energy wisely and make efficiency improvements in their homes. Additional information on energy efficiency programs is available on UGI’s website at www.ugi.com/energy-saving-tips .
