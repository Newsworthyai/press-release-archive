# UGI System Upgrades Now Underway in Hellertown

UGI Utilities just began a system upgrades project in Hellertown. The natural gas main replacement is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.  The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-January and have an impact on East High Street from Main Street to Easton Road.

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may have an impact on the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
