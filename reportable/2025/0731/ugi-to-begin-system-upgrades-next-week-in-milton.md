# UGI to Begin System Upgrades Next Week in Milton

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin system upgrades in Milton on Monday, August 4th. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by the end of September and impact travel on Broadway Street (SR-254) from Turbot Avenue to Queen Street.

The following side streets will also be affected: Turbot Avenue, Stanton Avenue, Prospect Avenue, Cedar Street, Hottenstein Lane, Brown Avenue, Poplar Avenue, and Queen Street.

When the school year begins, buses for the Milton School District will likely be delayed due to single lane restrictions. Wide load truck traffic will be restricted on this section of Broadway Street (SR-254) during the project.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
