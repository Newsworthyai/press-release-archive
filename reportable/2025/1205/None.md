# Boldin Survey Reveals End-of-Year Planners Have High Confidence and Anticipate Same or Greater Wealth at Longevity

Boldin, the financial confidence company, announced the results of its survey about end-of-year planning. The company polled more than 1,000 financially savvy Americans – all of whom manage their own financial plan using Boldin – to find out why they engage in year-end financial planning, and what others can learn from their planning habits. Survey respondents were evenly split between retirees (51%) and those planning for retirement (49%). The majority of respondents are high-net-worth individuals, with 70% reporting assets ranging from $1 million to $5 million. Across all current wealth bands, the majority of respondents anticipate having the same or more money at their longevity than they have today, indicating that their approach is worth emulating.

Regular Check-ins and End-of-Year Plans Build Confidence

The survey found that both retirees and those preparing for retirement engage in thoughtful planning throughout the year and at year-end. The majority of respondents revisit their financial priorities, progress towards them, and plans for achieving them, with 27% checking in once a week or more, 21% revisiting them two to three times a month, and 25% reviewing them once a month. The vast majority (92%) agreed that annual (or more frequent) reflection on their big-picture financial goals and progress significantly increases their confidence. Furthermore, 90% stated that knowing their financial standing at the end of the year gives them the confidence to make informed decisions for the future.

Successful Retirees Look Back, Plan Ahead, and Take Action

Of those surveyed, 99% said they engage in end-of-year planning, carving out time to review the previous year’s financials and make adjustments for the year ahead, and only 1% said they do not complete end-of-year planning. Around one-third (34%) of end-of-year planners said their approach is strategic, focused on long-term planning and overall financial strategy. Just over half (54%) utilize a balanced approach that combines tactical actions with strategic planning, while 12% focus on specific transactions and short-term goals.

When asked which end-of-year activities they typically complete, 60% reflect on financial performance over the past year. Additionally, 62% review last year’s spending and income as part of their end-of-year planning, while 44% examine savings goals and progress. Many respondents also make decisions for the upcoming year, with 50% saying they plan healthcare coverage, and 43% reporting that they review or set financial goals.

The end of the calendar year is also a time to take key actions. Of those surveyed, 40% optimize their tax liability or conduct tax-loss harvesting as part of their end-of-year planning activities. Nearly four in ten (39%) complete Roth conversions, and 24% make charitable contributions.

The Motivation Behind Year-End Planning: Confidence

When asked why they dedicate time to end-of-year planning, end-of-year planners cited a desire to increase confidence above all else. Nearly eight out of ten (79%) said they complete end-of-year financial activities to feel more confident in their financial decisions or increase confidence in their plan; 50% said they plan to reduce their tax burden, while less than half (43%) said they do so to build more wealth over time.

“These findings underscore that people aren’t planning simply to optimize performance. They’re planning to feel informed and confident in their financial decision-making,” said Steve Chen, founder and CEO of Boldin. “We have long believed that giving people the tools to manage their own financial plan would lead to increased know-how and confidence, and the data backs that up. The best part is that anyone can implement the habits of financially secure individuals by creating a plan, setting goals, taking action, and reviewing their progress.”
