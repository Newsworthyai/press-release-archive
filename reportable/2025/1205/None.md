# Boldin Survey Reveals End-of-Year Planners Have High Confidence and Anticipate Same or Greater Wealth at Longevity

San Francisco, CA – December 5, 2025 –

Boldin, the financial confidence company, announced the results of its survey about end-of-year planning. The company polled more than 1,000 financially savvy Americans – all of whom manage their own financial plan using Boldin – to find out why they engage in year-end financial planning, and what others can learn from their planning habits. Survey respondents were evenly split between retirees (51%) and those planning for retirement (49%). The majority of respondents are high-net-worth individuals, with 70% reporting assets ranging from $1 million to $5 million. Across all current wealth bands, the majority of respondents anticipate having the same or more money at their longevity than they have today, indicating that their approach is worth emulating.

Key Takeaways:* Among retirees and retirement planners surveyed, 99% conduct year-end planning, and a majority review their plan multiple times throughout the year.
* Nine out of ten (92%) of respondents said that annual or more frequent reflection on their big-picture financial goals and progress towards them significantly increases their confidence.
* Nearly 80% of retirement planners complete end-of-year planning activities to increase confidence in their plan; less than half (43%) said they do so to build more wealth over time.
