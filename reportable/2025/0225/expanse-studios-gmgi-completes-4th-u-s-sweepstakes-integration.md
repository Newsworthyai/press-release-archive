Expanse Studios, part of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), has successfully completed its fourth major integration in the U.S. sweepstakes market, further solidifying its presence across 40+ states. The latest partnership has been facilitated through Casimba Gaming and extended Expanse Studios' third-party distribution strategy, allowing its proprietary slots, crash games, and table games to reach an even broader network of regulated sweepstakes operators.

Scaling U.S. Market Expansion

With its games now available across multiple social casino platforms, Expanse Studios continues to build a scalable content ecosystem tailored for the U.S. sweepstakes sector. By working with Casimba Gaming, Expanse Studios ensures seamless integrations with top-tier operators, providing flexible and engaging game content designed for long-term player retention.

Expanse Studios remains focused on expanding its U.S. presence, strengthening its proprietary content offering, and supporting high-growth iGaming sectors.

"We remain committed to expanding our footprint in the U.S. and delivering high-quality, sweepstakes-compatible gaming content," said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios. "Our latest integration through Casimba Gaming reflects the growing demand for our content and strengthens our position in the sweepstakes space."

Boosting Operational Efficiency and B2B Expansion

Expanse Studios' games are now available across multiple sweepstakes and social casino platforms, reinforcing its footprint in the high-growth U.S. market.
