# UGI  Requests a Natural Gas Base Rate Increase

UGI Utilities, Inc. - Gas Division (UGI) today filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to increase its base rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers by $110.4 million annually. The requested increase would recover UGI’s ongoing costs related to system improvements and operations necessary to maintain safe and reliable natural gas service.

If the company’s entire request is approved, the total bill for a residential heating customer using 73.7 ccf per month would increase from $104.47 to $115.74 per month or by 10.8%.

The total bill for a typical commercial heating customer using 28.3 mcf per month would increase from $305.44 to $331.80 per month or by 8.6%.

The total bill for a typical industrial customer using 75.4 mcf per month would increase from $765.99 to $823.42 per month or by 7.5%.

These bill impacts reflect a customer purchasing their gas commodity portion of their bill from UGI. Customers utilizing an alternate natural gas supplier may see differing impacts.

UGI’s filing includes over $786 million in investments for improvements to its natural gas distribution system, facilities, and information technology which are not reflected in current rates. A substantial portion of these improvements involve the ongoing replacement of all non-contemporary pipelines with those made of contemporary materials.

The UGI rate increase request will only impact the delivery charge portion of a customer’s bill. The delivery charge provides a utility with the funds needed to own, operate, and maintain the gas distribution system and provide customer service and emergency response services.

UGI is requesting that the new gas rates take effect March 28, 2025. However, the PUC typically suspends the effective date for general base rate proceedings to allow for investigation and public hearings. The full PUC proceeding is expected to last approximately nine months from the date of filing, which would delay implementation of the new rates until October 2025.

Customers and interested parties may view UGI’s base rate filing materials on the UGI website at (www.ugi.com) and clicking on the “rate filing” link on the home page. Customers with questions may also call UGI toll-free at 1-800-276-2722 to receive further information on the proposed rate increase or to find out what actions they make take.

UGI Utilities, Inc., Gas Division, serves more than 700,000 customers in 46 counties across Pennsylvania.
