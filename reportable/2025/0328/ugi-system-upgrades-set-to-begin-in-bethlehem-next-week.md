# UGI System Upgrades Set to Begin in Bethlehem Next Week

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: March 28, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin additional system upgrades in Bethlehem on April 1. The two gas main replacement projects are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The replacements are also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project routes to convert to natural gas.

One of the projects is expected to be completed by late April and impact travel on the following streets:

* Seneca Street between North Hoffert Street and North Bergan Street
* South Bergan Street between Beech Street and Broadway

The other project is scheduled for completion in mid-May and will impact these streets:

* East 3rd Street between South New Street and Webster Street
* South New Street between Mechanic Street and East 3rd Street
* Columbia Street between Webster Street and Adams Street
* Adams Street between Columbia Street and East 3rd Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
