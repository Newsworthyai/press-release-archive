# UGI Set to Begin System Upgrades Next Week in Two Luzerne County Boroughs

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: September 26, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project in Edwardsville and Kingston Boroughs on Wednesday, October 1. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* Plymouth Street between Russell Street and Main Street
* Main Street between Curry Court and South Page Street
* South Page Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-October. The completion date may change due to weather and working conditions. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
