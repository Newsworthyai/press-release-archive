# UGI System Upgrades Set to Begin in Quakertown

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 25, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project on Friday, August 1, 2025, in Quakertown. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-September and impact travel on Rich Hill Road between Whaland Road and Masi Drive.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
