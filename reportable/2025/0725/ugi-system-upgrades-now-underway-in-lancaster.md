# UGI System Upgrades Now Underway in Lancaster

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 25, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. just began a natural gas main replacement project in the City of Lancaster. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by the end of September and impact travel on the following streets:

* North Charlotte Street between West Orange Street and West King Street
* West Grant Street between North Mary Street and North Concord Street
* West Strawberry Street between West King Street and Lafayette Street
* West Filbert Street between Old Dorwart Street and Manor Street
* East Filbert Street between Manor Street and High Street
* New Dorwart Street between Manor Street and High Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
