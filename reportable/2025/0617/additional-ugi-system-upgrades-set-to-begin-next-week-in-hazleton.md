# Additional UGI System Upgrades Set to Begin Next Week in Hazleton

UGI Utilities will soon begin another system upgrade project in Hazleton. The work, which is scheduled to begin on Berner Avenue on June 24, is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. This may also be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The replacement of a gas main will close Berner Avenue between South Cedar Street and South Poplar Street during construction hours of 7am to 5pm Monday through Friday. Residents and businesses in this section will be allowed through. Parking will also be restricted during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The underground work is expected to be completed by mid-July. Weather and working conditions could delay completion. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
