# UGI System Upgrades Beginning in Easton Could Fuel Natural Gas Conversions

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin two gas main replacement projects in Easton. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

On Thursday, January 2, work is scheduled to begin on the following streets:

* Walnut Street between Butler Street and Northampton Street
* Lehigh Street between South 9th Street and Walnut Street

Completion of this project is expected by the end of April.

On Monday, January 6, work is scheduled to begin on the following streets:

* Ferry Street between South 12th Street and South 15th Street
* South 14th Street between Ferry Street and Spruce Street

This project is expected to be completed by late March.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 740,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
