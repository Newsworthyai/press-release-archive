# PR Club Announces Final Call for Entries for 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards

BOSTON, March 10th, 2025– The PR Club encourages public relations and marketing professionals across New England to submit their entries for the 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards before the upcoming deadline. The regular entry deadline is March 14, 2025, by 6 p.m. ET, with late entries accepted until March 21, 2025, with an additional fee.

This prestigious annual event celebrates the most outstanding PR and marketing campaigns, showcasing the creativity, strategic thinking, and measurable impact that define the best of New England’s communications industry. This year’s award ceremony, “A Night at the Bell Ringers,” will take place on June 3, 2025, at the Museum of Science in Boston, featuring a networking dinner and an exciting awards presentation recognizing top campaigns and industry leaders.

New Professional Award: Honoring Workplace Excellence

The PR Club is excited to introduce the Carillonneur Professional Award, a new honor celebrating outstanding workplace culture in public relations and communications. This award is designed to recognize a public relations or communications agency, in-house team, or workplace that has demonstrated exceptional leadership, employee engagement, and commitment to professional growth over the past year.

“Inspired by the carillonneur—a musician who plays a carillon, a set of bells housed in a tower—this award symbolizes unity, collaboration, and a shared commitment to excellence,” said Kaitlynn Cooney, PR Club President. “It honors organizations that go beyond business success to foster an environment where employees thrive.”

As part of the professional awards category, the Carillonneur Award is free for PR Club members to enter. Judges will evaluate submissions based on company culture, leadership initiatives, employee development programs, and efforts to enhance workplace morale. This award provides an opportunity to showcase the people-first strategies that make an organization stand out in the PR and communications industry.
