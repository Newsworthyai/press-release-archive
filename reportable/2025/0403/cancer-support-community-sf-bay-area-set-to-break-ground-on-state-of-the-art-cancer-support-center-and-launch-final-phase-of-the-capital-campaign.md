# Cancer Support Community SF Bay Area Set to Break Ground on State-of-the-Art Cancer Support Center and Launch Final Phase of the Capital Campaign

Walnut Creek, CA, April 03, 2025 -- Cancer Support Community San Francisco Bay Area (CSC), a Bay Area-based nonprofit devoted to supporting individuals, families and communities affected by cancer through no-cost comprehensive supportive care programs, today enters the next chapter of its initiative with an anonymous donation match for its new state-of-the-art cancer support center. CSC will break ground for the cancer support center on April 23, achieving a significant milestone in the expansion of its services for patients and their families.

The campaign, "Rooted in Resilience" is a testament to the organization's roots in the community and its commitment to expanding its support offerings for those in need.

"CSC is more than just a support center, it is a community," said Lucinda Bazile, MPH, Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Support Community San Francisco Bay Area. "Our new center will provide an atmosphere of understanding, hope, and comfort, which is vital in the journey towards recovery. It's not just about treating the disease but also about addressing the psychological and social challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis. On April 23rd we will break ground on the future site as we begin establishing deeper roots within our community and beyond."

For 35 years, CSC has become a beacon of hope and healing to those impacted by cancer. In recognition that cancer touches many lives, CSC focuses on delivering psychosocial support to patients and their loved ones, addressing the emotional, social, and financial aspects of a cancer diagnosis.

The new cancer support center, which will be built on six acres of donated land in Lafayette, California, is adjacent to the serene atmosphere of the Lafayette Reservoir. It embodies the organization's commitment to fostering community among its participants and their families while providing a nurturing environment for healing. The state-of-the art center will include children and teen enrichment areas, support rooms with flexible space and remote broadcast capabilities, a demonstration kitchen, counseling rooms, an expressive arts room, a movement studio, a library and cafe, wellness treatment rooms, and a naturally healing garden and outdoor areas.

The campaign, which has already raised more than 75% of funds, will provide resources to complete the new cancer support center and continue CSC's mission to uplift and strengthen people impacted by cancer by providing support, fostering compassionate communities, and breaking down barriers to care.

"This undertaking is a testament to our resolve to continually enhance our services and reach more people," stated Donald Duggan, President of the Board of CSC. â€œWe are in the last leg of making this a reality and we are reaching out to our community to join us and become part of the journey. With each contribution, we double our impact through a $5 million match from an anonymous donor."

Echoing these sentiments, Patricia Falconer, Vice President of the Board of CSC, stated, "The growth of CSC has always been rooted in innovation and resilience. Our new cancer support center will increase our capacity to meet the growing needs of our diverse community and increase access to free of charge in-person, hybrid, and virtual, culturally responsive support programs for patients, families, and caregivers. We are grateful to all who have supported our mission thus far and invite others to join us to grow the future of cancer support."

With the final push in full swing, CSC is optimistic about the completion of its new center. This initiative not only signifies the organization's unwavering commitment to its mission but also emphasizes its resolve to shape the future of cancer support.
