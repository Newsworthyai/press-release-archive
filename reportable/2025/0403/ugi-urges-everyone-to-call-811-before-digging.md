# UGI Urges Everyone to Call 811 Before Digging

One phone call can be a life saver the next time you dig. Calling 811 can prevent costly damage, serious injury, even death.

April is “National Safe Digging Month” because it is a time when many people start outdoor projects. At least three business days before a shovel hits the ground, call 811 or go to call811.com to submit a request for your underground utilities to be located and marked. Having the facility owners mark your utility lines with paint or flags can help you or a contractor avoid unintentionally hitting underground lines. Common underground utility lines include gas, water, sewer, electric, phone, and cable television.

According to a survey by Common Ground Alliance, a non-profit organization committed to safety and damage prevention, 27 million U.S. homeowners plan to dig this year without contacting 811. Not doing this one step is putting the digger and the community at risk of danger and loss of utility services.

Making the call is the law. Both homeowners and contractors are required by Pennsylvania law to call 811 at least three business days before any digging or excavation. No matter how small or simple a project is, if a homeowner is doing the work, they should make the call. If a contractor is doing the work, they call 811. The request is free for homeowners and a small annual fee for contractors. Be prepared when calling 811 and have the location of the work ready, along with the type of work, details on how the work will be done, and the expected duration of the project.

“UGI wants every dig on every project to be a safe one. Whether it is a small project or a major one, the same rule applies: call 811,” says Chris Brown, UGI Utilities Vice President of Operations. “It is an extra step to take before your shovel hits the ground, but it is an important one that could be a life saver.”

This is also a good time to remind homeowners and contractors to be mindful of the dangers above when working around electric and other above-ground facilities. Contact of any kind to power lines can be deadly.
