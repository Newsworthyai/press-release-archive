# UGI System Upgrades Scheduled to Begin Next Week in Nazareth

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: April 2, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin system upgrades in Nazareth on April 7. The gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by late September and will impact travel on the following streets:

* East Prospect Street between South Whitfield Street and South Spruce Street
* South Cedar Street between East Prospect Street and East Park Street
* East Park Street between South Broad Street and South Whitfield Street
* South Broad Street between East Evergreen Street and East Belvidere Street
* East Walnut Street between South Cedar Street and South Main Street
* South Main Street between East Prospect Street and East Belvidere Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
