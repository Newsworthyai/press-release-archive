# Reportable and NewsRamp Team Up to Enhance Organic Discovery of Multimedia News Releases

March 27, 2025 -- Reportable, Inc., has announced its partnership with NewsRamp, a leading AI-driven news platform. This collaboration further enhances visibility and engagement for companies wanting to issue multimedia news releases. The latest distribution point for Reportable releases will not only provide AI-generated editorial coverage but will also enhance the organic discovery of your company, product, or service.

Reportable releases let you quickly build, design and publish a dedicated landing page to host your news in a way that takes advantage of multimedia. This approach promotes visual storytelling - an effective method that taps into the brain’s ability to more effectively process and remember information. It's a do-it-yourself software that puts you in control of design, social sharing, media targeting, email tracking and measurement.

Tom Baker, Cofounder of Reportable, Inc., emphasizes the significance of this partnership: "NewsRamp's AI technology amplifies visibility of content while our visual format for news releases makes them more memorable and functional for your audiences and reporters. We cater to all industries and specialize in privately-held companies who can be more creative than the more conventional newswires."

“Most internet activity happens outside of search,” added Mark M. Willaman, co-founder of NewsRamp. “By distributing releases in multiple formats across diverse platforms, NewsRamp ensures news surfaces organically where audiences spend their time.”

“We recognize that content publishers may not have the resources or technical expertise to keep pace with advancements in AI and large language models,” explains David McInnis, founder of NewsRamp.com and PRWeb. “With NewsRamp.com, newswires and content publishers gain access to a team continuously developing pioneering solutions for news distribution.”
