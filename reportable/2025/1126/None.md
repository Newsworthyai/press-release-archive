# A legal foundation. A curiosity for technology. A career shaped by purpose.

Bernice Kapinga’s path into cybersecurity did not begin with technical tools; it began with law. During her LLB studies, she completed a specialised module in Internet Law, where she explored digital privacy, data protection, cybercrime, online expression, and the evidentiary challenges connected to digital information. This early academic exposure revealed an important truth: modern legal systems depend on secure, well-governed digital environments, and without them, justice, accountability, and organisational trust are compromised.

That realisation sparked a growing interest beyond traditional legal study. Bernice began independently researching cybersecurity fundamentals, governance models, and global compliance standards to understand better how organisations and regulatory bodies were adapting to a digital world. This curiosity eventually led her to pursue formal training through the MIT x Simplilearn Postgraduate Program in Cybersecurity, where she studied network security, operating system security, cryptography, secure programming, policy frameworks, hardware architecture, and real-world case studies in web, mobile, and software security.

She also gained practical exposure through hands-on labs in MFA, SSH hardening, authentication log analysis, password policy enforcement, and continuous monitoring, grounding her in the operational realities of security.

Her professional transition began when she joined Wendt Partners. She entered the organisation in a support capacity, and it quickly became a place where her legal foundation and cybersecurity training could transform into practical expertise. Through on-the-job learning and operational involvement, she gained full exposure to:

* ISO/IEC 27001:2022
* SOC 2 Type II
* Vanta compliance automation
* Internal governance workflows and evidence management

Bernice played a contributing role in preparing, documenting, coordinating, and maintaining key components of Wendt Partners’ security posture, supporting the company in successfully achieving:

* ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification (August)
* SOC 2 Type II compliance (October)

Her work spanned control documentation, policy alignment, Vanta maintenance, interdepartmental coordination, and readiness preparations, giving her hands-on experience in the systems that underpin organisational security and trust.

Today, Bernice is building a multidisciplinary career at the intersection of cybersecurity, compliance, legal frameworks, and organisational operations. She is actively pursuing further studies in information security, privacy, ISO and SOC frameworks, HubSpot, and global compliance practices. Her long-term ambition is to help organisations strengthen resilience, safeguard their information, and build trust in an increasingly digital landscape, bridging the gap between law, technology, and secure business operations.
