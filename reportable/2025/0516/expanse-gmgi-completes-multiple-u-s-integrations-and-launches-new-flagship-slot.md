# Expanse (GMGI) Completes Multiple U.S. Integrations and Launches New Flagship Slot

Las Vegas, 16 May 2025 - - Expanse Studios, the proprietary B2B game development unit of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), has successfully completed multiple new integrations across U.S.-focused social and sweepstakes casino platforms, alongside the official release of its newest flagship title, Gates of Olympia.

In the past several weeks, Expanse finalized content partnerships with:

- Sportino, integrated via the Blazesoft ecosystem

- Zula, another Blazesoft-affiliated mobile-first social casino brand

- A fifth U.S. sweepstakes casino, marking Expanse’s continued expansion in this high-engagement market

As of May 2025, Expanse Studios now has 10 active or contracted sweepstakes/social casino partnerships in the U.S., solidifying its position as one of the few iGaming companies with a growing proprietary content presence in this segment.

The integrations align with GMGI’s strategy to scale content distribution through low-CAC, high-margin B2B channels that are compliant with U.S. regulatory frameworks. Proprietary content remains central to this strategy, enabling both monetization control and partner retention.

“These integrations and the launch of our latest slot demonstrate the scalability of our proprietary content across diverse regulated models,” said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios.

The company also launched Gates of Olympia, a new premium online slot designed for high player retention and monetization. The game features a 6x5 cascading reel layout, multipliers up to 500x, 15 Free Spins, and bonus-buy mechanics. It’s engineered for performance across both international iGaming platforms and U.S.-based sweepstakes casinos.

“We’re building titles that not only perform well for players but also deliver ROI for our partners,” Stamenkovic added. “With Gates of Olympia, we’re doubling down on content that drives engagement and recurring revenue.”

All Expanse Studios games are distributed through GMGI’s B2B platform, and also deployed on GMGI-owned B2C brands, including Meridianbet.
