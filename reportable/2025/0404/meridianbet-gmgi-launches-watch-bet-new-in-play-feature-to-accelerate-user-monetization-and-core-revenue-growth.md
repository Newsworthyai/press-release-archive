# Meridianbet (GMGI) Launches “Watch & Bet” — New In-Play Feature to Accelerate User Monetization and Core Revenue Growth

Valletta, 4 April 2025 - - Meridianbet, part of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), today announced the launch of Watch & Bet, a new mobile feature that enables users to stream live sports in full-screen mode while placing in-play bets simultaneously. The feature is built to increase in-play betting volume, extend session duration, and drive higher revenue per active user, directly supporting growth in turnover, user value, and margin.

Watch & Bet enables users to stream live sports in full-screen mode while placing in-play bets simultaneously—eliminating friction and improving the real-time betting experience. With multiple markets displayed alongside the stream, users stay engaged throughout the event without navigating away, leading to higher bet frequency and longer session times.

“Watch & Bet adds an important layer to our live betting ecosystem,” said Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet. “It enhances user engagement during the most valuable moments and supports stronger monetization per session—key drivers of platform growth.”

The feature is now live across Meridianbet’s mobile web platform and is fully integrated into the company’s proprietary sportsbook infrastructure.

GMGI FY24 Revenue: $151.1M GAAP / $159.7M Organic (Non GAAP)

The launch of Watch & Bet comes as Golden Matrix Group continues to deliver strong financial performance across its core business units. Golden Matrix Group reported GAAP revenue of $151.1 million for full-year 2024, up from $93.0 million in 2023, as disclosed in its FY24 financial results.

In parallel, the unaudited organic revenue — reflecting core operational performance from MeridianBet, GMAG, and RKings, and excluding contributions from acquired entities and FX impact — reached approximately $159.7 million in 2024 compared to $136.7 million in 2023.

A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP figures is provided in the Company’s 10-K filing and investor presentation.

Organic revenue is a non-GAAP measure used by management to evaluate underlying growth across established operations, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency volatility. These figures are intended to provide investors with additional clarity on core performance and are consistent with disclosures made in the company’s annual filing and public materials.
