# UGI System Upgrades Scheduled to Begin Next Week in Hazleton

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 30, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin additional system upgrades in Hazleton on Monday, June 2. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by late June and impact travel on the following roads:

* South Bennett Court between East Elm Street and East Beech Street
* East Birch Street between South Fulton Court Street and South Poplar Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities is available at www.ugi.com.
