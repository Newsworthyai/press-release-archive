# UGI Contributes Additional $500,000 for Customers Struggling to Pay Heating Bills

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: November 18, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is announcing an additional one-time donation of $500,000 to the Operation Share Energy Fund. This brings UGI’s total contribution this year to $1.7 million. Operation Share provides energy assistance grants to qualified customers who are having trouble paying their heating bills. UGI’s company donation is in addition to what will be raised through an employee giving campaign beginning this week.

“UGI and its employees are stepping up to help as the need for heating assistance grows. The delay in federal funds for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) means some customers need extra assistance now,” says Dan Adamo, UGI’s Vice President of Customer Relations. “UGI remains committed to providing our customers safe, reliable, and affordable energy service.”

Since 1983, the Operation Share Energy Fund has provided energy assistance grants to qualified customers. Operation Share is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and is also funded by UGI customers and concerned citizens. UGI works with community organizations to distribute Operation Share funds. The program is a supplement to federal or state energy assistance programs.

The application, income requirements, and the community organizations UGI partners with can be found at https://www.ugi.com/assistance-programs/operation-share/. This link also contains information for anyone who would like to donate to the Operation Share Fund.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
