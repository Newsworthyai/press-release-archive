# UGI Natural Gas Supply Rates  Not Changing in June, Increase Projected for December

For Immediate Release

Release Date: May 15, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. announced its purchased gas cost rates will not change on June 1, 2025. An increase is projected on December 1, 2025.

UGI will submit its December 1 natural gas cost rate projection in an annual filing with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC).

UGI is required to file its gas cost rates annually for review with the PUC and may adjust these rates quarterly to reflect changes in wholesale natural gas prices. By law, utilities cannot earn a profit on the natural gas commodity portion of a customer’s bill. Utilities are required to pass the cost of the natural gas they purchase directly on to customers without any markup.

If UGI’s proposed projected rates for December 1 are approved, the bill for a typical residential heating customer who uses 73.7 hundred cubic feet (ccf) of natural gas per month, and purchases their supply from UGI, would increase from $112.23 to $113.45 per month or by 1.1%. The total bill for a commercial customer using 28.3 thousand cubic feet (Mcf), and purchases supply from UGI, would increase from $333.24 to $337.83 per month or by 1.4%. The total bill for an industrial customer using 75.4 thousand cubic feet (Mcf), and purchases supply from UGI, would increase from $840.06 to $852.29 per month or by 1.5%.

Customers may call UGI at 1-800-276-2722 to receive further information on the proposed rates or to find out what actions they may take.

UGI recognizes some customers may have difficulty paying their bill. The company offers budget billing, as well as multiple payment options such as via UGI’s online account center and app, as well as an auto-pay program to assist customers in managing bill payments.

UGI encourages customers to use energy wisely and make efficiency improvements in their homes.
