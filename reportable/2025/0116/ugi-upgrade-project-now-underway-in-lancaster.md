# UGI Upgrade Project Now Underway in Lancaster

UGI Utilities, Inc. is replacing a natural gas main in Lancaster as part of its commitment to provide safe and reliable service. Gas main replacements can also be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The work is expected to be completed by the end of March and impact the following streets:

* Laurel Street between Wabank Road and Union Street
* Hebrank Street between Laurel Street and New Dorwart Street
* New Dorwart Street between Hazel Street and West Andrew Street
* Hazel Street between Wabank Road and South Prince Street
* Groff Avenue between New Dorwart Street and Parkhill Road

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available atÂ www.ugi.com.
