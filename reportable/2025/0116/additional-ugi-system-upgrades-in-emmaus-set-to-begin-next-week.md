# Additional UGI System Upgrades in Emmaus Set to Begin Next Week

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin another gas main replacement project in Emmaus on January 14. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by early May and impact the following streets:

* West Greenleaf Street between Macungie Avenue and North 7th Street
* North 7th Street between Harrison Street and West Berger Street
* West Berger Street between North 7th Street and Franklin Street
* Franklin Street between West Berger Street and North Street
* North Street between Franklin Street and North Moyer Street
* 6th Street between Elm Street and Long Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
