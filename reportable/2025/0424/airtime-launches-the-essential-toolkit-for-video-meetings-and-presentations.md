# Airtime launches the essential toolkit for video meetings and presentations

BENTONVILLE, Ark., Apr. 24, 2025 – Since the pandemic started and meetings moved to video, people have been stuck in little boxes for hours, first alone in their homes, and now working with teams both in and out of their offices. This makes it nearly impossible to stand out, be memorable, or even communicate clearly. Airtime is designed to solve these problems. Starting with Airtime Camera and Airtime Creator, available today, Airtime is building the essential toolkit for whenever people are on camera, helping everyone look great, stay on brand, and build better presentations.

Airtime is created by mmhmm, a company launched in 2020 to help people get the most out of video communication and is funded by Sequoia Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund, and other renowned investors.

Today, video powers global teams, sales pitches and demos, online education and training, the creator economy, and many more applications. Yet, for too many, being on video remains a dull and fatiguing experience. Zoom reports 300 million daily active users meeting for more than 3.3 trillion minutes annually. Things aren’t much better in recordings, where the dominant platforms are either too limiting or too overwhelming. People arrive for on-camera meetings in ways they never would have for in-person meetings, often sloppy, with horrible backgrounds, or leaving the camera off entirely. People crave a way to present themselves better and communicate more clearly.

“Companies and professionals know how to make their offices, retail locations, documents, and even clothes represent their brand, but how we show up on video is a suddenly ubiquitous new surface to conquer,” said Phil Libin, CEO of Airtime. “We’re making tools that make your video presence elegant and powerful.”

"Airtime doesn't merely improve video meetings; it fundamentally elevates how we connect," said Roelof Botha, managing partner of Sequoia Capital. “Phil and team’s focus on the end-user experience gives people complete control over their digital presence. With Airtime, I can express my authentic self in video meetings, including the use of well-timed GIFs and clips to inject moments of levity. This visual expressiveness transforms digital interactions, making virtual communication as impactful as in-person conversations."

Airtime Camera: Make meetings work for everyone

Airtime Camera makes it easy for everyone to show up best on video calls with a custom or on-brand look. Companies or individuals can design or tint backgrounds, add a logo, offer instant GIF reactions, or display thoughts, updates, location, and more. Looks in Airtime Camera are built on a natural background, so people always stay authentic while being stylish and professional. Entire teams can share looks to represent their company. Airtime Camera works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, or any app that supports virtual cameras.

Airtime Creator: Turning boring presentations into compelling live pitches and videos

Airtime Creator helps professionals build standout presentations and video recordings, helping them convey ideas on video without limitations, clutter, or a steep learning curve. With Airtime Creator, users can record and share presentations with their team in a way that makes it easier and faster for their teams to learn and absorb information. It provides a powerful, but easy-to-learn tool that lets people interact with their presentations and then share those recordings with their team. Airtime Creator also enables multiple users to record together, with everyone interacting with the same information at the same time.

Pricing and Availability

Airtime Camera is free through August 1 and then available for a one-time fee of $20. Airtime Creator is a subscription for $10 per month after a free trial. To download Airtime visit https://airtimetools.com.
