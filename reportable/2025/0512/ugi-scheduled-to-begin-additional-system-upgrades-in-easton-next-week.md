# UGI Scheduled to Begin Additional System Upgrades in Easton Next Week

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 12, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin additional system upgrades in Easton on Monday, May 19. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by the end of June and impact travel on the following roads:

* Spring Garden Street between North Third Street and Larry Holmes Drive
* North Second Street between Bushkill Street and Spring Garden Street
* North Green Street between Spring Garden Street and Bushkill Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
