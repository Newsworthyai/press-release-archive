# UGI System Upgrades in Sunbury Scheduled to Begin Next Week

UGI Utilities is set to begin system upgrades in Sunbury on Monday, May 19. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by the end of June and impact travel on the following roads:

* South 2nd Street from the Exit off Veterans Memorial Bridge (RT 61) to South Front Street
* South Front Street from South 2nd Street to Slough Street
* Slough Street from South Front Street to South 2nd Street
* Work will also occur in the parking lots of Weis Market’s Corporate Headquarters

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
