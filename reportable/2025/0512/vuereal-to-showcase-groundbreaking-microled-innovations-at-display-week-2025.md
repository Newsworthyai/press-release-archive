# VueReal to Showcase Groundbreaking MicroLED Innovations at Display Week 2025

WATERLOO, Ontario – May 12, 2025 – VueReal, a pioneer in MicroSolid Printing™ technology, will unveil its latest microLED advancements at Display Week 2025 (Booth #1447). The company will highlight scalable solutions for next-generation lighting, displays, and transparent electronics across automotive, consumer, and emerging tech applications.

VueReal’s proprietary MicroSolid Printing™ platform overcomes key manufacturing barriers by enabling precise, high yield microLED transfer at scale. With over 125 patents granted, the platform continues to push boundaries in micro device manufacturing. All technologies shown at Display Week were developed using VueReal’s patented process and Reference Design Kits, allowing customers to prototype and build real products without traditional non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs—dramatically accelerating development and time-to-market.

Booth Highlights at Display Week 2025

At its booth, VueReal will feature flagship demonstrations across three application areas:

1. Lighting: Smarter, Safer Automotive Displays

●    Taillight Demo/RDK-Smart Hybrid Lighting, RED: Highlights ultra-high-brightness performance in a razor-thin form factor. Goes beyond traditional brake lights to deliver contextual messaging (e.g., hazard symbols or "ICE" alerts), enhancing vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian communication.  Showcases the unique high brightness capabilities inherent in red microLED devices that are not possible with many other lighting technologies.

●    RDK-Smart Modular Lighting: Transforming automotive lighting with ultra-bright, energy efficient microLED displays, delivering precision illumination and seamless integration for next-generation vehicles.

2. MicroDisplays: Reimagining Automotive Interfaces

●    Side Mirror Demo/RDK-Smart Modular Lighting + RDK-High Brightness High Resolution 0.35” MicroDisplay: An industry-first ultra-compact concept showcasing +20,000 nits of brightness from VueReal’s Smart Modular Lighting and a 1,000,000-nit 0.35” microdisplay—delivering exceptional visibility in all lighting conditions. The demo features a puddle light projecting the VueReal logo and highlights low-power, ultra-bright performance for automotive innovation.

3. Transparent Displays: Seamless Integration into Vehicle Interiors

●    Steering Wheel HUD Demo/RDK-RGB Active Matrix Transparent 3.5” Display: A functional concept showing real-time navigation, audio, and map data across transparent displays integrated into the steering wheel. Delivers a futuristic yet functional user interface without visual clutter.

Private Suite Demonstrations (Schedule Private Demo Here)

In addition to the booth, VueReal will host private, R&D-focused demos showcasing a broader portfolio of next-generation technologies, such as:

●    World’s smallest 0.5μm microLED display

●    10-inch and 6.x-inch ~85% transparent microLED panels

●    AR Glasses with dual microLED displays

●    RDK-Smart Hybrid Lighting panels in amber, red, and white for automotive

●    3.5-inch transparent displays, digital mirror prototypes, passive matrix demos

●    Solar-integrated microLED power-generating display
