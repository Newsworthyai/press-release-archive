# Tickets Now Available for the 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards
 PR Club’s Signature Celebration Returns on June 3 at The Museum of Science

BOSTON, May 12, 2025 - The PR Club, New England’s leading communications trade organization, today announced the opening of ticket sales for the 57th Annual Bell Ringer Awards on Tuesday, June 3, 2025 at the Museum of Science. This premier event brings together PR, marketing and communications professionals from across New England to celebrate excellence in the field. You can get your tickets here.

Emily Schario, an Emmy-nominated multimedia journalist and Head of Content for The B-Side, a Boston Globe Media newsletter, will host the awards this year. Schario has gained recognition for her ability to connect with diverse audiences through impactful storytelling across platforms. Her experience and energy promise to set the tone for an exciting evening.

As part of the event’s community impact initiative, PR Club will raise funds to support CommonWealth Kitchen, a nonprofit selected by Schario. Based in Dorchester, CommonWealth Kitchen is a food business incubator, working to build a more equitable and inclusive food economy. The organization provides commercial kitchen space, training, and support to food entrepreneurs—particularly women, immigrants, and people of color. Proceeds from a 50/50 raffle held during the event will benefit CommonWealth Kitchen, and PR Club will match all donations raised that evening.

"I'm so honored to be a part of an event that brings Boston's best and brightest media pros together who understand the power of storytelling," said Emily Schario, Head of Content, The B-Side, Boston Globe Media. "As a self-proclaimed foodie, the opportunity to share and support the mission of Commonwealth Kitchen, a local organization dedicated to equity and entrepreneurship, is equally important. I'm thrilled to work with this community and give back to a cause that I care deeply about."

The Bell Ringer Awards shine a light on the best campaigns, teams, and talent in the region. Finalists represent a cross-section of agencies, in-house teams, and nonprofits. Each year, we honor one outstanding campaign entry with the Super Bell Award, given to the campaign deemed “Best of Show” by a consensus of the judges. The highest scoring Bell Ringer campaign entries are automatically entered into the Super Bell Award competition.

“We’re proud to carry this tradition forward and spotlight the tremendous work happening across our field,” said Kaitlynn Cooney, President of PR Club. “This event is a chance for us to not only recognize our peers, but also reconnect as a community. We’re especially excited to have Emily host the evening—her voice and work truly reflects where the industry is headed.”
