SERI is pleased to announce the inaugural ReThink Awards, recognizing organizations creating systems-level impact in electronics sustainability through groundbreaking innovation and bold thinking.

The ReThink Awards celebrate the disruptors, challengers, and visionaries reimagining what's possible in electronics sustainability beyond incremental improvements to forge entirely new paths. The ReThink Awards spotlight transformative ideas and initiatives that fundamentally challenge conventional approaches across the electronics lifecycle.

"A truly circular ecosystem for electronics demands more than just better versions of what we've always done—it requires completely rethinking our assumptions and practices," said Jeff Seibert, SERI’s Chief Provocateur. "With the ReThink Awards, we're shining a spotlight on the trailblazers who are questioning everything, taking action, and inspiring the entire industry to think differently and break from the status quo."

SERI is seeking annual nominations from across the electronics value chain - including designers, manufacturers, refurbishers, recyclers, and policy advocates. Ideal candidates are those introducing transformative approaches that challenge industry conventions, create circular solutions, extend product lifecycles, and inspire broader change in electronics sustainability.

Nominees will be evaluated based on the specific actions taken that demonstrate thinking differently, the measurable impact achieved within their organization or the industry, and how their initiative positively affects the sustainability of electronics. And there are no geographic barriers to the award – nominations are open regardless of borders.

"The ReThink Awards aren't just about recognizing great ideas—they're about creating impact and inspiring a movement," added Seibert. "By showcasing these breakthrough approaches, we hope to spark even more innovation and accelerate the transition to truly sustainable electronics."

Winners will be announced and celebrated at the eSummit in Minneapolis this September, where they'll have the opportunity to showcase their innovations before hundreds of industry peers and receive their one-of-a-kind award. The eSummit is an annual event that brings together the brightest minds and the most forward-thinking companies to make every facet of the electronics industry more sustainable.

In a creative twist that embodies the spirit of transformation, the physical awards themselves tell a compelling story of reinvention. For the 2025 awards, SERI has partnered with found-object artist Steve Heller, who has transformed electronic components donated by PAR Recycle Works into stunning artistic pieces that symbolically turn what many would consider worthless into valuable works of art.
