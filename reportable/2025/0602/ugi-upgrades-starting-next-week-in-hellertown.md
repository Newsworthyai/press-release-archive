# UGI Upgrades Starting Next Week  in Hellertown

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: June 2, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin system upgrades in Hellertown the week of June 9. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project will impact the following roads:

* Easton Road between Lower Saucon Road and Cherry Lane.

Construction on Easton Road is expected to begin the week of June 9, with work starting at 7 am Monday through Saturday. Between 9 am and 3 pm, one lane will close between Cherry Lane and Countryside Lane. Flaggers will direct traffic through the construction zone. Between 6 pm and 6 am Sunday through Friday, both lanes of Easton Road will close between Cherry Lane and Lower Saucon Road. Residents and businesses along the road will have access. Underground work on Easton Road is expected to be completed by the end of October.

* Ringhoffer Road between Easton Road and Sherry Hill Road.

Ringhoffer Road will close 24/7 between Easton Road and Sherry Hill Road, with work expected to begin in mid-June. The underground work on Ringhoffer Road is scheduled to be completed by the end of June.

There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
