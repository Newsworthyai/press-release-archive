# UGI System Upgrades Underway in Macungie Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 3, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. just began a natural gas main replacement project in Macungie. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* South Church Street and Mountain Road between East Main Street and Lorene Drive
* East Main Street and South Church Street Intersection
* Locust Street between South Church Street and Pine Street
* Cedar Street between South Church Street and Spring Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by the end of December. Temporary restoration of the area will occur immediately after the underground work is completed. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
