# UGI System Upgrades Now Underway in Steelton

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 3, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. just began a natural gas main replacement project in Steelton. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* South 4th Street between Q Street and E Avenue
* D Avenue at South 4th Street
* S Street between South 4th Street and 3rd Alley
* 3rd Alley between S Street and Bridge Avenue
* E Avenue at South 4th Street
* R Street between South 4th Street and 5th Alley
* 5th Alley at R Street
* Felton Street (heading south) to South 3rd Street
* South 3rd Street between Felton Street and McKinley Street
* Heagy Street between South 3rd Street and 3rd Alley
* 3rd Alley between Heagy Street and Felton Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by the end of December. Temporary restoration of the area will occur immediately after the underground work is completed. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
