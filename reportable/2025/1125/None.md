# Momentic Raises $15 Million in Series A to Eliminate the QA Bottleneck Slowing Software Delivery

Momentic, the AI-native testing platform for modern development teams, has announced it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures and existing investors - Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform and Karman Ventures. The investment will accelerate Momentic's mission to build the definitive verification layer for software.

Despite decades of innovation, the promise of fully automated testing has remained elusive, still requiring significant human intervention. Now, as AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor dramatically accelerate code output, they're generating bugs faster than traditional testing methods can catch them. This is the mission behind Momentic, because traditional testing infrastructure can't keep pace.

"We started Momentic because we saw too many engineering teams drown in broken tests while bugs still reached production," said Wei-Wei Wu, Co-founder and CEO of Momentic. "AI has made us faster at writing code, but our testing tools are stuck in the past. This round led by Standard Capital gives us the resources to build what the industry desperately needs: a validation layer to become the intelligent guardrail for software development across all applications, platforms and industries. We're making quality accessible to every team, not just those with dedicated QA engineers."

Standard Capital, the AI-native Series A firm founded by former Y Combinator partner Dalton Caldwell, Bryan Berg and Paul Buchheit, led the round in one of the first investments from their new fund, moving from initial application to term sheet in just two weeks. Momentic was drawn to Standard's unique approach as the firm intentionally does not take board seats, instead creating cohorts of peer companies where founders can share insights and accelerate learning together.

“As AI makes it trivial to generate code, and most code written will be written by AI, the real value shifts to the systems that verify the generated code works,” said Dalton Caldwell at Standard Capital. “Momentic is becoming the source of truth and guardrail layer for all software products. We believe Momentic has the opportunity to be the most valuable component of the future software stack.”

Momentic has quickly become the standard for companies shipping quality software. Today, Momentic is used across companies of all sizes, from leading technology teams like Notion, Xero and Collectors; AI companies like Runway and Reducto; and category leaders like Quora and Bilt.

The numbers tell the story with Momentic executing over 200 million steps in the past month, automating the equivalent of nearly 300,000 hours of manual testing. In that same time, its platform prevented more than 390,000 bugs from reaching production, establishing itself as the definitive verification layer for teams shipping with confidence.

“Before Momentic, our Selenium suite gave us good signal but was expensive to maintain,” said Erdem Alparslan, Head of Developer Experience at Notion. “Today every engineer runs Momentic tests on every PR, merge, and deploy as part of their normal workflow. We define critical flows in plain English, Momentic does the heavy lifting, and it has noticeably improved both our release cadence and our confidence in each deploy.”

The Series A funding will enable Momentic to expand its engineering team, accelerate product development, and scale go-to-market efforts as the company pursues its vision. As AI coding tools fundamentally reshape software development, Momentic is positioned to act as the source of truth for how software works. The company is actively hiring across engineering, product, and GTM roles.

 About MomenticMomentic is building the definitive verification layer for software. Companies like Notion, Xero, Bilt, Webflow and Retool use Momentic to automate testing to ensure all software releases launch as intended. Since the company's founding in late 2023, Momentic's customers have executed more than 2 billion steps so effectively that replicating this manually would take multiple decades to achieve.For more information, visit https://momentic.ai.
