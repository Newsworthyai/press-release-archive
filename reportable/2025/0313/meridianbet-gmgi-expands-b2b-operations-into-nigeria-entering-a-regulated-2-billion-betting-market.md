LAGOS, VALETTA – 13 March 2025, Meridianbet, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix Group, Inc.

The company’s entry into Nigeria further strengthens its 20-year presence in Africa, leveraging its proven track record in regulated markets to deliver world-class gaming products. Through its newly licensed local entity, Masterlive Network Limited, Meridianbet has secured full regulatory approval from the Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority (LSLGA), allowing it to operate in both sports betting and online casino verticals under License No: LSLGA/OP/OSB/MB041124.

Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet, commented:

"Our expansion into Nigeria marks a significant step in our long-term strategy to deepen our presence in Africa’s most dynamic gaming markets. With a highly engaged player base and strong industry growth, Nigeria presents a major opportunity for our B2B model.
