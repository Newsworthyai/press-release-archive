# NY CRE & CONTRACTORS FOR TUNNEL TO TOWERS ANNOUNCES FIFTH ANNUAL COCKTAIL TRIBUTE

NEW YORK, NY (September 10, 2025) – The New York Commercial Real Estate & Contractors for Tunnel to Towers (NY CRE & Contractors for T2T), an exclusive philanthropic group supporting the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, is proud to announce its Fifth Annual Cocktail Tribute, set for Thursday, October 16, 2025, at Redeye Grill in Midtown Manhattan.

This year’s honoree is Bill Dacunto, Executive Vice President of Silverstein Properties, recognized for his unwavering dedication to the men and women who serve our nation and communities. Dacunto joins a distinguished lineage of leaders whose values align deeply with the mission of Tunnel to Towers: honoring the sacrifice of first responders and military service members by providing critical housing support to their families.

“I hold our first responders and military personnel in the highest regard,” said Dacunto. “They are truly angels among us, and we can never do enough to support them. ‘Never forget’ is more than a phrase, it’s a call to action, especially for New Yorkers.”

The evening will convene top-tier professionals across commercial real estate, construction, public safety, and building services – bringing together a purpose driven network committed to giving back. Guests will enjoy a curated experience featuring premium cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, a silent auction, and appearances by special guests.

The event is spearheaded by a board of senior CRE executives – developers, contractors, engineers, architects, and service providers – united in support of a common cause.

“Our industry depends on the safety and resilience of the built environment,” said Board Chair James A. Pirot. “From skyscrapers to schools, none of it stands without the life safety professionals and first responders who protect them. Tunnel to Towers reminds us why honoring these heroes is not just right, it’s essential.”

Proceeds from the event directly benefit the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, a nationally respected non-profit organization born from the tragedy of 9/11. The foundation delivers mortgage-free homes to families of fallen first responders and Gold Star families with young children, as well as smart homes for catastrophically injured veterans and first responders.

Sponsorships and individual tickets are now available for what has become one of the most meaningful gatherings in New York’s commercial real estate calendar. Join us in honoring courage, sacrifice, and service.
