# i love boobies! Merchandise Sales Skyrocket With Y2K Resurgence, Creative Collaborations

YUCCA VALLEY, CA – The early 2000s have officially returned to retail and across pop culture.

For the Keep A Breast Foundation, whose iconic “i ♥ boobies!” campaign defined a generation and now brings fresh excitement to the cause of breast cancer early detection, this resurgence has created a renewed retail opportunity with real philanthropic impact.

Keep A Breast Foundation (KAB) re-launched its wholesale strategy in partnership with action sports and streetwear retailer Zumiez in 2022, marking a strategic return to retail that has reignited brand momentum. The result was an 85% surge in wholesale growth from 2022 to 2023, followed by a continued increase of 8% between 2023 to 2024. In 2024, the Zumiez partnership alone generated $1.3 million through wholesale. Meanwhile, the organization’s direct-to-consumer channel is also thriving, with more than $86,000 grossed between July 2023 and April 2025 through the organization’s new online storefront –further amplifying the reach and impact of its mission-driven brand that blends cultural awareness with health education.

This distinct ability continues to drive growth through creative fundraising, strategic retail partnerships, and product collaborations.

A Cultural Revival Meets Strategic Retail Growth

“The current Y2K excitement aligns perfectly with the foundation’s brand history and visual identity,” said KAB’s Founder and Creative Officer Shaney Jo Darden.

“Retailers are seeing an increase in demand for products that tap into nostalgia, especially when tied to an authentic purpose and meaningful cause."

KAB’s signature merchandise with its “i love boobies!” slogan — from its classic bracelets and t-shirts to recent limited release throwback colorways and never-before-seen designs — has long resonated with youth audiences. Today, it serves a dual function: delivering trend-forward product while introducing new consumers to KAB’s breast cancer prevention tools, including its free Keep A Breast App that guides users through how to perform a breast self-exam from virtually anywhere in the world.

To-date, nearly 21,000 new KAB App users have been driven directly from KAB retail partners, making the nonprofit’s merchandise one of its most effective tools for health education and early detection awareness.

"At Zumiez, we’re proud to partner with brands that stand for something meaningful,” Zumiez Divisional Merchandise Manager Melissa George said.

“In the last year, we sold over 200,000 KAB bracelets — proof that our customers connect deeply with both the product and the cause. Our sales teams do an incredible job sharing that story and connecting customers to the movement. They’re passionate about the message and proud to help carry it forward every day in our stores."

Product That Performs

From a performance standpoint, KAB’s merchandise program has become a reliable revenue driver for both nonprofit operations and participating retail partners. In addition to Zumiez, successful collaborations have launched with brands such as:

* Blenders Eyewear, which has contributed over $300,000 through a long-term co-branded product partnership.
* PSD's co-branded products were in the top 5 selling styles on PSD.com and is one of the top booked collections for the underwear brand’s wholesale partners.
* DIXXON's limited-edition KAB collaboration flannels sold out within minutes of launch.
* Seager, which donates 100% of profits from limited-edition pink snapbacks to KAB, a tradition their retail community looks forward to each year.
* Slushcult's KAB fingerboard collaboration resulted in a $10,000 donation to the organization, selling over 10,000 units through retail purchases at Zumiez.

“We’re proud to partner with brands that share our values of creativity, community, and impact,” Darden said.

“The more integrated and aligned the partnership, the more successful the collaboration tends to be, both in terms of revenue and mission delivery.”

A Platform with Purpose

As the organization reflects on its legacy and positions for future growth, KAB continues to offer a proven platform for brand partners seeking authentic community engagement and long-term impact.

“At Dixxon, we believe that great products should stand for something greater,” said Dixxon’s Chief Creative Officer Chris Vallely.

“Partnering with Keep A Breast has given us the opportunity to not just raise awareness, but to actively contribute to a cause that impacts millions of lives. Breast cancer has touched so many in our community — our customers, our families, our team — and we’re proud to stand alongside KAB in the fight for early detection and prevention. Every piece we create tells a story of resilience, hope, and community.”

The organization’s aim to reduce breast cancer risk provides an exciting and engaging entry point for partnerships aiming to not just engage with the cause passively, but to provide actionable opportunities for self advocacy to their audiences, improving breast health accessibility everywhere.

"I’ll never forget the call from my mom telling me she had breast cancer — I had to pull over, and in that moment, everything came into perspective,” said Blenders Eyewear Founder Chase Fisher.

“From that point forward, we made it our mission at Blenders to go all in on this fight. Partnering with Keep A Breast has given that mission a voice and a platform. They’re not just doing great things — they’re great people creating real impact through art, education, and awareness. They’ve become an extension of our team and, honestly, like family.”

A Strong Retail Foundation with Room to Scale

To support growth and increased consumer demand, KAB has recently expanded its ecommerce infrastructure to include Shopify, Amazon,TikTok and Instagram storefronts. Internal investments have also been made in fulfillment operations, staffing, and packaging to meet modern expectations and scale efficiently.

All products include KAB’s hallmark breast health education materials and QR links to the app, creating a direct link between commerce and education.

KAB celebrates 25 years of youth education and prevention efforts this year with expanded capsule collections, including a forthcoming anniversary collaboration with Etnies, as well as a multi-year apparel and underwear program with PSD.

"I've always admired the work done by the team at Keep A Breast and was thrilled to build a partnership with them through PSD,” PSD General Manager Bill Gage said.

“We have fantastic retail partners involved in this partnership who have wholeheartedly supported this program, and we look forward to maintaining a long-term partnership with Keep A Breast going forward."

KAB is exploring new international retail opportunities, brand collaborations and in-person activations this summer at the iconic Vans Warped Tour as the organization celebrates its 25th anniversary. The organization recently surpassed its sales forecast for the first leg of the tour, netting more than $25,000 in merchandise sales over the two tour days in Washington D.C. earlier this month.

“It’s incredible to reflect on how far we’ve come, and to still have long-term retail partners who have believed in our mission from the beginning means the world to us,” said Darden. “I absolutely love the sense of nostalgia our ‘i love boobies!’ merchandise is sparking in people — it’s a reminder of what we created and how deeply it has resonated. At the same time, it’s thrilling to have this opportunity to connect with an entirely new generation and continue spreading our message of breast cancer prevention in fresh, meaningful ways."

 Celebrating 25 years, The Keep A Breast Foundation™ is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission to reduce breast cancer risk and its impact globally through art, education, prevention and action. Since it was founded in 2000, KAB has acknowledged the power and vision of young people–ready to be engaged and educated, to establish their identities through meaningful action. KAB strives to empower youth to become their own health advocates and believe that art and creative expression are powerful healing tools. “i love boobies!” an inscription on KAB's popular, Supreme Court-stirring merchandise, continues to spark conversation and prompt action globally.
