# UGI Urges Customers to Consider Energy Conservation During Extreme Cold

With extremely cold temperatures forecasted through the end of next week, and the expected increase in energy demand, UGI Utilities is asking customers to consider ways to reduce usage while still staying safe and warm.

Ways to reduce energy consumption and costs include:

* Set your thermostat two to three degrees lower than the current setting or to the lowest comfortable setting.
* Delay using large appliances when possible or restrict usage during peak hours (6:00am – 10:00am and 5:00pm – 10:00pm).
* Avoiding use of natural gas fireplaces.
* Turn off non-essential lights, equipment, and appliances.
* Seal drafty areas around windows and doors.
* Open curtains and blinds during the day to take advantage of the warming effects of sunlight.
* Keep warm indoors by dressing in layers and using blankets.

Our crews are prepared to respond to any service interruptions. Please report outages or other service issues by calling UGI at 800-276-2722. Always stay away from downed wires. If you smell the rotten egg odor added to natural gas, evacuate immediately and get at least the length of a football field away before calling UGI or 911.
