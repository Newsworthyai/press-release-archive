# UGI System Upgrades Set to Get Underway Next Week Near State Capitol in Harrisburg

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin several system upgrades next week in Harrisburg. The projects are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.

The natural gas main and service line replacements are expected to be completed by the end of June and impact travel and parking on the following streets:

* North 10th St between State Street and Market Street
* Walnut Street between North 4th Street and Aberdeen Street
* North Court Street between Strawberry Street and Market Street
* North 2nd Street between Walnut Street and Strawberry Street
* North 3rd St between Cranberry Street and Locust Street
* Intersection of Pine Street and North 3rd Street
* South Street between Susquehanna Street and North Court Street
* Oliver Alley between North 3rd Street and Susquehanna Street

Construction is scheduled daily, including weekends, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities is available at www.ugi.com.
