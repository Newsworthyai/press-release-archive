# UGI’s Upcoming System Upgrades in Emmaus Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: March 12, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin more system upgrades in Emmaus on Monday, March 17. The gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The replacement is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-July and will impact travel on the following streets:

* West Greenleaf Street between Macungie Avenue and North 7th Street
* North 7th Street between Harrison Street and West Berger Street
* West Berger Street between North 7th Street and Franklin Street
* Franklin Street between West Berger Street and North Street
* North Street between Franklin Street and North Moyer Street
* 6th Street between Elm Street and Long Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
