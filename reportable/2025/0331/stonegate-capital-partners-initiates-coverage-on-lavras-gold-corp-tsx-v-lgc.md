# Stonegate Capital Partners Initiates Coverage on Lavras Gold Corp. (TSX-V: LGC)

DALLAS, TX -- March 31st, 2025 -- Lavras Gold Corp. (TSX-V: LGC): Stonegate Capital Partners initiates their coverage on Lavras Gold Corp. (TSX-V: LGC). As of 4Q24, Lavras Gold maintained a disciplined financial approach, ending the year with a cash balance of C$1.65M. The Company has successfully managed its exploration expenditures through equity financing, completing a significant C$15.0M raise in February 2025 at C$2.20 per share, attracting new institutional investors. Operating expenses remain primarily focused on exploration and evaluation, ensuring effective use of resources. With no outstanding long-term debt, LGC retains substantial financial flexibility to advance its exploration targets.

Company Updates:

Exploration Success: Lavras Gold continues to achieve notable exploration milestones, particularly highlighted by the Fazenda do Posto discovery, a significant blind gold discovery located just 150 meters west of the existing Butiá Deposit. Drilling at Fazenda do Posto has demonstrated robust mineralization, with key intercepts such as 340 meters grading 1.1 g/t gold and a high-grade core of 59 meters grading 2.9 g/t gold at depth. The Company has expanded exploration activities, including the recently announced Olaria discovery, with intervals of 56 meters grading 1.0 g/t gold. The ongoing exploration strategy in 2025 involves approximately 17,000 meters of additional drilling at Fazenda do Posto, Butiá, and Caneleira, further advancing Lavras Gold’s mineral resource potential.

Butiá Deposit: The Butiá Deposit remains Lavras Gold’s most advanced project, hosting M&I resources totaling approximately 377,000 ounces of gold. Recent drilling has demonstrated extensive continuity and grade potential, including significant intercepts of 236 meters grading 1.4 g/t gold. Butiá's mineralization remains open at depth and laterally, with exploration focused on extending its known mineralized footprint.

Cerrito Deposit: The Cerrito Deposit has continued to display significant mineral potential, with indicated resources of approximately 188,000 ounces of gold and inferred resources of 293,000 ounces. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike, suggesting considerable potential for further resource expansion through ongoing exploration efforts.

Additional Discoveries: Lavras Gold's exploration activities have uncovered several additional high-potential discoveries. Notably, the Fazenda do Posto discovery is shaping into a promising bulk tonnage, disseminated-style deposit with robust gold mineralization to depths exceeding 400 meters. Other discoveries like Zeca Souza and Vila Marieta continue to deliver encouraging results, underscoring the expansive potential across Lavras Gold's extensive exploration concessions.

Outlook and Leadership: Lavras Gold aims to transition from exploration to production by advancing economic and metallurgical studies at Fazenda do Posto and Butiá towards a preliminary economic assessment (PEA). Supported by robust gold market conditions, the Company is strategically positioned to attract joint venture partnerships and additional capital investments. This ambitious vision is backed by an experienced management team led by CEO Michael Durose, whose expertise in geology and financial markets, together with Chairman Rolly Uloth's proven executive leadership at Wesdome Gold Mines, provides Lavras Gold with a significant competitive edge to execute its growth strategy.
