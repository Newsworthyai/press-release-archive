# UGI Begins Upgrades in the City of Lancaster and Lancaster Township

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 17, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. began a natural gas main replacement project today in Lancaster and Lancaster Township. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.  The work could also create opportunities for homeowners and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* High Street between Charles Road and South Pearl Street
* Euclid Avenue to St. Joseph Street
* Rear Parking Lot of Manor Shopping Center
* Hershey Avenue Intersection at High Street
* South Pearl Street Intersection at High Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers may experience lane and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by the end of December. Temporary restoration of the area will occur immediately afterwards. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
