# BioMed X launches Women’s Health R&D Accelerator in Heidelberg

Heidelberg, Germany, October 14, 2025 – BioMed X today announced the launch of XFem Labs, a new Women’s Health R&D Accelerator in Heidelberg. The purpose of this initiative, which is supported by the Gates Foundation, is to establish a world-class women’s health innovation hub that advances early-stage research into scalable solutions for women in need around the world, including low- and middle-income countries.

Embedded within the academic environments of the University of Heidelberg and Yale, and directly within R&D campuses of leading pharmaceutical companies, BioMed X bridges the translational gap between academia and industry to drive transformative innovation.

The first project at the new XFem Labs accelerator in Heidelberg is entitled “New Strategies for Female-Controlled Non-Hormonal Contraception”. Despite the availability of various contraceptive methods, 257 million women worldwide still face significant barriers to access. Current hormonal contraceptives are often associated with side effects, such as changes in bleeding patterns, resulting in high discontinuation rates. Non-hormonal, female-controlled alternatives remain limited and often challenging, hence there is an urgent need for new options.

The first XFem Labs call for application invites proposals that explore new biological targets, molecular mechanisms, or delivery modalities for continuous and/or on-demand non-hormonal contraception. Selected researchers will participate in a boot camp at BioMed X, resulting in the incubation of a new research team based In Heidelberg.

“Our joint goal with the Gates Foundation is to create a significant impact on the lives and health of women world-wide,” said Dr. Christian Tidona, CEO of BioMed X. “Together with an international network of top experts and key opinion leaders, we will jointly build and mentor new outstanding research teams who will strive to solve some of the most pressing challenges in women’s health.”

Researchers interested in becoming part of this new research group are invited to respond to this international call by submitting a project proposal via the BioMed X Career Space at https://career.bmedx.com/call/2025-XFL-C01 before December 7, 2025.

This first XFem Labs project is made possible with a $2 million grant and network support from the Gates Foundation.
