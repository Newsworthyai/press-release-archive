# Stonegate Capital Partners Updates Coverage on Provident Financial Services Inc (NYSE: PFS) 2025 Q3

DALLAS, TX -- November 5th, 2025 -- Provident Financial Services Inc (NYSE: PFS): Stonegate Capital Partners updates their coverage on Provident Financial Services Inc (NYSE: PFS). Provident Financial Services delivered another strong quarter of consistent profitability and operational improvement. Net income was $71.7 million, compared with $72.0 million in 2Q25, translating to EPS of $0.55, in line with consensus expectations. Total revenue reached a record $221.8 million, up from $214.2 million in the prior quarter, supported by robust loan production and disciplined deposit pricing. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings rose 9% sequentially to a record $109 million, representing a 1.76% return on average assets, underscoring Provident’s improving core profitability.

Company Updates:

Net Interest Income and Margin: Net interest income increased 3.9% sequentially to $194.3 million, driven by new originations and repricing at favorable market rates, offset partially by modest increases in deposit costs. The reported net interest margin expanded seven basis points to 3.43%, as higher yields on earning assets outpaced funding-cost pressures. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets rose eight basis points to 5.76%, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased two basis points to 2.96%. Management reaffirmed its 4Q25 NIM guidance, citing a largely neutral interest-rate position and the potential for incremental benefit from an expected December Fed rate cut and a steepening yield curve.

Loans and Deposits: Loan growth remained steady, with period-end loans increasing $181 million, or 0.9%, to $19.3 billion. Growth was led by a $149 million increase in commercial and industrial loans to $4.84 billion and a $52 million rise in mortgage warehouse lines to $292 million, offset by modest declines in construction and residential portfolios. Deposits increased $388 million, or 2.1%, to $19.1 billion, driven primarily by core deposits, which grew $291 million to $15.7 billion. Wholesale deposits represented approximately 4.8% of total funding. Credit quality remained solid, with nonperforming assets improving to 0.41%, and the allowance for credit losses were at 0.97% of loans, down slightly from 0.98% in 2Q25. The loan pipeline expanded with a weighted average rate of 6.15%, reflecting sustained origination momentum across commercial and specialty verticals.

Financial Ratios and Capital: Provident’s profitability and capital ratios remained robust, reflecting continued improvement in underlying operating leverage. The Company reported a ROAA of 1.16%, ROAE of 10.39%, and ROATE of 16.01%, compared to 1.19%, 10.76%, and 16.79% in the prior quarter, respectively. Pre-tax, pre-provision ROAA increased to 1.76% from 1.64%, while the efficiency ratio improved to 51.0% from 53.5%, supported by disciplined expense management. Tangible book value per share increased 3.6% to $15.13, and the tangible common equity ratio improved to 8.22% from 8.03%, indicating strong capital formation and organic book-value accretion. As of September 30, 2025, total assets stood at $24.8 billion, total loans at $19.3 billion, and total deposits at $19.1 billion.
