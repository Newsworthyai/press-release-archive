# UGI Urges Customers to Be Safe and Use Energy Wisely During Extreme Heat

With excessive heat warnings in effect this week, and potentially record-breaking temperatures, UGI is offering tips to help keep the public safe and minimize energy usage.

* If you have a programmable thermostat and central air conditioning, raise the setting to the highest possible comfortable temperature. Also, raise the temperature if you will not be home for an extended period.
* Close doors that lead to uncooled parts of your home. If you have central air conditioning, close off vents to unused rooms. Keep air conditioning filters clean.
* Use ceiling and portable fans to circulate air as an alternative to air conditioning.
* Seal holes and cracks around doors and windows. Eliminate air leaks around window air conditioners with foam insulation or weather-stripping.
* Close blinds, shades, and draperies facing the sun to keep out the sun’s heat and help fans and air conditioners cool more efficiently.
* Stay hydrated and know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat exhaustion happens when your body has an excessive loss of water and salt, usually through heavy sweating. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include headache, nausea, dizziness, and weakness. Heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke, which can be deadly. This is when your body can no longer control its temperature. Symptoms include confusion, slurred speech, loss of consciousness, and seizures. If someone is experiencing these symptoms, seek medical attention.
* Check on the elderly, infants, young children, and those with chronic health problems or disabilities. They are more vulnerable to the effects of heat.
* Never leave children or pets in a parked vehicle.

If you have a service issue, UGI emergency response is available 24 hours a day, every day.  Your safety is always our top priority. UGI can be reached at (800) 276-2722.
