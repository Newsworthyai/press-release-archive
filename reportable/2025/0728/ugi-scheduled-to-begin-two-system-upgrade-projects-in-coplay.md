# UGI Scheduled to Begin Two System Upgrade Projects in Coplay

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 28, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin two natural gas main replacement projects in Coplay. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The first project is expected to start on Monday, August 4 and be completed by early September. It will impact travel on the following streets:

* Pembroke Road between Wood Street and Stefko Boulevard
* Arcadia Street between Pembroke Road and Minsi Trail Street
* Minsi Trail Street between Arcadia Street and East Washington Avenue

The second project is scheduled to begin on Monday, August 11 and be completed by the end of September. Travel will be impacted on the following streets:

* Coplay Street between South Ninth Street and South Eighth Street
* South Eighth Street between Coplay Street and Hokendauqua Street
* Hokendauqua Street between South Eighth Street and South Sixth Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
