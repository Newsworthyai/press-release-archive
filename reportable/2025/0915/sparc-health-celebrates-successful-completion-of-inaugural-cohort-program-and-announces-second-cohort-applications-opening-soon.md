# SPARC Health Celebrates Successful Completion of Inaugural Cohort Program and Announces Second Cohort Applications Opening Soon

SALT LAKE CITY, UT – September 15, 2025 – SPARC Health, a collaborative effort between Park City Angels (PCA), BioUtah, BioHive, in partnership with Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity (GOEO), today announced the successful completion of its inaugural cohort program with impressive metrics demonstrating significant impact on Utah's healthcare startup ecosystem.

Inaugural Cohort Delivers Exceptional ResultsThe first SPARC Health cohort supported nine healthcare startups through a comprehensive 10-module curriculum over 20+ hours of structured programming. Key achievements include:

Financial and Growth Impact:

* Over $677,000 in investment and funding secured
* 14 jobs created or retained across cohort companies
* Bloom Surgical closed $1 million seed round and expanded operations team
* RefloDx secured $250,000 after winning Trans-Atlantic Angel Group competition and presenting in Paris, France
* DME, rebranded to “Wonder Creations, LLC”, increased revenue 6x

Comprehensive Curriculum Addresses Critical Startup ChallengesThe 10-module program targeted the three primary reasons startups fail: poor product-market fit, running out of cash, and assembling the wrong team. Key modules included:

Foundation: Strategic planning, team formation, cash management, and product-market fit Advanced Development: Exit planning, quality management systems, stakeholder communication, brand development, corporate law/IP, and team culture

Each module combined preparatory tasks, training sessions, and homework, supported by mentors from Utah's healthcare ecosystem who provided direct access to experienced operational leaders and investors.

Looking Forward: Second Cohort and Continued Innovation"The success of our inaugural cohort validates our approach to healthcare startup acceleration," said Ted McAleer, Founder & Executive in Residence at SPARC Health. "We've proven that structured programming combined with access to our community of mentors in Utah's healthcare ecosystem can deliver measurable results for early-stage companies."

Applications for the second cohort are anticipated to open later this year, continuing to leverage the proven curriculum while incorporating lessons learned from the inaugural program.

SPARC Health also continues fostering community engagement through "Startup Huddle" events, where companies present specific challenges to experienced healthcare leaders, mentors, and investors, creating collaborative opportunities that benefit the entire ecosystem.

Interested healthcare startups should watch for second cohort application announcements expected later this year.
