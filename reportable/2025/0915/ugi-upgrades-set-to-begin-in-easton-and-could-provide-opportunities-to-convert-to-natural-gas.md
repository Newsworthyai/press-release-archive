# UGI Upgrades Set to Begin in Easton and Could Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: September 15, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project in Easton on Wednesday, September 17. This project was originally set to begin last month but had to be rescheduled. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* South 15th Street between Northampton Street and Liberty Street
* Northampton Street between South 15th Street and North 7th Street
* North 7th Street between Northampton Street and Church Street
* South 12th Street between Northampton Street and Ferry Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by early January. The completion date may change due to weather and working conditions. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
