# Knowledge Workers See AI as a Communication Aid Not a Job Replacement

BENTONVILLE, Ark., Mar. 24, 2025 – As generative AI continues to transform work, a recent survey of 1000 knowledge workers from mmhmm revealed a significant gap in how knowledge workers perceive its value. While workers understand that AI can play a role in automating work, they find the most value in AI helping them communicate more effectively. What’s more, the survey found a stark divide between the value senior leadership sees in AI and how employees perceive it, as well as a possible hidden well of AI activity happening throughout the workplace.

Findings include:

* Senior leaders are three times more likely than other workers to use AI as a daily work assistant.
* 31% of Gen-Z workers feel ashamed or guilty about using AI at work.
* 32% of Gen-Z workers use AI but prefer to keep it a secret.
* 14% of executives already consider AI indispensable to their jobs.
* 76% of senior leaders want AI to assist in decision-making, not make choices for them.
* 47% of workers say AI helps them become more compelling communicators.

Executives Embrace AI as a Decision-Making Partner

Senior leadership uses AI to help make decisions, focusing on activities like brainstorming and exploring options, with 76% saying that AI should support, not replace, their judgment. That doesn’t mean it’s all about decisions. Nearly two-thirds of executives are comfortable with AI-generated content as long as it maintains a human-like quality.

In contrast, many individual contributors worry about AI’s impact on job security, and nearly a third of Gen-Z workers feel guilt or embarrassment when using AI tools. This leads to a hidden block of AI activity in the workplace, as 32% of Gen-Z workers say they secretly use AI, even as some openly criticize their colleagues for the same activity.

Common Ground: AI Makes for Better Communicators

Despite differing perspectives, both executives an individual contributors agree that generative AI’s biggest benefit is in helping them become better communicators. Workers are using AI to help structure their thoughts, refine messaging, and improve clarity in workplace discussions. Twice as many employees turn to AI for communication support over technical activities like coding or data analysis.
