# PRO NEW ENGLAND CELEBRATES EXCELLENCE IN REMODELING AT THE 2025 PRO AWARDS

Milford, MA – PRO New England, the professional remodeling organization, held the annual PRO Awards which recognizes and celebrates excellence in remodeling. A panel of industry experts judge the entries and based on a point system, award a Gold and Silver winner.

Special awards include the prestigious Member of the Year Award, presented to Michelle Glassburn, President, Lavallee Systems and former Executive Director of PRO New England, by Eric Adams, President, Adams + Beasley Associates and Board Chair of PRO New England. The Member of the Year award recognizes longtime support and participation in the organization. Current PRO New England board president, Robert Way, Robert Way Construction, kicked off the event welcoming more than 300 members and guests at Clark Showroom in Milford, Massachusetts.

A new award was introduced in 2025 – the Impact Award – for the member who has contributed to the organization in a significant way during the year. Presented by Eric Adams, the inaugural award went to Sterling Bump, Custom Contracting. Other members recognized during the ceremony include long-serving board members rotating off the Board of Directors: Peter Feinmann, Feinmann, Inc.; Justin Zeller, President, Red House Design Build; Michelle Glassburn, Lavallee Systems; and Kathy DeMeyer, Encore Construction, who also served as PRO Awards chair for many years.

PRO New England Executive Director, John Marchiony, introduced the event Emcee, Amy Strack, Principal, Studio A Marketing, who has hosted the PRO Awards for the past four years. Event sponsors present a variety of awards as noted in the list of winners and below.

The 2025 PRO Awards were the culmination of over a year of effort, with projects completed after December 2022, judged blindly by industry peers across New England using a standardized ballot. Judges each invested more than a dozen hours evaluating entries, ensuring a fair and thorough selection process.

This year’s award categories were refined to better reflect the evolving trends and specialties within the industry—thanks to the thoughtful work of the PRO Awards Committee, led by Chair Kristin Mackin of F.D. Sterritt Lumber, with invaluable support from Kathy DeMeyer of Encore Construction, Julie Dalton of Platt Builders, Bridget O’Neil of Onyx Marble & Granite, Robin Shor of SPLASH, Amy Strack of Studio A Marketing, Jodi Swartz of KitchenVisions, and PRO New England Director of Events, Joanne Roy.

“I absolutely LOVE the PRO Awards,” said Kristin Mackin of F.D. Sterritt Lumber, the event’s lead sponsor. “It’s the most gorgeous night of the year for PRO New England. The projects are stunning, and I leave dreaming of moving into every single one!”

The members with the most recognition were Highline Construction, with four Gold and two Silver PRO Awards, and GMT Home Design, with two Gold and two Silver PRO Awards. Category groups were presented by the event sponsors.

This year’s recipients are Kyle Miller, Blackstone Valley; Kaylee Bacon, Medford Technical Vocational High School; Gregorio Burgos, Essex North Shore; and Diego Canales, Tri-County.
