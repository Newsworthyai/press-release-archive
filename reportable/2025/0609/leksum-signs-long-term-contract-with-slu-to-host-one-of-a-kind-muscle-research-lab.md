# LEKSUM Signs Long-Term Contract with SLU to Host One-of-a-Kind Muscle Research Lab

BOSTON, Massachusetts, June 9, 2025; Leksum LLC ("Leksum") has partnered with the Department of Clinical Sciences, SLU, Uppsala, Sweden ("SLU") to host Leksum's one-of-a-kind muscle research lab. It will be headed by Lars Larsson, MD/PhD, Leksum's Chief Scientific Officer, one of the world's leading researchers in muscle science. The lab is a unique experimental ICU model not limited by early mortality. Leksum's scientific team leverages the lab to understand the mechanism underlying the loss of muscle mass and function coupled with myosin modifications and preferential myosin loss. No other lab in the world can do the long-term mechanistic and intervention studies required for substantive muscle studies under ICU conditions, which require immobilization and mechanical ventilation ("MV").

Professor Larsson and his team now have the only two experimental ICU models worldwide not limited by early mortality. Standard commercially available ventilators are not capable of maintaining life support for much longer than a day or two, which adds a significant confounding factor related to the deteriorating preparation being studied. Further, it takes five days and longer exposure to the ICU condition (consisting of MV and immobilization) to develop critical illness myopathy ("CIM"), which is necessary to begin to replicate the condition of human ICU patients. The ability to replicate long-term survival is imperative for both mechanistic and intervention studies of myopathies related to long-term use of MV in ICUs.

The partnership between Leksum and SLU will be the foundation upon which Leksum will continue its groundbreaking research into therapies for acquired muscle myopathies. Professor Larsson commented, "I am pleased that Leksum and SLU were able to form a mutually beneficial arrangement that will support our team's continued research into a clinical approach that can be used both prophylactically and therapeutically to treat muscle myopathies affecting millions of patients a year."

 About Leksum Leksum LLC, based in Boston, Massachusetts with its primary laboratory at SLU, Uppsala, Sweden, is an early-stage life sciences company developing advanced biologic therapies to address acquired muscle myopathies. The company is preparing to enter into Phase I/IIa studies related to its LK-ICU program, which encompasses therapies addressing muscle myopathies resulting from the use of mechanical ventilation in ICUs, in particular with immobilized patients. Leksum's scientific team is also researching additional skeletal muscle conditions including sarcopenia, cancer cachexia, and muscle-loss due to the use of weight-loss drugs (i.e., GLP-1s).About SLUSLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences), Department of Clinical Sciences, located in Uppsala, Sweden, conducts education, research and environmental monitoring and assessment in collaboration with society at large. Through its focus on the interaction between humans, animals and ecosystems and the responsible use of natural resources, it contributes to sustainable societal development and good living conditions on our planet.
