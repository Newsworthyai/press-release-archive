# Altss Grows to 9,000 Family Offices—the Largest FO Database—and Readies Full LP Intelligence

September 24th, 2025- Miami, Florida- Altss announced a major expansion of its allocator intelligence platform, increasing verified family-office coverage to 9,000—the largest family-office database globally. The update is designed for general partners (GPs) and investor-relations (IR) teams that need current, decision-grade context on who allocates, why, and when.

Altss prioritizes evidence, recency, and provenance. Profiles are refreshed on a frequent cadence and enriched with OSINT-derived indicators that affect allocator behavior: mandate shifts, new fund activity, team and board changes, and conference participation. Precision filtering enables research, due-diligence, and meeting-prep workflows by strategy, stage, geography, structure, and commitment profile.

“Scale only matters if it’s current,” said Dawid Siekiera, Founder of Altss. “By pairing the largest verified family-office coverage with live LP signals and transparent sourcing, we help teams focus on the allocators most likely to be relevant—today and in the weeks ahead as we expand to full LP coverage.”

Coverage scope: Family-office intelligence spans North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Near-term additions extend to institutional LPs—pensions, insurers, endowments, sovereign funds, corporates, banks, and RIAs—with structured fields aligned to IR and diligence workflows.

What’s new in this expansion:

* Family-office first: 9,000+ verified family offices mapped with practical fields for triage and preparation.
* Live LP context: OSINT signals on mandates, team moves, new funds, and events to inform timing and prioritization.
* Fast refresh, source-aware: Frequent re-checks of critical fields with change-triggered updates and traceable sources.
* Research-grade filters: Strategy, stage, geography, structure, and commitment profile for allocator research and capital-formation planning.

What’s next: Over the next few weeks, Altss will extend to full institutional LP coverage; subsequent phases broaden the graph to startups and funds (venture, growth, and private equity), combining the breadth of legacy market databases with a Palantir-style layer of relationship context and social-listening signals.

With this expansion, Altss positions itself as a decision-grade alternative to legacy market databases—favoring current data, transparent provenance, and a graph that reflects how capital actually moves in private markets.
