# UGI Set to Begin Upgrades in Northampton Borough Next Week

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: September 24, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project in Northampton Borough on Monday, September 29. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* Newport Avenue between the 1700 Block of Newport Avenue and West Laubach Avenue
* West 17th Street between Canal Street and Railroad Street
* Poplar Street between West 17th Street and West 16th Street
* Cedar Street between West 16th Street and West 14th Street
* West 16th Street between Cedar Street and Railroad Street
* Railroad Street between West 17th Street and West 16th Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-March. The completion date may change due to weather and working conditions. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
