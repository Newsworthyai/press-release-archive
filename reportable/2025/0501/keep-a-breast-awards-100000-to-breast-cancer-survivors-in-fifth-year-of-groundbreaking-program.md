# Keep A Breast Awards $100,000 to Breast Cancer Survivors in Fifth Year of Groundbreaking Program

UNDER EMBARGO until May 1, 2025 9 a.m. (PACIFIC)

Yucca Valley, CA – May 1, 2025 – The Keep A Breast Foundation, a leading nonprofit organization focused on breast cancer prevention, early detection and support, proudly announces the fifth cycle of its Give Back Grant program, awarding $100,000 in direct funding to women of color impacted by breast cancer. This year's funding, awarded in partnership with major donors Curvy Couture and Smart&Sexy, will benefit 200 breast cancer patients and survivors, providing financial relief during and after treatment.

Launched in 2020 as part of Keep A Breast’s ongoing commitment to racial equity in healthcare, the Give Back Grant program addresses the disproportionate impact breast cancer has on communities of color. This year marks the fifth consecutive year of dedicated funding to support Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who are navigating a breast cancer diagnosis.

“Reaching this five-year milestone is both humbling and motivating,” said Shaney Jo Darden, Founder of Keep A Breast. “We created the Give Back Grant to show up for BIPOC women survivors in real and meaningful ways. Seeing the impact year after year reminds us that small acts of financial support can ripple out into big waves of healing, empowerment, and equity.”

To date, the Give Back Grant program has provided over $700,000 in micro-grants to more than 1,000 individuals, easing financial burdens related to transportation, medical bills, childcare, groceries, and other essential expenses. By focusing on underserved populations, Keep A Breast and the organization’s partners continue to push for systemic change in breast cancer outcomes through both prevention and support.

“At Smart&Sexy, we believe that confidence starts from within—and everyone deserves to feel supported, seen, and empowered,” said Sara Safarian, Brand Marketing and Communications Manager for the intimates apparel brand. “Partnering with Keep A Breast and contributing to the Give Back Grant Program allows us to do just that. We’re honored to stand behind a mission that uplifts BIPOC breast cancer survivors and fighters, helping them navigate their journeys with strength and dignity. Supporting this initiative year after year is more than a partnership—it’s a promise to always show up for our community.”

That commitment to care is shared across their sister brand, Curvy Couture, which also champions the Give Back Grant with financial support as part of its ongoing mission to uplift and celebrate every body.

“At Curvy Couture, we believe that Every Kind of Curvy & body deserves to be celebrated, empowered, and adorned in ways that make them feel seen and supported,” Summer Rose Beltran, Brand Marketing Manager for Curvy Couture said. “Our partnership with the Keep A Breast allows us to extend this mission beyond lingerie—creating a space where Breast Cancer Survivors can embrace joy and community through KAB’s Give Back Grant program. We are honored to uplift and support this beautiful community, year after year. It’s also given great insight to our customers on proper preventative care.”

Recipients are selected through a community-centered review process supported by volunteers in the BIPOC survivor and patient community. Grant applicants must self-identify as BIPOC, reside in the U.S., and be in active treatment or a breast cancer survivor. Previous applicants and recipients can reapply.

“Every cycle of the Give Back Grant reminds me why this work matters so deeply,” said Marquita Goodluck, Give Back Grant Program Manager and past recipient. “As someone who once stood on the receiving end of this support, it’s incredibly meaningful to now help carry it forward. Seeing another 200 BIPOC breast cancer survivors receive the care and recognition they deserve is so rewarding.”

The program would not be possible without the generous support of individual donors, community fundraisers, and corporate partners who are committed to advancing health equity and making a real impact, without the red tape.

To help sustain and expand future cycles of the Give Back Grant, Keep A Breast encourages individuals to donate, start a fundraiser, or explore corporate sponsorship opportunities. Every contribution helps provide critical support to BIPOC breast cancer patients and survivors when they need it most.
