# UGI Scheduled to Begin Additional System Upgrades in Allentown

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 1, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a system upgrade project in Allentown tomorrow and the second one next week. The gas main replacements are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project starting May 2 is expected to be completed by late July and will impact travel on the following streets:

* East Elm Street between South Aubrey Street and South Carlisle Street
* South Bradford Street between East South Street and East Fairview Street
* East Fairview Street between South Bradford Street and South Boyd Street

On May 5, a second project will begin. It is expected to be completed by mid-September and impact travel on the following streets:

* Lehigh Street between West Wyoming Street and West Tioga Street
* Keck Street between West Tioga Street and Juniata Street
* West Tioga Street between Lehigh Street and Keck Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date on installing the new natural gas main. Final paving and restoration may take several weeks to complete.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
