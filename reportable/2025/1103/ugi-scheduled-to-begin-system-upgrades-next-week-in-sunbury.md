# UGI Scheduled to Begin System Upgrades Next Week in Sunbury

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: November 3, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin system upgrades in Sunbury on Monday, November 10th. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by the end of December and impact travel on the following roads:

* Susquehanna Avenue from Amy Street to Julia Street
* Julia Street from Edison Avenue to Cake Walk
* Packer Street from Susquehanna Avenue to 215 Packer Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
