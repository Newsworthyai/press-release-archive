# UGI System Upgrades in Union Township Scheduled to Begin Next Week

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: June 16, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin system upgrades in Union Township, including an area of Winfield, on Monday, June 23. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by early September and impact travel on the following roads:

* Trutt Road between County Line Road and Felmey Road
* Woodsedge Drive from Trutt Road to cul-de-sac at end of road
* Felmey Road from Trutt Road to Amish Road

UGI will also have to replace service lines to customers along Felmey Road, Park Road, Shirley Drive and Westbranch Highway.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
