# First Orion Named “Telecommunications Solution Provider of the Year” in 2025 Mobile Breakthrough Awards

NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – November 4, 2025 – First Orion, a leading provider of branded communications solutions, today announced that it has been named the “Telecommunications Solution Provider of the Year” in the prestigious 2025 Mobile Breakthrough Awards. The annual awards program recognizes the top companies, technologies, and products driving innovation and excellence across the global mobile and wireless industry.

In today’s mobile world, spam calls, illegal robocalls, and anonymous “unknown” numbers have eroded trust in voice communication. First Orion’s branded communication solutions restore consumer confidence by enabling businesses to display their name, logo, and reason for calling directly on a recipient’s screen—transforming unknown numbers into recognized, trusted interactions. Proven results—higher answer rates, reduced fraud, and stronger engagement for leading brands—helped the company earn this industry distinction.

“Our mission is simple yet powerful — to make every call worth answering,” said Scott Hambuchen, CEO of First Orion. “This recognition from Mobile Breakthrough reinforces our belief that trust is the cornerstone of modern communication. We’re proud to lead the way in restoring confidence in the phone call and helping brands connect with customers transparently and reliably.”

First Orion’s technology is deeply integrated with major U.S. wireless carriers, allowing its branded calling solutions to function seamlessly across networks, devices, and operating systems. This carrier-backed integration provides enterprises with unmatched reach and reliability while helping consumers identify legitimate calls from recognized brands—reducing fraud and improving engagement rates across the industry.
