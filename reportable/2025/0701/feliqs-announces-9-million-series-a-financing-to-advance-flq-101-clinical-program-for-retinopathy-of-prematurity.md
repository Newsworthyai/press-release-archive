Fukuoka, Japan/New York, United States – July 1st 2025 – FELIQS Corporation (“FELIQS”), a biotechnology company developing first-in-class small molecule therapeutics targeting oxidized lipids for rare pediatric retinal diseases, today announced the successful completion of a $9 million Series A funding round, co-led by a major American pharmaceutical company and Beyond Next Ventures Inc., with additional participation from, Japan Science and Technology Agency and existing investors, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital Co., Ltd., Keio Innovation Initiative, Inc. and FFG Venture Business Partners Co., Ltd. WBB Securities LLC acted as the placement agent and Latham & Watkins provided legal counsel to FELIQS in this transaction.

This investment will enable FELIQS to accelerate the clinical development of FLQ-101, its lead candidate for the prevention of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). FLQ-101 is a once-daily oral or intravenous solution designed to enhance physiological retinal vascularization and protect against inflammation and abnormal neovascularization. The Phase 1b/2 tROPhy-1 study is scheduled to commence in the summer of 2025 in the United States. In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted FLQ-101 both Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations, recognizing its potential to address a significant unmet medical need in neonatal care.

“We are honored to receive lead support from a major American company and Beyond Next Ventures and participation from Japan Science & Technology and existing investors” said Dr. Ken-ichiro (Nobu) Kuninobu, Co-Founder and CEO of FELIQS. “This investment provides critical momentum as we advance our first-in-human clinical study and build a robust pipeline of targeted treatments for pediatric patients who have long been underserved.”
