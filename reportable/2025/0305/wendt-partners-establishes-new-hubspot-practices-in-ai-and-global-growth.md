# Wendt Partners Establishes New HubSpot Practices in AI and Global Growth

New York, NY (March 5, 2025) - Wendt Partners, an award-winning HubSpot Elite Solutions Partner headquartered in New York City, announced today that the firm is establishing two new practice groups within the firm. Both will be delivered as part of the firm’s Growth Solutions line of business.

The new AI Practice will be focused on generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) solutions delivered through the HubSpot CRM platform, most notably HubSpot Breeze™, the industry’s leading fully integrated customer platform AI toolkit. The practice will focus on helping clients gain the most from new Breeze capabilities as well as solutions that provide added value to the HubSpot CRM platform, such as CustomerIQ.

The AI Practice will be led by Terry Sullivan, one of the firm’s Senior Growth Consultants. Terry is a seasoned and proven marketing and sales executive who has served as a CMO and executive leader in the B2B and B2C industries for more than 35 years. In addition, Terry is an adjunct professor in the Schools of Business and Communications at Webster University in St. Louis and has published three textbooks in Marketing Management, Brand Management, and International Marketing.

Alongside the AI Practice, Wendt Partners is launching its new Global Growth practice as well. This team will focus on advising client companies on cross-border growth strategies while also leading Wendt Partners in the firm’s own expansion efforts in Canada, Central and South America, the U.K. and Europe, and Australia/Asia. The Global Growth Practice will be led by John Crozier-Durham, a founding member of the firm’s Growth Solutions consulting team.

John is a proven global leadership executive and attorney with extensive legal and business experience guiding companies in cross-border expansion including U.S. market entry, Asia-Pacific market expansion, and financial strategy. John will also serve as the firm’s Melbourne office lead.

“HubSpot is a world leader in enterprise CRM technology and has set the standard now for two key growth priorities: the use of AI, and the ability to grow across borders,” says Doug Wendt, Co-Founder and Senior Partner with Wendt Partners. “With these two practices now established and under the capable leadership of Terry and John, we are well-positioned to guide HubSpot clients in these exciting new innovative endeavors.”
