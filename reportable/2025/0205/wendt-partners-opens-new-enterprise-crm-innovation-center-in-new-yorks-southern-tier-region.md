# Wendt Partners Opens New Enterprise CRM Innovation Center In New York’s Southern Tier Region

New York, NY (February 5, 2025) - Wendt Partners, a HubSpot Elite Solutions Partner headquartered in New York City, announced today that the firm is expanding its presence in New York State by opening the firm’s new Enterprise CRM Innovation Center (ECIC) in Greater Binghamton, at the heart of the state’s Southern Tier region. This location will complement the firm’s existing headquarters location in Queens, New York City.

The center is located inside Koffman on Plaza, an extension of the award-winning Koffman Southern Tier Incubator. The Koffman on Plaza facility is already home to other technology firms who maintain headquarters in New York City and are utilizing Greater Binghamton as a center for engineering, research and development. These include ZeroMark, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup focused on providing counter-drown technologies to the military and defense marketplace.

Made possible by generous donations from the Koffman family as well public and private partners, the Koffman Southern Tier Incubator is the region’s premier technology incubation and commercialization startup center, providing funding, advisory services and other support to emerging companies in technology, clean energy and related fields.
