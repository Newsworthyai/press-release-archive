Dallas, texas. December 22, 2025

DALLAS, TX -- December 22nd, 2025 --Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT): Stonegate Capital Partners updates their coverage on Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT). HOFT reported revenue, operating income, and adj EPS of $70.7M, ($16.3)M, and ($1.99), respectively. This compares to our/consensus estimates of $85.2M/$85.5M, ($2.2)M/($2.2)M, and ($0.15)/($0.14). Revenues came in below expectations, declining 32.2% y/y, driven primarily by the Company selling the majority of it’s HMI business segment. In contrast, Hooker Branded net sales grew 4.4% y/y and Domestic Upholstery increased 3.0%, underscoring continued resilience in the Legacy brands. Following the sale of its lower margin HMI business consolidated gross margins grew to 25.6% showing sequential growth. Overall profitability was challenged by one time trade name impairment charges related to the HMI transaction, which we expect to be mostly one time in nature. Management reaffirmed its focus on navigating macro headwinds such as housing market weakness, high mortgage rates, and subdued consumer demand, while positioning the company to return to profitability.
