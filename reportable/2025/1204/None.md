# Why Executives are Loving SoCal Wine Country for Business and Lifestyle

Once known primarily for its rolling vineyards and scenic charm, Southern California’s Wine Country is quickly becoming a top destination for business leaders seeking both professional opportunity, and a higher quality of life. Executives are increasingly trading congested commutes and high overhead costs for a region that blends economic vitality with a relaxed, family-friendly lifestyle.

A Smart Move for Business and BalanceWith its proximity to Los Angeles, SoCal Wine Country offers unparalleled access to Southern California’s major markets without the LA price tag. Companies relocating here are discovering a lower cost of living, shorter commutes, and access to family-friendly amenities that enrich employee well-being and retention.

“KTM is very happy to be in Southwest Riverside because of the skilled technicians, riders and support team members that live in the area and share a passion for racing and our brands,” says Robin Grangruth with KTM, who recently opened their North American Headquarters in the region, “The weather is ideal for year-round riding and the proximation to multiple tracks is vital to our business activities. Riverside County was incredibly helpful with our ground-up facility construction. This was our first property development, and we have only good things to say about our experience and all of the help from Riverside County.”

The Southern California Wine Country Economic Development Coalition (EDC) has played a key role in supporting these corporate transitions. Through leveraging strategic partnerships and providing tailored resources to empower local businesses and communities, the EDC has made it easier for businesses to land and expand in the region.

Local governments, industry groups, and educational institutions are working together to attract and sustain diverse industries ranging from advanced manufacturing and life sciences, to professional services and tech startups. The EDC is also advocating for business-friendly policies, making it a more sustainable environment for growth.

“Our success comes from collaboration,” notes Connie Stopher, Executive Director, SoCal Wine Country EDC. “Public and private partners here don’t compete — they collaborate. That spirit is what makes SoCal Wine Country a model for regional growth.”

Local municipalities are joining the movement too, Acting Mayor, Bob Karwin, of Menifee highlights recent business-friendly initiatives aimed at fostering innovation and supporting sustainable growth: “As one of the best places in Southern California to raise a family, we have a competitive advantage in providing businesses with confidence that they will be successful in our region, said Acting Mayor Karwin. “By providing a high quality of life for our families, we’re also drawing in a talented workforce rooted in the community and ready to support the expanding needs of our local businesses.”
