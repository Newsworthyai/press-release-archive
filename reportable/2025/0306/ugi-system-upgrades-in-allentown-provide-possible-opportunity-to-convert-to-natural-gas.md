# UGI System Upgrades in Allentown Provide Possible Opportunity to Convert to Natural Gas

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: March 6, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to began a gas main replacement project in Allentown on March 12. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-July and will impact the following streets:

* West Whitehall Street between Seventh Street and North Meadow Street
* North Emery Street between Keats Street and West Whitehall Street
* North Fair Street between West Whitehall Street and Clay Street
* North College Street between West Whitehall Street and Greenleaf Street
* North Mohr Street between West Whitehall Street and Greenleaf Street
* North 4th Street between West Whitehall Street and Sumner Avenue

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
