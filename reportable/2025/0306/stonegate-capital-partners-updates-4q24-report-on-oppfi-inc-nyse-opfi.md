Liquidity and Balance Sheet: OPFI ended 4Q24 with $88.3M in cash and restricted cash, an increase of $14.3M from 4Q23. The Company had an additional $206.2M in unused debt capacity, bringing total funding capacity to $613.3M. This robust liquidity position allows OPFI to remain flexible when making capital allocation decisions to support growth initiatives. Key capital allocation decisions made subsequent to quarter end include the repayment of the remaining $30.0M in corporate term loan debt outstanding. Lastly, during 2024, OppFi repurchased $3.6M worth of Class A common stock at an average price of $3.41 per share.

Originations: Total net originations for the quarter were $214.0M, reflecting an 11% y/y increase, driven by the expansion of bank partnerships into additional states and enhanced lead evaluation capabilities. Notably, the auto-approval rate rose to 79%, compared to 73% in the same quarter last year, further demonstrating the effectiveness of OPFI’s algorithmic automation in the underwriting process. Lastly, we note that ending receivables reached $425.0M, a 2% increase from the previous year.

Lending Standards: Charge-offs as a percentage of total revenue declined to 42% in 4Q24, an improvement from 46% in the prior year. This reduction was attributed to a healthier portfolio composition and improved credit modeling as the Company is now using Model 6 to increase auto approvals and identify strong credit quality borrows. We expect the Company to continue focusing on higher-quality borrows going through FY25.

Guidance: In 4Q24, OppFi has provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $563.0M to $594.0M, representing a 7%-13% y/y increase. Adjusted net income is projected to range between $95.0M and $97.0M, reflecting a 15%- 17% annual growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.06 and $1.07, an increase of 11%-13% from 2024. We note that the Company remains well-positioned to meet these targets, supported by disciplined cost management and continued demand for its products. We believe OppFi is positioned to meet its guidance and have adjusted our model accordingly.

Valuation: We use a P/E comp analysis to guide our valuation. Our valuation relies on a P/E multiple range of 8.5x to 9.5x with a midpoint of 9.0x This arrives at a valuation range of $9.95 to $11.12 with a mid-point of $10.54.
