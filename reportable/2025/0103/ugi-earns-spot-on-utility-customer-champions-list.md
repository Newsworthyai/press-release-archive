# UGI Earns Spot on Utility Customer Champions List

UGI Utilities, Inc. has been recognized by Escalent, a top data analytics and advisory firm with extensive energy, utility and brand experience, as a 2024 Customer Champion for continuing to build engaged customer relationships. The distinction is part of Escalent’s Cogent Syndicated Utility Trusted Brand & Customer Engagement™: Residential study, which tracks the performance of 142 utilities and is published twice a year.

According to the report, Customer Champions outperform the industry average in several attributes, including:

* Building goodwill within their local communities
* Effectively communicating with customers about system improvements
* Offering effective programs including energy savings

“These aren’t utilities that have suddenly started outscoring their peers in 2024,” says Suzanne Haggerty, director of syndicated research with the Energy industry practice at Escalent. “Most Customer Champions have higher scores now than they did prepandemic, meaning they held on to at least some of that 2020 scoring bump.”

To measure customer engagement, Escalent conducted surveys among 59,377 residential electric, natural gas and combination utility customers of the largest U.S. utility companies.

“UGI’s mission of delivering safe, reliable, and affordable energy services is built on providing high level customer service,” says Dan Adamo, UGI’s Vice President of Customer Relations. “We are proud to be among the Customer Champions and continue to invest in our employees and technology to make our customer service even better.”

UGI Utilities is a natural gas and electric utility that serves more than 740,000 customers in certificated portions of 46 counties in Pennsylvania and one county in Maryland.
