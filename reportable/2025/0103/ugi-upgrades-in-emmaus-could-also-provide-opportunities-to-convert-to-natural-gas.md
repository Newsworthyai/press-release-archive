# UGI Upgrades in Emmaus Could Also Provide Opportunities to Convert to Natural Gas

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a gas main replacement project in Emmaus on January 6. The work is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service and can be an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed in mid-March and impact the following streets:

* South 6th Street between Minor Street and Chestnut Street
* West Jubilee Street between South 6th Street and Perkiomen Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 740,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
