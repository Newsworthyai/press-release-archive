# LisenID Announces Collaboration with Mayo Clinic to Advance Early Cancer Diagnostics

Wilmington, DE – April 1, 2025 – Lisen Imprinting Diagnostic, Inc. (LisenID) has entered a know-how agreement with Mayo Clinic to research and develop innovative early cancer diagnostic solutions. This collaboration combines LisenID’s epigenetic imprinting technology with Mayo Clinic’s clinical expertise to address gaps in early cancer detection.

LisenID specializes in Quantitative Chromogenic Imprinted Gene In-Situ Hybridization (QCIGISH), a technology that can detect cancer at its inception by identifying epigenetic imprinting biomarker abnormalities. Unlike traditional genetic mutation-based diagnostics, QCIGISH enables highly sensitive and specific cancer detection at an earlier stage, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing unnecessary treatments.

Transforming Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis

The initial focus of the collaboration is the research and development of a QCIGISH-based laboratory-developed test (LDT) for early lung cancer detection using transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples. This test aims to provide a more accurate, objective, and clinically actionable tool for diagnosing malignancies in peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs), which remain challenging with current cytology-based methods.

“We are excited to collaborate with Mayo Clinic, a global leader in clinical research and patient care,” said Dr. Tina Cheng, the co-founder and tech inventor of LisenID. “LisenID has demonstrated over 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity1,2,3,4 detecting various early-stage cancers, including lung, thyroid, cervical, and many more. This collaboration seeks to accelerate the clinical validation and eventual commercialization of our technology, ultimately improving early cancer diagnosis and patient care worldwide.”

Path to Market and Future Expansion

Following clinical validation, LisenID plans to introduce the new diagnostic test as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT), paving the way for further regulatory approval and broader market adoption.

Mayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this press release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education, and research.
