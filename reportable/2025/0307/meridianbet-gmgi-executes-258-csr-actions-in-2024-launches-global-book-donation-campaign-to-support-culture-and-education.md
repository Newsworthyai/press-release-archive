As a participant of the UN Global Compact, Meridianbet continues to drive social impact through well-structured and meaningful campaigns that resonate globally.

A Fresh Start in 2025: Supporting Culture and Knowledge Through Book DonationsIn February 2025, the Meridianbet Foundation launched a global book donation campaign aimed at revitalizing small libraries and encouraging reading habits in communities that lack sufficient funding for cultural institutions.

Inspired by a social media post from Serbia, the initiative saw Meridianbet employees collect and donate books to small libraries and cultural centers. This campaign builds on the success of previous CSR actions, reinforcing the company’s commitment to culture and education.

The campaign has already made a tangible impact by distributing thousands of books across all 18 markets where Meridianbet operates, which include Europe, Africa, and South America. By enhancing access to books and learning resources, Meridianbet is helping to preserve cultural institutions and inspire communities to embrace reading as a lifelong habit.

Empowering Communities Through Strategic CSR InitiativesMeridianbet’s CSR efforts in 2024 covered a broad range of impactful initiatives:

* Healthcare: Donations to health centers around the world and campaigns to raise breast cancer awareness, directly supporting communities in need of better healthcare access.
* Education: For the fifth consecutive year, the Meridianbet Foundation awarded global scholarships to students, ensuring that financial barriers do not stand in the way of quality education.
* Responsible Gambling: Continued efforts to promote safe betting practices and educate customers on responsible gambling.
* Environmental Sustainability: Projects focusing on sustainability practices and resource conservation, reflecting the company’s commitment to responsible growth.

Turning Sports Achievements into Community SupportMeridianbet also linked its CSR initiatives to major sporting events in 2024, transforming moments of sports success into opportunities for social impact:

* During EURO 2024, donations were made for every goal scored, helping to convert sports excitement into meaningful support for local communities.
* Similarly, contributions were pledged for every national medal won at the 2024 Olympics, underlining the company’s commitment to supporting both sports and social development.
* On March 8, campaigns against violence towards women were launched, reinforcing the company’s dedication to promoting social justice and safety.

Simplifying Donations for Greater ImpactTo make charitable giving more accessible, Meridianbet introduced two new tools:

* The Meridian Donate Button, designed to streamline donations and allow supporters to contribute to charitable causes quickly and easily.
* Scan & Help, a QR code-based solution that facilitates immediate donations for urgent causes, ensuring that support reaches communities in need without delay.

These innovations highlight Meridianbet’s focus on removing barriers to charitable giving and maximizing the impact of every contribution.

Employee Engagement and Strategic AlignmentEmployee participation played a significant role in the success of these CSR initiatives, with a large number of employees actively contributing their time and resources. This internal support reflects a strong culture of responsibility and a collective commitment to making a difference.

Meridianbet’s CSR actions are also aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on quality education, reduced inequalities, and responsible consumption. By integrating these goals into its strategy, Meridianbet ensures that its social contributions are both impactful and sustainable.

Looking ahead, the company plans to expand its educational programs, environmental projects, and healthcare support throughout 2025, maintaining its focus on making a positive impact in every market it serves.
