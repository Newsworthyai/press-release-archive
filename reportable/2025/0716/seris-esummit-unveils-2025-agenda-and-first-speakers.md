﻿For Immediate Release: Washington DC, USA – July 16, 2025

SERI is pleased to announce the release of the agenda and first speakers for eSummit 2025, taking place September 8-11 at the Renaissance Minneapolis Hotel, The Depot. This year's program features dozens of sessions and opportunities to learn and connect with executives and innovators from leading technology companies, recyclers, policymakers, and sustainability advocates to accelerate the transition to a circular economy for electronics.

Confirmed speakers already include Spencer Hahn from Amazon, Brian Comiskey from the Consumer Technology Association, Lionel Uzzan of Erase4Good, Jordan Sielaff from Gierd, Scott Shackelford from Google, Linda Demmler from IBM, Chris Cleet from the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), John Leiser from Lenovo, Shawn Stockman of OnePak, Andrea Murphy from Panasonic, Paul Baum from PlanITROI, Dr. Nabil Nasr from the REMADE Institute, Tony Sciarrotta from the Reverse Logistics Association, Andreas Nobell representing TCO Development, and Jim Kofalt of Verae.

"The 2025 agenda brings together voices that rarely end up in the same place, let alone have the opportunity for meaningful collaboration," said Corey Dehmey, CEO of SERI. "From product designers to recyclers, repair technicians to policymakers, these unexpected connections are where real innovation happens."

Monday's Pre-Summit Activities include optional facility tours provided by Dynamic Lifecycle Innovations and Integrated Recycling Technologies, industry member meetings, a Repair Meetup, and an evening welcome reception. These early activities offer invaluable behind-the-scenes insights and relationship-building opportunities before the main program begins.

Tuesday's Expo+ Day tackles today's operational challenges with sessions including "Preventing Battery Fires in the Recycling Chain," "Innovations in Data Sanitization," and "Unlocking Devices – Tackling Device Locks to Enable Reuse." This solutions-focused day helps attendees discover new technologies, find business partners, and solve immediate challenges while building revenue streams. The day culminates with the Industry Awards and popular Repair-Off competition.

Wednesday's Fast Forward Day shifts focus to strategic vision and industry transformation. Starting with the inaugural SERI ReThink Awards, the day features Brian Comiskey from the Consumer Technology Association presenting "A View From the Future: What's on the Tech Horizon," executives from IBM, Dell, and Amazon exploring "Decoding The Continuously Evolving Electronics Value Chain," and Steven Nickel from Google on "Building a Robust Repair Ecosystem." Leaders from Intel, Panasonic, and Jabil will share insights on unlocking circularity through product design. Breakout sessions explore emerging opportunities like carbon insets as revenue streams.

Thursday's Forward Together Day introduces a unique workshop format born from last year's spontaneous cross-sector conversations. Instead of traditional presentations, attendees join facilitated working groups to tackle lifecycle-specific challenges—from urban mining to design for repairability. This half-day session transforms dialogue into actionable strategies through the power of multistakeholder collaboration.

"What excites me most about this year's agenda is how it bridges immediate operational needs with long-term strategic vision," added Dehmey. "Whether you're dealing with today's battery safety challenges or planning for tomorrow's circular economy, the eSummit’s distinct style of cross-sector conversations creates solutions no single company could develop alone."

Registration is now open for the event with All-Access Passes for the complete four-day experience and Expo+ One-Day Passes for professionals focused on maximizing Tuesday's solution-oriented programming.
