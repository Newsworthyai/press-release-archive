# From Grizzly Stand-Off to House Fire Rescue: Canada’s Newest Animal Heroes Inducted

TORONTO, Sept. 23, 2025 – Two remarkable dogs have been formally inducted into the 2025 Purina Animal Hall of Fame, recognized for their extraordinary bravery and instinct in protecting their human families. From facing down a charging grizzly bear to alerting a couple to a devastating house fire, these pets demonstrated life-saving courage and loyalty, reminding Canadians that the bond between people and animals is both powerful and profound.

“Each year, the Purina Animal Hall of Fame opens our hearts to the extraordinary stories of pets who have gone above and beyond for the people they love,” says Maleeha Sheikh, Corporate Communications Manager, Nestlé Purina PetCare Canada. “This year’s heroes remind us that courage often comes on four paws, in quiet moments of loyalty, and in life-saving acts of love. Their devotion moves us, and their bravery inspires us to cherish the bond we share with our pets even more deeply.”

Since its inception in 1968, Purina’s Animal Hall of Fame has recognized 196 animals - including 168 dogs, 27 cats, and one horse - for life-saving acts of heroism across the country.

2025 Inductees

Night (Cochrane, AB): On a spring morning hike near Cochrane, Alberta, 70-year-old Craig Campbell suddenly found himself in a life-or-death standoff with a grizzly bear. What began as a peaceful outing with his Doberman, Night, turned into a moment of sheer terror when the bear charged from the bush at full speed.

“I’m going to die,” Craig recalls thinking as he dropped his walking stick and reached instinctively for his bear spray - knowing he would never get to it in time. That’s when Night, his loyal 10-year-old companion, leapt into action.

Night positioned himself directly between Craig and the bear, crouched low and growling with such intensity that the bear reared up on its hind legs in a frightening display. For several tense seconds, man, dog and bear faced off in the wilderness. The standoff gave Craig just enough time to prepare himself, but ultimately, it was Night’s fearless presence that turned the tide, the grizzly backed away into the forest, sparing Craig’s life.

Night has been by Craig’s side for more than a decade. While he has earned training titles in advanced obedience and protection work, Craig says those achievements pale in comparison to what matters most: Night’s loyalty. “We’re virtually inseparable,” Craig explains. “What makes him special isn’t the awards - it’s that he’s my best buddy.”

Thanks to Night’s courage and devotion, a deadly encounter ended in safety. His actions have earned him formal induction into the Purina Animal Hall of Fame, where he is recognized as one of Canada’s true animal heroes.

Toph (St. Charles, ON): In the early hours of July 16, 2025, 38-year-old Judy Spry was jolted awake in her basement suite in St. Charles, Ontario, by her blind Great Pyrenees, Toph. At just three years old, Toph’s heightened senses had detected smoke, and his relentless barking alerted Judy and her husband, Chris, to the fire spreading upstairs.

Chris rushed to warn Judy’s elderly parents, only to be forced back by overwhelming heat and smoke. With no time to spare, Judy and Chris devised a desperate escape through a basement window, first rescuing their husky-mix, Aya. Pulling Toph - who weighs nearly 100 pounds - to safety required quick thinking, a garden hose fashioned into a harness, and help from a neighbour who was also a volunteer firefighter.

Tragically, Judy’s parents and their pets did not survive the fire. Despite the heartbreaking loss, Judy credits Toph with saving her and Chris’s lives: “He’s my hero dog. If it wasn’t for him, we would have probably died from smoke too.”

Today, Judy and Chris are rebuilding their lives, deeply grateful to the blind dog whose instincts and bravery spared them from the flames.

Together, Night and Toph join a distinguished legacy of pets recognized through the Purina Animal Hall of Fame. Their remarkable stories remind us that humans and animals are truly better together, connected by bonds of trust and bravery. As Canadians reflect on this year’s inductees, these heroic dogs stand as powerful examples of the life-saving bond between people and their pets.
