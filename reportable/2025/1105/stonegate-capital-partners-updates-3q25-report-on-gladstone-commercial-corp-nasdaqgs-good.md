Strengthened Liquidity and Capital Resources: Gladstone reported total liquidity of approximately $24.6M in 3Q25, consisting of $18.4M in cash and cash equivalents and $6.2M in borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. This liquidity position represents a decrease from last year, primarily due to a draw on the revolver. As of this report the Company has upsized its credit facility, providing for sufficient liquidity. These measures reflect the company’s approach to maintaining flexibility while optimizing its debt.

Fundamentals Remain Strong: GOOD continues to demonstrate strong operational fundamentals, maintaining a high occupancy rate of 99.1% as of 3Q25, up from both 2Q25 and 4Q24. The Company also reported 100% cash rent collection in the quarter, showcasing its stable tenant base and strong leasing activity. Renewal and Leasing activity remained stable in 3Q25 despite broader economic uncertainty, with 14 properties seeing leasing activity. The portfolio’s weighted average lease term was 7.5 years, reflecting the Company’s ability to secure long-term leases with creditworthy tenants.
