# UGI System Upgrades Project Set to Begin Next Week in Carlisle

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: November 5, 2025

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin system upgrades in Carlisle on Monday, November 10th. The gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The upgrades will occur in sections and will likely extend into the Spring. Construction will stop during the weeks of December 22 and 29 and resume on January 5.

The following roads will be impacted:

* C Street between Cherry Street and North College Street
* Franklin Street between H Street and C Street
* D Street between Redwood Drive and Oak Street
* E Street between Franklin Street and North College Street
* F Street between Redwood Drive and Ash Avenue
* G Street between Franklin Street and Ash Avenue

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 3:30pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may have an impact on the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
