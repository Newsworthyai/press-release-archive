# UGI System Upgrades Now Underway in Coudersport

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: October 7, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. began a natural gas main replacement project in Coudersport this week. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* Gardeau Road between Mitcheltree Hollow Lane and Snowflake Drive
* Lacney Hollow Lane

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by early November. Temporary restoration of the area will occur immediately after the underground work is completed. Final paving will happen at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
