# Supply Costs to Increase on UGI Natural Gas Bills Beginning March 1

UGI Utilities, Inc. announced its purchased gas cost rates will increase on March 1, 2025. As a result, the average residential heating customer receiving gas supply from UGI will see a bill increase of 7.1%, increasing the average monthly bill from $104.37 per month to $111.73 per month.

Colder temperatures have led to increased demand for natural gas and increased supply costs. By law, utilities are required to pass the cost of the natural gas they purchase directly through to customers without any markup.

UGI recognizes some customers may have difficulty paying their heating bill. The Company offers budget billing, as well as multiple payment options such as via UGI’s online account center and app, as well as an auto-pay program to assist customers in managing bill payments. Pennsylvania customers can also choose their energy supplier and shop around for competitive rates at www.PAGasSwitch.com.

In addition, customers with a limited or fixed income should visit www.ugi.com/customerassistance or call UGI at 1-800-UGI-WARM to determine if they are eligible for one of several energy assistance programs. Further, UGI can assist eligible customers in applying for federally funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grants.

UGI encourages customers to use energy wisely and make efficiency improvements in their homes. Additional information on energy efficiency programs is available on UGI’s website at www.ugi.com/energy-saving-tips .

UGI Utilities, Inc. is based in Denver, Pennsylvania and serves more than 760,000 natural gas and electric customers in 46 counties in Pennsylvania. Additional information about UGI is available at www.ugi.com on Facebook at www.facebook.com/ugiutilities; and X at www.twitter.com/ugi_utilities.
