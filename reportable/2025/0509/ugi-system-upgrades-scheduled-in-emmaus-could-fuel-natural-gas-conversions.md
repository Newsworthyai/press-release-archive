# UGI System Upgrades Scheduled in Emmaus Could Fuel Natural Gas Conversions

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 9, 2025

UGI Utilities is set to begin system upgrades in Emmaus on Monday, May 12. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by mid-October and impact travel on the following roads:

* Main Street between South Fourth Street and Klines Lane
* Chestnut Street between South Fourth Street and Main Street
* North Cherry Street between Main Street and Railroad Street
* Keystone Avenue between Ridge Street and Main Street
* 1st Street between Main Street and End of 1st Street

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking will be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact completion dates. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
