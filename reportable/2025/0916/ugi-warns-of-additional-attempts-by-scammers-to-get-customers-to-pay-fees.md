# UGI Warns of Additional Attempts by Scammers to Get Customers to Pay Fees

UGI Utilities, Inc. is now aware of another customer targeted by scammers attempting to trick them into paying for work that is free of charge.

A UGI customer scheduled to have a natural gas service line installed at their home, called a phone number they say they found online. This was not UGI’s phone number and was not part of any legitimate UGI online resources. After many probing questions, the scammer tried to convince our customer that they owed $1,350 for the installation and sent an email requesting payment. The customer did not pay but instead called the correct UGI number and reported what happened.

This warning comes less than a week after UGI alerted the public about scammers creating sponsored online ads that turned up when some customers did online searches for UGI’s phone number. These ads did not mention UGI, and in no way are connected to UGI, but contained fraudulent phone numbers that customers believed would connect them to UGI. The Federal Trade Commission continues to warn about scammers creating sponsored ads that come up in online searches, or on social media, that contain fraudulent phone numbers.

“UGI wants everyone to know, if you have a question on your account, want to pay a bill, or need to report a possible gas leak, or for any other reason, there is only one number you should call to reach UGI and it is 800-276-2722, “says Dan Adamo, UGI Vice President of Customer Relations. “UGI makes sure that phone number is visible and well publicized in outreach to our customers, on our customer portal, and official website but scammers are finding ways to deceive customers.”

UGI also urges customers to be vigilant against scammers posing as utility workers and going door-to-door. Always ask for identification. UGI workers are required to carry photo ID. UGI meter readers, inspectors and service representatives routinely wear blue or orange uniforms with a UGI logo and drive marked and numbered vehicles. If you are suspicious about a person’s ID or activities, do not allow that person into your home and call us at 800-276-2722 to verify the visit.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
