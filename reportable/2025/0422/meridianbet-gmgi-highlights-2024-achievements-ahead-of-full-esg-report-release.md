“ESG isn’t a slogan for us — it’s how we operate at scale,” said Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet. “We’ve proven that it’s possible to grow in tightly regulated markets, lead on tech, and still deliver real outcomes to real people — from hospitals to youth sports. That’s the core of Meridianbet for 25 years.”

The 2024 period was also marked by Meridianbet’s public uplisting, becoming part of Golden Matrix Group’s NASDAQ-listed structure — reinforcing transparency, regulatory alignment, and investor access across all operations.

The full 2024 ESG Report will be released later this quarter.
