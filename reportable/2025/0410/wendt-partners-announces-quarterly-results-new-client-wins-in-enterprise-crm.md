# Wendt Partners Announces Quarterly Results, New Client Wins in Enterprise CRM

New York, NY (April 10, 2025) - Wendt Partners, an award-winning HubSpot Elite Solutions Partner headquartered in New York City, announced key accomplishments the firm has achieved during Q1 of 2025.

The firm secured contracts with 35 clients in the first quarter, beating its previous average deal win figures by nearly 20% year-over-year. Enterprise implementations increased as a percentage of closed-won business, as did work with existing HubSpot customers and current Wendt Partners clients. Average deal values for enterprise engagements also increased over the quarter, showcasing the firm’s ability to compete and win at the very high end of the market.

Key client relationships secured or expanded during Q1 include engagements with Actylis, Berk International, Dynex Technologies, Encompass Supply Chain Solutions, ETM Inc., Garland Technology, GranQuartz, Hardy Diagnostics, Jeffrey Allen Inc., Omniduct, Rodin Distributors, ShipNetwork, Softensity, Triarq Health, TriNova, Whole Freight and others. Approximately half of the firm’s won business is in the manufacturing, distribution and logistics market segment and half is in regulated sectors such as healthcare, financial services, education and related markets where SOC 2 and IT security compliance is essential.

Wendt Partners also achieved major milestones in the firm’s AI practice growth in Q1, including:

* Opening a new Enterprise CRM Innovation Center (ECIC) focused on AI best practices
* Appointing Terry Sullivan as the firm’s new AI Consulting Practice Lead
* Launching the firm’s new HubSpot Portal Breeze Roadmap (HubSpot PBR) service
* Partnering with CustomerIQ and AskElephant as top-tier AI product partners
* Expanding our partnership with BD Emerson for AI security and governance
* Achieving record market interest in AI content and programming around HubSpot CRM

The firm also launched its new Global Growth Practice which, considering current economic and political realities, has rapidly become an area of keen market interest. This practice complements the firm’s expansion with new regional offices opening in Toronto, London and Melbourne to complement the company’s New York-based headquarters.

“HubSpot is the fastest-growing provider of enterprise CRM solutions worldwide,” says Doug Wendt, Co-Founder and Senior Partner with Wendt Partners. “Our goal is to leverage AI and global presence to maximize our footprint as a recognized leader in HubSpot CRM and AI solutions consulting and services worldwide, and the accomplishments we’ve achieved in Q1 of 2025 demonstrate our ability to execute against that vision.”
