# PR Club of New England Expands for 2025-2026 Season

Boston, MA: October, 1, 2025 – The PR Club of New England, the region’s leading communications trade organization, today announced its new and expanded board of directors and strategic vision for the 2025-2026 term. Led by returning president Kaitlynn Cooney, the PR Club is committed to honoring its 77-year historic legacy, while setting the organization up for long-term success through educational programming, professional networking events, and membership growth.

Founded in 1948, the PR Club has long served as the premier community for public relations practitioners in New England, but like many other industry organizations, the PR Club faced a decline in membership and participation following the pandemic. Through the tireless dedication of its volunteer board and an aggressive commitment to rebuilding, the PR Club has now emerged with a strong foundation, renewed leadership, and a clear focus on driving growth and expanding its impact across the region while still honoring its prestigious history.

“For more than 75 years, the PR Club has been a cornerstone of New England’s communications community, evolving alongside an industry in constant flux,” said Kaitlynn Cooney, President of the PR Club and PR Director at Walker Sands. “As newsrooms contract and new technologies reshape how we tell and listen to stories, the Club’s revitalization mirrors the need for communications professionals to come together, share expertise, and navigate change with confidence. The PR Club is here to help our members learn, grow, and build meaningful connections for the future.”

The PR Club is introducing the board of directors for the season, featuring new members and additional support for key functions including content, programming, social media, and membership.
