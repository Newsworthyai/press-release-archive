# UGI System Upgrades Set to Begin Next Week in East Stroudsburg

UGI Utilities, Inc. is scheduled to begin a natural gas main replacement project in East Stroudsburg on Wednesday, October 1. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

Underground work will happen on the following streets:

* Analomink Street between North Courtland Street and Ransberry Avenue
* Crystal Street between Bank Aly and Analomink Street
* Penn Street between South Kistler Street and Fairview Street
* Fairview Street
* Prospect Street between Analomink Street and Normal Street
* Ransberry Avenue between Analomink Street and Normal Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by mid-February. The completion date may change due to weather and working conditions. Final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
