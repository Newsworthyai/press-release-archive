# Inc. Names Jane Mosbacher Morris to 2025 Female Founders 500 List

[Lexington, KY], March 11, 2025 – Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced its eighth annual Female Founders list, honoring a bold group of 500 women whose innovations and ideas are leading their industries forward. These resilient entrepreneurs expressed grit and drive to collectively attract approximately $9 billion in 2024 revenue and $10.6 billion in funding.

Each year, Inc. editors review thousands of applications highlighting female founders who are challenging the status quo and tackling some of the world’s biggest problems, and cull applicants through three rounds of judging, looking specifically at an entrepreneur’s bona fides in the past year. Criteria include quantifiable metrics such as revenue, sales, revenue growth, funding, and audience size.

“At TO THE MARKET, we believe the future of supply chains must be both responsible and resilient. Responsible sourcing is not just the right thing to do—it’s the smartest way to reduce risk and build long-term value,” said Jane Mosbacher Morris, founder and CEO of TO THE MARKET. “I am grateful to Inc. for this recognition and to our team and TRACERA for empowering businesses with the visibility and insights to navigate an evolving global landscape.”

The founders cross all industries and bring with them unique stories of success from each stage of the entrepreneurial journey — from startup to going public, being acquired by big buyers, or spending decades at the helm of an organization. To see the complete list of honorees, please visit: https://www.inc.com/female-founders
