Valletta, Malta, 11 March 2025 - Expanse Studios, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), continues its strategic expansion by applying for a Class 2 iGaming license in Romania. This license, issued by Romania’s National Gambling Office (ONJN), will allow Expanse Studios to distribute its proprietary gaming content to licensed operators across the regulated Romanian market.

According to Statista, the Romanian online gambling sector has emerged as one of Europe’s key gaming markets, with revenue expected to hit $2.2 billion in 2025 and reach $2.56 billion by 2029. The casino and casino games segment alone is projected to generate $1.39 billion this year, demonstrating strong demand for premium gaming content.

"Securing a Romanian license will be a crucial step in our European expansion strategy," said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios. "With a thriving iGaming sector and a strong regulatory framework, Romania represents a key growth opportunity. This move aligns with our broader vision of delivering high-quality content to new, regulated, and lucrative markets."
