# UGI  Scheduled to Begin Additional System Upgrades Next Week in Hazleton

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: July 29, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a natural gas main replacement project on Monday, August 4, in Hazleton. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-August and impact travel on Kiefer Avenue between Hazle Street and East Street.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
