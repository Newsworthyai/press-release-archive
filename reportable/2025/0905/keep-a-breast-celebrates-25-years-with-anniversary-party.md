# Keep A Breast Celebrates 25 Years with Anniversary Party

YUCCA VALLEY, CA — The Keep A Breast Foundation (KAB) is thrilled to announce its 25th Anniversary Party, a one-night-only celebration in the high desert at the legendary Pappy & Harriet’s on Friday, September 5, 2025. This milestone event honors 25 years of impact, creativity, and community dedicated to breast cancer prevention and education.

The benefit will feature a special live performance by Grammy Award-winning esteemed Atlanta hip-hop group Arrested Development and a DJ set by revolutionary artist and long-time KAB supporter Shepard Fairey.

“Dear people very close to us have fought this battle, so this benefit concert for Keep A Breast hits home in a different way,” Speech Thomas of Arrested Development said. “It's about healing at a whole different level.”

“I’ve worked with Shaney Jo and Keep A Breast for as long as they’ve been around,” Shepard Fairey said. “From the beginning, they’ve been able to speak to young people in their language and by doing so, they have raised critical awareness about breast cancer detection and prevention. Breast cancer is tragically prevalent and has impacted me and my family directly, so I’ve always been proud to participate in helping spread the word about their mission.”

Since 2000, KAB has reached millions of young people worldwide with an innovative, art-driven approach to breast cancer early detection and prevention. The 25th Anniversary Party not only celebrates the organization’s legacy but also looks ahead to the future with a spotlight on The Keep A Breast Valley (KAB Valley), the foundation’s upcoming wellness retreat center. Designed as a healing space for breast cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers, KAB Valley will offer support through nature, art, and community. Proceeds from the event will directly support this transformative project.

“This night is about celebrating everyone who’s helped shape Keep A Breast into what it is today,” KAB Founder Shaney Jo Darden said. “For 25 years, we’ve built a movement rooted in art, action, and prevention—and I can’t wait to party with the people who made it all possible. As we look ahead to the future with projects like KAB Valley, this is our moment to honor the past and dream even bigger together.”
