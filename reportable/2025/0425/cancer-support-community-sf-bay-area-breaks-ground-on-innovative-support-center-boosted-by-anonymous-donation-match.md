# Cancer Support Community SF Bay Area Breaks Ground on Innovative Support Center, Boosted by Anonymous Donation Match

Walnut Creek, CA, April 25, 2025 -- Cancer Support Community San Francisco Bay Area (CSC), a Bay Area-based nonprofit devoted to supporting individuals, families and communities affected by cancer through no-cost comprehensive supportive care programs, this week broke ground on its new state-of-the-art cancer support center in Lafayette, CA. More than 200 community members gathered to celebrate this remarkable milestone and vision as well as to show support for the advancement of CSC's services in the Bay Area.

The groundbreaking marks the kickoff of the final phase of the organization's Capital Campaign, "Rooted in Resilience." With $2.6 million left to go, the campaign will have raised $30 million to complete the facility, which includes a $5 million anonymous donation match. This generous gesture has injected a surge of optimism and hope for the team at CSC SF Bay Area.

Lucinda Bazile, MPH, Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Support Community San Francisco Bay Area, shared her thoughts on the occasion. "This groundbreaking signifies not just the start of a new building, but the beginning of a new era of compassion, innovation, and resilience in cancer support services," said Bazile. "As we enter the homestretch, we are heartened by the overwhelming community support in helping us grow and are eager to make this vision a reality."

The groundbreaking event was graced by the presence of several key figures of the Bay Area, including the Mayor of Lafayette, Susan Candell, Holly Sonne from the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, State Senator Tim Grayson, and Congressman Mark DeSaulnier in addition to CSC National CEO, Sally Werner. Each expressed their admiration for CSC's mission and the impact it has on the community.

Lafayette Mayor Susan Candell remarked, "The journey of Cancer Support Community with the full support of Lafayette behind it is a testament to the resilience and determination of this community. This new facility will provide much-needed support to those affected by cancer in our city and beyond and will enrich our community in countless ways."

Congressman Mark DeSaulnier added, "This is a wonderful celebration of hard work and community. The support that the Cancer Support Community provides today and will provide with this new center represents an innovative approach to cancer support in the Bay Area. It will serve as a beacon of hope and comfort for those facing cancer and their families."

State Senator Tim Grayson praised the CSC Bay Area, “The work this organization has done to address the psychosocial needs of those affected by cancer in this area is unparalleled. I can’t think of a better way to celebrate this noble cause than to name the Cancer Support Community as our district’s Nonprofit of the Year.”

CSC SF Bay Area has remained steadfast in its mission since its inception in 1990. The organization offers comprehensive, evidenced based supportive care programs, including counseling, support groups, nutrition, exercise, emergency financial assistance, patient education, and special programs for children and teens.

The new support center will be built on six acres of donated land adjacent to the Lafayette Reservoir and will transform access to emotional, social, and financial support programs increasing CSC SF Bay Area’s reach and impact. The new campus will include children and teen enrichment areas, support rooms with flexible space, a demonstration kitchen, counseling rooms, art studios, a library and café, as well as naturally healing gardens and outdoor areas. State of the Art Technology will enable CSC to deliver in-person, virtual, hybrid, and on demand culturally responsive programs broadcasted from inside the center and outside in the healing gardens. More people in the Bay Area, across more communities, will be able to access more programs, entirely free of charge. The organization invites everyone to join the mission by contributing towards completing the facility. Donations will help ensure that individuals and families impacted by cancer have access to the resources they need.

With the community's continued financial support, CSC will be able to double the impact of every dollar through its anonymous match and complete the construction of this innovative, state-of-the-art facility. In doing so, they will be able to expand their reach and bring their compassionate services to even more individuals and families affected by cancer.

The groundbreaking of the new cancer support center is a significant step forward in the mission of CSC SF Bay Area, and a testament to the resilience and strength of the community it serves. As the organization moves forward with this exciting new chapter, it continues to be rooted in resilience, fueled by innovation and driven by a deep commitment to providing compassionate support to those affected by cancer.
