# BioUtah to Attend the J.P. Morgan 43rd Annual Healthcare Conference

SALT LAKE CITY -– January 9, 2025 – BioUtah, the trade association, common voice, and flag bearer for Utah’s life sciences industry, today announced that it will participate in the J.P. Morgan 43rd Annual Healthcare Conference, January 12-16, 2025. BioUtah President and CEO, Kelvyn Cullimore, will attend on behalf of the association, representing the more than 2,000 life sciences companies across the state. Utah boasts strengths in medical device manufacturing, diagnostics, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and digital health.

“As one of the fastest growing innovation hubs in the nation, Utah continues to be a hotbed for life sciences startups, supported by a uniquely driven and collaborative ecosystem,” said Cullimore. “The J.P. Morgan conference provides us an extraordinary opportunity to spread the word about our culture of entrepreneurship, stellar research centers, educated workforce, business-friendly state, and the many Utah companies changing patients’ lives.”

Along with Utah business, university, and government partners, Cullimore will engage with industry leaders and investors to showcase Utah’s life sciences community. A study by the University of Utah Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute shows that Utah consistently ranks in the top three states for growth in the life sciences. In Utah, the sector accounts for $22.6 billion in GDP and approximately 180,000 jobs.

A number of Utah life sciences companies that are developing new treatments and cutting-edge medical technologies will be presenting at the conference.

BioUtah will be co-hosting a reception on Sunday night, January 12, 2025, at the Marker Hotel along with other state bioscience associations. This will be an excellent opportunity to network and make connections with other Utah stakeholders attending the conference.

BioUtah invites conference-goers to build on the momentum of the J.P Morgan event by attending the BioUtah Entrepreneur and Investor Life Sciences Summit. The Summit, presented in partnership with the University of Utah’s Technology Licensing Office, and sponsored by Wilson Sonsini, is Utah’s largest gathering of the state’s startup community, convening entrepreneurs, investors (local and national), distinguished speakers, academic research centers, incubators, service providers and more. A ski day and luncheon will follow on March 14 at the Snowbird Ski Resort.

Early bird discounts are available until February 14. Register HERE.

The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is considered the largest investment symposium in the industry.
