# UGI System Upgrades Scheduled to Start Next Week in Nazareth

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: August 5, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a natural gas main replacement project in Nazareth on Monday, August 11. The system upgrades are part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The underground work is expected to be completed by the end of October. The project will impact travel on the following streets:

* South Church Street between Mauch Chunk Street and Poplar Street
* Mauch Chunk Street between South Church Street and South Main Street
* Belvidere Street between South Main Street and South Broad Street
* Progress Avenue between Mauch Chunk Street and West Walnut Street
* South Green Street between Mauch Chunk Street and West Center Street
* South Spruce Street between Belvidere Street and East Walnut Street

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
