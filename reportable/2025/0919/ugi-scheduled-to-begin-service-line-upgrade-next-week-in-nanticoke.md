# UGI Scheduled to Begin Service Line Upgrade Next Week in Nanticoke

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: September 19, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to replace a service line on East Main Street in Nanticoke on Tuesday, September 23. The system upgrade is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.

Work at 71-73 East Main Street is expected to last two days and go from 7am until 5pm each day. During the service line replacement, seven customer meters will be moved from inside to an outside location. There will be an interruption to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

UGI is also working to minimize the impact on the recent beautification project site. This includes cutting smaller holes in pavement to access the current service line and to install the new line. Temporary restoration will occur after the completion of the underground work. Final restoration will occur later using a method that produces a seamless bond between the new and the exiting asphalt.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
