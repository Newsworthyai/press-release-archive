# UGI Scheduled to Begin System Upgrades in Lancaster City This Week

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Release Date: May 5, 2025

UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to begin a gas main replacement project on May 7, 2025, in Lancaster City, including the areas around Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital and Musser Park. The project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service. The work is also an opportunity for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The gas main replacement is expected to be completed by September and will impact travel on the following streets:

* North Duke St. between East Clay St. and East Chestnut St.
* East Frederick St. between North Christian St. and North Duke St.
* East Chestnut St. between North Duke St. and North Shippen St.
* North Shippen St. between East Chestnut St. and East Marion St.
* East Marion St. between North Shippen St. and North Lime St.

Construction is scheduled for Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7am and 5pm. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience road closures, detours, and traffic delays during construction hours. Parking may be restricted on the impacted streets during these hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may impact the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur at a later date.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.

UGI Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas and electric utility company that serves more than 760,000 customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at www.ugi.com.
