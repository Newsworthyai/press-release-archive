# ALBERTA DISTILLERS LIMITED® ELEVATES CANADIAN WHISKY WITH NEW ALBERTA PREMIUM GOLDEN RYE 9 YEAR OLD

TORONTO – July 30, 2025 - From the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, Alberta Distillers Ltd. introduces Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old, a new whisky expression that captures the essence of golden hour in every sip. Crafted with 100 per cent Canadian rye grain and aged for nine years, this release continues the brand’s tradition of excellence, while showcasing the full character and complexity of a matured rye. Made using local Canadian ingredients combined with meticulous crafting, Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old launches across Canada this July.

At the core of Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old is a thoughtful aging process that draws on three distinct barrel styles - new white oak, ex-bourbon, and ex-Canadian whisky casks. This layered maturation process reveals richness, spice, and nuance, allowing the rye grain to shine while evolving into an exceptionally smooth finish. Distilled and crafted with locally grown rye, this premium whisky reveals what time, terroir, and triple-barrel aging can truly offer.

With a bold 45 per cent ABV, Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old delivers a dynamic profile where aromas of caramel, subtle leather, and a whisper of coconut lead into a palate rich with raisin and molasses. The finish is where this expression truly shines; sweet, yet laced with signature rye spice, it lingers with exceptional smoothness and layered warmth. This release is a tribute to the golden hues of the prairies, the precision of Canadian whisky-making, and the pursuit of a smoother, more refined rye experience. Proudly crafted from grain to glass in Canada, made with 100 per cent Canadian-grown rye, distilled and bottled on Canadian soil, Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old is a celebration of homegrown excellence in every sip.

“Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old, represents the essence of Canadian craftsmanship, elevating it with a complex, layered whisky experience,” says Deepti Gurkar, Senior Director – National Marketing Canada and Global Canadian Brands at Suntory Global Spirits. “This launch is a celebration of what makes Canadian rye whisky so exceptional - bold flavour, rich heritage, and our continued commitment to innovation. It's a whisky made for those who value authenticity and are looking to explore deeper dimensions of taste.”

Alberta Premium Golden Rye 9 Year Old will be available across Canada beginning in July, at a suggested retail price of $37.95 per 750ml bottle. A testament to the mastery of Canadian whisky-making and the enduring appeal of 100 per cent rye, the new release invites both seasoned enthusiasts and new explorers to savour a whisky that balances flavour with remarkable finesse.
