# UGI Beginning System Upgrades in Stroudsburg

UGI Utilities is scheduled to begin system upgrades in Stroudsburg on Monday, November 24, 2025. The natural gas main replacement project is part of UGI’s commitment to provide safe and reliable service.  The work also provides opportunities for some homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas.

The installation of the new natural gas main is expected to be completed by April and have an impact on the following streets:

* North 5th Street from Wiley Avenue to Oakwood Avenue
* Wiley Avenue
* Wallace Street from Wiley Avenue to Wizac Avenue
* Wizac Avenue between North 5th Street and King Street
* Oakwood Avenue
* Spruce Street between Stokes Mill Road and Oakwood Avenue

Construction is scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm. Work will pause from November 26 through November 28, December 24 through December 26, and December 31 through January 1. Drivers, residents, and business owners may experience lane and parking restrictions during construction hours. There will be some interruptions to natural gas service. This will require UGI to have access to properties to inspect and relight equipment.

Weather and working conditions may have an impact on the completion date. After underground work is complete, final paving and restoration will occur later.

UGI encourages anyone interested in converting to natural gas to contact the company at 800-276-2722 or gasconversion@ugi.com.
