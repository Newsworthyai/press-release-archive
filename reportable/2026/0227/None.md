# Commission Approves UGI Petition to Lower Maximum Level of Increase in Purchased Gas Cost for March 1 Rates

for immediate release - february 27, 2026

UGI Utilities, Inc. petitioned the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to lower the maximum allowed increase on its purchased gas cost (PGC) rate increase to 10%, to be effective for its March 1, 2026 quarterly adjustment. UGI updates its natural gas supply costs on a quarterly basis to reflect actual gas costs paid on behalf of customers for the purchase of gas supply, consistent with a process described in its tariff. Without approval of the request, UGI’s PGC would have increased by 25% at the time of its quarterly rate adjustment. The PUC granted the Company’s request, preventing an increase of 25%, and instead capping the increase at 10%.
