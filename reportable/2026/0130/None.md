SAN DIEGO, Ca- January 30th, 2026

EDGE Boost by EDGE Markets, the first banking solution designed to promote responsible gaming in the U.S., announced that it is now allowing Crypto-to-USD conversion into its deposit accounts for the purposes of legal US gaming and betting. At launch, EDGE Boost will only support ETH, BTC, and Stablecoins — the most transparent and well-regulated tokens, providing far more auditable fund flows vs. cash.

Key Takeaways:* EDGE Boost now enables compliant crypto-to-USD funding for legal U.S. gaming by supporting BTC, ETH, and stablecoins through regulated exchange partners, without directly holding crypto.
* The new funding option expands access to players’ own funds outside traditional banking hours, offering a safer alternative to high-fee credit card advances and supporting responsible gaming behavior.
* By providing a regulated crypto onramp, EDGE Boost reduces the appeal of offshore and illegal gaming markets while expanding its reach to new users and markets.
