DALLAS, TX -- January 9th, 2026 -- NeOnc Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTHI). Stonegate Capital Partners initiates their coverage on NeOnc Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTHI). NeOnc Technologies Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage life sciences company developing central nervous system therapeutics designed to overcome the blood–brain barrier. The Company has numerous assets in its pipeline, highlighted by NEO100 which is a patented, pure pharmaceutical compound produced via proprietary synthesis for pharmaceutical-grade purity and reproducibility. NeOnc’s intranasal administration strategy is designed to access the brain via olfactory and trigeminal pathways, offering a non-invasive route intended to improve adherence and enable more direct delivery. We view NTHI as a differentiated platform, supported by favorable tolerability with prolonged dosing and multiple near-term catalysts as the program advances toward a 2026 readout.
