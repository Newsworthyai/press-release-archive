Key Takeaways:* CoorsTek Bioceramics has further established its right to market and sell its pink ceramic hip components in the European Union after the French Supreme Court ruled in favor of CoorsTek in its trademark dispute with CeramTec GmbH.
* This case follows on the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to decline review in a similar legal action. By declining review, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended CeramTec’s efforts to claim trademark rights to the color pink for ceramic hip components in the United States.
* The French Supreme Court upheld the cancellation of the three CeramTec trademarks by the Paris court of appeal. The Court held that Ceramtec had filed for trademark of its pink components in bad faith and that at the time of the trademark filing, CeramTec knew the pink color was not simply a brand indicator.
