# Stonegate Updates Coverage on Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE:TCBX) Q4 2025

DALLAS, TX -- January 23rd, 2026

DALLAS, TX -- January 23, 2026 -- Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE:TCBX): Stonegate Capital Partners updates their coverage on Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. For 4Q25, Third Coast reported net income of $17.9M, compared to $18.1M in 3Q25 and $13.7M in 4Q24, equal to basic and diluted EPS of $1.21 and $1.02, respectively. The modest Q/Q decline was primarily driven by merger-related legal/professional expenses and higher salaries/benefits, partially offset by higher NII and an increase in non-margin loan fees. We anticipate the Company will continue prioritizing operational efficiency, though near-term expense levels may remain somewhat noisy through the early stages of Keystone’s integration.
