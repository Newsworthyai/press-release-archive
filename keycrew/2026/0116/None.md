# Realay Launches Mobile App for Real Estate Referral Management with Voice-Activated Technology

Michigan-based platform brings hands-free referral tracking to real estate professionals nationwide.

 Independent real estate brokers and agents now have a new tool for managing referrals on the go. Realay, a Michigan-based real estate referral platform, has launched a mobile application that combines voice-activated AI technology with comprehensive referral tracking.

 The app, now available on the App Store, changes how agents handle client referrals during their busiest moments. Instead of pulling over to type information or waiting until they’re back at their desk, agents can speak commands. The AI-powered system captures details, sends notifications, and automatically tracks everything.

 “We’ve taken everything that made our platform successful and made it accessible anywhere, anytime. Agents no longer need to be tied to their desktops to capture opportunities,” said John LeRoy, Founder and CEO of Realay. “The voice activation feature means agents can make referrals as naturally as having a conversation. There’s nothing like this in the market.”

 Solving the Independent Broker Challenge Realay first gained traction among independent brokers with its web-based platform that addresses a specific problem: how do small brokerages compete with national franchises for out-of-market referrals? While large brokerages like Coldwell Banker can call sister offices across the country, independent brokers traditionally had to hunt for agents through Facebook groups.

 The platform built a vetted network of independent brokers across all 50 states, tracking referrals through a bidirectional communication system that eliminated the “black hole” problem in which referrals disappeared without updates. The mobile app makes this accessible anywhere, with voice activation powered by OpenAI integration.

 Expanding Into Contractor Referrals The platform’s newest feature addresses another broker challenge: managing contractor networks. Real estate transactions consistently require service providers like painters, plumbers, electricians, and locksmiths.

 Realay now allows brokers to organize their preferred contractor networks within the platform. When an agent needs to refer a contractor, they can access the broker’s vetted list through the app via voice command. Contractors join through broker invitations and pay a subscription fee, creating a new revenue stream for brokerages.

 “Every real estate transaction involves contractor services at some point,” LeRoy added. “We’re streamlining those connections and helping agents provide even more value to their clients while creating new revenue opportunities for brokerages.”

 Built for Independent Brokers The platform doesn’t charge upfront fees or monthly subscriptions. Instead, it operates on a pay-at-closing model where Realay receives 5% of the referral commission while the originating agent receives their standard 25% referral fee.

 Julie Capron, broker-owner of The Collective Home Group in Buchanan, Michigan, explained how the platform changed her workflow. She had been managing high volumes of referrals through spreadsheets and struggling with the administrative burden.

 Realay reports that 81% of referrals on its platform are currently engaged, meaning the receiving agent is actively working with the client. This conversion rate significantly exceeds typical lead generation services, where conversion rates hover around 1-2%.

 Ann Filippis, Realay’s Operations Director, explained the company’s approach: “We don’t just match referrals algorithmically and hope for the best. Our team reaches out to receiving agents to confirm they’re available and ready to work with the client. If an agent is on vacation or dealing with a family emergency, we find someone else. That white-glove approach is what keeps our engagement rates high.”

 The Realay mobile app is available for download on the App Store, with Android support coming soon. Brokers and agents can register at Realay.com to join the platform’s growing network.
