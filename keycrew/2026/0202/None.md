# From Garage Storage to Growing Business: How One Designer is Reshaping Las Vegas Real Estate Through Strategic Staging

The real estate staging industry has gained a determined advocate in Las Vegas, where Fiorenza Bilak, an interior design graduate and founder of Stage The Space, LLC, is building a business around a straightforward reality: most buyers cannot visualize how to use empty rooms.

 Bilak’s entry into home staging was unplanned. Seven years ago, her husband was struggling to sell a property he was flipping with a contractor friend. The house had lingered on the market, and he asked Bilak for advice. Drawing on her background and her habit of acquiring extra furniture, she suggested bringing in a few pieces to make the home more inviting.

 “I always had a knack for furniture and collected pieces here and there, so I already had some extra items at home that I could use for the listing,” Bilak recalls. “The house was tiny. I brought them to the property and set them up. To our great surprise, we had three over-asking offers the same day.”

 That first experiment quickly led to the creation of Stage The Space, which now provides staging services to real estate agents, investors, flippers, and builders across the Las Vegas valley and beyond.

 Why Staging Works: The Visualization Gap Bilak’s staging philosophy centers on a key statistic from RESA (Real Estate Staging Association) she shares with every client: “Statistically, 83% of the entire world population lacks imagination,” she explains. “When 83% of your potential buyers are walking into a property, that’s an enourmous number to gamble with. That is 83% of possibilities going straight down the drain simply because the public doesn’t understand space, scale, nor design concepts generally speaking.”

 This inability to visualize spaces makes empty homes more challenging to sell. Rather than leaving buyers to guess how a room might function, professional staging gives them an immediate sense of how they could live in the space.

 “The mission is to provide answers to potential buyers rather than raise questions. We want buyers to walk into a property and envision themselves living there, imagining an upgraded and ideal lifestyle,” Bilak says. “In most cases, staging encourages buyers to overlook flaws, and even appraisers tend to value staged homes higher than unstaged properties.”

 Bilak points to industry data and her own experience to demonstrate that staging increases both the speed and price of home sales. By addressing the visualization gap, she argues that staging doesn’t just help sell a property; it can directly improve the seller’s financial outcome.

 “Our job is to simplify the seller’s life by shortening time on the market and maximizing profit through strategic positioning that makes the listing highly competitive.”

 Addressing Skepticism and Budget Concerns Despite the documented benefits, Bilak frequently encounters skepticism from real estate professionals or homeowners who see staging as a cost rather than an investment.

 “I can’t believe how many people skip staging, assuming it’s too pricey or unnecessary, when the data clearly shows it boosts results,” she notes.

 “The results of that first experiment were so striking that my husband and countless clients never listed a home without staging again.”

 Staging involves careful planning and coordination, and not every client is familiar with the timeline it requires. “Some expect a home to be staged immediately after a call, but it’s a process,” Bilak says. “There’s an enormous amount of steps behind the scenes to ensure everything is just right.”

 A more persistent challenge is helping sellers understand the financial logic behind staging. “Many don’t realize that skipping staging can end up costing more in the long run,” she emphasizes. “Properties that linger on the market continue to accrue mortgage, tax, and maintenance expenses, often far exceeding the cost of staging.”

 To address these concerns and reduce barriers for sellers, Stage The Space recently partnered with Notable, introducing a pay-at-closing option for her clients who need an immediate line of credit at a very low cost. This allows clients to defer payment until the property sells, eliminating the upfront financial hurdle and making staging accessible to a broader range of clients.

 Staging Strategy: Neutrality, Scale, and Nature Bilak’s staging approach emphasizes neutrality and broad appeal. “We keep it very neutral to appeal to every taste,” she explains. “The goal is to create spaces that resonate with the widest range of buyers, while still looking polished and editorial, like something you’d see in the pages of a magazine.”

 She focuses on selecting furniture and décor that fit the scale and style of each property. Oversized art is used for large spaces, while smaller rooms are staged with appropriately sized pieces to avoid overwhelming the space.

 A distinctive feature of her approach is the use of “biophilic touches” incorporating greenery and organic elements into the design. The biophilic concept, which brings nature into interior spaces, has grown in popularity for its positive effects on wellbeing. “Neurologically speaking, it helps human beings live better, behave better, feel better, heal better,” Bilak notes, referencing Singapore’s hospital system as an example where biophilic design dramatically supports patient recovery.

 Expanding Through Technology Seeking to diversify her business and add value for both sellers and buyers, Bilak has partnered with the furniture platform From Where to establish a digital storefront. This allows potential buyers to purchase the furniture and décor they see in their staged homes.

 “I’ve always dreamed of having a digital storefront, but I never really knew where to start,” she admits. Now, with the help of From Where, buyers can explore and select pieces with ease, enjoying a seamless, curated experience that extends the feeling of her staged homes beyond the property itself.

 Properties staged by Stage The Space now feature QR codes that direct visitors to Bilak’s personalized storefront. Buyers interested in a particular sofa, artwork, or accessory can immediately access product details and complete a purchase, turning the staged home into a live shopping experience.

 Building Industry Knowledge Beyond her staging projects, Bilak is dedicated to raising industry standards and sharing her expertise. She teaches a three-hour continuing education course on home staging for real estate agents through the Real Estate Staging Association (RESA).

 The course not only provides agents with three credits toward their license renewal but also teaches the practical and financial benefits of staging. “Participants in my class will also earn, on top of their three credits, the RESA CSA (Certified Staging Advocate) designation,” she explains.

 Her goal is to equip agents with the tools and language to advocate for staging, helping them articulate its value to sellers and incorporate it into their marketing strategy as a standard practice.

 Serving the Las Vegas Market Stage The Space operates throughout the Las Vegas Valley, from Lake Las Vegas to Pahrump, but limits its service radius to ensure quality and efficiency. Bilak’s team stages homes across all price points, adjusting inventory and design to match each property’s market segment.

 “While we specialize in high-end properties, we stage homes at every price point,” Bilak explains. “Our inventory reflects that, we have literally everything we need. And for the luxury properties, we bring in the high-end pieces that elevate the space and make it truly shine.

 Her approach is to treat each listing as a unique project, tailoring the staging to the home’s size, style, and target buyer. This adaptability allows Stage The Space to support a wide range of clients, from first-time sellers to luxury developers.

 Looking Ahead: Education and Expansion As the Las Vegas real estate market evolves with shifting buyer expectations and rising competition, Bilak sees education as the key to making staging more widely adopted. She notes that her most successful agents are the ones who truly understand staging and put it into practice. “Staging shouldn’t be thought of as an optional resource,” she says. “It’s a proven strategy that helps homes sell faster and achieve higher returns.”

 For an industry built on helping people envision their future homes, the challenge is clear: most buyers cannot picture the possibilities in a space. By providing visual answers and demonstrating the tangible benefits of staging, companies like Stage The Space are helping bridge the gap between vacant properties and successful sales.

 Through strategic staging, technology partnerships, and a commitment to industry education, Bilak is positioning her company and Las Vegas real estate professionals to meet today’s buyers’ needs and unlock the full potential of every listing.
