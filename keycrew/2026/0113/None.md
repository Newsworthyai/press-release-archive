# Loodmy Jacques: What West Palm Beach Home Buyers and Sellers Should Expect in 2026

As we start 2026, I’m seeing South Florida real estate continue its transition from pandemic-era extremes toward more balanced market conditions. Inventory is up about 30% across Palm Beach County, and that’s changing the dynamics for both buyers and sellers.

 The most important thing to understand is that South Florida is not one market. What happens in Delray Beach is different from what’s happening in Jupiter or West Palm Beach. Each area has its own buyer demographics and price movements.

 The Seller Mindset Challenge One pattern I’m seeing: sellers who remember what their neighbors got for similar homes in 2021 or 2022 are having a hard time adjusting to current pricing. Some are choosing not to sell at all rather than accept what feels like leaving money on the table.

 I understand that feeling, but here’s the reality. If you want to sell in 2026, you need proper pricing, professional marketing, and realistic timeline expectations. The immediate sales that characterized 2021-2022 aren’t happening anymore. That doesn’t mean homes aren’t selling; it just means they’re taking longer and require the right approach.

 For Buyers: Understanding What’s Normal I talk to a lot of buyers who are nervous about timing. They’re asking: what if prices keep dropping? What if I buy now and lose value?

 Here’s what I tell them. Normal market appreciation is somewhere between 3% to 6% annually. During COVID, we saw 20% to 30%, which was never sustainable. What we’re experiencing now is a return to normal, not a crisis.

 If you plan to stay in a property for five to seven years, can afford the payments, and find a location that works for your life, current conditions actually favor you. You have negotiating power over repairs and closing-cost credits that didn’t exist a few years ago.

 The Interest Rate Question I’m not telling people to wait for interest rates to drop. If you find a property within your budget and it checks your boxes, buy it. You can always refinance later when rates improve.

 We work with lenders who offer programs that reduce your rate for the first couple of years, giving you time to adjust and position yourself for refinancing. The key is to remove interest rate anxiety from your decision and focus on whether the property and payment work for your situation.

 Cash vs. Financing With nearly 45% of Palm Beach County sales being cash transactions, financed buyers sometimes worry they can’t compete. But there are ways to strengthen your financing offer.

 We help buyers get fully underwritten approval rather than just an introductory pre-approval letter. This eliminates financing contingencies and makes your offer much more attractive to sellers. Combined with a strong track record and quick response times, financed buyers can absolutely compete.

 Where I’m Seeing Opportunity Port St. Lucie continues to offer value to buyers seeking newer single-family homes at more affordable prices. The area is positioned for growth through planned development and job creation, making it attractive to both first-time buyers and investors.

 The analysis always depends on individual return expectations and long-term goals, but it’s an area worth considering if you’re being priced out of closer-in markets.

 My Approach for 2026 My goal is always education over transaction. Not everyone should buy right now. If you’re uncertain about your five-year plans or your job situation might change, renting may make more sense.

 But if you’re ready and qualified, don’t let market noise paralyze you. Work with someone who will walk you through the numbers, show you comparable sales, and help you understand what you’re really getting into.

 The market has normalized, and while that’s less exciting than the frenzy, it’s actually healthier for everyone involved. It rewards preparation, strategy, and realistic expectations.
