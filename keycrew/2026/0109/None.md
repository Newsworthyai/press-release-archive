# Home Warranty’s Structural Problem That Nobody Wants to Talk About

With a background in traditional insurance at AIG, Matan Slagter, CEO and Co-Founder at Armadillo, recognized a hard truth the industry had long ignored: home warranty companies were primarily responsible for their own poor reputations.

 The industry’s poor track record isn’t speculation – it’s evident in online reviews where countless homeowners share negative experiences. The math is stark. While homeowners’ insurance has an over 90% attachment rate because mortgage companies require it, home warranty remains optional and distrusted. The difference isn’t just about mandates – it’s about decades of companies prioritizing their technician networks and cost structures over customer experience.

 Where Actuarial Discipline Meets Consumer Empathy Slagter’s actuarial background shapes an approach that’s still uncommon in many fast-growing startups: disciplined growth with customer experience thoughtfully embedded into the pricing model. He applies mathematical rigor to ensure products are priced to support both long-term profitability and high-quality service, deliberately building in the capacity to deliver genuine care rather than focusing solely on cost efficiency.

 By grounding Armadillo’s growth in actuarial principles, Slagter emphasizes sustainability – setting prices that reflect real risk and service needs, and creating a business designed to scale responsibly while maintaining a strong customer experience.

 Transparency as Strategy, Not Feature When Armadillo took inspiration from Domino’s Pizza’s tracking system, it wasn’t simply about replicating a clever interface. “What became clear to me is that coverage alone doesn’t determine how homeowners feel – communication does. Two homeowners can receive the same thousand dollars for a refrigerator replacement, yet have completely different experiences. It comes down to how clearly you communicate, how long people wait, and whether they understand the reasoning behind the decision.”

 The challenge is significant. Home warranty sits between technicians and homeowners in a highly fragmented industry, requiring integration with contractor systems and parts suppliers. But solving this complexity is essential as consumer expectations continue to rise.

 The Counterintuitive Choice That’s Reshaping the Model Perhaps Armadillo’s most radical departure is letting homeowners choose between the company’s vetted network or their own trusted technicians – an option no other major player offers upfront. The traditional model made sense from a cost perspective: companies negotiated lower rates with their technician networks, keeping expenses down. But it was destroying customer experience, with complaints frequently centering on long wait times and unprofessional service.

 Some newer entrants tried the opposite approach, offering only reimbursement for customer-selected contractors. Armadillo went further, giving customers a genuine choice upfront. The data revealed that a significant portion of claims utilize the self-service option. The company built its entire technology stack around this dual model, with systems that adapt based on customer choice.

 Beyond the Startup Playbook While startup culture often emphasizes speed and momentum, Slagter’s team is focused on growing quickly and responsibly – building a sustainable business where customers, employees, and partners all feel part of something built to last.

 This approach reflects a balance of investor perspectives, combining the urgency and ambition often associated with venture capital with the long-term operating discipline of business owners who have independently scaled companies. The result is a flywheel: a company designed to endure, supported by robust processes, scalable technology, and sound economics that can thrive beyond any single individual.

 The Bigger Picture With projections suggesting the market could reach $13.6 billion by 2030 – roughly triple its current size – the opportunity is substantial. For home warranty specifically, evolution likely extends beyond repair and replacement. Preventive maintenance represents an obvious expansion, helping homeowners maintain systems before they break rather than only fixing failures.

 Slagter has observed a recurring pattern across industries: organizations grow accustomed to existing ways of working and gradually lose sight of the reasons behind them, rarely pausing to ask whether those practices still make sense. In an industry burdened by its own reputation, simply asking that question – and being willing to change in response- may be the most meaningful form of transformation.

 The home warranty sector needs more than incremental improvements. It requires companies willing to acknowledge past failures, reimagine core assumptions, and build with both profitability and genuine value in mind. That’s not just good business. It’s the only path back to trust.
