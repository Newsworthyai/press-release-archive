# Mark Gordon: Why Trying to Time the Vail Market Is the Mistake Buyers Keep Making

Market timing sounds logical in theory: wait for the bottom, buy at the lowest possible price, and maximize your return. In many real estate markets, this approach can occasionally work. In Vail, however, it consistently fails. Decades of market cycles show that even sophisticated buyers struggle to time it correctly.

 Mark Gordon from Christiania Realty entered real estate in 2008, during the worst market conditions since the Great Depression. While it may have seemed like the worst possible time to launch a career, it gave him a rare, firsthand education in how Vail’s market truly behaves. Most notably, he saw buyers repeat the same mistake over and over: waiting for a bottom that was either impossible to identify or already gone by the time they felt confident.

 The Great Recession Lessons Between 2009 and 2011, Vail presented clear opportunities. Prices had corrected from pre-recession peaks, though not as dramatically as in other resort markets. Vail’s limited supply and diverse buyer base provided insulation, but value still existed for buyers willing to act.

 “Buyers were very fickle,” Gordon recalls. Many found properties they liked at prices that made sense historically, yet hesitated. They wanted the absolute bottom. What if prices dropped another 5%? What if the market hadn’t truly turned?

 That hesitation proved costly. By the time buyers felt confident enough to move forward, prices had already rebounded. Those who purchased in 2009 or 2010, even without catching the exact bottom, saw returns that far exceeded any marginal savings they might have gained by waiting.

 “If all the buyers I worked with during the Great Recession had bought, they’d be very happy today,” Gordon notes. Some eventually purchased years later at significantly higher prices, often reminding them they wished they had acted sooner.

 Why Vail Doesn’t Follow the Playbook Traditional markets allow supply to respond to demand, rely on frequent comparable sales, and draw from local buyer pools. Vail breaks all of these assumptions.

 Supply is permanently constrained by national forest boundaries; more Vail cannot be built. Properties trade infrequently because owners tend to hold long-term. Demand comes from multiple sources: Denver, other U.S. markets, and international buyers, each influenced by different economic conditions.

 As a result, Vail is typically slow to enter a correction and quick to recover. When one buyer group pulls back, another often fills the gap.

 The market also tracks overall wealth more closely than interest rates. With a high percentage of cash buyers, stock market performance and wealth creation matter more than borrowing costs.

 The Current Moment Today’s market differs from 2008. There is no widespread distress and no forced selling. Instead, there is selective adjustment at lower price points, while the luxury segment above $5 million continues to outperform.

 At the same time, roughly $2 billion in major developments are moving through entitlement. These are long-term investments by experienced developers who are betting on Vail’s continued strength, not short-term market fluctuations.

 The Appreciation Play Gordon describes Vail real estate as an appreciation play rather than a cash-flow investment. While other markets may offer stronger rental yields, Vail delivers long-term price growth along with the lifestyle benefit, the “powder dividend.”

 From 1980 to 2019, Vail properties averaged over 7% annual appreciation, supported by low property taxes, constrained supply, and diverse demand. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the fundamentals remain intact.

 Sometimes the best time to buy isn’t the perfect moment. It’s when opportunity aligns with long-term fundamentals, and in Vail, that has proven true for decades. Explore homes in Vail.
