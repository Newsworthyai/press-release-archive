# TAY Investments Makes Boldest Move Yet with 365-Unit West Side Jersey City Development

New Jersey-based TAY Investments has closed on its largest acquisition to date, securing a fully approved development site at 212-230 Culver Avenue in Jersey City’s West Side neighborhood. The deal marks a significant milestone for the vertically integrated developer and underscores growing confidence in one of the region’s most rapidly transforming corridors.

 The 56,897-square-foot site will accommodate an 8-story building with 365 residential units, approximately 1,500 square feet of ground floor commercial space, and 184 indoor garage parking spaces. For TAY Investments, it represents both a scale play and a strategic bet on West Side Jersey City’s evolution from industrial hub to dynamic residential district.

 Doubling Down on West Side “The acquisition of 212 Culver Ave. represents a major step forward for TAY Investments as we continue expanding our footprint in the City, and we’re incredibly excited about it,” said Yuval Shram, Founder of TAY Investments. “This investment reinforces our long-term belief in Jersey City’s, and specifically in the West Side, tremendous growth potential.”

 TAY’s conviction in the area isn’t new. The company has been active in Jersey City since 2013 and currently operates six projects in the city, including two under development, totaling over 800 residential units and 22,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space. The Culver Avenue acquisition demonstrates the firm’s willingness to make increasingly significant bets on the submarket’s future.

 A Multi-Billion Dollar Transformation The property sits in the heart of Route 440, an area undergoing a multi-billion dollar transformation driven by three major anchors: the 100-acre Bayfront waterfront redevelopment, the SciTech Scity innovation hub, and the expanding New Jersey City University campus. The site’s location just 0.3 miles from the West Side Avenue Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Station provides direct access to downtown Jersey City and Manhattan, making it an attractive option for commuters seeking more affordable alternatives to downtown living.

 “The West Side area of Jersey City offers a unique combination of connectivity, community energy, and long-term value creation,” Shram explained. “For TAY Investments, this marks another strategic milestone in delivering high-quality, community-driven multifamily housing and we’re committed to delivering a thoughtful, sustainable development that elevates the neighborhood and delivers meaningful impact for both our residents and the community.”

 The Sanctuary Concept True to TAY’s amenity-forward approach, the development will feature “The Sanctuary,” a highly amenitized wellness area with indoor and outdoor facilities including a pool, hot tub, state-of-the-art gym, yoga and meditation center, dry and wet saunas, cold plunge, pickleball court, rooftop bar, and more. The entire building will be integrated with state-of-the-art technology features designed to elevate the resident experience.

 This emphasis on premium amenities at accessible price points has become a hallmark of TAY’s development strategy, positioning the company to capture demand from young professionals and established renters alike.

 Market Timing The timing of the acquisition reflects TAY’s view on current market conditions. “With interest rates beginning to move toward normalization and construction cost escalation moderating, we believe there will be even stronger demand for high-end modern apartments in strong growth areas like Jersey City,” Shram noted.

 Construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2026, with a grand opening targeted for summer 2028. The project will feature a mix of studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom configurations totaling 312,915 gross square feet.

 Acknowledgments Shram took time to recognize the team behind the transaction: “I would like to thank all of the TAY team, who I could not do this without. It is an honor and a privilege to work with each and every one of you. Special thanks to our partners at BHI – Ilana Druyan and David Kesselman – who have always been there for us.”

 Shram also highlighted the critical role of the listing agent: “Listing agent Yanni Marmarou was instrumental in closing this transaction. He negotiated optimal pricing and terms, landing us what is likely the standout deal of the 2024–2025 cycle in Jersey City.”
