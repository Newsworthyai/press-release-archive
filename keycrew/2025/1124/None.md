# PropTech ROI Reality Check: Separating Game-Changers from Gimmicks

Teddy Abdelmalek reveals which technologies deliver real returns versus expensive distractions

 Property technology (PropTech) continues to flood the market with promises of operational transformation. For owners, the challenge is simple but critical: how do you separate genuine ROI solutions from costly gimmicks?

 Teddy Abdelmalek, Senior Vice President at HH Redstone, has developed a clear framework that helps owners make smarter PropTech investments across 7,500 units nationwide.

 The Two-Question Filter “There’s so much noise in property technology,” Abdelmalek explains. “The question is: Does it improve resident experience? Does it improve operational efficiency? If it doesn’t hit on one of those, it’s a gimmick.”

 This simple lens ensures investments deliver measurable returns rather than empty promises. Before evaluating any technology, Abdelmalek’s team identifies the specific operational problem they’re trying to solve. Only then do they assess whether a proposed solution genuinely addresses that need or simply adds complexity.

 Game-Changing Technologies Enterprise-Grade Wi-Fi: Reliable, high-speed connectivity is essential for students’ academic and social needs. ROI includes fewer service calls, higher satisfaction, and a competitive leasing advantage. “When the internet goes down, everything stops,” Abdelmalek notes. “Investing in robust infrastructure prevents the emergency calls and frustration that drain operational resources.”

 Battery-Free Mobile Access: Door locks powered by phones using reverse wireless charging reduce infrastructure costs and maintain access during power outages. The technology eliminates battery replacement cycles while providing residents with seamless entry through devices they already carry.

 AI Leasing Chatbots: Automated after-hours lead capture pays for itself quickly, ensuring no missed opportunities and faster lease conversions. These systems handle initial inquiries when human staff aren’t available, then route qualified prospects to leasing teams during business hours.

 Overhyped Technologies Standard VR Tours: Basic, off-the-shelf VR/virtual tours look cool, but they rarely drive results and often fall flat in leasing. “We’ve seen properties pour money into standard VR tools like Matterport floorplans but it does little for leasing or provide a measurable ROI,” Abdelmalek says.

 The only virtual products truly worth supporting are the high-end products and experiences that come from two companies: LeaseMagnets and Point in Time Studios. They both elevate the professionalism of the tour experience, curate the storytelling, and give a representative overall feel of the property, and these two products have nurtured over 3 million tours.

 Their work actually enhances stabilized and new development pre-leasing campaigns, especially when a real tour isn’t possible yet. When paired with a strong marketing strategy behind these products, you are surely unstoppable in the leasing game.

 Over-Automated Leasing: Centralized systems that remove human connection risk eroding community engagement. While automation handles routine tasks efficiently, completely removing on-site staff presence eliminates the relationship-building that drives retention and referrals.

 Complex Amenity Systems: Elaborate booking tools for underutilized amenities typically underperform compared to functional infrastructure improvements. Properties often invest in sophisticated reservation platforms for spaces that see minimal use, when those resources could address more pressing operational needs.

 Future Innovations (2026–2030) Interactive Common Area Displays: Screens providing news, weather, and local advertising improve communication while generating revenue. These systems create value for both residents and properties by offering useful information while offsetting costs through local business partnerships.

 Smart Home Integration: Voice-activated work orders directly linked to property management streamline service while keeping the experience human. Residents can report maintenance needs conversationally, while staff receive structured requests they can efficiently address.

 Unit-Specific Leasing: Allowing residents to select exact bedrooms or views brings multifamily flexibility to student housing, enhancing choice and satisfaction. This approach reduces assignment friction and improves move-in experiences by giving residents more control over their living environment.

 Learning from Other Industries Abdelmalek draws inspiration from hospitality and retail, where anticipatory service drives loyalty and efficiency. “FedEx understands anticipatory service—they know people aren’t just mailing packages,” he explains. “They’ve built an entire ecosystem around predicting when you’ll need shipping supplies, when your business will have peak shipping needs, and how to make the entire process frictionless before you even realize you need help.”

 In PropTech, this same principle applies. The best technologies anticipate resident needs before they become problems. Smart thermostats that adjust before residents complain about temperature. Maintenance systems that identify issues before they cause disruptions. Leasing tools that engage prospects at the exact moment they’re ready to make decisions.

 “It’s about being one step ahead,” Abdelmalek says. “The technology that delivers real ROI is the technology that solves problems residents didn’t know they had yet.”

 Smart Decision Framework Start with Problems: Identify operational challenges before shopping for solutions. Abdelmalek’s team documents specific pain points—lease conversion rates, maintenance response times, resident complaints—then evaluates whether technology can meaningfully address those metrics.

 Measure Impact: Track metrics that directly affect NOI: leasing velocity, resident retention, and operational efficiency. “If you can’t draw a direct line from the technology investment to one of these outcomes, it’s probably not worth the expense,” Abdelmalek notes.

 Maintain Humanity: “AI has to supplement what we’re already doing, not replace the hospitality component that makes residents feel a certain way.” Technology should enhance human connection, not eliminate it. The properties that succeed use PropTech to free staff from repetitive tasks so they can focus on relationship-building that drives retention.

 The Bottom Line “The secret sauce isn’t mysterious. It’s doing fundamentals consistently every single day,” Abdelmalek emphasizes.

 Successful PropTech investments enhance proven strategies, improve measurable outcomes, and elevate resident experience. Everything else is expensive noise. The key is maintaining clarity about what problems you’re solving and ensuring technology serves operational goals rather than creating new complications.
