# From Residence Halls to Real Estate Leadership: How Student Affairs Shaped One Executive’s Approach

Teddy Abdelmalek’s journey from UMKC Resident Assistant to SVP at HH Red Stone reveals why people-first leadership drives better property performance.

 Most real estate executives come from finance or property management. Teddy Abdelmalek took a different path, one that started in a residence hall at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he learned that authentic leadership isn’t about authority, but about service and empathy.

 Today, as Senior Vice President of Business Development at HH Red Stone, Abdelmalek oversees a national platform managing 7,500 units (10,000 beds). His unique background combining biology, chemistry, and a master’s in Higher Education gives him a perspective that sets him apart in an industry often dominated by spreadsheets over people.

 The Moment That Changed Everything As a Resident Assistant at Cherry Street Residence Hall, Abdelmalek experienced a moment that would define his career. Late one evening, a resident he’d been supporting through a difficult semester stopped by to say thanks.

 “He shared that he had been in a dark place earlier that year, quietly battling thoughts of ending his life,” Abdelmalek recalls. “Having someone check in on him reminded him that he mattered, made the difference between withdrawing completely and finding a reason to stay.”

 That conversation crystallized a fundamental truth: community isn’t a marketing tagline. It’s what keeps people moving forward. “That moment lit the spark that still drives my career today: building environments where people feel supported, connected, and capable of thriving.”

 Blending Science with Service Abdelmalek’s dual bachelor’s degrees in biology and chemistry taught him methodical thinking, a skill he now applies to budget planning and performance analysis. His master’s in Student Affairs taught him how to connect with people and lead with intention.

 “Together, those three degrees shaped both sides of my professional identity: the analytical and the relational,” he explains.

 When he transitioned into real estate, this combination proved invaluable. “In business, it’s easy to focus on numbers like occupancy and rent growth. But my student affairs background taught me to see the people behind the metrics. Every data point represents someone’s home and someone’s experience.”

 Creating Community Before Chasing Performance Overseeing an extensive student housing portfolio struggling with turnover, Abdelmalek returned to his UMKC foundation: create belonging before performance.

 “We launched mentorship programs and resident-driven initiatives that gave students a sense of community,” he recalls. “Within a year, renewals and satisfaction both increased. It was proof that when you put people first, results follow.”

 This philosophy aligns with HH Red Stone’s approach: bridging real estate performance with human-centered management, seeing housing as a platform for community impact, not just a business.

 A Different Approach to Business Development Abdelmalek’s student affairs background also informs his business development approach. He treats properties as living communities rather than financial assets, a perspective that resonates with partners seeking more than transactional relationships.

 “My background blends institutional insight with a student-first, results-driven approach,” he explains. “That allows me to focus on both the resident experience and measurable real estate performance.”

 Every success HH Red Stone achieves ties back to principles Abdelmalek learned at UMKC: servant leadership, resilience, and the belief that great communities start with great people.

 The Competitive Advantage of Caring In an industry increasingly focused on technology and efficiency, Abdelmalek’s journey offers a powerful reminder: the most sustainable competitive advantage may be genuinely caring about residents.

 His approach proves that student affairs principles aren’t just feel-good concepts. They’re business strategies that drive retention, satisfaction, and superior property performance.

 “Every success we’ve achieved ties back to the principles I learned at UMKC,” Abdelmalek reflects. “Servant leadership, resilience, and the belief that great communities start with great people.”

 For property owners and operators, his story suggests a question worth considering: Are you managing properties, or are you building communities?

 Tadros “Teddy” Abdelmalek serves as Senior Vice President of Business Development at HH Red Stone, bringing more than 25 years of leadership experience in student housing and multifamily real estate. He earned his B.A. in Biology and Chemistry and M.Ed. in Higher Education from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
