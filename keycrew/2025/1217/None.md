# McKay Mortgage Owner Brendan McKay Honored on Mortgage Professional America’s Global 100 List

BAC’s Chief Advocacy Officer recognized among the world’s most influential mortgage leaders for 2025

 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Brendan McKay, Broker/Owner of McKay Mortgage Company and Chief Advocacy Officer of the Broker Action Coalition (BAC), has earned a place on Mortgage Professional America’s prestigious 2025 Global 100 list, which recognizes the world’s most impactful mortgage industry leaders.

 The seventh annual Global 100 report, produced by Mortgage Professional America alongside its international partner publications, identifies professionals who have demonstrated exceptional leadership and driven meaningful change across the mortgage sector during a year marked by regulatory transformation and market challenges.

 From Local Excellence to National Advocacy Impact McKay’s recognition highlights his unique dual role as both a successful practicing broker and an influential policy advocate. At McKay Mortgage, he has guided more than 1,300 families through the home financing process, closing over $600 million in loans while building a reputation for transparent, education-focused lending. His operational excellence has earned him recognition as a Top 100 Mortgage Broker nationwide and the #1 Mortgage Broker in the DC/Metro area consecutively from 2019 through 2024.

 As BAC’s Chief Advocacy Officer, McKay has transformed grassroots energy into legislative victories, most notably leading the charge that resulted in the passage of the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act. This landmark legislation will end abusive trigger lead practices when it takes effect in 2026, marking a watershed moment for consumer privacy protection in the mortgage industry.

 “Brendan represents exactly what the Global 100 is meant to recognize – leaders who don’t just succeed within their own businesses, but who actively shape the future of the industry,” said Rachel Clark, Executive Director of the BAC. “His ability to bridge the gap between practicing broker and policy advocate brings a rare authenticity to our work in Washington.”

 Navigating Industry Transformation The 2025 Global 100 honorees were selected based on their ability to lead through complexity, including navigating shifting interest rates, evolving regulations, and accelerating digital transformation. Selection criteria emphasized demonstrated leadership impact, influence on critical industry issues, and innovative responses to changing market conditions.

 McKay’s advocacy leadership has included mobilizing nearly 400 mortgage professionals for two national Advocacy in Action fly-in events, facilitating 250+ Congressional meetings, and orchestrating grassroots campaigns that generated more than 25,000 constituent messages to lawmakers. This sustained engagement proved instrumental in securing bipartisan support for trigger lead reform.

 “It’s not my job to sell you anything. It’s my job to educate you so you feel confident enough to make smart decisions,” McKay said, reflecting the philosophy that guides both his brokerage work and his advocacy efforts. “Whether I’m working with a homebuyer or speaking to Congressional offices, the goal is the same – provide people with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their future.”

 Building Momentum for Future Advocacy Wins With the historic trigger lead victory secured, BAC is expanding its policy agenda to tackle rising credit report costs, loan officer compensation reform, and protecting independent brokers from regulatory overreach. The organization continues building on the successful coalition-building approach that proved effective with the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act.
