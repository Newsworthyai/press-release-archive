# The Vertical Integration Advantage: How TAY Investments Maintains Profitability in Tight Markets

As construction costs surge and financing tightens, many real estate developers find themselves squeezed between rising expenses and tenant expectations for premium features. Yuval Shram, founder of TAY Investments, has charted a different path through strategic vertical integration and disciplined market selection.

 With a portfolio spanning New Jersey’s most dynamic rental submarkets, Shram’s success stems from a deceptively simple principle: control what matters, optimize relentlessly, and build for the long term.

 The Case for Vertical Integration Unlike developers who outsource construction, property management, and leasing to third parties, TAY Investments maintains in-house capabilities across the entire development lifecycle. This structure provides both cost advantages and strategic flexibility that specialized contractors can’t match.

 When you’re your own general contractor and property manager, you eliminate layers of margin while gaining direct insight into what actually works. Design decisions get made with operations in mind, and construction quality reflects long-term ownership rather than short-term handoff.

 This integration proves especially valuable when market conditions shift. Rather than renegotiating contracts with external partners or absorbing cost overruns, TAY Investments can adjust strategies internally, reallocating resources to maintain project economics.

 The approach requires significant organizational capability: maintaining teams with expertise in development, construction, leasing, and ongoing operations. However, for projects above 150 units where economies of scale justify the overhead, Shram believes the model delivers superior returns.

 Market Selection: The Proximity Premium TAY Investments’ geographic strategy centers on a careful balance: proximity to major employment centers without the cost structure of prime urban locations.

 TAY isn’t trying to build in the heart of downtown Jersey City or Newark. The company positions properties just close enough, near transportation hubs and accessible to the city, but where land costs and competitive intensity allow for compelling value propositions.

 This positioning targets tenants for whom convenience matters but doesn’t justify premium downtown rents. A property near light rail connections offers functional access to Manhattan employment while delivering amenities that would be financially impossible in core urban submarkets.

 The strategy also reflects demographic analysis. TAY Investments focuses on young professionals in their twenties and thirties, a cohort that marries later and forms smaller families than previous generations. For this demographic, proximity to work and lifestyle amenities outweighs traditional suburban priorities.

 Building to Hold Perhaps the most distinctive element of TAY Investments’ approach is the ownership time horizon. Unlike developers who optimize for rapid stabilization and sale, Shram builds with indefinite holding periods in mind.

 When you plan to hold a building for the long term, you make different decisions. Material quality matters more, amenity durability matters more, and resident satisfaction becomes the metric rather than lease-up velocity.

 This mentality influences vendor selection, construction specifications, and amenity design. Features requiring higher upfront investment but delivering better long-term performance get prioritized. The approach also provides strategic flexibility in difficult markets. Without pressure to hit short-term exit timelines, TAY Investments can ride out temporary market dislocations and optimize properties over multiple economic cycles.

 Navigating Today’s Challenges Shram doesn’t minimize the current environment’s difficulty. Interest rates, inflation, and rising costs for materials and labor have compressed margins across the industry.

 His prescription emphasizes fundamentals: deep expertise, strong relationships, and disciplined underwriting. For aspiring developers, he counsels gaining experience through working with established firms rather than learning through expensive first projects.

 Every development mistake costs significant money. If you’re not confident you know what you’re doing, you definitely don’t. The advice is to work with someone, learn the business, then apply that knowledge to your own projects.

 Relationships matter equally. Reliable brokers, supportive lenders, and capable team members make the difference when conditions get challenging.

 Credibility Through Execution TAY Investments has built its market reputation through reliable execution. Sellers know when TAY commits to a transaction, it closes. This credibility provides advantages in deal sourcing and financing that financial resources alone can’t purchase.

 This reputation stems directly from vertical integration and market focus. Deep operational expertise allows TAY to underwrite confidently with shorter diligence periods. In-house construction capabilities eliminate contractor execution risk.

 Looking ahead, TAY Investments continues pursuing properties above 150 units near transportation hubs and employment centers across New Jersey. While specific amenity packages may evolve based on ongoing tenant feedback, the core philosophy persists: understand what residents genuinely value, deliver it efficiently, and build to own rather than building to sell.

 In an industry where conventional wisdom often proves expensively wrong, Yuval Shram’s emphasis on integration, tenant insight, and long-term thinking offers a proven alternative. For developers willing to invest in operational capabilities rather than simply orchestrating third-party services, the approach demonstrates that quality and profitability need not be mutually exclusive, even in challenging markets.

 Yuval Shram is the founder of TAY Investments, a vertically integrated real estate development company specializing in multifamily properties across New Jersey. With in-house capabilities spanning development, general contracting, property management, and asset management, TAY Investments maintains a long-term holding strategy focused on creating exceptional residential communities in strategic locations throughout the state.
