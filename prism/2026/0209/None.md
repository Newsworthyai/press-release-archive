 DALLAS, TEXAS, February 9, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX) (“Blackboxstocks” or the “Company”) today announced that its merger target, REalloys Inc. (“REalloys”), has appointed General John M. “Jack” Keane (U.S. Army, Ret.) as a Designate Director. General Keane will formally join the Board of Directors upon the closing of the merger between Blackboxstocks and REalloys. Blackboxstocks’ registration statement on Form S-4 has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the companies expect to complete the merger in the near term, subject to customary closing conditions, including NASDAQ listing approval.

 General Keane, a four-star general and former Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, brings an unparalleled depth of experience in national security, foreign policy, and strategic leadership. His appointment further strengthens a highly experienced board led by Chairman Stephen S. duMont, President of GM Defense, as REalloys accelerates its mission to establish a secure, Western-aligned mine-to-magnet supply chain.

 “General Keane is one of the most respected strategic minds of our time. His service to our nation, from the battlefields of Vietnam to the highest levels of the Pentagon, demonstrates a lifetime of leadership and unwavering patriotism. As REalloys works to break reliance on foreign adversaries for rare earth supply chains, we believe that General Keane’s guidance will be invaluable. We are not just building a company; we are securing the industrial foundation of the free world, and I can think of no better partner to join us on this mission than General Keane.”

 Stephen S. duMont, Chairman of the Board of REalloys General Keane completed 37 years of public service, culminating in his appointment as Acting Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. As the Chief Operating Officer of the Army, he directed 1.5 million soldiers and civilians in 120 countries with an annual operating budget of $110 billion. He played a key role in formulating and recommending the “Surge” strategy in Iraq and continues to serve as a trusted advisor to presidents, cabinet officials, and members of Congress.

 “I am honored to join the Board of REalloys at this pivotal moment for our national security. The United States and our allies face a defining challenge: we must secure the strategic resources that power our defense systems and our economy. Dependence on adversaries for these materials is a vulnerability we can no longer accept. I believe that REalloys is taking decisive action in its plan to build the domestic capacity we need to remain free and independent.”

 General Jack Keane General Keane currently serves as Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and is a Senior Strategic Analyst for Fox News. During his military career, he commanded the highly respected 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and the 18th Airborne Corps. He is a decorated combat veteran, holding the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and five Legions of Merit, among other honors. In March 2020, General Keane was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.

 General Keane joins a high-caliber board that includes Chairman Stephen S. duMont, Ambassador David MacNaughton, former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, and the Honorable Brad Wall, former Premier of Saskatchewan. Together, they bring a potent combination of defense, diplomacy, and industrial policy expertise aligned with Title 50 of the U.S. Code.
