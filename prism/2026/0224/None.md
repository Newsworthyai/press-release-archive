# Blackboxstocks Announces that NASDAQ Approves Listing of REalloys; Merger Expected to Close Today after Close of the Market

Following the closing, the combined company will begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “NASDAQ: ALOY” effective Wednesday, February 25, 2026.

 

 DALLAS, February 24, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX) (“Blackboxstocks” or the “Company”) today announced that the Nasdaq Capital Market approved the Company’s listing application in connection with its previously announced merger transaction with REalloys Inc. (“REalloys”). The merger and related transactions are expected to close today, Tuesday, February 24, 2026, after the close of the market, subject to customary closing conditions.

 Following the closing of the merger and related transactions, REalloys will operate as a publicly traded, vertically integrated North American heavy rare earth platform built for national security and defense-oriented supply chain resilience.

 REalloys Highlights:

 * Strategic Objective: To become the largest producer of heavy rare earth oxides and metals outside of China by 1H 2027, supported by what REalloys believes are among the most advanced commercial-scale heavy rare earth separation and metallization assets outside of China.
* Compliance Advantage: REalloys believes it is currently positioned to be the only North American heavy rare earth platform with a zero-China nexus supply chain aligned with 2027 U.S. defense procurement restrictions, purpose-built to support the Defense Industrial Base, and currently servicing the Defense Logistics Agency.
* Advanced Execution Profile: Built on existing infrastructure with phased expansion plans, comparatively limited incremental capital requirements, and reduced permitting risk relative to greenfield peers, advancing on what REalloys believes are the most accelerated commercial timelines in the heavy rare earth sector.
* Feedstock Strategy: Designed to be feedstock-agnostic and diversified, avoiding reliance on a single captive source of feedstock and mitigating supply concentration risk that constrains many competing platforms.
* Integrated Growth Path: Currently executing a phased scale strategy across oxide separation, metallization, and downstream magnet initiatives, including collaboration efforts with JOGMEC the most leading-edge organization on magnets outside of China, to support high-performance magnet manufacturing for strategic and protected markets.

 REalloys enters the public markets at a pivotal moment, as national security, advanced manufacturing, and allied supply chains converge around the need for dependable, China-free heavy rare earth capability.
