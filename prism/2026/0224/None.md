# Blackboxstocks and REalloys Announce Closing of Merger; REalloys to Begin Trading on Nasdaq Under Ticker “ALOY”

Combined Company Positioned as a Vertically Integrated, Zero-China Nexus Heavy Rare Earth Platform Supporting U.S. National Security and Defense Supply Chains

 

 DALLAS, February 24, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Blackboxstocks Inc. (Nasdaq: BLBX) (“Blackboxstocks”) today announced the successful closing of its previously announced merger with REalloys Inc. (“REalloys”) following the close of market on February 24, 2026.

 Effective at the open of trading on Wednesday, February 25, 2026, the combined company will operate under the name REalloys Inc. and its common stock is expected to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ALOY.”

 The transaction marks the public market debut of a vertically integrated North American heavy rare earth platform focused on establishing a secure, zero-China nexus supply chain aligned with U.S. defense procurement priorities.

 As provided in the merger agreement, the Blackboxstocks board of directors authorized and declared a dividend of one contingent value right (“CVR”) for each share of common stock outstanding at 5:01 p.m. Central Time on the record date, February 23, 2026, payable immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The CVRs will represent the rights to receive cash payments in connection with certain transactions involving the assets, rights and properties owned, used or usable by Blackbox.io Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Blackboxstocks, which was organized to conduct historical operations of Blackboxstocks.

 Transaction Highlights

 Following the closing, REalloys is positioned to advance its strategic objective of becoming the largest producer of heavy rare earth oxides and metals outside of China by the first half of 2027, supported by what the Company believes are among the most advanced commercial-scale heavy rare earth separation and metallization assets outside of China.

 Key Platform Attributes Include:

 * Strategic Objective: Scaling oxide separation and metallization capacity to serve defense, advanced manufacturing, and protected industrial markets.
* Compliance Advantage: Positioned to operate a zero-China nexus supply chain aligned with anticipated 2027 U.S. defense procurement restrictions and currently servicing federal logistics and procurement channels supporting the Defense Industrial Base.
* Advanced Execution Profile: Leveraging existing infrastructure with phased expansion plans, comparatively limited incremental capital requirements, and reduced permitting risk relative to greenfield development projects.
* Feedstock Diversification Strategy: Designed to be feedstock-agnostic, utilizing allied and domestic sources to mitigate supply concentration risk.
* Integrated Growth Path: Executing a phased scale strategy spanning upstream resource development, midstream separation and metallization, and downstream magnet initiatives, including collaboration efforts with Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) to support high-performance magnet manufacturing for strategic markets.

 Strategic Positioning at Closing

 REalloys enters the public markets at a pivotal time as geopolitical considerations, critical mineral policy, and national security priorities increasingly converge around the need for dependable, China-independent heavy rare earth capability.

 The Company’s integrated mine-to-magnet strategy encompasses:

 * Upstream: 100% owned Hoidas Lake rare earth asset in Saskatchewan, strategic partnership with U.S. government backed Mission Critical Materials (tailings and waste stream technology), a diversified portfolio of allied upstream feedstock providers, and recycling partnerships.
* Midstream: Expansion of North American separation, refining, and metallization capabilities in partnership with the Saskatchewan Research Council.
* Downstream: 100% owned PMT Critical Metals. The only advanced heavy rare earth metallization facility in the continental U.S., serving federal logistics and procurement agencies supporting the U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA, as well as the broader Defense Industrial Base, Nuclear Industrial Base, and Organic Industrial Base.
