# Tianrong Internet Products and Services Inc. (OTC: TIPS) Provides Post-Launch Update on DEPIN Token and Outlines Phase II Expansion Strategy for Depinfer

Company Advances Decentralized GPU Compute Network with Staking, Governance, and AI Marketplace Enhancements Planned for Phase II Completion by March 2026

 

 Mountainhome, PA, February 24, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Tianrong Internet Products and Services Inc. (OTC: TIPS) (“TIPS” or the “Company”), a Pennsylvania-based technology company focused on blockchain incubation and decentralized infrastructure initiatives, today provided an operational update following the February 17, 2026 launch of the DEPIN token for the Depinfer project on the Solana blockchain via Raydium.

 As previously announced on February 18, 2026, the DEPIN token successfully graduated from incubation and completed Phase I decentralized deployment. Since launch, the DEPIN/SOL trading pair has remained active on decentralized exchanges, with trading activity reflecting continued market engagement and community participation.

 Depinfer is a decentralized GPU compute-sharing protocol designed to enable participants to contribute idle GPU resources to a distributed network supporting AI inference and compute workloads. The protocol aggregates underutilized hardware capacity from independent operators and facilitates marketplace-based allocation of compute jobs, with rewards to be distributed in DEPIN tokens and company reward tokens paired with DEPIN.

 Management believes early trading activity and community growth provide initial validation for the decentralized physical infrastructure network (“DePIN”) model within the GPU compute segment, where global demand for AI-related processing continues to expand.

 Liquidity and Token Structure

 Following completion of the initial bonding curve phase, liquidity transitioned to Raydium automated market maker pools. The associated liquidity pool has been locked in accordance with the project’s stated security framework. The DEPIN token functions as the utility mechanism for marketplace transactions, node incentives, reward token pairing, and future governance features.

 Phase II Development Roadmap

 With Phase I deployment complete, Depinfer is advancing to Phase II development, which is expected to focus on:

 * Integration with additional AI frameworks and developer tools
* Implementation of dynamic workload allocation and pricing mechanisms
* Introduction of staking and governance features
* Continued enhancement of data privacy and network security protocols
* New Custom and Reward Token pairs and launches

 The Company expects Phase II to complete by the end of March 2026. It will emphasize infrastructure scaling, marketplace functionality, and ecosystem development while maintaining a community-oriented governance structure. Project supporters interested in testing the beta roll out of the coming governance and marketplace features, and or gaining priority for early participation in new custom and reward token launches, can register by becoming DEPIN token holders on Raydium through the link above or by search contract address: GCyTkEDd239AvEDMR2HbuoxHNzQAh6mSxd4Kcudjiray

 Strategic Positioning

 Depinfer leverages the Solana blockchain’s high-throughput architecture to facilitate low-cost, high-speed settlement for decentralized compute transactions. Management believes decentralized GPU aggregation may offer an alternative infrastructure model in markets experiencing compute constraints and rising AI processing demand.

 TIPS will continue to provide advisory, technical, and strategic support to the Depinfer initiative as it advances through subsequent development phases.
