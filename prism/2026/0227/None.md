# Renewal Fuels, Inc. (OTC: RNWF), Operating as American Fusion, Provides Update on Washington State Legal Matters

Southlake, Texas, February 26, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Renewal Fuels, Inc. (OTC: RNWF) (“RNWF”, “American Fusion” or the “Company”), provides the following update regarding its pending civil action in King County Superior Court (Case No. 25-2-32689-6).

 On February 26, 2026, the Court entered an order dismissing all claims against Justin Costello pursuant to Civil Rule 41. Because Mr. Costello is no longer a party to the action, the Court struck his Emergency Motion for Stay of All Proceedings.

 The Court separately entered an order striking the Company’s Motion for Entry of Default Judgment against the remaining corporate defendants on procedural grounds related solely to citation formatting requirements under Civil Rule 7 and King County Local Civil Rules.

 Importantly:

 • Defaults entered against the corporate defendants remain in place.

 • The Court did not question service, default, rescission, or the evidentiary record.

 • The ruling was procedural and did not address the merits of the Company’s claims.

 The underlying action seeks rescission of two 2021 asset purchase agreements and cancellation of approximately 1,683,000,000 shares issued in connection with those transactions for which the Company contends no consideration was received.

 The Company is in the process of refiling a corrected motion that complies with the Court’s procedural directives. The Company believes this to be last remaing material item outstanding to effect the Corporate action with FINRA for the Name Change and Voluntry Symbol Change.

 Management is aware of commentary circulating online and emphasizes that the Court’s orders do not constitute a ruling against the Company on the substance of its claims.

 The Company remains committed to resolving the disputed share issuances through the judicial process.
