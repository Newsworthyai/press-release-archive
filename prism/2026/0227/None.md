# Renewal Fuels, Inc. (OTC: RNWF), Operating as American Fusion, Provides Patent Portfolio Update; 20 Texatron™ “Clam-Shell” Applications Filed; Significant Portfolio Expansion Planned for 2026

Advancing Texatron™ Reactor Engineering Through Strategic Intellectual Property Expansion

 

 * Expanding the Texatron™ Patent Portfolio for Commercial Deployment
* Positioning for Long-Term Shareholder Value Through IP Expansion
* Engineering a Commercial-Ready Aneutronic Fusion Framework

 

 Southlake, Texas, February 27, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Renewal Fuels, Inc. (OTC: RNWF) (“RNWF”, “American Fusion” or the “Company”), today provided a comprehensive intellectual property (IP) update regarding its Texatron™ fusion platform and proprietary “clam-shell” reactor architecture.

 

 

 As of the date of this release, the Company has filed 20 patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) covering core structural, confinement, and electromagnetic design elements of the Texatron™ system.

 Of the 20 applications filed, one application is currently in active prosecution with a USPTO Examiner, three priority applications are expected to begin examination with an Examiner in mid-2026 subject to USPTO and the remaining filings are progressing through the USPTO review process.

 The Company is currently developing approximately 240 additional patent applications in coordination with Chief Technology Officer Dr. John Brandenburg. These applications reflect ongoing engineering and architectural refinements and are expected to be filed in phases as development progresses and, if filed as contemplated, would result in a combined intellectual property portfolio of approximately 260 patent applications spanning core reactor architecture, fuel cycle optimization, system integration, and related technologies.

 Intellectual Property as Strategic Foundation

 The Company’s patent strategy is designed to establish layered protections across core reactor architecture, fuel cycle optimization, and integrated system design elements supporting the Texatron™ platform. Management indicated that filings are being sequenced to align with ongoing engineering refinements and long-term commercialization objectives.

 Michael Smith, CLO of the Company, stated: “Our intellectual property strategy is being structured deliberately and in phases. We are prioritizing core architectural protections while building a portfolio intended to support regulatory positioning, commercial deployment, and long-term defensibility. Coordinating closely with technical leadership ensures that each filing aligns with the platform’s development roadmap.”

 Texatron™: A Transformative Aneutronic Fusion Architecture

 The Texatron™ platform is engineered around an aneutronic fusion pathway utilizing Helium-3 and Deuterium, significantly reducing neutron radiation compared to traditional deuterium-tritium fusion concepts. The system’s compact, modular “clam-shell” design incorporates a hollow toroidal chamber with a rifled interior surface intended to optimize electromagnetic confinement and fuel dynamics.

 Key differentiators of the Texatron™ include:

 * Aneutronic fuel mixture (Helium-3 and Deuterium)
* Compact modular architecture suitable for distributed deployment
* Innovative rifled toroidal interior geometry
* Electromagnetic foil formation along interior ridges
* Symmetrical and asymmetrical shell configurations
* Direct energy concentration features

 Management believes the Texatron™ platform is designed to support scalable, compact deployment objectives consistent with long-term clean energy development goals.
