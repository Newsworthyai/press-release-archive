# Auddia Highlights LT350 Business as Core AI Infrastructure Asset in Proposed Merger

Proprietary technology turns any parking lot into a revenue generating datacenter delivering AI inference at the edge without absorbing parking spaces

 Supports the fastest, most secure, and lowest cost inference runs for the highest paying customers handling the most sensitive data

 LT350 accounts for approximately 50% of McCarthy Finney’s $250 million DCF valuation

 

 BOULDER, CO, February 25, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – Auddia Inc. (NASDAQ: AUUD) (“Auddia” or the “Company”), today announced a comprehensive strategic overview of LT350, a distributed AI compute business engineered to address two of the most urgent constraints in the AI infrastructure market; GPU underutilization and grid‑constrained datacenter deployment. LT350 is one of three new businesses that would be combined with Auddia in the new McCarthy Finney holding company if Auddia’s recently announced business combination with Thramann Holdings, LLC (“Thramann Holdings”) is completed.

 LT350 represents a breakthrough in AI infrastructure design protected by 13 issued and 3 pending patents, creating a defensible, highly differentiated deployment platform for distributed AI infrastructure. Unlike large, centralized datacenters, LT350 aims to deploy a network of small, interconnected datacenters across parking lots without absorbing any parking lot space. Instead of utilizing containerized or ground mounted micro data centers, LT350 integrates modular GPU, memory, and battery cartridges directly into the ceiling of its proprietary solar parking‑lot canopy, transforming the airspace above the parking lot into a revenue generating high performance AI compute datacenter optimized for inference.

 “Hyperscalers built the training layer. LT350 is building the distributed inference layer — one that we believe will be faster to deploy, cheaper to operate, and dramatically more energy efficient, while generating premium revenue for premium inference compute services.”

 Jeff Thramann, CEO of Auddia and founder of LT350 The Company believes LT350 creates numerous advantages in the datacenter space.

 A New Infrastructure Model for the Inference Era

 AI workloads are shifting from centralized training to real‑time, distributed inference, creating demand for compute that is:

 * Physically close to data sources
* Less dependent on strained regional electrical grids
* Faster to deploy
* More cost predictable
* Aligned with data sovereignty and compliance requirements for sensitive data

 LT350’s canopy-integrated architecture enables high‑performance compute to be deployed directly at the point of need — in the parking lots of hospitals, financial campuses, research parks, logistics hubs, and autonomous‑vehicle depots — without displacing parking or requiring new land acquisition.

 “I believe LT350 solves the three constraints that define the next decade of AI infrastructure: latency, power, and land. By integrating compute into the ceiling of a patented solar canopy, LT350 preserves all parking functionality while creating a new, revenue‑producing layer of AI infrastructure above it. This is a structurally advantaged platform for the inference era for many reasons.”

 Jeff Thramann, CEO of Auddia and founder of LT350 Designed for High‑Value, Regulated, and Latency Sensitive Workloads

 LT350’s architecture is purpose‑built for customers who require deterministic performance, physical data sovereignty, and proximity to operations. Target verticals include:

 * Hospitals and health systems requiring HIPAA‑aligned inference
* Financial institutions needing low‑latency model execution
* Defense and aerospace organizations with strict isolation requirements
* Biotech and research campuses running sensitive workloads
* Autonomous‑vehicle fleets needing local data offload and model updates

 By placing AI compute mere feet from these environments with secure, direct connections, LT350 delivers performance and assurance levels that management believes centralized cloud datacenters cannot match. Inference customers with the specialized compute requirements that match to what LT350 aims to deliver are typically the highest paying customers. LT350 is not competing with hyperscalers on price. Instead, LT350 complements hyperscalers by serving inference workloads that cannot be efficiently or compliantly handled in centralized cloud datacenters, thus competing in the space by providing the highest quality inference services for the highest sensitivity data.

 Power‑Sovereign Architecture for a Constrained Grid

 LT350 supports the grid by integrating solar generation and battery storage directly into each canopy, enabling:

 * Behind‑the‑meter power buffering
* Peak‑shaving
* Curtailment resilience
* Reduced interconnection requirements
* Predictable long‑term power economics

 This design aims to position LT350 to scale even as utilities, regulators, and hyperscalers face mounting grid constraints.

 Parking‑Lot Deployment: Faster, Cheaper, Zero Land Cost

 LT350 deploys in existing parking lots, leveraging the elevated canopy ceiling to preserve all parking functionality. This creates three structural advantages:

 * Zero land acquisition costs and readily available sites adjacent to the best customers
* No loss of parking as a non-revenue generating asset converts to revenue generation
* Faster deployment as zoning, permitting, and environmental hurdles are minimized

 We believe the result is deployment in months, not years, with materially lower capex.

 A New Economic Model for Inference Infrastructure

 By combining modular GPU deployment, solar‑plus‑storage energy systems, and parking‑lot‑based datacenters, The Company believes LT350 delivers a fundamentally different cost and performance profile for AI compute:

 * Higher utilization by matching GPU cartridge deployment to inference need
* Higher revenue from delivering higher quality inference services
* Lower energy costs from solar generation and off peak battery charging
* Reduced grid impact from solar and batteries
* Faster deployment due to parking lot availability and no infrastructure upgrades
* Improved resilience inherent in a distributed AI network
