# JP3E Holdings Partners with TBURN Chain to Launch Innovation Cities Kwave in Atlanta and Dallas

K2Global SMB500 Platform deploys blockchain-enabled industrial ecosystems in Atlanta, GA and Dallas, TX — strengthening American supply chains and manufacturing capacity

 

 ATLANTA, GA, DALLAS, TX, February 25, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – JP3E Holdings Inc. (OTC: JPTE) today announced a strategic partnership with TBURN Chain Foundation to deploy the K2Global SMB500 Platform through Innovation City Kwave hubs in Atlanta, Georgia and Dallas, Texas. The K2Global SMB500 initiative integrates 500 elite Korean small and mid-sized enterprises into US manufacturing clusters powered by KWAVE AI intelligence and TBURN.IO real-world asset tokenization infrastructure, targeting $7.5 billion total capital deployment creating the first Korean-US industrial blockchain corridor for strategic materials supply chain resilience.

 K2Global SMB500 represents JP3E’s institutional-grade platform combining physical manufacturing clusters, KWAVE AI 4-pillar enterprise scoring, TBURN.IO RWA tokenization, and a structured SPAC-to-NASDAQ pathway for Korean SMBs. Atlanta Innovation City will integrate 160 enterprises across K-Tech (semiconductors), K-Bio (biotech), K-Defense (aerospace), and K-Materials (critical minerals) sectors with 2.8M square feet of shared advanced manufacturing infrastructure and $2.5B CapEx deployment. Dallas cluster operations will focus on K-Energy, K-Defense, K-Tech, and K-Materials sectors, expanding platform capacity as Korean SMBs scale US market presence through blockchain-settled procurement networks and institutional capital access.

 MARKET CONTEXT

 JPMorgan CEO: “Blockchain is Better Than Current Banking System” — Bank Processes $16 Trillion in Single Day on Blockchain. In a February 2025 interview on Fox Business, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon revealed the bank recently processed $16 trillion in a single day using blockchain infrastructure, confirming Wall Street’s irreversible migration from traditional settlement rails to distributed ledger technology. “Everything is moving out of the current banking system,” Dimon stated, validating the institutional blockchain infrastructure thesis that underpins JP3E’s Innovation Cities Kwave deployment.“If we can use things like that to do something better, faster, cheaper… we’re going to,” the JPMorgan CEO emphasized — the same principle driving JP3E’s decision to deploy industrial tokenization on TBURN Mainnet rather than traditional financing rails.

 JPMorgan’s blockchain validation arrives as US policymakers prioritize supply chain resilience and manufacturing onshoring following pandemic-era disruptions. Innovation Cities Kwave addresses this strategic imperative through infrastructure rather than subsidies — creating repeatable regional ecosystems where blockchain-based settlement, tokenized capacity sharing, and institutional capital access enable American manufacturers to compete globally without sacrificing domestic production.

 “K2Global SMB500 is not incremental trade policy — it’s infrastructure for the next era of Korean-US industrial collaboration. We’re deploying 500 Korean SMBs across strategic K-Wave sectors through Innovation Cities in Atlanta and Dallas, powered by KWAVE AI scoring and TBURN.IO tokenization. This is $7.5 billion institutional capital meeting Korean manufacturing excellence, with blockchain as the settlement rails and NASDAQ as the pathway.”
