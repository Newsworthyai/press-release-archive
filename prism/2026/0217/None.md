 ROBESONIA, PA, February 17, 2026 – PRISM MediaWire (Press Release Service – Press Release Distribution) – BLAQclouds, Inc. (OTC: BCDS), a Web3 infrastructure and digital settlement technology company, today announced the official launch of the ApolloNFT.io Marketplace, a creator-focused digital asset platform built on the Apollo Mainnet.

 

 

 ApolloNFT.io provides artists, musicians, filmmakers, directors, and digital creators a comprehensive environment to mint NFTs, create collections, launch catalogs, curate playlists, import fan communities, and connect with audiences in a unified on-chain ecosystem designed to enhance creator branding and engagement.

 Unlike traditional NFT platforms centered primarily on collectibles, ApolloNFT.io is designed as a content ecosystem, enabling creators to organize media, build audience relationships, and distribute digital works through structured catalogs and interactive communities.

 Platform Capabilities

 The ApolloNFT.io marketplace allows creators to:

 * Mint NFTs directly on Apollo Mainnet
* Launch organized collections and catalogs
* Create media playlists and content libraries for music, videos and documents
* Import and manage fan communities
* Engage with like-minded creators and audiences
* Build branded digital experiences around their work
* Link directly via Web interface with theAlley and ApolloCASH.io

 The platform is engineered to serve as both a distribution channel and a community infrastructure layer for digital creators.

 Web3 Cross-Platform Integration

 Through BLAQclouds’ Web3 infrastructure stack, users will be able to seamlessly interact across multiple ecosystem applications, including:

 * theAlley(SocialFI) — social and creator engagement environment
* ApolloNFT.io(SocialNFT) — digital asset minting and media catalogs
* ApolloCash.io(Global Remittance) — cross-platform payment and settlement
* ApolloWallet.io — Non-custody digital and transaction management
* ApolloID.io — Web3 identity and access layer

 This integration enables users to maintain a single digital identity and asset presence across the ecosystem, allowing payments, ownership, and community interaction to operate cohesively rather than as isolated services.

 Creators will be able to mint assets, distribute content, receive payments, and interact with their communities without leaving the ecosystem environment.

 Foundation for Future Media Initiatives

 BLAQclouds stated that ApolloNFT.io will serve as the foundational infrastructure for its upcoming Super Studios film initiative, enabling tokenized film assets, fan participation models, and media-centric digital ownership structures.

 Additionally, ApolloNFT.io will be seamlessly integrated into the V2 launch of theAlley, expected during the first week of March 2026. The integration will allow creators and communities to interact across platforms while maintaining unified identity and asset ownership.

 “ApolloNFT is not just another NFT marketplace — it is built around our Four Pillars philosophy and is the infrastructure layer for creator economies. We built this platform so creators can mint, distribute, monetize, and engage with their audiences while remaining connected to payments and identity. Instead of fragmented apps, users experience one connected Web3 environment. The real innovation is interoperability. A creator can mint on ApolloNFT, engage fans on theAlley, receive payments through ApolloCASH and BLAQpay, and manage assets inside ApolloWallet, while being fully secured using ApolloID. This becomes the backbone for our Super Studios rollout and the upcoming V2 launch of theAlley, forming a unified creator economy ecosystem.”

 “Apollonft.io is hands down the easiest NFT platform I’ve ever encountered. The minting process is fast and very affordable. 5 stars!” — C7 Music, Independent Label.
