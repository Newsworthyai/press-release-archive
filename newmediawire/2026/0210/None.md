# Hi-View Completes Acquisition of Saunders and NUB Projects in Toodoggone District

VANCOUVER, BC - February 10, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - HI-VIEW RESOURCES INC. (“Hi-View” or the “Company”) (CSE: GXLD; OTCQB: HVWRF; FSE: B63) is pleased to announce that, further to the Company’s news releases dated August 13th, 2025, it has closed its previously announced acquisitions of the Saunders and Nub Properties in Toodoggone District of British Columbia.

 The two projects are located approximately 300km northeast of Smithers, BC and 30km north of the Kemess Cu-Au Porphyry Complex, operated by Centerra Gold. They are located within the prolific Stikine Terrane proximal to many past producing mines, deposits, and prospects including the Lawyers deposit, the Baker deposit and the Saunders prospect that represent low sulphidation epithermal-type mineralization.1

 R. Nick Horsley, Chief Executive Officer of Hi-View, commented, “We are delighted to have secured a 100% interest in the Saunders and Nub projects. The Saunders Property lies within the same prolific structural corridor as the high-grade AuRORA porphyry Cu-Au-Ag discovery, and we are actively unpacking and interpreting a substantial volume of historical data to unlock its full potential. Meanwhile, the Nub Property features an underexplored magnetic anomaly offset by northwest faulting, presenting a compelling opportunity for modern, systematic exploration in the Toodoggone district. Importantly, Hi-View has no work commitments on any of its outstanding options, which provides us with the flexibility to aggressively pursue results and prioritize high-impact exploration activities.”

 About the Saunders Property

 The Saunders Property covers 209.6 hectares and comprises two non-contiguous claim blocks overlying three documented BC MINFILE occurrences: Saunders Northwest, Saunders North, and Saunders South.2 Mineralization on the property is expressed as low-sulphidation epithermal Au–Ag systems, hosted in quartz +/- barite veins and breccias associated with silicification and argillic alteration of Early Jurassic volcanic rocks.

 Historical sampling at the Saunders Northwest occurrence returned assays of up to 1.42 g/t Au and 11.7 g/t Ag (BC AR 14487). Mineralization seems to be structurally controlled by the northwest-trending Saunders Fault and associated splays, a regional-scale structure that is part of a broader mineralized corridor extending through the central Toodoggone district.

 Intersecting NE-trending structures, interpreted from topography and regional fault datasets, are considered important secondary controls on mineralization. Similar structural intersections are recognized as key controls on epithermal and porphyry systems elsewhere in the district.

 Early Jurassic-aged intrusive rocks are present within and proximal to the Saunders claims and are temporally consistent with porphyry Cu–Au and epithermal Au-Ag mineralization throughout the Toodoggone region. The Saunders mineral occurrences are interpreted to represent an upper-level epithermal expression developed above or lateral to a possible deeper porphyry system, consistent with regional geological relationships.

 A review of recently released schematic figures from induced polarization (IP) data from nearby projects indicates that elevated chargeability anomalies do not consistently coincide with mineralization of interest. In porphyry–epithermal systems of the Toodoggone district, such chargeability responses can be interpreted as pyrite-rich phyllic alteration zones, with economic mineralization potentially occurring beneath, adjacent to, or offset from chargeability highs. As a result, IP data are most effective when integrated with geological mapping, structural interpretation, and geochemical information.

 Additionally, the Company has identified a historic Induced Polarization (IP) survey over the Saunders property that delineated an anomaly subsequently drill-tested. The Company is currently digitizing this legacy data to evaluate whether the historical drilling adequately targeted the chargeability anomaly.3

 About the Nub Property

 The 873.9 ha Nub project is surrounded by the JOY project operated by Amarc Resources. The JOY project is interpreted to be the northern extension of the Kemess porphyry Cu-Au district and hosts significant porphyry-type mineralization including the Pine (BC MinFile 094E016) and MEX (094E057) deposits and the recently discovered AuRORA deposit. While epithermal-type targets are noted within the JOY project, exploration has been focussed on discovery and definition of porphyry-type mineralization. The highest priority exploration target on the Nub property is a magnetic anomaly located at valley bottom in close proximity to the Hazelton and Stuhini Group unconformity, commonly referred to as the “red-line”. The anomaly is also coincident with anomalous copper in soil geochemistry.
