# Helix Biopharma Corp. Extends LEUMUNA Option With metaShape Pharma for Adipose Tissue-Related and Metabolic Diseases

TORONTO, ONTARIO - February 5, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Helix BioPharma Corp. (TSX: “HBP”, OTC PINK: “HBPCD”, FRANKFURT: “HBP0”) (“Helix” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage oncology company shaping a near future where today’s hard-to-treat cancers are vincible, today announced the extension of its Research and Exclusive Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) with metaShape Pharma AG (“metaShape”) covering LEUMUNA™ through December 31, 2028.

 The Agreement was originally entered into in April 2023 between metaShape and Laevoroc Immunology AG, providing metaShape with an exclusive research license and an option to negotiate a commercial license for LEUMUNA within the field of adipose tissue-related and metabolic diseases. Referred to internally at metaShape as “MS 001”, the compound is being developed as an orally administered, first-in-class co-therapy to GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, aimed at improving the selectivity of adipose tissue reduction and the durability of weight loss.

 In metaShape-led preclinical studies, MS 001 was shown to increase inosine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, supporting enhanced mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure in adipose tissue, and broader metabolic efficiency. Consistent with these effects, treatment with MS 001 in mice maintained on a highly obesogenic diet was associated with improved weight loss outcomes and attenuated weight regain following GLP-1 withdrawal.

 Following Helix’s acquisition of Laevoroc Immunology AG’s assets and related rights in November 2024, as amended, Helix became the successor licensor under the Agreement.i In accordance with previously agreed terms, the parties have extended the option period through December 31, 2028, providing additional runway to advance research activities and support the progression of the program toward clinical-stage development. For Helix, the extension preserves long-term optionality in high-value metabolic indications, while maintaining a clear strategic focus on unlocking the potential of its oncology assets in hard-to-treat cancers.

 “The extension of this agreement aligns with a period of meaningful progress for metaShape,” said Randall Riggs, MBA, CEO of metaShape. “We are excited about the developments underway around MS 001 and look forward to sharing more as the program continues to advance.”

 “From Helix’s perspective, the decision to extend this agreement is grounded in the quality of the emerging preclinical data around MS 001, particularly its effects on NAD⁺ biology and the reprogramming of fat metabolism,” said Thomas Mehrling, MD, PhD, CEO of Helix BioPharma. “We are excited by the potential of this compound to benefit patients across distinct disease settings, with dosing and development approaches designed to reflect the unique needs of each indication. This program also reinforces the breadth of Helix’s science and its ability to generate value beyond oncology.”

 About MetaShape Pharma

 MetaShape Pharma is a privately owned biopharmaceutical company founded in 2023 on a bold premise: metabolic dysfunction is a solvable problem, if we treat it at its root.
