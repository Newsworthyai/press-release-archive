* Company receives EUR 20 million of new capital and significantly reduces debt
* Sustainable financing structure creates basis to implement targeted strategic measures to consistently drive LR’s success story

 AHLEN, GERMANY - February 11, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - LR Health & Beauty SE, Europe’s leading social commerce company for high-quality nutritional supplements and beauty products, has today taken an important step to realign its financing structure. An agreement was reached with significant investors in the Company concerning a comprehensive restructuring of its 2024/2028 Bond (ISIN: NO0013149658) (the “Bond”) and the Company’s capital structure. This agreement provides for an aggregate injection of fresh capital of EUR 20 million. At the same time, the Company's debt structure is being significantly reduced and restructured.

 Jorg Korfer, Chief Executive Officer of LR Health & Beauty SE, comments: “With this agreement on a realignment of our financing structure, we have reached an important milestone to reposition the LR Group to make it viable for the future. On the basis of a solid financing structure, we aim to initiate targeted strategic measures to now bring the LR Group onto a successful trajectory. The consistent digitalisation of our business processes, a focused further development of our product portfolio and our expansion into new markets are to play a central role in this context. Furthermore, our strong partner community represents an important foundation for the future success of our Company. Following the successful start-of-year events and the launch of an innovative new product under the LR Body Mission brand, we aim to create additional incentives for our partners' activities in the course of the year with promising product innovations.”
