 Dual-Path Strategy Targets Neuroinflammation While Expanding Nugevia™ Longevity Brand

 NEW YORK, NY - February 12, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - B2i Digital, Inc., a capital markets positioning and investor connectivity platform focused on growth-stage public companies, today announced that Jupiter Neurosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS) has been selected as a B2i Digital Featured Company.

 Jupiter Neurosciences is advancing a therapeutic pipeline targeting neuroinflammation and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, led by an FDA-cleared Phase IIa clinical trial in Parkinson’s disease. The company is also exploring additional indications including Alzheimer’s disease, Friedreich’s Ataxia, Mucopolysaccharidoses Type I, and MELAS, supported by research collaborations with Harvard University, Georgetown University, MIT’s Picower Institute, and the University of Miami.

 “Jupiter Neurosciences offers investors a differentiated opportunity within the CNS sector,” said David Shapiro, Chief Executive Officer of B2i Digital. “With a Phase IIa Parkinson’s trial underway and a consumer longevity platform already in market, the company is advancing its pipeline while building potential revenue streams. We look forward to expanding their visibility across our investor network.”
