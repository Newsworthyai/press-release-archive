# Pride Holdings Group Reports Record Fourth Quarter Results, Exceeding $4 Million in Revenue and Delivering 289% Quarter Over Quarter Growth

ORLANDO, FL - February 12, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Pride Holdings Group (OTC: PHSE), a diversified LGBTQ+ focused hospitality, entertainment, and community-driven holding company, today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2025, reporting over $4 million in revenue, representing a 289% increase compared to third quarter revenues.

 The Company’s strong fourth quarter performance reflects continued execution on its growth strategy, including the expansion of owned and operated venues, improved operational efficiencies, and increased brand visibility across its portfolio.

 Fourth Quarter 2025 Highlights:

 * Revenue exceeded $4.0 million
* 289% growth compared to Q3 2025 revenues
* Strong performance across hospitality, nightlife, and events divisions
* Momentum driven by acquisitions, seasonal demand, and operational scale

 “We continue to grow Pride, and I'm delighted with such growth in the 4th quarter of 2025. We have more big news and growth in quarter 1 and 2 of 2026, as we continue to roll up and growth of the LGBTQ+ markets. I am extremely confident in our business model, staff, customer base, and shareholders that we have an extraordinary 2026. We are driven to both increase revenues, increase profitability, offer a great experience for our customers, and of course add value to our shareholders and staff alike,” said Mike Barrett, CEO of Pride Holdings Group.

 Management attributes the quarter-over-quarter growth to increased same-venue performance, successful integration of recent acquisitions, and heightened consumer demand during the peak fourth quarter period. The Company expects these trends to continue as it scales operations and evaluates additional strategic opportunities.

 Pride Holdings Group expects to release full year financials and additional operational updates in the coming weeks.
