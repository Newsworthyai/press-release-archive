The Evaluation was Based on Specific Criteria That Analyzed the Company’s Overall Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute

 SAN FRANCISCO and MUMBAI - February 11, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CleverTap, the all-in-one customer engagement platform, today announced that they have been positioned by Gartner® as a Leader in their 2026 Magic Quadrant™ for Personalization Engines.

 We believe this recognition underscores the progress we are making alongside our customers, a growing ecosystem of forward-looking brands and partners dedicated to delivering relevant, responsible, and effective personalization.

 Our approach to hyper-personalization, individualized to each customer, is built around agentic AI capabilities from CleverAI™ designed to deliver "Experience of One” through 1:1 engagement at scale. We believe the CleverAI™ Decisioning Engine plays a central role in interpreting customer intent, enabling brands to connect customers with the right message, on the right channel, at the right moment. Combined with a comprehensive suite of personalization capabilities, we believe these capabilities are helping brands drive measurable outcomes, including up to 35% higher conversion rates across key use cases in industries like financial services, retail, ecommerce, media, telecom, and many others.

 At the core of this approach is CleverAI™, our enterprise-grade agentic intelligence and decisioning engine. Designed for autonomous real-time orchestration, it enables continuous experience optimization across the customer lifecycle. We believe this focus on unified intelligence, real-time decisioning, and scalable hyper-personalization has contributed to our broader market momentum.
