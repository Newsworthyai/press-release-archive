# Sprott Executive Explains Why The Precious Metal Run Will Continue In 2026

DETROIT, MICHIGAN - January 5, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sprott Inc. (NYSE: SII) is ending 2025 on a high note, with assets under management reaching an all-time high. While it’s hard to pinpoint one reason, Steven Schoffstall, Director ETF Product Management, said all of the metals Sprott follows performed well, plus there was a lot of new investor interest in its precious metals, critical materials and mining company ETFs.

 “A lot of times it's that geopolitical uncertainty, economic uncertainty," Schoffstall told Benzinga in an interview. “We’re seeing trade wars and threats of tariffs. All of that bodes well for precious metals traditionally.”

 As for the outlook for 2026, Schoffstall pointed to silver as one metal that should have a good run given it’s both a precious metal and industrial metal, with almost 60% of it used in industrial applications including artificial intelligence and semiconductors. “A lot of what we saw in 2025 is likely to carry through into 2026,” said Schoffstall of precious metals.
