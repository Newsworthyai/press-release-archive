# Aperam Marks New Chapter as Sud Sivaji Commences as Chief Executive Officer

LUXEMBOURG - January 5, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Aperam, a global player in stainless, electrical, and specialty steels, as well as recycling and renewables, today announced that Sud Sivaji has officially assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective 1 January 2026. This milestone completes the leadership succession plan initiated in September 2025 following the retirement of Tim di Maulo at the end of 2025.

 Mr. Sivaji, who previously served as Aperam’s Chief Financial Officer, brings 25 years of engineering, supply chain, and financial expertise to the role. His industrial experience spans the steel, stainless, and aerospace sectors, providing a strong foundation to lead Aperam’s next phase of growth.

 Commenting on his appointment, Sud Sivaji, CEO of Aperam, said:

 “Our ambition to establish Aperam as the leading value creator in the circular economy of infinite, world-changing materials is at the heart of our transformation. Beyond producing steel, we are creating value across supply chains: from stainless, electrical steel, aerospace and specialty alloys to recycling, charcoal, and forestry. These are the materials that will power our planet’s future.

 Our success begins with our 13,000 people across the world. Their knowledge of materials, their ability to innovate and their determination to move fast, together - is the foundation of my confidence in our global team. What truly sets us apart is our uniquely integrated value chain, where our businesses succeed because they work together as one Aperam.

 For our customers and communities, my commitment is clear: to create value responsibly, to be a trusted partner and a good neighbour, and to continuously improve the world we serve, every day.”

 The broader Leadership Team supporting Mr. Sivaji has been in place since 1 October 2025. With this leadership structure now fully operational, Aperam is uniquely positioned to execute its long-term strategy and drive innovation in the materials space.
