# GeoVax Announces 1-for-25 Reverse Stock Split to Regain Compliance With Nasdaq Minimum Bid Requirement

ATLANTA, GA - January 8, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, today announced that the Company's Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), at a ratio of 1-for-25. The Company is effecting the reverse stock split to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The reverse stock split was approved by the Company's stockholders at a meeting held November 26, 2025.

 The reverse stock split will become effective on January 9, 2026 (the "Effective Date"), and the Common Stock is expected to begin trading on the split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange ("Nasdaq") at the market open on January 12, 2026. Following the reverse stock split, the Common Stock will continue to trade under the symbol “GOVX”.

 On the Effective Date, every 25 issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock will be converted automatically into one share of the Company's Common Stock without any change in the par value per share. The total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock will therefore be reduced proportionately from 43,303,682 shares to approximately 1,732,148 shares.

 Immediately after the reverse stock split, each stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power will remain unchanged, except for minor changes and adjustments that will result from the rounding up of any fractional shares to the next whole number of shares. The rights and privileges of the holders of shares of Common Stock will be substantially unaffected by the reverse stock split.
