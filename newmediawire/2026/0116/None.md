EDMONTON, ALBERTA - January 16, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Yorkton Equity Group Inc. (TSXV:YEG) (“Yorkton” or the “Company”) is very pleased to announce the successful closing of the acquisition of “The Crystallina”, a one hundred and eighty-four (184) unit multi-family residential complex in Edmonton constructed in 2016 and comprising of three condominium quality buildings and a free standing amenity building with a fitness centre, social room and leasing office, situated on approximately 3.81 acres of land overlooking the scenic Crystallina Lake, located in the desirable Crystallina Nera East neighborhood at 17904, 17908, 17912 and 17916 - 78 Street NW, Edmonton, Alberta (the “Property”).

 This acquisition, previously announced on October 24, 2025, was successfully completed on January 15, 2026, for a purchase price of $46.0 million and has been funded by a combination of the Company’s cash for the down payment and a Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (“CMHC”) insured mortgage of approximately $44.3 million, inclusive of financing costs, that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.692% for a 5-year term and is amortized over fifty (50) years. The Company paid a fee of 0.50% of the committed loan amount to a licensed mortgage broker for services in arranging the mortgage financing upon closing of the loan.

 The Property was appraised at $46.75 million with a projected total annual revenue of approximately $3.6 million and a projected total annual Net Operating Income (“NOI”) of approximately $2.2 million, as well as a capitalization rate of approximately 4.9%. The Property currently has an occupancy rate of 98.4%. Yorkton believes that there will be a strong potential to grow the NOI in the coming years.

 “Yorkton is pleased to complete the acquisition of The Crystallina, adding another high-quality, condominium-grade rental property to our Edmonton portfolio,” says Ben Lui, President and CEO of Yorkton. “This follows our purchases of The Dwell (188 units) and The Fuse (125 units) and further increases our portfolio of high-quality, condominium-grade rental properties in Edmonton, Alberta. The city’s growing population, healthy economy, and affordable housing market make it an ideal location for expanding our portfolio.
