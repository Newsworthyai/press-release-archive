 NEW YORK, NY - January 12, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - B2i Digital, Inc. has been selected as the Marketing Partner for the 38th Annual ROTH Conference, hosted by ROTH Capital Partners. The invitation-only conference will be held March 22–24, 2026, at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in Dana Point, California, and is expected to convene executive teams from approximately 500 public and private growth companies alongside institutional investors and other capital markets participants.

 The 38th Annual ROTH Conference combines one-on-one and small-group meetings with company presentations, analyst-selected fireside chats, industry keynotes and panels. The three-day program begins Sunday with athletic charity events supporting the Challenged Athletes Foundation, followed by two full days of meetings and presentations. This year’s agenda also features ROTH Consumer Private Company Day and the inaugural Engineering & Consulting Day. Attendees will have access to networking and entertainment throughout the program, with meetings and events held against the backdrop of the Southern California coastline at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel.

 “B2i Digital is the Capital Markets Matchmaker, connecting companies with investors through digital marketing, investor conferences, and direct introductions to institutional and active growth-oriented investors,” said David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital. “ROTH’s annual conference is a cornerstone of the small-cap calendar. By combining ROTH’s in-person meetings with our audience of more than 1.4 million market participants, curated outreach, and targeted investor introductions, we help issuers extend the reach of their story and convert marketing into real meetings.”

 As Marketing Partner, B2i Digital will deploy its Featured Conference program and proprietary distribution infrastructure to support participating companies leading into the event and throughout the conference cycle. This includes high-visibility digital placement, targeted investor outreach, conference-specific company profiles, and post-event follow-up designed to sustain engagement beyond Dana Point.

 B2i Digital’s approach focuses on creating a direct path from Marketing to Meetings™, aligning digital campaigns and investor introductions with in-person conference access to support more productive discussions on-site and ongoing dialogue after the event concludes.
