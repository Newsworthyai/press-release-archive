LOS ANGELES, CA - January 12, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT) highlighted the strategic importance of its New York and Philadelphia edge network deployment with Available Infrastructure SanQtum AI platform, a GPU-powered, zero-trust edge infrastructure featuring national security-grade cybersecurity that enables instant data monetization.
