# TV Depictions Of Hands-Only CPR Are Often Misleading

Research Highlights:

 * Scripted TV programs in the U.S. often inaccurately portray who is most likely to need CPR and where out-of-hospital cardiac arrests happen, according to an analysis of more than 160 TV episodes aired since 2008.
* TV programs tend to focus on white people or men receiving CPR, which mirrors real-life disparities where women and Black and Latino adults are less likely than white people to receive CPR from a lay rescuer.
* The analysis examined TV depictions of out-of-hospital CPR as a potential reason why there is a low prevalence of Hands-Only CPR performed outside of hospitals, particularly for Black adults, Latino adults and women.

 DALLAS, TX - January 12, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - TV depictions of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may mislead viewers about who is most likely to need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and where it’s needed, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association’s peer-reviewed scientific journal Circulation: Population Health and Outcomes.

 As of January 1, 2026, the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes has been renamed Circulation: Population Health and Outcomes.

 According to the American Heart Association, each year, more than 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the U.S. When a person has a cardiac arrest, receiving CPR immediately from someone nearby can double or triple survival rates. However, only about 40% of people experiencing a cardiac arrest outside a hospital receive the immediate help they need, and those rates are even lower among Black and Latino adults and women.

 “We know that TV depictions of health topics can influence viewers,” said senior author Beth L. Hoffman, Ph.D., M.P.H., an assistant professor in the department of behavioral and community health sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health in Pittsburgh. “We’ve also seen news stories about people saving lives because of the CPR they learned from watching it on screen. Considering the sheer number of people who watch TV, it’s important to think of how to leverage this to improve the likelihood that people will perform CPR and save lives.”

 In this study, researchers reviewed 169 American scripted TV episodes depicting CPR that aired after 2008 - the year the American Heart Association endorsed Hands-Only CPR to encourage more people to act quickly to save the life of a teen or adult they see collapse from a cardiac arrest. The shows were mostly dramas, such as Breaking Bad, Yellowstone or 9-1-1, and also included two episodes of the adult, animated sitcom Archer.

 Hands-Only CPR uses chest compressions only rather than the combination of breaths and compressions. It has been shown to be just as effective as conventional CPR in quickly getting oxygen to the body’s vital organs, especially in the critical first few minutes after cardiac arrest in teens and adults.

 The analysis found:

 * Less than 30% (29.6%) of the 169 TV episodes accurately portrayed Hands-Only CPR: calling 911 and beginning chest compressions.
* More than half of the people who received Hands-Only CPR on TV were younger than 40 years old; in contrast, real-life recipients needing CPR are typically older (average age of 62 years).
* In reality, more than 80% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur at home vs. about 20% on screen. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests portrayed on TV were more likely to happen in remote areas (37%) or in public spaces (26%).
* Depictions of CPR in the TV episodes reviewed commonly featured males and white adults as both recipients and providers of Hands-Only CPR.

 “It was interesting that what we saw on screen mirrored real-life disparities in CPR receipt,” said Ore Fawole, B.S., B.A., a recent graduate of The University of Pittsburgh and first author on the research letter. “It could be that what is on TV is a reflection of real-life, or that what people are watching on TV reinforces implicit biases or stereotypes that contribute to lower rates of CPR receipt for women, Black adults and Latino adults. We hope that this research paves the way for accurate TV depictions of CPR that can help close the gaps on these disparities for all people to receive CPR and ultimately save more lives.”

 The good news is that 58% of those who experienced a fictional out-of-hospital cardiac arrest received CPR, which is greater than the real-world likelihood of about 40%.

 “Wouldn’t it be great if seeing CPR being used to save a life on TV motivated more people to act quickly if they witness an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?” said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association. “Hands-Only CPR is a simple two-step process - call 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest. Because no special training or equipment is needed, anyone can provide this lifesaving measure, even young children. That’s especially important because most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the home, so knowing CPR may help you save the life of someone you love.”

 The Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ initiative is committed to turning a nation of lay rescuers into lifesavers with a goal of doubling cardiac arrest survival rates by 2030. The long-term goal: to ensure that in the face of a cardiac emergency, anyone, anywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival. Join the Nation of Lifesavers by learning CPR.
