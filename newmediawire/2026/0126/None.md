# Critical Infrastructure Technologies and AIRmarket Inc. Execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

VANCOUVER, BC - January 26, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms and AIRmarket Inc. (AIRmarket) today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaboratively explore pilot, and potentially commercialise solutions supporting drone-enabled airspace, remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) traffic management (RTM), and related digital and infrastructure services.

 The MOU establishes a non-binding framework for cooperation between the two companies, with a focus on bi-national (Australia–Canada), defence-inclusive government and emergency services use cases.

 Under the MOU, CiTech and AIRmarket will work together to assess opportunities that enhance the safe, sovereign, and compliant integration of drones into national airspace, supporting defence, public safety, and critical infrastructure operations.

 Strategic Collaboration

 The collaboration brings together complementary capabilities:

 - AIRmarket contributes expertise in RPAS traffic management, airspace utilities, aviation safety, and regulatory engagement.

 - CiTech contributes secure digital platforms, systems integration, data and AI capabilities, and the manufacture of autonomous communications infrastructure required to operationalise drones in regulated environments.

 Together, the parties aim to improve situational awareness, operational efficiency, and response capability for defence forces, emergency services, and government agencies.

 Focus Areas

 The collaboration will include:

 - Defence and border security operations

 - Drone as First Responder (DFR) programs

 - Wildfire, search and rescue, and disaster response

 - Critical infrastructure protection across energy, transport, and utilities

 - Technical integration of RTM platforms with secure communications infrastructure

 - Government-led pilots, trials, and regulatory engagement

 Governance and Next Steps

 The MOU provides for the appointment of points of contact and the potential establishment of a joint working group to guide collaboration activities. Any pilots, deployments, or commercial arrangements will be governed by separate definitive agreements and will be subject to applicable regulatory, security, and export control requirements.

 “This MOU provides a structured foundation for CiTech and AIRmarket to explore how our combined capabilities can support government and defence stakeholders,” said Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech. “It reflects a shared commitment to safety, sovereignty, and the practical deployment of drone-enabled infrastructure.”

 Lindsay Mohr, CEO of AIRmarket, added, “AIRmarket enables the airspace – monitoring it and helping drones operate safely. CiTech enables the remote operations with autonomous infrastructure that brings communications and surveillance in hard-to-reach areas. Together, this MOU builds a dual-use foundation for critical infrastructure, from mines and industrial plants to borders and wildfire response. This aligns Canada’s national interest and the growing investment in resilience, sovereignty, and public safety”.
