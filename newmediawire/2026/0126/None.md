GLENDALE, CA - January 25, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Martial Arts History Museum became the epicenter of Hollywood and combat sports excellence last night as Museum President Michael Matsuda hosted a star-studded gala to celebrate the legendary Benny “The Jet” Urquidez.

 Duff McKagan of "Guns N Roses" The red carpet saw an extraordinary gathering of A-list icons, highlighting the profound impact Urquidez has had on the entertainment industry over the last several decades. Among the notable attendees were Keanu Reeves, Academy Award® winner Marisa Tomei, and legendary rock star Duff McKagan of Guns N’ Roses. The crowd also included action veteran Danny Trejo, UFC champion Bas Rutten, Tiger Chan and Shannon Lee, daughter of the late Bruce Lee, along with many other high-profile figures from the film and martial arts worlds.

 Urquidez’s connection to these stars runs deep. For decades, he has served as both a teacher and fight choreographer for many of the biggest names in cinema. In addition to his work behind the scenes, he has performed in some of the most famous martial arts sequences in film history, famously trading blows with stars such as John Cusack and Jackie Chan.

 The festivities began with an intimate VIP unveiling of the new exhibit presented by Michael Matsuda, president of the Martial Arts History Museum. Following the reveal, guests moved to the museum theater for a poignant presentation featuring speeches from Duff McKagan and Shannon Lee. A standout moment of the night was a special congratulatory message sent from overseas by Jackie Chan, who honored his longtime friend and former screen rival.

 “It was a monumental evening as we not only honored one of our greatest pioneers but also raised vital awareness for the museum’s mission,” said Matsuda.

 A Legacy of Dominance and Integrity

 Benny “The Jet” Urquidez remains the most dominant figure in the history of American kickboxing. Rising to prominence in the 1970s, he maintained a staggering professional record of over 60 undefeated fights with 57 knockouts. Known for his immense integrity, Urquidez famously refused to be called a world champion until he had traveled the globe to defeat the greatest competitors in their home countries - a feat he successfully achieved throughout his career.

 His storied journey in the ring spanned three decades, culminating at the age of 42 when he defeated Japanese champion Yoshihisa Tagami for the WKA Super Welterweight world title. Today, Urquidez stands as the foremost advocate for the arts and has been officially inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum’s Hall of Fame, the only officially recognized hall of fame for martial arts worldwide.For more information about the Martial Arts History Museum or to make a donation, visit their site at MAmuseum.com.
