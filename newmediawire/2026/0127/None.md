 BEVERLY HILLS, CA - January 27, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Announced today, Dr. Nicole Dolan, psychologist and recognized expert in trauma-informed, integrative mental health, signs with CMP Agent Alan Morell for her book THE ART OF CHAOS, as well as her commercial rights monetized revenue streams. These include literary works, including a sequel to THE ART OF CHAOS, broadcast, adaptation of her book to a docuseries, speaking engagements, endorsements, advisory roles with online courses, and licensing of her Sacred Path Holistic Therapy model to wellness centers.

 ABOUT DR. NICOLE DOLAN:

 Dr. Nicole Dolan is a depth psychologist whose work explores how life’s disruptions, including trauma, identity loss, motherhood, neurodivergence, and major life transitions, serve as catalysts for deeper psychological integration and healing. Working at the intersection of trauma studies, nervous system science, and depth psychology, she approaches symptoms not as isolated pathology, but as meaningful signals pointing toward unmet needs, unresolved grief, and disowned or exiled aspects of the self seeking reintegration into wholeness.

 Through her clinical practice, teaching, and writing, Dr. Dolan develops frameworks that help individuals and families move beyond survival toward greater coherence, capacity, and self-understanding. Her work emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the nervous system before engaging deeper psychological inquiry, allowing insight, meaning, and lasting change to emerge over time.

 Dr. Dolan is the founder of Sacred Path Holistic Therapy, a multi-state nonprofit collective of more than 30 clinicians providing integrative, trauma-informed psychotherapy and clinical supervision. Through Sacred Path, she has developed and implemented models of care that translate depth psychology into practical, scalable systems supporting both clients and clinicians within contemporary mental health settings.

 Dr. Dolan holds a PhD in Depth Psychology and a Master’s degree in Counseling Psychology. She maintains clinical practices in Northern and Southern CA, provides professional training and direction, and is the author of the forthcoming memoir THE ART OF CHAOS.

 Said Author Dr. Nicole Dolan:“I am very excited about signing with CMP and Agent Alan Morell for my book and career commercial rights across CMP platforms. THE ART OF CHAOS is deeply meaningful to me because it is rooted in lived experience, both personal and clinical, and explores how experiences we are often taught to minimize or pathologize can instead serve as pathways into truth, meaning, and wholeness. The book reframes chaos not as something to fix or escape, but as an intelligent signal that invites deeper listening at the level of the nervous system, the psyche, and the soul. Whether the experience is trauma, loss, or raising a neurodivergent child, chaos becomes a universal pathway to the self and a guide for growth that is relevant across cultures and around the world.

 "Sacred Path Holistic Therapy represents the applied expression of this work in the world. Through Sacred Path, I have translated these principles into practical, scalable models of care that integrate mind, body, and soul while maintaining clinical rigor, accessibility, and depth.”

 Said Agent Alan Morell:“I am honored to represent Dr. Nicole Dolan. At CMP we represent over 200 Doctors in our 700+ roster across Ent.
