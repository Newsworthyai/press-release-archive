# UNLOCKD Inc. (OTCID: BFCH) Closes Equity Financing and Enters Commercial Execution Phase; Prepares for Regulation A Offering

LANCASTER, PA - February 17, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTCID: BFCH), doing business as UNLOCKD Inc., today announced the completion of its previously authorized fixed-price equity financing and the formal transition of the Company into its commercial execution phase under the UNLOCKD platform strategy.

 The financing, structured as a clean equity-only raise, provides growth capital to activate brand execution initiatives, finalize infrastructure, and prepare for a future Regulation A offering.

 Equity Financing Closed - Fixed Price, No Convertibles

 The Company confirmed the completion and closing of its $175,000 authorized equity seed round, with aggregate gross proceeds of $173,259 issued exclusively as restricted common stock at $0.0008 per share pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of the Securities Act.

 No convertible notes, variable-rate instruments, SAFEs, warrants, or derivative securities were issued in connection with the offering.

 Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated:

 "As promised, this was a fixed-price, equity-only round. No new debt. No convertible overhang. We raised efficiently and within our authorized limits to fund the next stage of execution.

 "The lead equity investor in this round is highly aligned with the Company’s long-term direction and has expressed strong conviction in our strategic roadmap. We believe this investor will be an important supporter as we advance our global brand collaboration and broader commercialization initiatives.”

 Management views the clean structure of the raise as consistent with the Company’s post-transition commitment to disciplined capital formation and long-term shareholder alignment.

 Commercial Execution Phase Activated

 With initial capital secured, UNLOCKD is entering its commercial execution phase under its previously disclosed global brand partnership framework within the wellness and functional-beverage sector.

 The collaboration under discussion involves a globally recognized fashion and lifestyle brand exploring the launch of an official beauty-from-within functional beverage for the North American market.

 Management believes the opportunity is differentiated by favorable category dynamics, established brand leverage, and contemplated North American commercialization rights; a structure designed to support scalable, recurring revenue rather than a limited product release.

 The brand partner brings established marketing and media infrastructure across print, digital, and social platforms, accelerating demand generation without requiring UNLOCKD to build consumer awareness from inception.

 Initial execution activities are underway, including formulation work related to the planned beauty-from-within beverage line.

 Following the disciplined completion of its equity financing and prior structural objectives, the Company expects to announce binding documentation as the partnership framework is finalized. Management anticipates a structured cadence of news flow as execution milestones are achieved.

 EVERMIND Platform Positioning

 In parallel, the Company continues commercialization planning for EVERMIND™, its wholly owned cognitive wellness platform acquired effective December 31, 2025.

 While current execution focus is centered on the global brand collaboration framework, EVERMIND remains a foundational operating asset within the UNLOCKD ecosystem and provides internal formulation expertise, category insight, and long-term platform optionality.

 Use of Proceeds

 Proceeds from the equity financing are being allocated toward:

 * Initial execution activities contemplated under the Company’s previously disclosed global brand partnership framework, including formulation work related to the planned “beauty-from-within” beverage
* Legal, accounting, and infrastructure preparation for a future Regulation A offering
* Finalization of UNLOCKD’s corporate website, pitch deck, and updated investor materials
* Commercialization planning and operational readiness

 The Company believes this disciplined deployment of capital positions UNLOCKD to transition from early-stage activation into scalable growth.

 Regulation A Capital Formation Strategy

 Management is preparing for a future Regulation A offering intended to expand investor participation and provide growth capital at a higher valuation tier once the Company’s commercial structure and brand partnership framework are fully activated.

 Balencic concluded:

 “Since July, our focus has been structural and sequential - eliminate legacy debt, stabilize the balance sheet, secure operating assets, close clean equity financing, and activate execution. With this round complete, we are now in build mode. The foundation is in place, and we believe the next stage of growth will be driven by disciplined commercialization and scalable capital formation.”
