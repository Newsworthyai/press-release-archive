# Ethema Health Corporation Partners With B2i Digital as Featured Company to Expand Investor Awareness

Partnership Will Showcase Ethema's Growing Network of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities Across Florida and Kentucky

 NEW YORK, NY - February 17, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - B2i Digital, Inc. is pleased to announce that Ethema Health Corporation (OTC: GRST) has been named a B2i Digital Featured Company. Ethema Health Corporation is a behavioral healthcare company based in West Palm Beach, Florida, that operates in-patient treatment facilities for substance use disorders across Florida and Kentucky. The company has built its model around developing centers of excellence in addiction treatment for adults.

 “We look forward to helping Ethema Health expand its investor awareness through our digital marketing platform and targeted outreach campaigns,” said David Shapiro, Chief Executive Officer of B2i Digital. “The substance use disorder treatment space has strong secular demand drivers, and Ethema’s multi-state operating footprint gives the company room to grow revenue by increasing occupancy across its existing facilities while selectively adding capacity.”

 Ethema’s footprint expanded in January 2025 with the acquisition of ARIA Kentucky, adding residential treatment capacity across multiple locations in the state. Combined with its existing Florida operations, including a West Palm Beach facility and a newer Boca Raton location acquired in May 2024, the company now has approximately 400 operationally available beds with a current patient census of approximately 325. The Florida facilities have been operating at near capacity, and the Kentucky operations have been steadily increasing patient census since the acquisition closed.

 “Our priority is delivering quality care while growing our operations in Florida and Kentucky,” said Shawn Leon, President and CEO of Ethema Health Corporation. “Partnering with B2i Digital allows us to reach a broader audience of investors who are following the behavioral health sector as we continue to scale our business.”

 Total revenue for 2025 is expected to be reported as $19.5 million, an increase of 225% over 2024. The company expects continued revenue growth as it brings additional dormant facilities online and increases occupancy across the platform.
