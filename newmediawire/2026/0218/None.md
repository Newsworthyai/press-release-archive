# The Match Stick Flame 3 to Debut at Martial Arts Museum

LOS ANGELES, CA - February 18, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Martial Arts History Museum will be hosting a Movie Premiere for The Match-Stick Flame 3: Red Mafia on Saturday March 7, 2026 from 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm (Red Carpet) and 4:15 pm to 5:30 pm (Movie Screening) located at 201 N Brand Blvd B100 Glendale, CA 91203.

 The Match-Stick Flame 3: Red Mafia is about Detective Dalton (Craig Bruss), now a Bounty Hunter, who is finishing his assignment given by DEA Agent Prasad (Vineeta Prasad), to take down the remaining Lunada Bay gang members in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Dalton is a Navy Seal veteran with PTSD who is seeking alternative medicine strategies with karate Sensei Darryl Vidal as well as traditional therapy. However, Dalton has to hunt down the Russian Mob called “Red Mafia” to save Agent Prasad, who was taken. Dalton reconnects with Chief Higgins, the Match Stick Mobsters, and Jake in order to rescue Agent Prasad.

 "The film screening of The Match-Stick Flame 3: Red Mafia, seems like a natural fit since it is an action film with mixed martial arts featuring highly experienced actors/martial artists such as Darryl Vidal, known for the “crane kick” in The Karate Kid and playing a referee in Cobra Kai Season 6 ", stated Michael Matsuda, Museum Director. "We are excited to offer this special event for all who want to come to Glendale."

 Please buy tickets at the door (credit cards accepted): $12 for adults, $5 for kids (age 17 and under). Martial Arts History Museum is located at the corner of Brand and Wilson, next to Muay Thai School. Parking: Use the 4-story tower at 222 N. Orange Street ( the first 90 minutes are free).

 The Match-Stick Flame 3: Red Mafia will be on streaming services such as Tubi, Amazon, and YouTube very soon.
