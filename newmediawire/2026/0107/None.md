# New dietary guidelines underscore importance of healthy eating

WASHINGTON, DC - January 7, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The American Heart Association, devoted to a world of healthier lives for all, issued the following statement in response to today’s release of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

 “The American Heart Association welcomes the new dietary guidelines and commends the inclusion of several important science-based recommendations, notably the emphasis on increasing intake of vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting consumption of added sugars, refined grains, highly processed foods, saturated fats and sugary drinks. These elements align closely with the longstanding dietary guidance of the American Heart Association and other public health authorities.

 “We see an important opportunity to educate consumers about the scientific basis for certain recommendations. For example, we are concerned that recommendations regarding salt seasoning and red meat consumption could inadvertently lead consumers to exceed recommended limits for sodium and saturated fats, which are primary drivers of cardiovascular disease. While the guidelines highlight whole-fat dairy, the Heart Association encourages consumption of low-fat and fat-free dairy products, which can be beneficial to heart health.

 “For decades, the Heart Association has issued science-based recommendations for healthy eating. We remain committed to working with the administration to reduce the burden of chronic disease, particularly for the next generation, and to help consumers make healthier choices for themselves and their families. This includes promoting healthy dietary patterns that significantly reduce consumption of added sugars and sodium. Protein is an essential component of a healthy diet, and we urge more scientific research on both the appropriate amount of protein consumption and the best protein sources for optimal health. Pending that research, we encourage consumers to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.

 “The American Heart Association will continue to do our part. We have long advocated for policies to reduce sugary drink consumption in the face of fierce opposition from the soda industry – this remains a major Heart Association priority. We are committed to working with the administration to inform the development of an operational definition of ultraprocessed food, building upon the Association’s recent science advisory on ultraprocessed foods. We are prepared to work collaboratively with the administration on initiatives to improve our understanding of the critical role healthy food can play in preventing and managing chronic disease, including the Association’s Health Care by FoodTM and Periodic Table of FoodTM programs. And we remain steadfastly committed to informing the public about healthy eating. As part of our usual process, we will issue updated guidance later this year - an effort in support of the shared goal to provide a robust, science-first roadmap for a healthier America.”
