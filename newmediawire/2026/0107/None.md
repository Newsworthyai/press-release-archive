# Carolindica Expands THC Beverage Line With New Sodas and Seltzers

New THC-Infused Sodas and Seltzers Crafted With a Local North Carolina Brewery Offer Consumers an Alcohol-Free Way to Unwind and Socialize

 RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA - January 7, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Carolindica, a North Carolina-based hemp industry leader of high-quality hemp-derived wellness products, today announced the expansion of its beverage collection with High Tide, a new line of THC-infused Sodas and Seltzers. Crafted in partnership with a local Raleigh brewery, these new offerings bring a fresh, creative twist to the growing THC beverage market that’s quickly becoming a preferred alternative to alcohol for social occasions.

 The new line includes both carbonated Seltzers and THC Sodas, a richer, more nostalgic beverage experience that stands apart from typical cannabis drinks. Each product is carefully formulated to deliver a clean, balanced onset with precisely measured hemp-derived cannabinoids, providing consumers with a functional, social and enjoyable alternative to alcohol.

 “THC beverages are redefining the way people relax and connect,” said Chris Karazin, CEO and Founder of Carolindica. “Our new Sodas and Seltzers are designed for today’s consumer - someone who wants to unwind, enjoy flavor and feel good without the physical tax of dehydration and the headache of a hangover. Partnering with a prominent North Carolina-based brewery allows us to bring real craftsmanship to the beverage space, and we’re proud to deliver products that taste great and feel even better.”

 The expanded beverage lineup includes:

 * THC Seltzers - 10mg THC + 25mg CBD: Each blend features a crisp, light carbonation and natural fruit flavors for a smooth, uplifting experience. Flavors: Orange Cream, Rogue Berry Riot, and Lemon Lime
* THC Sodas: A richer, more nostalgic take on THC beverages, these sodas pair bold flavor with Carolindica’s signature precision dosing for a fun, balanced experience. Offering two dosages:   Max Strength Tall Boy THC Soda - 60mg Nano THC (50mg D9 + 10mg THCP). Flavor: Lemon Lime Soda “Limelight”    Strong and Sweet Sodas - 25mg THC. Flavors: Blackberry Lemon Lime "Berry Blitz", Strawberries & Cream "Blush Rush", and Lemon Lime "Limelight"

 Available now for nationwide shipping, Carolindica’s THC beverages are offered in a range of strengths and flavors, each produced in small batches to ensure purity, potency, and consistency. The seltzers offer a smooth, balanced flavor with low sugar content and effects that feel as light, bright, and refreshing as their taste, while the THC Soda delivers a bold, sweet finish reminiscent of classic favorites—perfect for sharing with friends or enjoying solo.

 “With most cannabis beverages leaning toward the seltzer category, our High Tide THC Soda gives consumers something truly different,” said Ellen Marion, Creative Director of Carolindica. “It’s nostalgic, fun and crafted with care. High Tide brings people together in a lighter, more intentional way.”

 The expansion arrives amid a nationwide surge in THC beverage popularity, as more consumers turn to cannabis-infused drinks as a modern, hangover-free alternative to alcohol.
