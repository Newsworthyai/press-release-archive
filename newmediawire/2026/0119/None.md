 ZURICH and FRANKFURT - January 19, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - naoo AG (Dusseldorf: Ticker: NAO; ISIN: CH1323306329), operator of the social media and commerce platform naoo, will participate in the ODDO BHF Small & Mid Cap Conference in Frankfurt on 26 January 2026.

 As part of the conference, the management of naoo AG will hold a series of one-on-one meetings with institutional investors, asset managers and family offices from the German-speaking region. Discussions will focus on the company’s revenue development in the 2026 financial year, a new app release, and - for the first time - a live demonstration of naoo business, the company’s new business platform, which is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2026.

 In addition to the continued expansion of its customer portfolio, naoo is extending its existing platform with an integrated solution for business customers and brands. This will, for the first time, provide companies with direct access to content placement, incentives, gamification mechanisms and location-based features within the naoo ecosystem.

 “The ODDO BHF Small & Mid Cap Conference provides us with an ideal platform to engage with long-term oriented investors about the next phase of naoo’s growth,” said Dr. Thomas Wolfensberger, Founder and Principal Shareholder of naoo AG. “With the upcoming app release and the launch of naoo business, we are laying important foundations in 2026 for continued revenue growth and deeper monetisation of the platform.”

 The ODDO BHF Small & Mid Cap Conference is one of Europe’s established investor conferences and brings together listed growth companies with institutional investors.
