# Trailbreaker Receives Drill Permit for Coho Property, Central BC

VANCOUVER, BC - January 19, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Trailbreaker Resources Ltd. (TBK.V) (“Trailbreaker” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the receipt of a property-wide exploration permit for its 8,000-hectare Coho property, located in central British Columbia (BC), Canada. The Coho property is a drill-ready copper-gold (Cu-Au) porphyry target situated 30 km west of the Mount Milligan mine.

 A 5-year Multi-Year Area-Based (MYAB) Mines Act permit has been approved by the BC Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals with a provisional expiry date of December 18th, 2030.

 Approved Exploration Activities

 * Diamond drilling, based from up to 50 drill pads
* Construction/modification of exploration access trails (up to 15 km)
* 20 line-km of ground geophysical surveys
* Construction of a temporary work camp

 Community Engagement

 The Coho property is located within the territory of the Takla First Nation, with whom Trailbreaker is committed to continued engagement and to building a working relationship. The Company is currently collaborating with the Takla First Nation on the future drill program.

 Daithi Mac Gearailt, CEO of Trailbreaker, commented: “We are thrilled to receive this permit in time for the 2026 exploration season, allowing us to conduct the inaugural drill program at the Coho zone. This is an exciting opportunity to explore an undrilled Cu-Au porphyry target in a prolific mineral district.”

 About the Coho Property (link to presentation)

 The 8,000-hectare Coho property (Figure 1) is located 90 km north of the Town of Fort St. James, BC. The claims were acquired by Trailbreaker through an option agreement signed in May, 2025 whereby Trailbreaker has the option to acquire a 100% interest (see May 26, 2025 news release). The priority target is the Coho zone, a drill-ready Cu-Au porphyry target with recently completed property-wide geochemical and geophysical surveys. The zone hosts a recently identified chargeability and resistivity anomaly, associated with high-grade gold and copper values from surface rock grab samples. While there has been limited historical drilling on the claims, the Coho zone, has never been drilled.

 Located within the Quesnel Tectonic Terrane, the Coho property is situated in a district known for prolific alkalic Cu-Au porphyry deposits and discoveries. The property is located 30 km west of Centerra Gold’s Mount Milligan Cu-Au porphyry deposit, a producing mine with current reserves of 1.2 B lbs Cu and 2.8 Moz Au(1). Pacific Empire Minerals’ (‘PEMC’) Trident property is contiguous with the Coho property’s western border. On December 15th, 2025, PEMC reported a drill intercept of 0.77% Cu, 0.51 g/t Au, and 3.4 g/t silver (Ag) over 183.0 m from the ‘A-zone’, located only 3.5 km west of the Coho property(2). To the north lies Pacific Ridge Resources’ Chuchi property, where 2024 drilling returned 382.0 m of 0.19% Cu, 0.12 g/t Au, and 0.47 g/t Ag(3) from the BP zone.

 Figure 1: Trailbreaker’s Coho property is located 30 km northwest of Centerra Gold’s Mt. Milligan Cu-Au porphyry deposit, and 3.5 km east of Pacific Empire Minerals’ Trident property, where recent drill results include 183.0 m of 0.77% Cu, 0.51 g/t Au, and 3.4 g/t Ag.

 The Coho zone is defined by a 650 x 550 m Cu-Au-Ag surface rock and soil geochemical anomaly within diorite, and spatially associated with an ENE-trending fault zone (the Coho fault) and gabbro dykes. Two additional faults, the Valley and Redline faults, extend south from the BP zone (Chuchi property) and converge with the Coho fault at the Coho zone. Historic surface grab samples at the Coho zone returned values up to 16.15 g/t Au, 16.35% Cu, and 67.3 g/t Ag.

 A recent (2022) airborne ZTEM (Z-axis Tipper electromagnetic) survey, followed by a 2023 ground-based induced polarization (IP) survey, identified an interpreted 400 m x 250 m x 200 m-deep porphyry intrusive complex (3D ZTEM anomaly) with a two-limbed IP chargeability high anomaly that spans more than 1.4 km.

 The Coho zone is located 4.5 km south of the BP zone (Chuchi property) and is currently interpreted to be situated along the same Valley/Redline fault structure that hosts the BP zone. Alkalic porphyry deposits commonly occur in clusters and Trailbreaker’s team believes the Coho property, in particular the Coho zone, may represent a Cu-Au porphyry system similar to the surrounding prospects and deposits. Trailbreaker has interpreted this system to be part of a cluster of deposits found along the margin of the Hogem batholith.
