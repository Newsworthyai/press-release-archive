# DeepVest Launches AdvisorLab to Accelerate Client Acquisition for Financial Advisors

New AI-powered Toolkit Transforms Prospect Statements Into Personalized Investment Proposals in Minutes

 SARASOTA, FL - January 28, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - DeepVest, the AI-powered investment platform for financial advisors, today launched AdvisorLab, a suite of prospecting tools that dramatically accelerates the client acquisition process by automating portfolio analysis and proposal generation.

 AdvisorLab enables advisors to upload prospect account statements and receive comprehensive portfolio diagnostics - including fee analysis, tax efficiency assessment, and risk exposure - within minutes. The platform then generates client-ready proposals that advisors can customize and present.

 "Prospecting has always been a time-intensive process that requires deep analysis of a prospect's existing holdings," said Toby Wade, CEO of DeepVest. "AdvisorLab eliminates the manual work while maintaining the analytical rigor advisors need to win new business. What used to take hours now takes minutes."

 The platform analyzes holdings across multiple accounts to identify:

 * Hidden fees and expense ratios
* Tax inefficiency and potential savings
* Portfolio concentration risks
* Asset allocation misalignment
* Cash drag and rebalancing opportunities

 Unlike generic portfolio analysis tools, AdvisorLab is purpose-built for prospecting workflows. The platform integrates with DeepVest's hallucination-free AI engine, which uses verified financial data rather than large language models to generate recommendations - a critical compliance consideration for RIAs.

 "Advisors waste countless hours manually combing through statements to build value propositions for prospects," said Dan Eyre, Chief Revenue Officer at DeepVest. "AdvisorLab turns that diagnostic process into a competitive advantage by giving advisors the insights they need immediately."

 AdvisorLab is available now as part of DeepVest's Advisor Premium subscription. Volume discounts are available for firms with multiple advisors.
