# "Father of the JOBS Act" Joins KoreInside as Advisory Team Member

KoreInside, The First Secure Online Infrastructure for Private Capital Markets to Manage All Capital Market Activities, Welcomes David Weild IV, former Vice Chairman of NASDAQ Stock Market

 NEW YORK, NY - February 13, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - KoreWire -- David Weild IV, widely recognized as the “Father of the JOBS Act” and former Vice Chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Market, has just been appointed as an Advisory Team Member of KoreInside.

 KoreInside provides the first secure, end-to-end infrastructure whose objective is to make private capital markets work better for all participants including, Broker-Dealers, Investment banks, RIAs, ATSs, Asset Managers, Transfer Agents, issuers, investors, IR and PR firms. Each will interoperate on a single, compliant blockchain infrastructure. From issuance and shareholder management to clearing, settlement, disbursement, distribution and “aftermarket support,” KoreInside will enable private market activity to function with the rigor and efficiency expected in public markets - without sacrificing regulatory compliance.

 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law on April 5, 2012, by President Obama, aims to boost U.S. small business growth and startup funding by easing SEC regulations, allowing equity crowdfunding, and reducing compliance burdens. The legislation facilitates capital formation by increasing the number of shareholders allowed in private companies and lowering reporting requirements for public companies with less than $1 billion in revenue.

 As private markets continue to grow, the lack of standardized infrastructure has become the critical roadblock for intermediaries. issuers and investors, alike.

 “Remove these roadblocks, and we increase the rate of company formation, job creation, innovation, and upward mobility. This in turn will help cure diseases, help shore up our national security, and help pay down our deficit,” said David Weild. “It's time to help private markets realize their full potential.”

 Weild’s appointment represents a transformative milestone for KoreInside, bringing one of the most influential voices in modern capital markets and capital formation into the company’s executive leadership.

 Joining KoreInside

 “With his deep expertise in new product development in capital markets, policy, regulatory advocacy, and growth-oriented market design, David’s leadership will accelerate KoreInside’s mission to eliminate friction from private capital markets, help drive the growth in these markets, and speed institutional blockchain adoption. This appointment not only strengthens KoreInside’s operational and strategic capacity but also elevates the company’s credibility and influence with regulators, investors, and global financial institutions,” said Oscar Jofre, Co-founder and CEO of KoreInside.

 Private capital markets are growing rapidly - but the infrastructure behind them remains fragmented. Issuers, broker-dealers, transfer agents, ATSs, RIAs, and funding platforms still operate across disconnected systems, creating compliance risk, operational friction, and investor confusion.

 KoreInside was built to solve the following:

 * Why have private capital markets lagged in infrastructure
* How compliance-first architecture is reshaping private market transactions
* What intermediaries need next as private markets mature.

 “David’s network will also bring KoreInside’s groundbreaking infrastructure as quickly as possible to all regulated intermediaries (Broker-Dealers, Funding Platforms, Transfer Agents) corporations that are most likely to benefit from the technology,” said Jofre.
