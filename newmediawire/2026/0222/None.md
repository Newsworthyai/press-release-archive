# Hong Kong Designer Labels Shine at London Fashion Week

Fashion Hong Kong Supports Local Fashion Brands in Going Global

 HONG KONG - February 22, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) returned to London Fashion Week this year with its Fashion Hong Kong runway show, presenting the Autumn/Winter 2026 collections of some of Hong Kong’s most innovative fashion labels. The event spotlighted the originality and creative excellence of Hong Kong fashion for the UK and global fashion communities, reinforcing the city’s standing as a key fashion design hub in Asia.

 Held on the evening of 19 February at The Vinyl Factory in Soho, London, the Fashion Hong Kong runway show drew more than 300 international buyers, media representatives and fashion professionals. The event was supported by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London.

 Four Hong Kong designers took part in the fashion show: Angus Tsui (brand name: ANGUS TSUI), Bettie Jiang (brand name: Bettie Haute Couture), Harrison Wong (brand name: HARRISON WONG) and Menu Tsai (brand name: selfFab.). Through a wide spectrum of design expressions - from avant-garde futurism and cultural fusion to zero-waste tailoring and sporty aesthetics - the designers highlighted the innovation, sustainability and global outlook of Hong Kong’s fashion industry.

 The runway show received overwhelming support from the UK fashion industry, with model Eva Apio, singer CC Clarke, renowned influencer Leo Mandella and celebrated stylist Karine Laudort among those in attendance. The event also attracted attention from leading international fashion media, including BBC News, DAZED, Forbes, Vogues Business and Wonderland. Beyond highlighting Hong Kong designers’ creativity and capabilities to a global audience, the show strengthened the exchange and collaboration between fashion industry players from Hong Kong and the UK and helped to elevate international awareness of Hong Kong fashion brands.

 Comprehensive support helps Hong Kong brands go global

 To further highlight the creative strength and sustainability ethos of Hong Kong fashion designers, a curated display of selected works from the four designers was presented at the runway show venue, complemented by creative pieces from “NEXT@Fashion InStyle”, an innovative initiative showcasing the latest products presented by material suppliers from around the world. This initiative is a key highlight of Fashion InStyle, a premier trade platform for the global fashion and garment industry held annually in Hong Kong in April. The showcased designs illustrate how innovation is sparked through designers’ creative use of new materials, exploring the intersection of technology, sustainability and artistry.

 In addition, the HKTDC has launched a professional designer showroom in London from 18 to 23 February, featuring the designers’ latest Autumn/Winter collections. The showroom provides a valuable platform for international buyers to engage directly with the brands and gain deeper insight into their design philosophies and production details. It also enables the designers to test market responses, build business connections and explore collaboration opportunities, thereby strengthening the international development and global reputation of Hong Kong fashion brands.

 Since its launch in 2015, Fashion Hong Kong has taken Hong Kong designers to major fashion weeks including New York, London and Tokyo, showcasing the creativity and vibrancy of Hong Kong fashion on the global stage. The return to London Fashion Week in 2026 once again underscores the strong international potential of Hong Kong design.

 With over 50 offices globally, the HKTDC will continue to connect Hong Kong’s design talent with the global creative ecosystem, supporting local brands in expanding their overseas presence and reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as a leading fashion hub in Asia.
