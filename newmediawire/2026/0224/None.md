# B2i Digital Highlights Hybrid Australia Investor Day as a Featured Conference

Hybrid Event at OTC Markets Headquarters Showcases Nine Presenting Companies Across Morning and Afternoon Sessions

 Direct Access to Management Teams Through Live Presentations, Real-Time Q&A and 1x1 Meetings

 NEW YORK, NY - February 24, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - B2i Digital, Inc. is highlighting the Australia Investor Day Virtual Investor Conference taking place Thursday, February 26, 2026. The Australia Investor Day is a B2i Digital Featured Conference, hosted by Virtual Investor Conferences (VIC), an OTC Markets Group Inc. property. The hybrid event will combine in-person presentations at OTC Markets headquarters, 300 Vesey Street in Lower Manhattan, with a simultaneous live broadcast to VIC’s global online investor audience. The event is sponsored by Viriathus and OTC Markets.

 The Australia Investor Day Virtual Investor Conference connects presenting companies with a global audience of individual and institutional investors through live, interactive online presentations. Participating companies deliver scheduled presentations followed by real-time Q&A, and investors can request one-on-one meetings with management teams through the VIC platform. Presentations are archived for on-demand viewing for 90 days following the event.

 The program features nine presenting organizations and companies across resources, energy, advanced manufacturing, and medical technology, along with a featured panel discussion focused on cross-border investor engagement.

 “I'm lucky enough to be a short cab ride from the Upper East Side to downtown, so I can catch these presentations in person,” said David Shapiro, Chief Executive Officer of B2i Digital. “But if you're smart enough not to be paying Manhattan rent, you can join virtually too. Either way, VIC is built for real access: hear the story, ask questions live, and follow up one-on-one with management.”

 As Official Marketing Partner, B2i Digital supports issuer outreach around VIC events by publishing digital profiles of presenting companies ahead of each conference. These profiles are intended to help investors review company backgrounds prior to attending live sessions and scheduling meetings through the platform.
