# MAX Automation SE: Changes to the Supervisory Board and Managing Directorate

HAMBURG, GERMANY - February 24, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Supervisory Board of MAX Automation SE (ISIN DE000A2DA588) has appointed Oliver Jaster as Managing Director and CEO, effective 1 April 2026. At the same time, Dr. Ralf Guckert will step down from both the Managing Directorate and the Supervisory Board effective 31 March 2026. He will, however, remain within the MAX Automation Group as Chairman of the Management Board of Vecoplan AG, a subsidiary of MAX Automation SE.

 Oliver Jaster has been a member of the Supervisory Board of MAX Automation SE since 2013, with a brief interruption, most recently serving as Deputy Chairman. He indirectly holds approximately 66% of the Company's shares.

 The Supervisory Board is confident that Oliver Jaster, given his in-depth knowledge of the Group and his close involvement with day-to-day operations – particularly as Chairman of the Presidential Committee – is ideally positioned to lead MAX Automation SE through its current phase. The appointment is on an interim basis. In parallel, the Supervisory Board is working on a long-term succession solution.CONTACT:
