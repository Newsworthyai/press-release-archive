Finance Empowering Business, Global Financial Leaders Convene in Hong Kong to Drive Win-Win Solutions Amid Shifting Dynamics

 HONG KONG - January 19, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The 19th Asian Financial Forum (AFF), co-organised by the Hong Kong SAR Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), will take place on Monday, 26 and Tuesday, 27 January 2026 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). This year’s AFF introduces a fresh perspective with the new tagline, “Finance Empowering Business”. Under the theme “Co-creating New Horizons Amid an Evolving Landscape”, the forum has invited over 140 financial officials, business leaders, and financial experts to serve as guest speakers, with expectations of attracting over 3,600 participants from more than 60 countries and regions.

 AFF aims to foster collaboration among attendees to navigate change and create win-win scenarios. Additionally, the inaugural Global Business Summit will be launched on the second day of the forum, focusing on the integration of finance and the real economy. This summit aligns with the recommendations of the country’s 15th Five-Year Plan, aiming to strengthen the foundation of the real economy, assist mainland enterprises in going global, and bring in international companies, while promoting Hong Kong’s unique advantages as an international financial and commercial hub.

 Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, said, “Amidst the current complexities of the international landscape, Hong Kong as a globally trusted international financial centre is committed to bridging the world and the Chinese Mainland. By gathering global financial and industry leaders, we will leverage their global vision and seasoned experience to optimise the strategic positioning of our industrial and financial supply chains from a global perspective with a view to achieving win-win outcomes. This year’s forum also features specifically the gold market development with the inclusion of a dedicated discussion session, signing of a memorandum of understanding on gold market development, as well as unveiling the latest moves that will drive the construction of an international gold trading centre in Hong Kong. All these will showcase to the international community Hong Kong's advantages and immense potential in developing gold market while seeking collaborative opportunities. Furthermore, the inaugural Global Business Summit, coupled with AFF's unique deal-making, will exemplify how the financial services empower the real economy and highlight Hong Kong's function as an international financial centre in supporting the nation's high-quality development.”

 Maggie Ng, Asian Financial Forum Steering Committee Chairperson and HSBC Hong Kong CEO, said: “We are pleased to welcome global leaders to this year’s Asian Financial Forum. This gathering underscores Hong Kong’s pivotal role as a leading international financial centre. Over 52,000 Chinese companies have extended their footprint outside of the Chinese Mainland. We see the internationalisation trend continuing. Hong Kong thrives as the China’s gateway to the world - supporting mainland firms going global, fueling innovation-driven growth and offering families unparalleled wealth management expertise.”

 Patrick Lau, Deputy Executive Director of HKTDC, said: “President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of financial services for the real economy, focusing on enhancing the capacity of the real economy to create value through capital flow and improved turnover rates. This year’s Asian Financial Forum will stay closely aligned with market trends by introducing the inaugural 'Global Industry Summit’, aiming to foster deep integration between the financial sector and high value industries, thus generating a strong multiplier effect that transforms capital into significant economic growth and drives industrial upgrading. This initiative aligns with the 15th Five-Year Plan by supporting China’s commitment to high-level two-way opening, advancing the deep integration of finance, technological innovation, and industrial innovation, and facilitating the expansion of mainland enterprises internationally and attracting foreign companies, further leveraging Hong Kong’s strengths as an international financial and commercial centre. The summit will feature support from several renowned brands, whose management teams will analyse future development trends across various industries, enabling the financial sector to provide tailored services that drive economic growth.”
