# Ares Strategic Mining Awarded Multi-Year Pentagon Contract With Estimated Initial Award Value of Approx. $169M and Potential Task Orders Up to $250M Over Five Years

VANCOUVER, B.C. - January 20, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - In a major development for the U.S. critical minerals industry, Ares Strategic Mining Inc. (CSE: ARS) (OTC: ARSMF) (FRA: N8I1) has been officially awarded a $168,938,267.30 contract by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) - a significant initiative to help strengthen America’s domestic manufacturing and supply base and support the rebuilding of U.S. strategic mineral stockpiles.

 The award is part of a five-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) agreement, with a total contract ceiling of up to $250 million. “This is the kind of contract that transforms companies, and secures the future of U.S. industry,” said James Walker, CEO of Ares Strategic Mining. “We’re not just producing fluorspar; we’re helping build a more resilient and secure domestic supply chain for critical minerals.”

 This award represents a major milestone for Ares and further strengthens the Company’s positioning as a strategic domestic supplier of acid-grade fluorspar, a U.S. designated critical mineral essential to defense readiness, industrial manufacturing, clean energy supply chains, and high-tech applications.

 Contract Highlights

 * Award Value Locked In: $168.9 million
* Potential Upside: Up to $250 million through future task orders
* Customer: United States Department of Defense
* Supplier: Ares Strategic Mining – the only U.S. producer of acid-grade fluorspar
* Mission: Support replenishment of government stockpiles of strategic and critical minerals

 This contract establishes Ares as a sole-source domestic supplier of acidspar to the U.S. government – and the only U.S.-based operation positioned to deliver this critical mineral supply at scale.

 Strategic National Significance and A Major Step Forward for Domestic Critical Mineral Independence

 Acid-grade fluorspar (“acidspar”) is a vital input used in the production of hydrofluoric acid and fluorine-based materials, supporting industries including:

 * Defense systems & missile tech
* Steel & aluminum production
* Fluorochemical manufacturing
* Semiconductors, batteries, and next-gen electronics
* National defense-related supply chain resilience

 The United States has historically been 100% import-dependent for fluorspar, making the establishment of a domestic supply chain a critical national priority. This award marks a turning point. It not only validates the national importance of Ares’ Utah-based Lost Sheep Project, but also positions the Company at the heart of America’s effort to build a robust domestic sourcing network to ensure long-term self-sufficiency.

 With this award, Ares is positioned to support the U.S. government’s mission to invest in a more resilient and secure national supply chain and promote long-term growth by prioritizing domestic sourcing of critical minerals. James Walker added that, “This award reflects the U.S. government’s commitment to revitalizing a long-neglected critical mineral supply chain. We are proud to support the U.S. government’s strategic material reserves by supplying domestically sourced, high-grade acidspar. This contract confirms our leadership in rebuilding U.S. critical mineral capability and ensures our products directly contribute to national resilience, industrial strength, and long-term security. We are now a partner in America’s strategic future.”

 DISCLOSURE AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

 Companies typically rely on comprehensive feasibility reports on mineral reserve estimates to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with a production decision. Historically, situations where the issuer decides to put a mineral project into production without first establishing mineral reserves supported by a technical report and completing a feasibility study have a higher risk of economic or technical failure, though some industrial mineral ventures are relatively simple operations with low levels of investment and risk, where the operating entity has determined that a formal prefeasibility or feasibility study in conformance with NI 43-101 and 43-101 CP is not required for a production decision. Based on historical engineering work, geological reports, historical production data and current engineering work completed or in the process by Ares, the Company intends to move forward with the development of its Utah asset.
