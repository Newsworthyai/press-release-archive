# Critical Infrastructure Technologies United States Patent Application Granted

VANCOUVER, BC - February 27, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to announce that its United States patent application titled “A Mobile Radio Station” has now been formally granted.

 The patent, United States Patent No. US 12,555,886, has been granted. The application (No. 18/558043) is registered in the name of Critical Infrastructure Technologies Pty Ltd and relates to the core technology underpinning the Company’s Nexus platform architecture.

 STRENGTHENING GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITION

 The U.S. patent grant represents a significant milestone in CiTech’s global intellectual property strategy and secures protection in one of the world’s largest defence, telecommunications, and homeland security markets.

 The patented invention covers CiTech’s deployable, autonomous mobile radio station system - an integrated, containerised communications platform designed for rapid establishment of secure connectivity in remote, disaster-affected, and high-threat environments.

 The system integrates:

 - A transportable ISO container-based communications hub

 - A hydraulically deployed, rigid scissor-lift mast

 - Hybrid energy systems incorporating battery storage and renewable inputs

 - Automated deployment functionality

 - Climate-controlled, mission-ready communications architecture

 STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE IN THE U.S. MARKET

 The United States represents a key strategic market for CiTech across defence, emergency response, border security, energy, mining, and aerospace sectors.

 Grant of the U.S. patent strengthens CiTech’s ability to:

 - Protect its rigid mast and autonomous deployment technology

 - Engage with U.S. defence and federal agencies

 - Expand licensing and partnership opportunities

 - Secure long-term commercial advantage in mission-critical communications

 The patent further enhances CiTech’s competitive positioning as it continues expanding its international footprint across North America, Europe, and allied markets.

 PATENT OVERVIEW

 CiTech’s invention defines a deployable, autonomous mobile radio station designed for rapid establishment of secure communications in remote or high-threat environments. The system overcomes the limitations of conventional mobile LTE and radio infrastructure by integrating transportability, energy autonomy, and intelligent automation.

 The patented design substantially expands CiTech’s Total Addressable Market, extending beyond traditional telecommunications infrastructure into defence, disaster response, remote industrial operations, mining, and emerging aerospace and satellite applications.

 GLOBAL PATENT COVERAGE

 CiTech filed patent applications for “A Mobile Radio Station” in:Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States.

 Along with the United States, South African have granted a patent. All other jurisdictions are either filed, under or awaiting examination. This extensive global IP coverage ensures broad protection of CiTech’s Nexus 20 technology across major defence and communications markets.

 COMPETITIVE DEFENCE ADVANTAGE

 CiTech’s Nexus 20 platform delivers a fully self-contained, air-liftable communications hub capable of autonomous field operation, ideal for rapid network establishment in defence operations, disaster recovery, and remote mission support.

 A key differentiator of CiTech’s design is its super-rigid, precision-engineered mast, which maintains complete stability even under extreme wind conditions. Unlike competitor systems that suffer vibration and movement during operation, CiTech’s mast design ensures consistent, uninterrupted signal delivery - a critical requirement for mission-critical defence and communications environments.

 Its energy independence, automation, and structural integrity significantly reduce personnel exposure and logistics, enhancing reliability and operational readiness in demanding field conditions.

 The system’s modular and AI-enabled architecture also positions CiTech for next-generation applications, including:

 - Rapid-deploy satellite ground stations and mobile telemetry for aerospace and UAS test ranges.

 - Counter-UAS and electronic perimeter defence, areas of growing focus in NATO and European defence programs.

 - Critical infrastructure protection and smart city security, enabling mobile monitoring for ports, airports, and large-scale civic events.
