# GridAI Technologies (GRDX) Positions Itself at the Operating Layer of a Continuously Managed Electric Grid

LOS ANGELES, CA - January 14, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GridAI Technologies (NASDAQ: GRDX) is aligning its platform with a structural shift in how the electric grid is operated as accelerating AI workloads, electrification, and distributed energy resources push grid management away from long-range planning and toward continuous, real-time operation. As demand volatility increases and the margin for error narrows, grid intelligence is moving from a periodic optimization function to an always-on control layer, where software-driven coordination and automation are required to manage live conditions at scale. GridAI’s approach reflects this reality, positioning the company not as a planning tool, but as an operational layer designed to support ongoing orchestration of demand, storage, and generation in a grid that must now be managed continuously rather than intermittently.
