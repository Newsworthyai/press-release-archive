# First Canadian Graphite Inc. Appoints John LaGourgue as CEO and Board Member

VANCOUVER, BC AND MONTREAL, QB - February 23, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - First Canadian Graphite Inc. (TSX.V: FCI | Frankfurt: BR2 | OTC: GBMIF) (“First Canadian”, “FCI” or the “Company”), a dynamic junior mining company focused on advancing high-grade graphite projects in Quebec to meet the growing demand for onshore sourced critical minerals, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. John LaGourgue as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, effective immediately.

 Mr. LaGourgue brings extensive experience in leadership, capital markets, commercial and governmental relations, business development, and operations in the resource sector. He has a proven track record in project oversight, corporate finance, risk management, and commercial operations. This includes over 25 years in senior executive roles, board positions, advisory roles, and investments in private and public companies with a focus on microcap issuers. Mr. LaGourgue has successfully led commercial and mining exploration programs, secured more than $100 million in debt and equity funding, and advanced projects through multiple stages.

 John LaGourgue, CEO of First Canadian, stated: “I am honoured to join the FCI team and look forward to driving an exciting new phase for the Company. I see tremendous potential to position First Canadian Graphite as a leader in the global graphite supply chain. Our world-class graphite district features some of the highest-grade and highest-quality graphitic bodies in existence, located in Quebec’s mining-friendly jurisdiction with excellent road access and global shipping capabilities. These graphitic bodies have drawn me to this opportunity, and my vision is to make First Canadian a premier low-cost, high-quality graphite producer.”

 This appointment aligns with First Canadian's strategic vision to accelerate development of its flagship Berkwood Graphite Project in northern Quebec. The project hosts a high-grade, large-flake graphite resource with a historical NI 43-101 estimate of 3.2 million tonnes of indicated and inferred at an average grade of 17%. It is positioned adjacent to major world-class graphite developments and benefits from Quebec's clean hydroelectric power and supportive infrastructure.

 “We are thrilled to welcome John LaGourgue to lead First Canadian at this pivotal time,” said Thomas Yingling, who will focus on his role as President to execute a busy 2026 program of field operations and steps toward commercializing the Company’s resource. “John’s expertise, energy in expanding investor awareness, and clear vision for maximizing shareholder value through commercialization will be instrumental as we advance Berkwood, strengthen our management team and board, and capitalize on the surging global demand for graphite.”
