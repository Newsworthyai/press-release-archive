# GridAI Technologies (GRDX) Poised at Convergence of Electrification, EV Growth and AI Demand

LOS ANGELES, CA - February 23, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GridAI Technologies (NASDAQ: GRDX), a company operating at the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy infrastructure, is positioned for opportunity as the power grid has become a central battleground for the next phase of AI growth. An article discussing this reads, “The company is developing grid and power-management software aimed at hyperscale AI data center campuses. Its core proposition is that the limiting factor for AI infrastructure is no longer only compute capacity, but the ability to control and optimize energy at scale… This challenge is structural. Modern grids were designed for predictable demand patterns and centralized generation. AI data centers do not conform to that model. They operate continuously, draw large and variable loads, and increasingly cluster in regions where grid capacity is already strained. At the same time, electric vehicles, electrification of industry, and distributed energy resources are adding new layers of volatility… Rather than building power plants or transmission lines, the company focuses on orchestration software that allows existing assets to operate more flexibly. Its systems coordinate energy flows between grid connections, on-site generation such as reciprocating engines, battery energy storage systems (‘BESS’), and, in some cases, renewable inputs like solar.”
