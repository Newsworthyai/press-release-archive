# California Transit Training Consortium Appoints Mark Hollenbeck as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors

LONG BEACH, CA - February 20, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The California Transit Training Consortium (CTTC) announced today that Mark Hollenbeck has been appointed Vice Chair of the CTTC Board of Directors, bringing more than 30 years of experience across the North American transit bus industry to help advance CTTC’s mission of strengthening the transit workforce through innovative, cost-effective technical training.

 The transit industry is navigating a period of rapid transformation - driven by zero-emission mandates, emerging technologies, and evolving maintenance and workforce needs. As agencies accelerate battery-electric adoption and evaluate next-generation systems, the need for effective training continues to grow - not only for new zero-emission platforms and supporting infrastructure, but also for the proven sustainable power-drive solutions many fleets rely on today. CTTC remains committed to helping members balance this transition by delivering training that supports cutting-edge technologies while strengthening foundational skills across alternative fuels and other lower-emission propulsion strategies.

 Hollenbeck joined Complete Coach Works (CCW) in 2024 as Manager of Business Development, where he partners with transit agencies across North America to deliver innovative and sustainable fleet solutions - enhancing operational performance, extending vehicle lifecycles, and supporting the shift toward greener transportation options. His expertise spans full bus refurbishment, major and minor accident repair, leasing, used bus sales, and battery-electric bus conversions.

 “Mark’s career reflects the breadth of experience and future-focused perspective our industry needs,” said CTTC leadership. “As Vice Chair, he will help strengthen collaboration across transit agencies, education, and industry partners - supporting training that keeps pace with advancing technologies while meeting today’s operational realities.”

 Hollenbeck began his transit career in the 1990s in bus sales at Metrotrans Corporation before moving to the publishing side of the industry, where he spent two decades with Bobit Business Media as Associate Publisher for School Bus Fleet and Metro Magazine. In 2020, he joined Proterra as West Coast Sales Director, promoting electric vehicle technology, and later served as Sales Director for WideSense, a transit solutions and EV fleet transitions software company.

 “As the industry accelerates toward zero-emission fleets and increasingly complex systems, training becomes a critical success factor,” said Hollenbeck. “I’m honored to serve as Vice Chair and support CTTC’s work to equip transit professionals with the skills and confidence to maintain, operate, and lead through change.”

 In addition to delivering technical training for transit professionals statewide, CTTC also supports the next generation of technicians entering the transportation workforce through the James A. Ditch Education Fund. This year alone, CTTC awarded $17,250 in scholarships to 12 California students pursuing careers in the automotive field, helping reduce barriers to education and strengthen the talent pipeline that keeps fleets and communities moving. In total, the James A. Ditch Education Fund has awarded scholarships to support students across California pursuing technical careers aligned with transit maintenance and emerging vehicle technologies.

 CTTC’s Board of Directors includes representatives from public transit agencies, academia, and private industry partners. Together, they guide the consortium’s priorities and support expanded access to high-impact training for CTTC members across California.
