By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - February 11, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Paul Warley, CEO of Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTI), was recently a guest on Benzinga All Access.

 Warley discussed Ascent Solar’s expansion in the solar space market. The company makes featherweight, flexible and durable CIGS thin-film photovoltaic solutions.

 “What’s exciting about our product is we’re lighter weight than everybody, we are very flexible, you can roll it up and unroll,” Warley told Benzinga during the interview. “If you want to move a satellite, you move the satellite easier or if you know there is going to be certain space debris coming, you can roll it up to protect the solar. Also, we're much lighter, so it costs less to put it into space.”

 As for what Warley thinks sets Ascent Solar apart from its competitors, he pointed to the company’s manufacturing readiness, noting Ascent Solar has been making solar solutions for more than 15 years and can make solar arrays that fit whatever the customer needs.
