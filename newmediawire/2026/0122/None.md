 VANCOUVER, BC - January 22, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to provide an update on its acquisition of 100% of the issued shares in a Western Australian precision manufacturing company, to expand its advanced production capabilities and secure local sovereign manufacturing capacity for its Nexus 20 and future product lines.

 Under the agreement, CiTech will acquire the company from founders for a total consideration of AUD $7.7 million, plus standard net debt and working capital adjustments.

 The acquisition will add a profitable and well-established business to CiTech, with revenue exceeding AUD$7.4 million and EBITDA of more than AU $1.9 million. This provides a robust earnings base to support accelerated growth in sovereign defence manufacturing, enabling CiTech to scale production, strengthen supply chain control, and advance delivery of its Nexus 20 and future autonomous communication systems.

 Key Benefits of the Acquisition:

 1. Certified to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), and ISO 45001 (Safety) standards, and operates a fully equipped in-house manufacturing facility featuring state-of-the-art laser cutting systems, CNC folding and bending machines, robotic welding technology, and advanced CAD/CAM integration.
2. Provides CiTech with direct access to a highly skilled workforce and modern fabrication systems, enabling faster prototyping, improved cost control, and scalable manufacturing for its defence and communications technologies.
3. This combination of modern equipment, skilled personnel, and a robust quality management system enables it to produce defence-grade components and assemblies with precision, repeatability, and efficiency.
4. The business has successfully achieved DISP accreditation (Defence Industry Security Program), a critical credential administered by the Australian Department of Defence. DISP membership ensures that companies meet rigorous security, governance, and information protection standards required to work with Defence and its supply chain partners.
5. The acquisition reinforces CiTech’s commitment to building a sovereign Australian manufacturing ecosystem capable of supporting rapid-deployment systems for defence, emergency response, and secure communications.
6. It complements CiTech’s growing network of international partnerships, including collaborations with Babcock International, Terma, and the establishment of an EU presence in Latvia, and therefore further expanding its reach across NATO’s Eastern Flank and allied markets.

 Integration & Timeline

 The acquisition remains subject to:

 * Finalisation of the Share Sale Agreement (expected within the next 5 days)

* Standard closing conditions
