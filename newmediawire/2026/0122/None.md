# Curt Cignetti Named 2025 Paul Bear Bryant Coach Of The Year

HOUSTON, TX - January 21, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Curt Cignetti, head coach at Indiana University, was named national college football Coach of the Year at the American Heart Association’s Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards, presented by Houston-based Memorial Hermann Health System. The 40th annual awards program benefits the American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all.

 “We are honored to recognize coach Cignetti with this year’s Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant Coach of the Year Award,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. "This award upholds coach Bryant’s legacy by celebrating exceptional leadership and excellence. The American Heart Association's work with the Bryant family strengthens our mission so everyone, everywhere can live a long and healthy life. Congratulations to this year’s finalists who lead with purpose.”

 In his second season at Indiana, Cignetti capped one of the most dramatic program turnarounds in the history of college football culminating with the program’s first national title. Indiana finished the 2025 season with a perfect 16-0 record, led by the play of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who was named Most Outstanding Player in the Hoosiers’ national championship victory over Miami.

 “This is a tremendous award and honor,” said Cignetti. “This is a team award and I’d like to thank our seniors who were outstanding in their leadership this year. All successful organizations are about having the right people and we have the right people from top to bottom. I’m honored to continue the legacy of coach Bryant and support the life-saving work of the American Heart Association.”

 Presented in Houston, the Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award annually recognizes the country’s top college football coach for their positive contributions both on and off the field, as well as efforts to make the sport better for athletes and fans alike by demonstrating grit, integrity and a winning approach to coaching and life. The Coach of the Year award is voted on by the National Sports Media Association, current NCAA College football coaches, former Coach of the Year Award winners, the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards’ Executive Leadership Team and the Bryant family. This award is the only college football coaching honor given after the National Champion has been determined.

 In 1983, football coaching legend, Paul “Bear” Bryant died from a heart attack. Moved to amplify and drive education surrounding heart disease after his passing, the Bryant family teamed up with the American Heart Association in 1986, building on the Association’s Coach of the Year Award to create the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards program. Each year since then, the awards have celebrated “Bear’s” legacy by recognizing coaching excellence while raising critical funds for research to eradicate cardiovascular disease.

 “The legacy of Coach Bryant and the lifesaving mission of the American Heart Association are deeply connected,” said Rodney Reed, American Heart Association volunteer and 2026 Bryant Awards Chair. “Coach Cignetti exemplifies the excellence, leadership and character this award represents. We are proud to recognize his outstanding achievements this season and grateful to all of our finalists for the impact they continue to make, both on the field and in their communities.”

 As previously announced, Phillip Fulmer, the legendary former head coach of the University of Tennessee and the late Mike Leach, innovator of the Air Raid offense and former head coach at Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State universities, will also be recognized with special awards at this year’s gala event. Coach Fulmer will receive the 2026 Paul “Bear” Bryant Lifetime Achievement Award and the late coach Leach will be honored posthumously with the 2026 Paul “Bear” Bryant Heart of a Champion Award presented by St. Luke’s Health, one of the largest health systems in Greater Houston.

 Fans were able to participate in the awards with the sixth annual Coach of the Year Fan Vote, sponsored by Accenture. Starting in August 2025, fans cast votes for their favorite coach online at bryantawards.org/fan-vote. Thanks to the unwavering support of his supporters, Bob Chesney of James Madison University repeated as the winner of the Fan Vote.

 The Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award ceremony presented by Memorial Hermann Health System will be broadcast on CBS Sports Network at 12:30 a.m. CST and 9:30 a.m. CST on January 22nd.
