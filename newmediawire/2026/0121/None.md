# LIG Assets, Inc. Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire Limestone Aggregates Property in Northwest Florida

MARIANNA, FLORIDA - January 21, 2026 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - LIG Assets, Inc. (OTCQB: LIGA) (“LIG” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a tract of land in Northwest Florida for the purpose of mining limestone aggregates and high-quality, ultra-pure calcium carbonate. This announcement follows a previously disclosed letter of intent executed several months ago.

 The mining property is located in Florida’s northern panhandle and is expected to support the production of construction aggregates, including road base materials, as well as agricultural lime (“ag-lime”), which is used to reduce soil acidity. The site also presents future potential for expansion into the ultra-pure calcium carbonate market, which serves a broad range of medical, agricultural, and industrial applications. These end uses include antacids and calcium supplements, construction materials, paper and paint products, and common consumer goods such as toothpaste, cleaning agents, and food additives.

 In connection with the transaction, LIG Assets has transferred $500,000 to the seller to secure exclusive rights to the entire acreage. Additional details regarding the transaction will be disclosed at a later date.

 Allan Gillis, Chief Executive Officer of LIG Assets, stated, “We would have preferred to delay issuing a press release, as this transaction remains fluid and there is much more to come. However, current regulations require the disclosure of material events within four days, which necessitated this announcement.”

 The acquisition represents a significant milestone in LIG Assets’ strategic diversification efforts and expands the Company’s portfolio across the agriculture, construction, and industrial markets.
