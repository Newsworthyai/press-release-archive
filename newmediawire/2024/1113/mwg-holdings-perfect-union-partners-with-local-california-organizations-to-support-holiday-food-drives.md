# MWG Holdings' Perfect Union Partners With Local California Organizations to Support Holiday Food Drives

SACRAMENTO, Ca. - (NewMediaWire) - November 13, 2024 - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings” or “MWG”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today that its Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness retail stores are participating in food drives to support local communities throughout the Northern California region this holiday season.

“As a company deeply rooted in the communities we serve, we are proud to support the incredible efforts of local charities and organizations this holiday season,” said Angelica Sanchez, Sr. Director of Government Affairs & Compliance at MWG Holdings and Perfect Union. “Giving back is a core value at MWG, and we’re honored to help provide essential food items to families in need. Through partnerships like this, we can make a meaningful impact, ensuring that everyone in our community has access to a warm meal during the holidays.”

MWG’s Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness Marysville locations are proud to support the Yuba Sutter Food Bank's holiday food drive by helping collect non-perishable food items for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The food bank is especially in need of holiday-specific items, including canned vegetables, boxed stuffing, instant potatoes, cranberry sauce, ready-made soups and meals, and pasta. To make it easier for customers and the local community to contribute, donation barrels are placed at both the Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness locations. These barrels will be available for food donations through the holiday season.

"As we prepare for the holidays, the Yuba Sutter Food Bank is not only focused on providing holiday meals but also on meeting the ongoing needs of families throughout the year,” said Maria Ball, Executive Director of Yuba Sutter Food Bank. “Hunger is a challenge that doesn’t stop after the holidays, and our work is only possible because of the generosity and partnership of our community. We are especially grateful to Perfect Union for their support and hope that other local businesses will join us in this mission. Every contribution helps sustain our programs and brings us closer to a community where no one has to worry about where their next meal will come from. Together, we can make a lasting impact.”

In addition to supporting the Yuba Sutter Food Bank's holiday food drive, MWG Holdings is committed to giving back to the community through a series of holiday events and initiatives. On November 17, Perfect Union will join forces with the Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services for their 17th Annual Turkey Drive, helping provide turkeys to families facing hardship. In Shasta Lake, the company is working with the Good News Rescue Mission to collect canned and dry goods for Thanksgiving baskets, offering support to those experiencing homelessness and financial struggles. Additionally, in Morro Bay, Perfect Union is contributing to the Morro Bay Free Community Thanksgiving Dinner by donating turkeys and holiday sides, providing the community with access to a warm, free holiday meal. These efforts highlight Perfect Union’s ongoing commitment to supporting local communities and spreading goodwill during the holiday season.
