# REMSleep Patent Application Has Been Allowed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office

CLEARWATER, FL - (NewMediaWire) - September 03, 2024 - REMSleep Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: RMSL) announces that another utility patent for its Nasal Ventilation System has been allowed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  REMSleep will file the necessary paperwork to pay for issuance and, thereafter, REMSleep should be awarded a patent in approximately 8 weeks.  REMSleep will maintain a continuation application for adding any improvements and/or changes to the patent lineage.

 REMSleep is now waiting on delivery of silicone raw materials from supply chain to produce inventory for market launch.  We are expecting materials to arrive to manufacturer approximately first week of October.  Production should be available a few days after and we will begin shipping samples to distributors, etc.  During this period, we are making all necessary preparations to be fully regulatory compliant with FDA for the launch of the Deltawave CPAP pillows interface.

 Immediately after launch of the Deltawave REMSleep intends to submit 510K application for its next generation “Longevity”.  The Longevity CPAP pillows interface 510K application is expected to take approximately 5 months to clearance.  The “Longevity” design is complete, and no additional R&D is needed.  There will be a third generation CPAP interface mask to follow Longevity.  We expect to have the third-generation pillows mask to market by end of 2025.  We expect REMSleep to be a substantial company by end of 2025.
