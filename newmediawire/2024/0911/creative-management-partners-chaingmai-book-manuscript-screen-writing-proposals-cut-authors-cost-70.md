BEVERLY HILLS, CA - (NewMediaWire) - September 11, 2024 - Creative Management Partners: CMP AI Announcement 2025 Publishing: CMP Provisional Patent IP and now Artificial Intelligence (AI) used via CMP ChaingmaAI Office for clients’ book proposals, manuscripts, screen writing proposals and podcasts, cutting authors; cost up to 70%.  CMP is considered the Rothschild of the Industry for their 100% track record in sales offers of their literary clients works to publishers.

Said CMP Agent Alan Morell: “I am thrilled now that AI is available for our valued client authors/screen writers through our CMP ChaingmAI office. At CMP, we have two models for our clients: CMP Model A: Continue to work with A-List ghost writers, writer collaborators (e.g. from major publications) across every industry; WGA/WGC Emmy screenwriters for our clients works. We recognize, although effective, CMP Model A at times is very expensive.

“Now with CMP ChaingmAI Model B, CMP can reduce the cost for CMP clients up to 70% whereby CMP AI provides an author a full 40-page book proposal, complete with graphics;  full 295-page manuscript and when their book is adapted for docuseries, documentary or feature film, 100 pages for screen writing elements e.g. scripts, episodes for series, pilot, feature films and podcasts.

“CMP will continue to provide ghost writers, writer collaborators WGA/WGC services as an option for our authors/clients in Model A and also, for Model B as desired, to work alongside our clients and polish up their works using new CMP ChaingmAI for submission to publishers.”

CMP Corporate has initiated a relationship with SoMo Financial, Keystone Elite Advisors www.somo.financial/keystone to fund early stage companies for clients works in general and doctors specifically. CMP Manages over 200 doctors/CEO/ health wellness founders, more than any agency in the world e.g. CMP represents doctors across major respected medical institutions; White House Task Force, FDA, and Big Pharma. Many CMP doctor clients have IP devices and FDA submitted formula IP products to present to the FDA for trials, for exit sale to Wall Street and Big Pharma. CMP serves as Senior Advisor in this sector.

Dream Merchant Partners LLC is a CMP referred credit facility for CMP authors and screenwriters to utilize, as they work with CMP Model A or Model B.  For social media, CMP clients work with The Chambers Group www.chambersgroup.com, the gold star standard of social media companies; all by which, CMP advises clients for a start to finish exit plan.  CMP has a 100% track record of sales offers for clients’ literary works with publishers.

Said Richard D’Alessio, SVP ChaingmAI Office: “Our CMP ChaingmAI platform is designed to revolutionize the way writers approach their craft, offering unprecedented efficiency and creativity. By integrating AI into the development process, we can generate comprehensive, high-quality proposals, manuscripts, and screenwriting elements in a fraction of the time it once took, and at a significantly reduced cost. This gives our clients the freedom to focus on storytelling, while we handle the heavy lifting. What excites me most is how this technology empowers both emerging and established authors to bring their visions to life without the traditional barriers of time and cost.”

Said Timothy Troke, President of “The Doctor Is In”, (A CMP Company) and SVP of CMP Original Content: "At The Doctor is In, we're harnessing AI to enhance content creation in a way that adds greater value for both our audience and advertisers. AI helps us analyze audience sentiment and pinpoint topics that will truly resonate, while creators remain focused on human engagement and authentic conversations. This balance allows our teams to maintain their unique voices, while meeting the ever-growing demand for fresh, relevant content."

Said Eric and Branden Chambers of Chambers Group: www.chambersgroup.com: "We have been working with CMP for social media for their multiple A-List clients and feel CMP AI and our ‘Deep Target’ proven model is perfect for helping clients expand their reach, personalize their content, and amplify their brand messaging. By combining CMP groundbreaking AI-driven creative services with our precision-targeting capabilities, we’re confident that authors, screenwriters, and publishers will experience a new level of audience engagement and success across digital platforms."

Said Zef Vataj and Matt Smith of SoMo Financial Keystone Elite Advisors (KEA): www.somo.financial/keystone: “AI is the future and working with CMP clients have been ideal for our funding match making. While working with Alan over the years, we've seen firsthand the incredible clients and products he represents, and we are very excited to help raise funding for his businesses, projects, and doctors to help them grow and succeed further.  Somo and KEA are collectively a full service platform to help everyone save money, make money, and raise money more efficiently and effectively than anywhere else. With our networks of thousands of accredited investors, banking and money management institutions, and document writing team, we are confident we can customize a strategy for everyone to benefit from the kept secrets from Wall Street."

Most importantly, CMP, due to their 100% track record for sales offers of authors’ works to publishers, CMP will orchestrate a SALE offer for the author book to a recognized publishing house. No AI service can provide this start to finish sales service for an author.

For authors’ social media, CMP works with The Chambers Group www.chambersgroup.com which supports sales, many of which are CMP best selling authors and Emmy winners. For funding, CMP works with SoMo Financial, Keystone Elite Advisors www.somo.financial/keystone As a credit facility, CMP authors have the option of Dream Merchant Partners LLC.
