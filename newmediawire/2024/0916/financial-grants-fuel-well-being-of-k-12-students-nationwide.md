# Financial grants fuel well-being of K-12 students nationwide

(NewMediaWire) - September 16, 2024 - DALLAS — As the new school year begins, the American Heart Association is supporting student health and well-being by awarding financial grants to nearly 80 elementary, middle and high schools nationwide. These grants, part of the Association’s commitment to improve cardiovascular health for all people everywhere, will allow local schools in communities across the country to invest in vital resources such as new fitness equipment, water filling stations and health education tools. By providing financial support for schools to enhance both the physical and emotional well-being of their students, the grants aim to combat critical health issues like childhood obesity — affecting nearly 20% of children and teens[1] — and address the alarming statistic that less than 25% of young people are getting enough physical activity[2].

 “These grants represent more than just financial support, they are a lifeline for schools striving to make a real difference in their students' lives,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and former executive vice president and chief diversity officer for The PNC Financial Services Group. “By equipping schools with the means to promote healthier habits, we are investing not only in students' physical and mental well-being, but also in their long-term success, ultimately advancing health and hope for everyone, everywhere.”

 Celebrating 100 years of lifesaving work in 2024, the bi-annual grants underscore the Association’s ongoing commitment to improving student health through its Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ in-school initiatives. Both the Kids Heart Challenge and American Heart Challenge are rooted in proven science, which has shown that kids who are regularly active have a better chance of a healthy adulthood2. Each year, these service-learning programs engage more than 10 million students in approximately 20,000 schools in every state in the country. Students learn how to improve their overall health while making a positive impact on others. Through engaging lesson plans and interactive technology, students get active, have fun and learn lifesaving skills like Hands-Only CPR.

 The grant application process was open to all schools that participated in the American Heart Association’s school-based programs during the 2023-2024 school year. To learn more about the Association’s in-school initiatives, visit heart.org/getstarted.
