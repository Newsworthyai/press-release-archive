# SuperCloud Inks Deal to Add Hundreds of Free Live TV Channels to Consumer 5G TV Platform UMAXX

Entertainment-Tech Company Brings Further Value to Consumers with Addition of Library of FAST Channels

FT LAUDERDALE, FL - (NewMediaWire) - September 05, 2024 - SuperCloud International, Inc. (“Company” or “SuperCloud”), a privately held technology and entertainment holding company with B2B and B2C brands and services, today announced that it has entered a content distribution agreement with a leading free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel provider to add several hundreds of live TV channels to its UMAXX consumer 5G internet and TV platform over the coming weeks. The addition of the FAST channels adds to UMAXX’s library of over 350 High-Resolution HD premium Live TV channels, all with the convenience of cable-free portability and industry-leading privacy and security features.

Consumer interest in FAST TV programing has continued to increase over the past few years with over 50% of consumers reporting they watch some form of ad-supported programing already. In a reversal from the “ad-free” experience offered by many streaming companies, consumers seem more willing to have ads during their content if it means greater options. Following this trend, SuperCloud has partnered with a leading provider of FAST channels to expand its portfolio of Live TV channels offered through its UMAXX entertainment platform, bringing further value to consumers nationwide. UMAXX is the world’s first all-in-one 5G TV and internet experience offering blazing fast internet speeds and cable-free Live TV. The service runs on a proprietary closed loop wireless platform offering the widest range of availability in the industry. It does this by leveraging multiple national 5G networks simultaneously creating best-in-class reliability and speeds.

The new FAST channels will be included in all UMAXX Ultra Internet plans, only increasing the value of the package which comes with unlimited data usage and speeds faster than 4G or satellite, as well as all of its TV packages. UMAXX is offering consumers the chance to try their TV and internet packages for one month free with purchase of 5G hardware, with no contract or commitment.

“With the addition of these FAST channels, UMAXX will become one of the largest wireless Live TV content providers in the world,” said Jim Devericks, Chairman and CEO of UMAXX. “Since our launch, we have been working tirelessly to expand and improve our offerings with solutions customers want. For consumers who are looking for a reliable and fast internet connection but may be unsure if they would enjoy UMAXX’s Live TV experience, these FAST channels give a glimpse into the simplicity of wireless Live TV to those on the UMAXX internet service. We are certain that once consumers get a taste of truly cable-free Live TV via these free FAST channels, they will want to explore the other packages of UMAXX Live 5G TV which offers all of the best channels in the world.”

UMAXX offers three tiers of both its stand-alone internet service, as well as its internet/TV bundle packages based on the number of channels a customer prefers, with add-on options for premium channels such as HBO, Starz, Showtime, and others.

Subscribed UMAXX users have access to UMAXX’s library of Live TV channels via the UMAXX App which is available on most Smart TVs, as well as third-party devices such as Amazon Firestick, Roku, and Apple TV. Consumers, who do not have Smart TVs, may also purchase a set-top box from UMAXX to subscribe and enjoy their service.

The UMAXX service is the culmination of years of work by legendary technology innovator Jim Devericks. Devericks holds several patents for underlying technology that powers the UMAXX platform and is responsible for the development of the SuperCloud proprietary Infrastructure and Hybrid Converged Internet Solution (known as CloudCable) which aggregates the UMAXX data and distributes it via the proprietary military-grade 5G network.
