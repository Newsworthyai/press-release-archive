# Auddia Announces Industry First AI Podcast Player Added to faidr

Forward+ and Chapter Visualization Leverage Auddia’s Advanced AI Technology to Introduce Leading Podcast Listening Experience

Technology Now Available on iOS With Android Targeted for Q4

Features are First Clearly Differentiated Offerings for Podcast Listening on faidr

BOULDER, CO - (NewMediaWire) - September 05, 2024 - Auddia Inc. (NASDAQ:AUUD) (NASDAQ:AUUDW) (“Auddia” or the “Company”), a proprietary AI platform for audio identification and classification and related technologies, reinventing how consumers engage with AM/FM radio, podcasts, and other audio content, today announced it recently launched two new differentiated features for podcast listening on the iOS faidr mobile application, Forward+ and Chapter Visualization.

Both features are built on the Company’s proprietary audio classification AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology for podcasting. Forward+ allows a user to skip forward to the end of the segment being played with a single touch, and Chapter Visualization shows the user where segment breaks are in the episode within the progress bar of the player.

"For each of the audio content categories we have in the faidr app, our strategy is to develop and launch clearly differentiated experiences within each," said Michael Lawless, Auddia CEO. "Forward+ and Chapter Visualization are industry-first approaches to meeting podcast listeners where they are by enabling a far more efficient and intelligent experience for the process of skipping forward. We believe this capability will further differentiate faidr as the best platform for listening to podcasts."

Unlike Seamless, a beta feature that pays podcast partners per play while allowing users to listen to ad-reduced podcast episodes without manually skipping, and which requires a subscription after the beta program expires, both Forward+ and Chapter Visualization are available on hundreds of podcasts and are free features for all users.

The Company is further leveraging its AI platform for audio to introduce additional industry first capabilities that will be announced as they become available.
