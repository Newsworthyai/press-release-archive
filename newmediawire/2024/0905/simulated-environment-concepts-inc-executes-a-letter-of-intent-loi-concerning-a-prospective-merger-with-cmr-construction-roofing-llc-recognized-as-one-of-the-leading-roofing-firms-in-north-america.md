# Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. Executes a Letter of Intent (LOI) Concerning a Prospective Merger With CMR Construction & Roofing, LLC, Recognized as One of the Leading Roofing Firms in North America

NASHVILLE, TN - (NewMediaWire) - September 05, 2024 - Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. (OTC: SMEV or Simulated) and CMR Construction & Roofing LLC (referred to as "CMR") are pleased to announce the execution of a Letter of Intent (LOI) targeted at Strategic Business Combination potentially merging Simulated with CMR, one of the Top 10 roofing companies in the country.

The objective of this proposed merger is to establish a diversified construction company focused on enhancing shareholder value through investments in and acquisitions of innovative construction businesses that prioritize responsible risk management and provide practical solutions to global challenges in the construction and roofing industries.  Further, this merger targets to incorporate an enhanced business model that includes increased revenues from ancillary verticals and upselling of existing customers with a full array of home improvements.

Both CMR and Simulated are confident that this merger will yield the necessary strength and resources to implement an ambitious growth strategy. The anticipated merger is a significant step in Simulated's evolution into a multi-faceted enterprise engaged in construction, real estate financing, corporate spin-outs, industry consolidations, and early-stage financing with CMR becoming the surviving entity.

"This strategic transition signifies a crucial juncture and opportunity for SMEV," stated Bryan Wilkinson, CEO of Simulated Environment Concepts. "I have been greatly impressed by CMR's successful execution and expansion since 2018, as they embrace innovation, diversification, and future technologies that will provide a renewed perspective for the future of SMEV shareholders."

The Letter of Intent delineates the principal terms of the proposed merger, which will greatly increase the value of SMEV's market capitalization, due to the fact that CMR has generated over $100 million every year since 2018 and is anticipated to continue to sustain that kind of revenue as they grow their business.

This merger will enable Simulated to incorporate substantial business acumen and management expertise when CMR's team takes over SMEV.

"We're looking forward to collaborating with Simulated and anticipate a successful merger. This transaction is important and integral to our Strategic Plan," said Steven Soule, CEO of CMR Construction & Roofing, LLC.
