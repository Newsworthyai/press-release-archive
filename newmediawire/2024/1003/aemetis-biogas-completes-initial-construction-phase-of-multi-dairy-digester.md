# Aemetis Biogas Completes Initial Construction Phase of Multi-Dairy Digester

Biogas Production of Over 200,000 MMBtu per Year Scheduled to Begin by Year-end 2024

CUPERTINO, Calif. - (NewMediaWire) - October 3, 2024 - Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on low and negative carbon intensity products, announced today that its Aemetis Biogas subsidiary has completed initial construction of a multi-dairy anaerobic digester to process waste from approximately 14,000 dairy cows in Merced County, California.

The multi-dairy digester is expected to begin operations by year-end 2024 and produce more than 200,000 MMBtu per year of renewable natural gas (RNG). The digester is designed to collect waste from four dairies that are each located within one-half mile from the multi-dairy digester. The project is connected to the 36-mile Aemetis biogas pipeline.

“Aemetis Biogas is scheduled to significantly increase production this quarter, including the multi-dairy digester and two other dairy digesters,” stated Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “We are pleased with the rapid acceleration of revenue growth from new digesters, which generate credits from the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and from Production Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act starting in January 2025, supporting our construction of digesters for additional dairies.”

Currently, Aemetis generates biogas from anaerobic digesters fed by ten dairies, producing approximately 300,000 MMBtu per year of RNG. After completion of the multi-dairy digester and two other digesters, Aemetis will be producing approximately 550,000 MMBtu of RNG per year from 16 dairies.

Aemetis Biogas has signed agreements with 48 dairies and expects to add an additional 27 dairies to its biogas portfolio. When fully operational, the dairies in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project are expected to generate more than 1.6 million MMBtu per year of RNG and annual revenues of $250 million.
