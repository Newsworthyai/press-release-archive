Despite these challenges, we are proud to announce that we met all our goals for the quarter and remain committed to supporting Floridians as they rebuild. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this horrific storm. We look forward to a strong finish to the year and continued growth as we move into the fourth quarter.”
