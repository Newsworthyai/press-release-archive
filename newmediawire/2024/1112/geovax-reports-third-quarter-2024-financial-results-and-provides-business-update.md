 ATLANTA - (NewMediaWire) - November 12, 2024 - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.

 

 David Dodd, GeoVax’s Chairman and CEO, stated, “2024 has shaped up to be a year of steady progress and execution across our development programs. Following the BARDA/RRPV award of nearly $400 million in support of evaluating GEO-CM04S1 in the Project NextGen program, we continue to collaborate closely with the BARDA Project NextGen team and our CRO, Allucent, preparing for the activation of the 10,000-patient Phase 2b clinical study. The necessary sites are confirmed, and we are working closely with Oxford Biomedica (“OXB”), our manufacturing partner, to produce the vaccine product required for study activation. We look forward to sharing further updates related to this exciting Phase 2b study.

 

 “In the third quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet with additional funding, enabling us to confirm plans towards initiating a Phase 2 trial of Gedeptin in conjunction with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, as therapy for first recurrent head and neck cancer patients,” Dodd continued. “We anticipate initiating this study during the first half of 2025. We have also made significant progress with GEO-MVA, our vaccine candidate for Mpox, and expect to achieve production of a cGMP clinical batch during the fourth quarter. With GEO-MVA, we intend to create the first U.S.-based source for a Mpox vaccine, an important biodefense goal.

 

 “Supported by our recent progress, we believe we are well-positioned to advance our priority programs in support of developing innovative solid tumor therapies and infectious disease vaccines. Our commitment to advancing life-changing treatments continues to drive us in our mission to improve patient care worldwide through innovative developments.”

 

 Third Quarter Business Achievements and Updates

 

 GEO-CM04S1

 * BARDA Project NextGen Phase 2b trial: Target sites are confirmed, and activities are underway in support of initiating the 10,000-participant, randomized, Phase 2b double-blinded study to compare the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GEO-CM04S1 with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
* Existing Phase 2 clinical studies: During the fourth quarter of 2024, GeoVax anticipates reporting interim results from (a) the comparative trial among Immunocompromised/Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients and (b) the booster trial among healthy adults. For the Immunocompromised/Stem Cell Transplant patient trial, additional sites have been added and patient enrollment continues.

 Gedeptin®

 

 * Activities underway in support of Phase 2 study of Gedeptin combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor as therapy among patients with first recurrent head and neck cancer.
* This trial is anticipated to be a single-cycle trial in approximately 36 patients with a pathologic response rate as the primary endpoint. The primary goal of this trial will be to establish efficacy of neoadjuvant Gedeptin therapy combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in squamous cell head and neck cancer.

 

 Mpox and Smallpox Vaccine Platform

 

 * GEO-MVA is GeoVax’s vaccine candidate in development for protection against Mpox and Smallpox.
* A cGMP Master Seed Virus has been successfully manufactured and released by OXB and a cGMP clinical batch is currently in production, anticipated to be completed during Q4.
* MVA is the vaccine recommended by both WHO and the CDC against both Mpox and Smallpox, recognized for its safety and efficacy among all patient populations, including pregnant women, children and immunocompromised individuals.  MVA is the vaccine currently used and stockpiled in the United States Strategic National Stockpile for immunization against potential bioterrorism threats based on the smallpox virus.

 Continuous Cell-line MVA Manufacturing Process Development

 

 * Development activities are underway in support of the AGE.1 continuous MVA manufacturing process.  Additional progress is expected to be reported during Q4.

 Corporate Updates

 

 * GeoVax Scientific Advisory Board: Appointed Teresa Lambe, PhD, OBE, FMedSci, professor of Vaccinology and Immunology at the Oxford Vaccine Group within the University of Oxford, to the Scientific Advisory Board.

 About GeoVax

 

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned to initiate during the first half of 2025. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
