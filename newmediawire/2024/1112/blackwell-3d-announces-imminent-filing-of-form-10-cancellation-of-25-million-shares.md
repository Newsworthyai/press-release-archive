DUBAI, UAE - (NewMediaWire) - November 12, 2024 - Blackwell 3D Construction Corp. (OTC: BDCC) ("Blackwell 3D” or the "Company"), an innovative 3D house printing technology company, is pleased to announce that its previously disclosed plans to file a Form 10 Registration Statement with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to come to fruition within the week. This significant step marks Blackwell 3D’s commitment to enhancing transparency, increasing shareholder confidence, and preparing for anticipated growth as a publicly traded company.

By consolidating our share structure, BDCC aims to deliver stronger returns for existing shareholders, reduce dilution risk, and enhance the attractiveness of the stock for long-term investors.

“The decision to cancel 25 million shares demonstrates our commitment to maximizing shareholder value,” added Zaveri. “By reducing the number of outstanding shares, we’re able to reward our existing shareholders and create a stronger, more sustainable capital structure that positions us well for long-term growth.”
