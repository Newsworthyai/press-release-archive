Operational Highlights

●      Entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Acquisition Agreement”) to acquire Newtek Technology Solutions, Inc. (“NTS”) from NewtekOne, Inc. (“Newtek”), the sole stockholder of NTS, through a two-step merger process. We will pay $4,000,000 in cash to Newtek and will issue to Newtek 4,000,000 shares of a newly created series of our preferred stock (in each case, subject to adjustment as further described in the Acquisition Agreement) (the “Acquisition”). Newtek is also entitled to receive an earn-out payment of up to $5,000,000 based on the achievement of certain cumulative average Adjusted EBITDA thresholds for the 2025 and 2026 fiscal years. As a condition to the closing of the Acquisition, we must effectuate the sale of our “Paltalk” and “Camfrog” applications and all assets and liabilities related to such applications in one or more transactions and cease the operations of our “Tinychat” application.

●      Entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Divestiture Agreement”) with Meteor Mobile Holdings, Inc. (“Meteor Mobile”), pursuant to which we and our subsidiaries party thereto agreed to sell our telecommunications services provider, “Vumber”, as well as our “Paltalk” and “Camfrog” applications and all assets related to such services provider and applications, other than certain excluded assets (the “Transferred Assets” and such transaction, the “Divestiture”), to Meteor Mobile in exchange for (i) a cash payment of $1,350,000 and (ii) the assumption of all of our liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the Transferred Assets on or after the closing of the Divestiture, other than certain excluded liabilities, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Divestiture Agreement. Following the Divestiture, we will retain all patents, patent applications, and any rights or causes of action related to such patents and patent applications (including the patent litigation against Cisco). We are also entitled to receive, for the six-month period beginning July 1, 2025 and each subsequent annual period beginning on January 1, 2026, 2027 and 2028, certain cash earnout payments based on a percentage of cash revenue, net of any refunds, received by Meteor Mobile that is attributable to the business of the Transferred Assets.

Business Objectives

As a result of the entry into the Acquisition Agreement and the Divestiture Agreement, our near-term business objectives now include:

●      Consummation of the Acquisition and the Divestiture;

●      Integration of the business of NTS following the closing of the Acquisition;

●      Continuing our efforts to improve user experience with our ManyCam software and optimize features for both consumer and enterprise applications; and

●      Continuing to defend our intellectual property

1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the discussion below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics” and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information concerning this and other non-GAAP financial measures.

Management Commentary

Jason Katz, Chairman and CEO of Paltalk, commented, “Our team had a very busy and productive end to the summer, with the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire NTS from Newtek.  We also recently announced our entry into a definitive agreement to complete the sale of Vumber and our Paltalk and Camfrog applications. We are in midst of a transformational shift in our business strategy that we believe will enhance stockholder value. Additionally, in our patent infringement litigation against Cisco, we were recently awarded a $65.7 million jury verdict. We will continue to defend our intellectual property against any post-trial proceedings, including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco.”

Katz continued, “We expect that the Acquisition, once completed, will have an immediate and meaningful impact on our revenue, since NTS’s revenue in 2023 was approximately three times greater than Paltalk’s 2023 revenue. We look forward to moving towards the closing of the Divestiture and the Acquisition. We have an ample cash balance of $12.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and we are excited to focus our attention on growing the cybersecurity, cloud hosting and technology solutions business.”

Patent Litigation Update – Awarded $65.7 Million Award in August 2024

On July 23, 2021, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Paltalk Holdings, Inc., filed a patent infringement lawsuit (the “Lawsuit”) against WebEx Communications, Inc., Cisco WebEx LLC, and Cisco Systems, Inc. (collectively, “Cisco”), in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (the “Court”). We alleged that certain of Cisco’s products have infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,683,858, and that we were entitled to damages.

On August 29, 2024, the jury awarded the Company $65.7 million (the “Award”) in a jury verdict in connection with the Lawsuit. On October 8, 2024, an order granting a motion for final judgment was entered into in the Court in connection with the Lawsuit. The final judgment was entered in the Company’s favor in the amount of the Award and started the time for filing any post-trial motions or appeal.

The exact amount of the Award proceeds to be received by the Company will be determined based on a number of factors and will reflect the deduction of significant litigation-related expenses, including legal fees. Consequently, the Company estimates that it would receive no more than one third of the gross proceeds in connection with the Award, subject to post-trial proceedings (including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco).

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics

The Company has provided in this release Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude interest (income) expense, net, other (income) expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results to assess operational performance and to determine the Company’s future capital requirements. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to Adjusted EBITDA in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and others to understand and evaluate the Company’s operating results and it allows for a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s performance and that of competitors. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect, among other things: cash capital expenditures for assets underlying depreciation and amortization expense that may need to be replaced or for new capital expenditures; interest income, net; other expense, net; income tax expense from continuing operations; our working capital requirements; the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; and the provision for income taxes. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including total revenues, subscription revenue, deferred revenue, net loss, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net cash used in operating activities and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
