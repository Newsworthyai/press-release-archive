(Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Ecker Capital LLC, the holding company for warehouse management software companies InterlinkONE Inc. and Interactive Systems Inc., from ZenaTech’s affiliated company Ameritek Ventures Inc. (OTC: ATVK). The acquisition of these two software companies will provide important functionality for integration with its ZenaDrone IQ Nano AI drone solution, enabling autonomous inventory management for warehouse and logistics customers. This transaction also further expands ZenaTech’s portfolio of SaaS software solutions and customer base and is expected to add to recurring revenues. Combined operating income for the acquired companies were $354K on revenue of $678K for the first nine months of 2024, and $386K on revenue of $949K for FY 2023. The acquisition is subject to any shareholder and regulatory approvals that may be required.

“This acquisition will add more recurring revenue to ZenaTech, as well as provide additional functionality to our ZenaDrone IQ Nano AI drone solution for autonomous inventory management. We look forward to introducing these ground-breaking solutions to warehouse and logistics customers in the US and globally. We believe this dramatically improves decision making and efficient operations by being able to assess and manage physical inventory cost-effectively by the hour instead of once every quarter as often done.  This can easily result in inventory cost savings in the millions of dollars a year for multi-warehouse facility customers,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.
