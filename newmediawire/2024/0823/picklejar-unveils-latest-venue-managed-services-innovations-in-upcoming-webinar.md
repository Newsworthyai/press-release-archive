HOUSTON, TX - (NewMediaWire) - August 23, 2024 - PickleJar Entertainment Group, Inc. (OTC: PKLE), a leading Texas-based music and entertainment software company, today announced a live webinar presentation with PickleJar’s co-founder and chief executive officer to unveil new features being added to its Venue Managed Services offering. PickleJar is showcasing the latest advancements to its PickCaster 2.0 digital signage and new integrated ticketing point of sale platform for ticket sales at the door. Taking place on Wednesday, August 28, 2024, at 3:00 p.m. EST, the company update will provide an in-depth understanding of the Company's Venue Managed Services (VMS) strategy, as well as highlighting the various benefits these new innovations will offer to their Venue Partners, advertisers and customers.

"Customer experience is now a must for all live music venues,” explains Jeff James, co-founder and chief executive officer. “We want to demonstrate to our partners how they can win with PickleJar’s integrated VMS technologies and how it can be a differentiating factor for their customers.”

In the recent 2024 State of the Industry Survey by Bar and Restaurant, over 30% of respondents said they are planning to invest in new on-premise technologies and 33.5% of respondents indicated their investment in new entertainment options for patrons in the coming 12 months. PickleJar’s enhanced PickCaster 2.0 digital signage will include a new, multi-zone layout to increase advertising and sponsorship exposure as part of its innovative revenue share model with its Venue Partners. Additionally, PickleJar’s integrated ticketing platform now will incorporate a kiosk hardware package for point-of-sale (POS) tickets at the door, including cover charges and check-in functionality for tickets sold across its platform. Both products are scheduled to roll out with key Venue Partners in September 2024.

“Building on our success with Artist Promotions, the new PickleJar VMS platform is built for the small to medium live music venues, making it easy for them to monetize the moments on their stages with on-brand visual content that drives new revenue streams,” said James. “With PickleJar’s integrated approach to the Fan’s customer experience, strong record of product innovation and proven ability to deliver products that empower Venues of all sizes, Venue Managed Services offers an unparalleled combination of deep transaction and advertising expertise business leaders and Fans can trust.”
