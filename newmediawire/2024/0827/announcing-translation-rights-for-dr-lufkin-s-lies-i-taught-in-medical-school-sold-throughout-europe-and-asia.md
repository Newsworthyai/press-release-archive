 ABOUT Lies I Taught in Medical School  BY ROBERT LUFKIN MD:

 Lies I Taught In Medical School is a riveting, cautionary tale of how modern medicine has gotten things so wrong (and continues to) in several key areas. It provides powerful evidence that chronic diseases are all linked by common root causes largely overlooked by our system. The book shows how we got into this situation and what we can do about it. It also explains how Professor Lufkin reversed four of these chronic diseases in himself and provides detailed instructions on how to keep them from ruining your health.

 Said Glenn Yeffeth, Publisher, BenBella Books: "On behalf of our Publishing House, we are very pleased with the tremendous success of Dr. Lufkin's seminal work. Dr. Lufkin employs the latest science to challenge the conventional wisdom and show readers how to make a long-term breakthrough in their health."

 SAID ROBERT LUFKIN MD: “I am very excited about my book Lies I Taught in Medical School going internationally, which will allow it to reach so many more people with the life transforming and life saving message that most of the chronic diseases that we face can be delayed or even reversed by the lifestyle choices we make every day.  Readers will be able to employ in their own lives the powerful tools based on nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, and other factors that were used to reverse those diseases in myself and my patients."

 SAID AGENT ALAN MORELL: “It is my honor and pleasure to represent Author Dr. Robert Lufkin for the sale of his wonderful book, Lies I Taught in Medical School to respected Publisher Glenn Yeffeth of BenBella Books, who I felt would be an ideal partner for Dr. Lufkin.  This wonderful book is a true to life guide and cautionary tale with emphasis on global epidemics of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases that were uncommon 100 years ago. I am very pleased Dr. Lufkin’s book not only continues to sell throughout North America but according to BenBella Books, will have sales throughout Europe, Asia and South America."
