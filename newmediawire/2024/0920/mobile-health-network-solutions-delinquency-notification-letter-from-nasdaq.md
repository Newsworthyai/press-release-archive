# Mobile-health Network Solutions Delinquency Notification Letter from Nasdaq

SINGAPORE - (NewMediaWire) - September 20, 2024 - Mobile-health Network Solutions (Nasdaq: MNDR) ("MaNaDr" or "the Company"), a leading Asia-Pacific telehealth provider, today announced that it received a notice dated September 18, 2024, from the Listings Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share of its Class A ordinary shares (“Class A Ordinary Shares”) was below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Rule”). The Nasdaq notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares, and the shares will continue to trade uninterrupted under the symbol “MNDR.”

Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a compliance period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until March 17, 2025 (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the closing bid price per share of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance, and the matter will be closed.

In the event the Company does not regain compliance by March 17, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company chooses to implement a reverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than ten (10) business days prior to March 17, 2025, or the expiration of the second compliance period if granted.
