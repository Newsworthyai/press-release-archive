 (NewMediaWire) - November 06, 2024 - DALLAS — Lauren H. Sansing, M.D., M.S., FAHA, professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, will receive the Basic Research Prize from the American Heart Association during its Scientific Sessions 2024. The meeting, Nov. 16-18, 2024 in Chicago, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Dr. Sansing will be recognized with the award during the Presidential Session on Sunday, Nov. 17.

 Dr. Sansing is a professor of neurology and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, as well as the vice chair of academic and faculty affairs in the department of neurology. An accomplished physician-scientist, her research focuses on maximizing potential recovery for people who experience complex neurovascular diseases, such as stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (commonly referred to as a brain bleed),  a type of stroke that happens when a blood vessel ruptures inside the brain.

 “Dr. Sansing’s research is at the forefront of unlocking opportunities for people who have strokes to recover their ability to function,” said Keith Churchwell, M.D., FAHA, American Heart Association 2024-2025 volunteer president, associate clinical professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and adjunct associate professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “Congratulations, Lauren, on this well-deserved award. Discoveries from your research will help us fine-tune our approaches and likely change the landscape of stroke treatment in the near future.”

 Dr. Sansing leads an Association- and NIH-funded lab that includes 14 researchers, students and other trainees at Yale School of Medicine. The Sansing Lab studies immune system responses after ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage and vascular dementia. She and her research team are working to learn which immune responses help brains heal after injury and which responses make healing more difficult. Their goal is to take this knowledge and apply it to patient care to enhance the immune responses that aid in healing and suppress the immune responses that hinder healing to provide the best possible recovery to people who experience brain injuries. She and her team are also committed to enhancing translation to patient care through rigorous testing of candidate treatments for stroke in the NINDS-funded Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network.

 She is the author of more than 140 peer-reviewed papers. Dr. Sansing is an active volunteer with the Association and is currently the chair of the International Stroke Conference for 2025-2026. In addition to leading a lab, she is an investigator on multiple clinical trials currently underway at Yale and cares for patients with stroke at Yale New Haven Hospital. She is also an active mentor for future scientists and physician-scientists, mentoring students in her lab, directing the Master’s in Health Sciences program at Yale School of Medicine and co-directing the NINDS R25 clinical neurosciences research program.

 “I’m honored to have my research recognized and celebrated by the American Heart Association,” said Dr. Sansing. “It’s my mission to uncover new treatments to improve outcomes after stroke and maximize recovery potential for people who have cerebrovascular disease.”

 Dr. Sansing earned a bachelor’s in biology from Cornell University, a medical degree from the Stony Brook University School of Medicine (now Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University) and a master’s in translational research from the University of Pennsylvania. She completed her medical training at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with an internship in internal medicine, a residency in neurology and a fellowship in vascular neurology. Dr. Sansing also completed a research fellowship in stroke immunology at the University of Pennsylvania. She is board certified in neurology and vascular neurology. She was previously honored by the Association in 2019 with the Established Investigator Award.
