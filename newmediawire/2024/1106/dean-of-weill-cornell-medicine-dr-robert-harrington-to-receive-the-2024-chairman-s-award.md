 (NewMediaWire) - November 06, 2024 - DALLAS — Robert A. Harrington, M.D., FAHA, the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, will receive the 2024 Chairman’s Award at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2024. The meeting, Nov. 16-18, 2024, in Chicago, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Dr. Harrington will be honored and presented with the award during the Presidential Session on Sunday, Nov. 17.

 Dr. Harrington is a physician-scientist who felt a calling to become a cardiologist after losing his mother to a heart attack his senior year of college. His family’s experience with the devastation of an unexpected heart attack drew him to research. His research interests include evaluating the use of medications to reduce the chances of developing blood clots for people who have narrowed heart arteries, otherwise known as acute ischemic heart disease; and in minimizing the complications of percutaneous coronary procedures, non-surgical procedures to widen narrow arteries by placing stents to restore normal blood flow to the heart. Throughout his career, his goal has been to improve research methods to include the utilization of available technology to help conduct clinical trials. Dr. Harrington is a champion of technology as a tool to spread health education, including sharing information on health issues and information on medications.

 “It’s a true privilege to present this year’s Chairman’s Award to Dr. Robert Harrington,” said Marsha Jones, 2023-2025 volunteer chairperson of the Board of the American Heart Association. “Bob has been a long-standing volunteer for the Association, and his leadership and knowledge have been pivotal in the continued strength of the Association. His understanding of the need for timely communication in medicine was really driven home just a few years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began during his tenure as president. He helped us reinforce the use of technology to elevate the voices of medical professionals and to ensure professionals and the public had the timeliest, evidence-based information during the pandemic. Thank you for your distinguished leadership, Bob!”

 Dr. Harrington is the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean and professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and provost for medical affairs of Cornell University, as well as an attending cardiologist at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Before joining Weill Cornell Medicine in September 2023, he was the Arthur L. Bloomfield Professor and chair of the department of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, and he remains an honorary faculty emeritus of medicine and a member of the Cardiovascular Institute.

 He served as the 2019-2020 volunteer president of the Association, where he is fondly recalled as the “pandemic president.” During his presidential term, he worked tirelessly to distribute $1.2 million in Rapid Research Grants to 12 research teams carefully selected from hundreds of applicants, ensuring funding was awarded for diverse science topics. In addition to serving as president of the Association, Dr. Harrington was the lead organizer for the Association’s annual Scientific Sessions for two years and has been and continues to be a member of the Association’s board of directors. He was previously honored by the Association in 2017 with the Clinical Research Prize, and in 2022 with a Distinguished Achievement Award by the Council on Clinical Cardiology. Dr. Harrington was also the chair of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee.

 “I’m incredibly honored to be this year’s recipient of the Chairman’s Award, and proud to be part of the Association’s enduring commitment to addressing the challenges of cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. Harrington. “Motivated by my own family history and the disparities I’ve seen in health care, I’ve dedicated my career to advancing the field of cardiology through research and technological innovation that seeks to improve access to care for all. I am excited about what is possible for the future of medicine, as we continue to leverage advanced tools, images and artificial intelligence to improve the patient experience. It’s also a privilege to guide the next generation of health care leaders to be as curious as they are compassionate, and together transform the lives of people living with heart disease.”

 Dr. Harrington earned a bachelor’s degree in English from the College of the Holy Cross and a medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine. He completed an internal medicine residency and served as chief resident at what is now known as UMass Memorial Medical Center, followed by a fellowship in general and interventional cardiology at Duke University Medical Center.

 He is the author of more than 760 peer-reviewed articles, manuscripts, editorials and book chapters, and he was the senior editor of the 13th and 14th editions of Hurst’s The Heart, a widely used textbook on cardiovascular medicine. Dr. Harrington is the host of “The Bob Harrington Show,” a podcast presented by TheHeart.org and Medscape that discusses cardiology and the practice of medicine. He is also an elected member of the Association of American Physicians, the National Academy of Medicine/Institute of Medicine and the Association of University Cardiologists.
