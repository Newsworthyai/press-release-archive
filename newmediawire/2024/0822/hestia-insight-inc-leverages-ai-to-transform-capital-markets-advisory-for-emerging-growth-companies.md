NEW YORK, NY - (NewMediaWire) - August 22, 2024 - Hestia Insight Inc. (OTCQB: HSTA) (“Hestia Insight” or the “Company”), a leader in healthcare and biotech advisory services, today announced a strategic shift toward focusing on capital markets advisory with a key emphasis on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its service offerings. By addressing the critical needs of emerging growth companies, Hestia Insight aims to simplify the complexities of the U.S. capital markets with innovative AI-driven solutions designed to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve compliance for its clients.

"Our mission is to empower emerging companies with cutting-edge tools and insights that drive success in capital markets," said Edward C. Lee, CEO of Hestia Insight. "Integrating AI allows us to deliver personalized, data-driven strategies that keep our clients competitive in an evolving financial landscape."

As part of this strategic pivot, Hestia Insight is phasing out certain of its non-core operations, including its vending machine and cell phone charger businesses, to concentrate on supporting emerging growth companies in the U.S. and Asia through the Company’s AI-enhanced capital markets advisory services. The Company’s expanded focus includes helping clients create high-quality, professional investor presentations and investment documents that resonate with global investors, particularly in Asian markets where demand is rising.

Our goal is to provide emerging companies with a cost-effective advantage in developing their investment documentation, ensuring they stand out in a crowded market."

To lead its AI initiative, Hestia Insight has partnered with Edward Boyle, a pioneering expert in artificial intelligence with a distinguished track record in AI innovation and advisory services. Mr. Boyle’s experience ranges from founding an AI startup funded by Apple to advising Fortune 500 companies and startups on leveraging AI for growth strategies and business models.

"I have dedicated my career to advancing AI technology to solve real-world problems," said Mr. Boyle, leader of the AI initiative at Hestia Insight. "My expertise spans AI-driven marketing, data analytics, and venture capital, making me well-positioned to assist Hestia Insight’s clients with leveraging AI to drive market competitiveness. Our current focus is on establishing AI applications for capital market advisory, strategic partnerships, and merger/acquisition opportunities, ensuring our clients have the tools they need to succeed."
