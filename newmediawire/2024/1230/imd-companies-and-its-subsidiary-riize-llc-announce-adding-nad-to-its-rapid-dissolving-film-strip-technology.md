# iMD Companies and Its Subsidiary, Riize LLC, Announce Adding NAD+ to Its Rapid Dissolving Film Strip Technology

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - (NewMediaWire) - December 30, 2024 - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC:ICBU) and its subsidiary, Riize LLC, is pleased to announce another first for its rapid dissolving film strip technology. In January Riize LLC will begin manufacturing film strips for an NAD+ supplement.

NAD+ has become extremely popular due to the enormous attention it has received on social media, and from wellness and celebrity influencers, as an anti-aging supplement. NAD+ is a coenzyme that exists in every cell and is essential for cellular energy production, cellular health and metabolic processes, including those related to cellular aging and longevity.

NAD+ is widely available in traditional capsule and powder form however, it has not been formulated for rapidly dissolving oral strips until now. Riize Health has a well-established history of leading the way in oral strip dissolving products that deliver both prescription and non-prescription drugs and supplements with maximum effectiveness. From weight loss to sexual health (ED), to sleep and energy products, Riize Health has both the resources and expertise to create oral dissolving strips that deliver up to 90% of the active ingredients directly to the bloodstream, bypassing the stomach which inherently decreases the effectiveness of traditional supplement forms.

The new NAD+ supplement strips will not require a prescription and is expected to be available over-the-counter worldwide starting in January. January will also see the launch of 3 new Riize oral dissolving strips: Riize Sleep, Riize Energy and Riize Extra (for sexual vitality). All 3 new products will be available on the site RiizeUp.com.

Reilly Schueler, CEO of Riize LLC, states, "Once again, we are very excited to be part of bringing yet another high demand product the consumer market using our leading oral dissolving film strip experience and expertise. Given the value of the NAD+ supplement visibility and market, it's another great growth and revenue opportunity."

Rick Wilson, President and CEO of IMD Companies, Inc., states, "We couldn’t be happier with the continuance of adding great products to this industry, clientele and shareholders."
