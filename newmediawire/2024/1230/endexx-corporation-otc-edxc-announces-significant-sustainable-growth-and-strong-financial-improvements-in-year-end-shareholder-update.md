 2024: Building the Foundation for Future Success and Demonstrating Financial Resilience

 This year was about strategically repositioning Endexx for long-term success. While we faced some headwinds, we made critical strides in optimizing operations, building a robust foundation for future growth, and achieving significant improvements in our financial performance:

 * Financial Performance: We reported revenue of $1,656,000 in fiscal 2024 and a gross profit of $831,000. While there was a decrease in revenues from fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 saw an improvement in gross margins from ($880,000) in 2023 to $831,000 in 2024. Further, cash used in operating activities was reduced from $1,623,000 in 2023 to $452,000 in 2024. The improvements in margins and cash utilization demonstrate our focus on profitable product lines, commitment to operational efficiency and disciplined cost management. These strategic actions are paving the way for enhanced profitability in the coming years.
* Year-End Financial Highlights:  Revenue Generation: Despite a challenging market, we generated $1,656,000 in revenue in 2024. This demonstrates our continued market presence and the ongoing demand for our products. Cost Control: We significantly reduced our Cost of Revenues, resulting in a gross profit of $831,000 in 2024, a major improvement from a gross loss of ($880,000) in 2023. This reflects improved efficiency, a focus on profitable product lines, and strategic cost-cutting measures that are crucial for our financial sustainability. Cash Management: We reduced cash used in operating activities to $452,000 in 2024 down from $1,623,000 in 2023. This demonstrates our commitment to maintaining liquidity and managing resources effectively. Net Loss Reduction: We made substantial progress in reducing our net loss, demonstrating our focused efforts to streamline operations and improve profitability. Operational Adjustments: The adjustments made to reconcile net losses indicate proactive management of our resources and a focus on optimizing cash flow.

 Key Highlights: Setting the Stage for a Breakthrough Year

 * HYLA E-Commerce Platform: We are putting the finishing touches on our enhanced HYLA e-commerce platform. With a new distribution backend partner and a powerful marketing strategy, we anticipate a full rollout early next year, poised to drive significant consumer engagement and sales.
* Strategic Partnership with American Shaman: We've successfully launched HYLA products in 40 corporate-owned American Shaman locations, with plans to expand to their full network of 300 stores. This partnership significantly expands our domestic footprint and validates the strong market demand for our products.
* Strengthened Leadership Team: We were thrilled to welcome Doug Williams, CPA, as our Fractional CFO, bringing invaluable financial expertise and ensuring fiscal discipline. We are also incredibly honored to have Colonel Elton Johnson join our leadership team. As the founder of AmeriVet Securities and a decorated war hero, Col. Johnson brings unparalleled leadership, financial acumen, and unwavering dedication that will be instrumental in driving our strategic vision and operational excellence.

 Igniting Growth: Major Developments on the Horizon

 * Transformative Joint Venture Opportunity: We are in advanced discussions for a potentially game-changing joint venture distribution agreement with a highly respected partner renowned for its television infomercial and global e-commerce prowess. This partner boasts a remarkable track record, generating hundreds of millions in annual product sales. An offer is on the table, and while negotiations are ongoing, we are highly optimistic about finalizing this agreement, which could dramatically accelerate our growth trajectory.
* Disruptive Product Launch: Prepare for a major announcement in Q1 2025! HYLA is poised to enter a significant new market segment with a groundbreaking, nicotine-free product line. This innovative offering has the potential to disrupt a massive market â€“ and here's why it matters: the global nicotine pouches market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to reach a staggering $25.56 billion by 2030, up from approximately $3.95 billion in 2024, with a projected CAGR of 34.4% from 2025 to 2030. We believe our superior, plant-based alternative will redefine the category and significantly elevate our position in the wellness space.

 Commitment to Compliance and Transparency

 We are dedicated to strengthening shareholder confidence and upholding the highest standards of corporate governance:

 * Audit Preparation: We will initiate an audit early next year, taking a decisive step toward regaining fully reporting SEC status.
* Removing the Yield Sign: We are committed to updating our financial disclosures to remove the yield sign on OTC Markets, underscoring our commitment to operational integrity and transparency.
