HOUSTON, TX - (NewMediaWire) - September 17, 2024 - PickleJar Entertainment Group (OTCMKTS: PKLE), a leading Texas-based music and entertainment software company, today announced its new integration with OptCulture to offer Venue Partners the ability to issue on-demand loyalty campaigns via the OptCulture platform, with built-in coupons, promotional offers, and enhanced business analytics. This solution helps Venues unify customer data and loyalty initiatives across their locations and online channels for personalized, data-driven marketing and rewards.

●      Venue owners get a “360 view” of each customer with aggregated data from various sources.

●      Venues can create, distribute, and manage coupons, loyalty offers and gift cards to attract and retain customers effectively.

●      Integrated, dynamic reporting and analytics tools help Venue partners track performance, identify trends, and refine their approach.

●      Venues can create and manage their own “VIP” loyalty programs delivered through the PickleJar Live App to incentivize repeat purchases and customer referrals, fostering brand loyalty.

"We are teaming up with OptCulture to give our Venue Partners greater control of their patron marketing, enhanced rewards programs, and revenue management that comes with using our Venue Managed Services. Alongside our PickleJar Live app, the integration unlocks automated loyalty programs, on-premise activations, and unified point-of-sale offers," said Jeff James, Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer of PickleJar. "The integration helps us provide an elevated Fan experience and more value across our platform."

Introduced in late 2023, PickleJar continues to enhance its Venue Managed Service (VMS) offering which includes intelligent ticketing solutions, digital signage, broadband connectivity, live streaming and “skip the line” digital rewards. What sets VMS apart is its seamless integration across its services, leading POS systems, e-commerce platforms, and marketing tools. PickleJar’s Unified Entertainment Ecosystem eliminates implementation hassles and creates a seamless Fan experience, saving Venue Partners time and effort.

“Loyalty rewards are essential in today’s digital transformation journey of music fans, but their true value is realized only when integrated into the broader ecosystem of services and embedded into business processes,” said Amith Lulla, Chief Executive Officer of OptCulture. “Our enhanced platform addresses the critical touchpoints of Fan engagement with a Venue by offering out-of-the-box campaigns and analytics, enabling owners to fully realize the full value of PickleJar’s Venue Managed Service offering.”
