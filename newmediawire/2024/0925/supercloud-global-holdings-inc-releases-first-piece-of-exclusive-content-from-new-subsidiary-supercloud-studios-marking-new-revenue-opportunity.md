# SuperCloud Global Holdings Inc. Releases First Piece of Exclusive Content From New Subsidiary SuperCloud Studios, Marking New Revenue Opportunity

Newly Formed, Full-scale Entertainment Production Company Celebrates Pivotal Milestone Via Release of First Episode of Docuseries ‘The Journeys Within’

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - (NewMediaWire) - September 25, 2024 - – SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc., the newly formed entity resulting from the business combination of SuperCloud International and EyeOnChannel, today announced that it has released its first piece of original content from its newly formed media and entertainment arm, SuperCloud Studios in collaboration with EyeOnChannel. The release of the first episode of docuseries The Journeys Within, starring Dr. Stephen Loyd, marks a pivotal milestone in SuperCloud Global’s broader vision of creating new revenue streams by producing original content and distributing it across various platforms, including UMAXX.TV, its 5G-powered internet and live TV service.

The recently announced formation of SuperCloud Global Holdings was the result of a combination of SuperCloud International and EyeOnChannel and subsequent launch of SuperCloud Studios. SuperCloud Studios will build on EyeOnChannel’s success in creating and distributing rich content, including family-friendly and conservative-themed shows, and serve as the Company’s entertainment production subsidiary. SuperCloud Studios has greenlit three other shows and has plans to greenlight up to 25 more episodes of The Journeys Within following the positive reception of the first episode release. Beyond new productions, SuperCloud Studios is currently in discussions with leading distribution platforms about other shelved content projects that are ready for distribution and monetization including plans to leverage the content across its Live TV service UMAXX.

“With the combination of SuperCloud and EyeOnChannel complete, we’re now ready to develop an array of content that resonates with nationwide audiences while exploring new, innovative ways to monetize that content,” said Jim Devericks, Chairman and CEO of SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc. “SuperCloud Studios will focus on developing high-quality original productions, while we continue to build on the success of the existing EyeOnChannel content, to engage viewers across multiple platforms. Our unique value proposition as a production company is that we own multiple distribution platforms ourselves including UMAXX, WFS, and soon to launch UMAXX PLUS Fast channel app with access to millions of homes. Our opportunity to create value from this end-to-end supply chain of entertainment content has never been greater!”

As part of its content strategy, SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc. will look to introduce a 24-hour EyeOnChannel content stream to UMAXX.TV, which will offer viewers a continuous stream of EyeOn’s popular programming, both canned and in development. This programming will also be syndicated across various distribution platforms, including other digital and television channels, as SuperCloud Studios focuses on producing new, original content in the coming years. Shows such as The Journeys Within, which documents the opioid crisis from the eyes of those who have experienced it, and a reality cooking show Cookn’ with Fire, which follows the lives of firehouse chefs, are just a few examples of the types of original productions set to come from SuperCloud Studios.

“This business combination was about more than just leveraging existing content libraries but about building an infrastructure that will allow us to develop new programming while maximizing the reach of existing assets. SuperCloud Studios is set to become a hub for innovative content creation, giving us the flexibility to monetize through advertising, subscription models, and pay-per-view events,” added Devericks.

SuperCloud Global’s approach to content creation is centered on building sustainable revenue streams. By investing in both original programming and the enhancement of existing content, SuperCloud Studios will capitalize on diverse monetization models. The Company’s plan includes pay-per-view options, exclusive content on UMAXX.TV, and partnerships with major production houses for distribution deals on larger platforms. As part of its long-term strategy, SuperCloud Global plans to position SuperCloud Studios as a major player in the content production and entertainment space, combining its innovative approach to content creation with its powerful 5G infrastructure.

“Our goal is to establish SuperCloud Studios as a premier content creator while building new distribution pathways for our productions,” said Devericks. “With the integration of EyeOnChannel content and our commitment to original programming, we’re creating a brand that is both flexible and forward-thinking, ready to meet the needs of today’s entertainment landscape.”
