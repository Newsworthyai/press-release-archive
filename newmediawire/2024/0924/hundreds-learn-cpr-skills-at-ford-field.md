# Hundreds learn CPR skills at Ford Field

(NewMediaWire) - September 24, 2024 - DETROIT — Hundreds of Michiganders are now equipped with lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills after participating in a training hosted by the Detroit Lions and the American Heart Association on Sept. 16 at Ford Field. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die. A major factor is the lack of immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 This is the second stadium training hosted by the Detroit Lions and the American Heart Association, celebrating 100 years of lifesaving service as a global force for healthier lives for all, to add lifesavers to the chain of survival which includes early recognition, calling 911, administering high-quality CPR, and having access to, and using an automated external defibrillator (AED). Participants completed one of two course options: the American Heart Association’s Heartsaver® CPR course, which provides the highest quality evidence-based training in the lifesaving skills of CPR, as well as the appropriate use of an AED or, Hands-Only CPR education which has been shown to be as effective in the first few minutes as conventional CPR for cardiac arrest at home, at work or in public.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency is the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Detroit Lions is helping to support that critical link in the community” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate 100 years of lifesaving work, we know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 Those who complete the training are empowered to act in the event of a cardiac emergency at work, home or in the community. Participants used the Association’s CPR in Youth Sports Kits which include manikins and AED training tools. The kits will be donated to the community to continue education efforts.

 “We are honored to use our platform and resources to partner with the American Heart Association to further bring awareness on the importance of learning CPR,” said Detroit Lions Vice President of Detroit Lions Foundation and Community Relations Roxanne Caine. "Just as every play matters in sports, every action in CPR can be lifesaving. Together, we're building a stronger community and equipping individuals with the essential skills they need to make a vital difference.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. More than 350,000 people in the US have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest every year. CPR, especially if performed immediately, could double or triple a cardiac arrest victim’s chance of survival.
