# JumpTech Reimagines and Launches New Digital Service Ecosystem for Global Car Manufacturer Audi

Enterprise Digitization Company Develops and Releases Four-Part, Comprehensive Digital Platform for Audi

 SINGAPORE - (NewMediaWire) - September 24, 2024 - JumpTech Solutions, Corp. (“JumpTech” or “Company”), a global leader in enterprise digitization and mobile solution development, today announced the successful development and launch of Audi’s After Sales Digital Experience. This extensive digital ecosystem upgrade included the development of three mobile apps, a web app, an advanced Content Management System, and a robust server architecture, all designed to deliver an intuitive post-sales experience for both consumers and employees of the renowned brand.

 Until this project, Audi’s primary service app in Singapore was managed by a distributor and the car company sought to bring this important tool in-house. Beyond the need to regain control of the tool, Audi wanted to enhance its service segement’s digital infrastructure to improve functionality and cohesiveness throughout the service supply chain. For the consumer-facing application, Audi wanted to create a single touchpoint for everything from service history, upcoming appointments, and roadside assistance to post-service solutions such as accessory shops and educational resources that allow Audi owners to get the most out of their vehicles. To support the consumer-facing application, the project included the development of an internal desktop and mobile system designed for use by employees in the service center that provided real-time vehicle tracking and optimization/automation of automotive servicing operations, while providing a feedback loop to consumers. Finally, adding an additional layer of complexity to the project, the new digital solution needed to integrate other legacy platforms throughout the company seamlessly and implementation needed to take place in the midst of operations.

 JumpTech initiated the project by conducting extensive market research, including interviews with previous users including customers and employees, analyzing usage data, and engaging in detailed discussions with Audi stakeholders on what they need in an all-encompassing digital solution. Utilizing its agile-first development methodology, JumpTech planned, developed, and launched the new four-pronged digital ecosystem in under a year, with an on-time rollout and near 100% uptime.

 "Audi is a luxury brand where the customer experience matters just as much as the functionality and we needed to build a product that lived up to that standard,” said S. Mohan, CEO of JumpTech Solutions. “This project was just as much about the technicals as it was about learning what the customers wanted and creating a product that exceeded expectations. We were able to leverage insights from the legacy application to understand its shortcomings which provided us a strategic blueprint for what we imagined from the new system. The result was three mobile applications, a web-based application, an advanced CMS, and all of the necessary server architecture required for such a system. I could not be more pleased with the outcome of this project and believe it uniquely highlights the core competencies of our organization."

 The centerpiece of the after-sales system built by JumpTech is the The Audi Digital Command Center, an advanced CMS tool for managing customers, tracking queries, scheduling servicing appointments, overseeing team availability, managing the Audi accessories store, managing in-app promotions, and monitoring various car variants. It also provides real-time insights into service center operations, including employee activity, capacity, and shift timing. The system works seamlessly across Audi’s entire digital universe while transferring real-time data and analytics to customers and employees systems throughout the supply chain. JumpTech continues to provide Audi with support on the applications, improving them wherever possible and scaling the systems as needed to meet demand.
