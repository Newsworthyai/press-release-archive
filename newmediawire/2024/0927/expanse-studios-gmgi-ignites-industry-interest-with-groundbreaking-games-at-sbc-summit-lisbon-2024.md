LISBON, Portugal - (NewMediaWire) - September 27, 2024 - Expanse Studios, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI), today announced its triumphant participation in the SBC Summit Lisbon 2024, held from September 24-26 at the Feira Internacional de Lisboa. The event, which saw a record-breaking attendance of 25,000 industry professionals, served as a launchpad for Expanse Studios' latest innovations, catalyzing discussions with over 20 potential partners.

"Our presence at SBC Summit Lisbon 2024 has been nothing short of extraordinary," said Damjan Stamenkovic, CEO of Expanse Studios. "The unprecedented scale of this year's event in Lisbon provided an ideal backdrop for us to showcase our cutting-edge games and engage with key industry players. We're thrilled to report that our booth was a hub of activity, with more than 20 operators expressing keen interest in our offerings and engaging in promising talks about potential collaborations."

Expanse Studios exhibited in Hall 2, where the company introduced two game-changing titles that captivated attendees:

●      "Beach Penalties" - Expanse Studios' first game specifically designed and launched for the social casino category, marking a significant milestone in the company's strategic expansion into the rapidly growing social gaming market. While Expanse's extensive portfolio has always been adaptable for social casino platforms, "Beach Penalties" represents the studio's first title tailored from the ground up for this segment.

●      "Super Heli" - A high-octane crash game dubbed "the diamond of crash games" by the public, that generated incredible buzz among operators and players alike.

Both titles garnered substantial attention, reflecting the industry's growing appetite for innovative gaming content that pushes boundaries and engages players in new ways.

Stamenkovic added, "The enthusiastic reception of 'Beach Penalties' and 'Super Heli at SBC Summit Lisbon validates our strategic direction. By expanding into social gaming and elevating the crash game experience, we're not just growing our portfolio – we're opening new avenues for engagement and revenue in the iGaming space."

The level of interest shown by operators at the event underscores Expanse Studios' growing influence in the iGaming sector. With the number of talks and pending agreements, the company is optimistic about the prospects these discussions present for future growth and market expansion.

Expanse Studios continues to expand its diverse portfolio, which now includes over 50 games spanning slots, crash games, social casino games, and turn-based strategy games. The company's mobile-first approach and strategic partnerships with operators and aggregators position it for continued growth in the global iGaming market.
