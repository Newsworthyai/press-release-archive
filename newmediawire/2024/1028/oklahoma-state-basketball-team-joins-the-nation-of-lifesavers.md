# Oklahoma State basketball team joins the Nation of Lifesavers

(NewMediaWire) - October 28, 2024 - STILLWATER, Okla. — The Oklahoma State University (OSU) men’s basketball team participated in an American Heart Association Hands-Only CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training to learn the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency. Learning Hands-Only CPR is the skill needed to join the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ movement, which is focused on doubling survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest by 2030. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 of people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 In addition to learning this lifesaving skill, OSU basketball integrated CPR into its Saturday, Oct. 26 game at Gallagher-Iba Arena against Southern Methodist University (SMU) where the team raised funds to support the lifesaving mission of the American Heart Association, through the Eddie Sutton Foundation.

 During the game the OSU basketball team donated two American Heart Association CPR in Schools kits, underwritten by Devon Energy, to Stillwater High School and Pawnee High School. These kits include training manikins and AED training resources that will continue to deliver community education teaching the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency is the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Oklahoma State University is helping to support that critical link in the community” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate 100 years of lifesaving work, we know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. More than 350,000 people in the US have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest every year.

 “Our team is honored to participate in this important training,” said OSU men’s basketball coach Steve Lutz. “Learning Hands-Only CPR is a skill that extends beyond the court and into our everyday lives. We are proud to support the American Heart Association’s mission to save lives.”

 In Oklahoma, the American Heart Association, as part of the Smart Hearts Sports Coalition, advocated for a statewide policy that will require cardiac emergency response plans (CERPs) in all public schools and school athletic facilities. On April 8, advocates from across the state converged on the state Capitol to advocate for this lifesaving policy. Current OSU manager DeShawn Caldwell served as an advocate alongside the American Heart Association in the efforts to pass Bill 1921. Caldwell knows firsthand the importance of CPR as eight years ago, he was spared by the quick actions of his high school coaches after collapsing during a practice session. In addition to Caldwell, other OSU support was provided by Dr. Johnny Stephens, OSU Center for Health Sciences and Interim President, Carson Sager OSU basketball player, and Micaela Wark, OSU women’s softball player. Now successfully passed and signed by Governor Kevin Stitt on July 10, 2024, this means that 1,805 public school sites in the state supporting 698,696 students, 42,551 teachers and additional administrators, staff and school visitors will be better prepared to respond in a cardiac emergency. Schools are currently working to implement these lifesaving plans.

 The American Heart Association is a founding member of the Smart Heart Sports Coalition established by the NFL in 2023. The coalition is actively advocating for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based public policies that will prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. According to the American Heart Association, as many as 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac outside of a hospital annually, and about 40% of those occur among student-athletes. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes nationwide.
