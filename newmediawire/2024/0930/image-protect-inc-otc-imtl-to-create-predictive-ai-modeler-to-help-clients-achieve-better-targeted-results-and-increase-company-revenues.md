# Image Protect, Inc. (OTC:IMTL) to Create Predictive AI Modeler to Help Clients Achieve Better Targeted Results and Increase Company Revenues

NEW YORK, NY - (NewMediaWire) - September 30, 2024 - Image Protect, Inc. (OTC:IMTL) (Imageprotectcorporation.com) (“Image Protect” or the “Company”), through its subsidiaries, Review Control Reputation Management and 2CentTexts.com, is happy to inform shareholders that it is moving forward with development of its new Generative AI programming to help clients assimilate important consumer data to assist in targeted marketing campaigns.

This is a very lucrative and logical next step in the company’s quest to provide the very best in digital management tools for its valued customers and will seamlessly bring together the most important aspects of the company’s two main subsidiaries, creating better results for its clients and an additional revenue-generating service.

Incoming CEO Frank Casella said: “With all our combined services, including tracking lines, review management, text marketing, and digital marketing services for our clients, we needed a way to assimilate all this valuable data and give our clients a much more granular picture of their customer revenues, as well as to maximize their business relationships with those customers. A predictive modeler, driven by generative AI, is the perfect solution to achieve this goal. The product will represent an additional revenue center for the company while providing a more successful relationship with our clients. We estimate additional annual spend should be $2,400 to $3,600 annually per client. Based upon our interim marketing goals for new client procurement, this can translate into an additional $2.4 to $3.6 million annually and grow with our market penetration plans in specific business verticals as stated in our marketing plans. In the aggregate, all-in spending by our clients will now more easily allow the company to hit revenue projections over the next 24 months. There is a lot of business to be done with all the service verticals and independent retailers, and we plan to penetrate those spaces with the very best in business-to-business services that are needed for our clients’ growth and success.”

The Company will keep shareholders informed as this new AI technology is integrated into the current subsidiary platforms.

Image Protect, Inc. remains committed to innovation, growth, and delivering unparalleled solutions in the dynamic landscape of online reputation management and text marketing business services.
