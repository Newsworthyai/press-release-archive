BOULDER, Colo. - (NewMediaWire) - September 30, 2024 - Auddia Inc. (NASDAQ:AUUD) (NASDAQ:AUUDW) (“Auddia” or the “Company”), a proprietary AI platform for audio identification and classification and related technologies, reinventing how consumers engage with AM/FM radio, podcasts, and other audio content, today announced it has grown its total available stations within the faidr app to over 13,000 AM/FM stations, more than 9,000 of which are ad-free for subscribers.

“We’re constantly iterating and optimizing the experience for our free users and subscribers, and this recent addition is a prime example of that,” said Michael Lawless, Auddia’s CEO. “Having a full inventory of US and Canadian stations was the goal of this most recent push. International stations will come next year, and we’re excited to begin the expansion into other regions.”

In addition to doubling its available stations in faidr, Auddia recently introduced two groundbreaking podcast features: Forward+ and Chapter Visualization, enhancing the podcast listening experience. Forward+ allows users to skip entire segments with a single touch, while Chapter Visualization displays segment breaks within the progress bar, making navigation more intuitive. These industry-first features offer listeners a more efficient and intelligent way to engage with their favorite podcasts.

Auddia will be releasing a new music-only AI model in Q4 that will give faidr users the choice of listening to only music on their favorite music focused AM/FM stations. Also in Q4, the Company will be releasing its first gamification features in the app.
