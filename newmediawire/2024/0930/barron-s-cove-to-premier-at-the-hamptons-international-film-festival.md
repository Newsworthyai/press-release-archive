BARRON’S COVE tells the story of a grieving father, Garrett Hedlund (TRON: LEGACY), with a violent past, whose life is shattered by the tragic death of his young son. Consumed with the need for answers, he kidnaps the child, Christian Convery (SWEET TOOTH), that he believes is responsible for his son’s death, igniting a frenzied manhunt fueled by the kidnapped boy’s powerful politician father, Hamish Linklater (THE BIG SHORT).

Brittany Snow (PITCH PERFECT) plays a heartbroken mother struggling to find peace while caught in a web of distrust. Stephen Lang (AVATAR) stars as a ruthless uncle with a criminal enterprise, using power and influence to control those around him.

Writer/director Evan Ari Kelman's twisty feature debut is a gripping thriller about a flawed father's devotion to his son and the complicated nature of revenge.
