# PetVivo Holdings, Inc. Announces Participation at The Spartan Capital Investor Conference Premier Event to Showcase Growth Companies and Foster High-Level Investor Engagement

MINNEAPOLIS - ([NewMediaWire](https://www.newmediawire.com)) - October 16, 2024 - PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: PETV, PETVW), a leading provider of biomedical therapeutics for equines and companion animals, is proud to announce its participation in Spartan Capital Securities, LLC's inaugural investor conference on November 4th at the prestigious Pierre Hotel in New York.This participation aligns with our commitment to engage with industry leaders and investors. Our presentation will offer insight into our company's growth strategy and market position.

John Lai, Chief Executive Officer for PetVivo, commented, "We are pleased to be invited and to present at Spartan Capital's inaugural investor conference. This event provides an excellent platform to showcase our company and keep the key influencers in the capital markets apprised of our accomplishments and future plans."

Mr. Lai intends to provide an overview of PetVivo Holdings, Inc. as well as discuss its lead product, SPRYNG™ with OsteoCushion™ Technology. Spryng is an intra-articular injectable veterinary medical device composed of sterilized, extra-cellular matrix microparticles. The microparticles of Spryng have been found to adsorb onto the joint synovial lining of animals and subsequently integrate with the animal’s subsynovial tissue. Such action promotes the restoration of proper joint mechanics, thereby aiding in the management of noninfectious sources of joint pain such as joint instability, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis.

The conference, organized in partnership with B2i Digital, a leading digital marketing firm specializing in investor communications, will feature presentations from over 30 carefully selected companies. The event will include panel discussions, one-on-one meetings, and networking sessions to maximize interactions between investors and presenters.

“We’re privileged to welcome PetVivo Holdings, Inc. to this pivotal event and showcase their accomplishment on b2idigital.com and with our 950K+ sophisticated investor community across social media,” added David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital.

Lowry, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, stated, "Our inaugural investor conference commemorates Spartan Capital's 17 years as a trusted leader in the capital markets.
