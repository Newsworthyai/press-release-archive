# NFL Player Ambassadors urge fans to learn lifesaving CPR in 90 seconds

(NewMediaWire) - October 16, 2024 - DALLAS — More than half of all people who experiencing sudden cardiac arrest outside of hospital don’t receive immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). As a result, 9 out of 10 times they die[1]. Yet it takes just 90 seconds to learn the fundamentals of Hands-Only CPR to save a life. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival. To save more lives, the American Heart Association and the National Football League (NFL) are actively putting boots on the ground - cleats on the field - to educate more Americans about this lifesaving skill.

 More Americans than ever say they are now ready to perform CPR in emergencies, according to newly released survey data from the American Heart Association, celebrating 100 years of lifesaving service as a global force for healthier lives for all[2]. Recent efforts by the Association to create a Nation of Lifesavers™ with partners like the NFL have boosted CPR readiness. The percentage of surveyed adults in the U.S. who say they now feel they have the confidence to perform CPR increased from 30% to 35% from 2021 to 2023[3]. In observance of World Restart a Heart Day, which takes place annually on Oct. 16, the Association unveils its 2024-2025 Nation of Lifesaver Ambassador Class, comprised of current NFL players, who will continue to support efforts to build awareness of lifesaving CPR. Ambassadors will support the Heart Association’s call to action to learn CPR by amplifying public service announcements (PSAs), social media content and local community education events.

 The American Heart Association launched the Nation of Lifesavers™ movement in 2023 following the sudden cardiac arrest of Buffalo Bills’ player Damar Hamlin during Monday Night Football™. As the global leader in creating resuscitation science, education and training and with more than 60 years of CPR education and training experience, the Association also publishes the official guidelines for CPR. The Nation of Lifesavers and the collaboration with the NFL is the Association’s most recent demonstration of its commitment to CPR education with the goal to double survival rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by 2030[4].

 “CPR education is crucial to saving lives and improving outcomes in a cardiac emergency,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “At the American Heart Association, our health is about improving yours. Together with the NFL and this ambassador class, we are proud to empower communities to act fast and be ready and able to respond with the lifesaving skill of CPR.

 Members of the 2024-2025 Nation of Lifesaver Ambassador Class are:

 * Arizona Cardinals - DeeJay Dallas, running back
* Atlanta Falcons - Bradley Pinion, punter
* Buffalo Bills - Damar Hamlin, safety. In addition to representing the Bills, Hamlin also serves as National Ambassador for the Nation of Lifesavers.
* Carolina Panthers - Johnny Hekker, punter
* Chicago Bears - Gerald Everett, tight end
* Cincinnati Bengals - Chris Evans, running back
* Cincinnati Bengals - Kris Jenkins, defensive tackle
* Cleveland Browns - Denzel Ward, cornerback
* Los Angeles Rams - Demarcus Robinson, wide receiver
* New Orleans Saints - Johnathan Abram, safety
* New York Giants - Devin Singletary, running back

 “The NFL is proud to continue its partnership with the American Heart Association to ensure that the entire NFL family can serve as lifesavers during medical emergencies,” said Anna Isaacson, NFL senior vice president of social responsibility. “We look forward to working with our Nation of Lifesaver Player Ambassadors to expand access to essential CPR training and education in communities across the country.”

 To further bring CPR training to the community level, the NFL Foundation provides CPR grants to each team to help increase CPR access in community neighborhoods. The grants have already funded Hands-Only CPR training, Heartsaver® CPR AED (automated external defibrillator), placement of CPR in Schools Kits and CPR Youth Sports Kits. Each team worked to create a plan customized to the needs of their local market. Additionally, the 32 NFL teams received NFL Foundation funds to place AEDs directly in local youth sports programs, schools and community parks and playgrounds. Since January 2023, the American Heart Association specifically has worked alongside the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears, Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Rams, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans.

 In addition to the community education opportunities through the NFL clubs, the Nation of Lifesavers Mobile CPR Unit appeared at Super Bowls LVII and LVIII and the 2023 and 2024 NFL Drafts, extending the opportunity to learn Hands-Only CPR to the thousands of fans in attendance. The Mobile CPR Unit will appear at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans and the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

 The collaboration also helps kids to learn how they can play a role in strengthening the chain of survival. According to the American Heart Association, kids as young as 9 can perform CPR while children as young as 4 can support by calling 911[5]. The NFL is also supporting kid-focused CPR education through the American Heart Association’s in-school programs, Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™. Students who learn Hands-Only CPR through the program can win Super Bowl tickets and their school can be eligible for a $10,000 physical education makeover as part of the collaboration to inspire Hands-Only CPR adoption. The 2024 NFL season marks the second season of this work with the winners of the 2023 season unveiled on Sept. 19, 2024.

 The American Heart Association is also a founding member of the Smart Heart Sports Coalition established by the NFL in 2023. The coalition is actively advocating for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based public policies that will prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. According to the American Heart Association, as many as 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac outside of a hospital annually, and about 40% of those occur among student-athletes. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes nationwide.

 With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. If a teen or adult collapses, witnesses should immediately call 9-1-1 emergency services and begin chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 beats per minute and a depth of approximately two inches. Hands-Only CPR is chest compression-only CPR. Learn CPR today, visit www.heart.org/nation.
