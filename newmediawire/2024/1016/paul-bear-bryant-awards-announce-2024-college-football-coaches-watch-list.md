# Paul  Bear  Bryant Awards announce 2024 college football coaches watch list

(NewMediaWire) - October 16, 2024 - HOUSTON — Twenty-seven college football coaches make up the American Heart Association’s 2024 Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award watch list, a list of current coaches in consideration for the annual top honor. The award, given each January to a college football coach, recognizes contributions that make the sport better for athletes and fans alike by demonstrating grit, integrity and a winning approach to coaching and life – both on and off the field.

 The American Heart Association, the leading voluntary health organization devoted to a world of longer, healthier lives for all for more than 100 years, and the Bryant family present this award annually to celebrate Bear Bryant’s legacy and raise awareness and critical funds for scientific research to eliminate needless suffering and death from cardiovascular disease and stroke, the leading causes of death globally. The football coaching legend died from a heart attack in 1983.

 Now in its 39th year, the Coach of the Year award winner will be announced live from Houston’s Post Oak Hotel on Wednesday, January 22, 2025, during an awards ceremony presented by Marathon Oil.
