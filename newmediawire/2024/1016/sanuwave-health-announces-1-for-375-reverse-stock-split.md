Information for SANUWAVE Stockholders

Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every 375 shares of issued and outstanding Company common stock at the close of business on October 17, 2024, will be automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, with no change in par value per share. In connection with the reverse stock split, there will be no change to the total number of authorized shares of Company common stock as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares that would have resulted from the reverse stock split will be settled in cash. The reverse stock split will affect all common stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s common stock, except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in some stockholders experiencing an adjustment of a fractional share as described above.

Record holders of Company common stock will receive a transaction statement with respect to the exchange of such shares for post-reverse split shares. Stockholders holding stock certificates will receive information from Securities Transfer Corporation (“STC”), the transfer agent for the Company’s common stock, regarding the process for exchanging their shares of common stock.
