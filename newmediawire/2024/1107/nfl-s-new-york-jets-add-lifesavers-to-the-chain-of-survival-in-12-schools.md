# NFL s New York Jets add lifesavers to the chain of survival in 12 schools

(NewMediaWire) - November 07, 2024 - NEW YORK— The American Heart Association and the New York Jets gathered representatives from 12 local schools for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training on Nov. 6 at Mahwah High School in Mahwah, New Jersey. According to American Heart Association data, Nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable to begin administering CPR. This event with the New York Jets is helping to support that critical link in the community,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate 100 years of lifesaving work, we know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 The schools receiving CPR in Schools kits are:

 * Eric S. Smith Middle School, Ramsey, New Jersey
* Mahwah High School, Mahwah, New Jersey
* Northern Highlands High School, Allendale, New Jersey
* Paramus East Brook Middle School, Paramus, New Jersey
* Park Ridge High School, Park Rodge, New Jersey
* Pascack Hills High School, Montvale, New Jersey
* Pascack Valley High School, Hillsdale, New Jersey
* Prospect Park School Number Two, Prospect Park, New Jersey
* Ramapo Indian Hills High School- Oakland, New Jersey
* Ramapo Ridge Middle School, Mahwah, New Jersey
* River Dell High School, Oradell, New Jersey
* Roy W. Brown Middle School, Bergenfield, New Jersey

 In addition to the training, the Jets are donating resources for schools to bring these lifesaving skills back to their campuses and continue to build confidence and capabilities to respond in cardiac emergency. Each of the 12 schools received a CPR in Schools kit and three of the schools attending received an AED- Mahwah High School, Pascack Hills High School and Northern Highlands High School. The CPR in Schools kits include 10 Hands-Only CPR manikins and 10 AED training tools and curriculum to train additional students, faculty, staff and parents. The attending representatives learned the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use their new resources.

 Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “The Jets are excited to partner with the American Heart Association to provide resources for local communities to address cardiac emergencies” said Jesse Linder, New York Jets vice president of Community Relations. “Access to CPR training and AED units is critical to saving lives."

 Last year, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.
