# iMD Companies and Its Subsidiary Riize Health Announce Official Product Line Launch of Riize Hair

RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. - (NewMediaWire) - November 07, 2024 - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC:ICBU) and its subsidiary Riize LLC (Riize Health) is pleased to announce the launch of its Riize Hair product line.

On Friday, October 25, 2024, Riize Health began selling Riize Hair, an advanced hair loss solution for men, through its telemedicine platform of licensed health care professionals. The proprietary formula in the Riize Hair products combines the most effective FDA approved prescription hair growth ingredients available - minoxidil, finasteride and biotin.

The Riize Hair product is being made available in either topical drops or oral dissolving strips. The products will be offered in 3 different monthly package configurations - individually as drops, individually as strips, or as a combined package of both drops and strips.

With the unique proprietary formula and the introduction of an oral dissolving delivery system, giving superior bioavailability, Riize Hair represents an innovative product approach to the 7+ billion-dollar male hair loss market, as Riize Health continues to bring product innovation forward with its proven expertise in oral dissolving thin film delivery systems.

"We're excited about the opportunity to bring something truly unique to market when it comes to male hair loss products as well as our entire product line," states Reilly Schueler, CEO of Riize Health. "We look forward to continued expansion with Riize Hair, as well as future products.  We are just getting started and look forward to giving our clients state of the art delivered products."

Rick Wilson, President and CEO of iMD Companies, Inc., states that, "Having a new product with a different delivery mechanism is a game changer.  For those who don’t want to use drops and can use the strips or the option of both is truly catering to our clients.  We are so excited about this and can’t wait to carve out our slice of the pie.  Our entire line of products is disruptive, and we are excited for our future.”

As a welcoming statement, we’re inviting new clients and shareholders to go to our website at https://www.riizehealth.com/, use Promo Code ICBU50, and save 50% on all first month's orders.
