# Ladybug Continues to Accelerate Growth Targeting Strategic Acquisitions

TULSA, Okla. - (NewMediaWire) - November 07, 2024 - Ladybug Resource Group, Inc. (OTC PINK: LBRG), now operating as Ladybug Nutratech, a leading player in the health and wellness products sector, continues to accelerate revenue growth, across all business sectors.

Ladybug's recent announcement of $6.0 million in revenue growth marks a remarkable 10,527% increase over the same period last year, highlighting the Company's commitment to strategic innovation and market expansion.  This strong growth trajectory, coupled with the results of the U.S. elections, unlocks new opportunities for securing capital to support significant growth and Ladybug’s strategic acquisitions of e-commerce nutritional companies.

Ladybug's year-to-date performance in the first half of 2024 showcases robust revenue growth driven by a suite of strategic initiatives.  These include the launch of new product lines, strategic acquisitions, and the introduction of NutraBuddy, an AI-powered eCommerce platform aimed at attracting over 10 million users within its first-year post-launch.  Ladybug continues prioritizing online marketing and sales, focusing on innovative products that integrate nutritional and pharmaceutical elements to provide unparalleled simplicity for their customers to achieve and maintain comprehensive health benefits.  In an era marked by a rising awareness of health and wellness and an aging population seeking natural, preventative solutions, the nutraceutical industry has seen a surge in demand.  This trend is further propelled by the convenience of e-commerce, allowing consumers easy access to a wide range of nutritional options from home.

James Kurko, Chairman and CEO of Ladybug Resources, proudly commented on the continued growth results, " We are pleased with these results and look forward to remarkable financial performance in 2024, anticipating new growth opportunities and complementary strategic acquisitions."
