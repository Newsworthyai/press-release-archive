# ZenaTech Participates in Taiwan Trade Mission to Open First Asian Office for ZenaDrone AI Drone Sensor and Component Manufacturing

TORONTO, Ontario - (NewMediaWire) - November 07, 2024 - ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, announces that company principals are currently participating in a Trade Mission to Taipei, Taiwan as part of an Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) delegation, with the goal of opening a manufacturing office for its previously announced Spider Vision Sensors Ltd. subsidiary.

This subsidiary will manufacture drone sensors and components to be integrated with ZenaDrone multifunction autonomous AI drones, manufactured at company facilities in Sharjah, UAE, and future facilities in Phoenix, Arizona. ZenaTech’s CEO and CTO are in Taiwan finalizing manufacturing office facilities, meeting with potential partners, and completing registration tasks to establish and open this company in November.

“We are pleased to be expanding company operations to our first Asian location by setting up a drone component manufacturing office in Taiwan. It is critical to ensure our drone sensors and components are cost-effective and come from US-friendly countries so that we can achieve NDAA compliance and approved supplier status to sell to the US military. Spider Vision Sensors will provide a reliable supply of input components for our drones destined for US military customers, which will be manufactured in Arizona,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.

Spider Vision Sensors will manufacture drone sensors, electronics, and components such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), thermal, infrared, multi-spectral, and hyper sensors, cameras, and PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). Taiwan was selected due to its size and skills as an electronics hub, and the availability of low-cost alternative components versus those from China.

NDAA compliance refers to adhering to the provisions outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act, which is a U.S. federal law that specifies the budget and expenditures for the Department of Defense (DoD). The Blue USA program is a stringent government-approved supplier list of drone companies that wish to do business with the DoD; suppliers must meet strict NDAA cyber security and supply chain sourcing requirements.

The ACA is the State of Arizona’s economic development organization and a longstanding partner of ZenaDrone.
