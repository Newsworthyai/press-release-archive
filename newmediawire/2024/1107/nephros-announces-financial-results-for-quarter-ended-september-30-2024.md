# Nephros Announces Financial Results for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024

Third-Quarter Net Revenue of $3.5 Million;

 Operational Improvements Result In First Profitable Quarter

 SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. - (NewMediaWire) - November 07, 2024 - Nephros, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEPH), a leading water technology company providing filtration solutions to the medical and commercial markets, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Financial Highlights*

 ●      Net income of $0.2 million, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million

 ●      Adjusted EBITDA of $295,000, compared to $11,000

 ●      Net revenue of $3.5 million, an 8% increase over Q2 2024; a decrease of 6% over Q3 prior year

 *Stated performance is relative to same period in the prior year unless otherwise noted.

 “I am very excited to report our first profitable quarter, marking a major milestone in our pursuit of achieving operational excellence. I am also pleased to report we had positive-adjusted EBITDA for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024,” stated Robert Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Although most of our sales regions showed solid growth and steady performance with existing customers, our [South Central] region continued to miss expectations, which resulted in some reorganization. Additionally, a handful of our larger accounts exhibited slower-than-usual ordering patterns, as demonstrated by a slight decrease in same-site sales. We continue to push forward with actions designed to mitigate the reduction in programmatic reorders, as outlined during our previous earnings call.”

 Mr. Banks continued, “While Nephros prepares to launch digital support for filter installation, we are ramping up our service capabilities to foster installation commissions and complement filter sales. We believe these efforts will offset customer non-compliance with filter changeout schedules.”

 Financial Performance for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024

 Net revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $3.5 million, compared to $3.7 million in the corresponding period in 2023, a decrease of 6%. The third quarter of 2023 was one of our largest quarters by revenue ever, with several new accounts placing initial orders of significant size. Although those 2023 customers have continued to order, their 2024 replacement orders have been smaller by comparison. Another contributing factor to our decreased quarterly revenue was underperformance across our South Central region, despite an 8% increase from our prior quarter.

 Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $1.4 million, compared with $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 12%. Gross margins for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were 61% compared to 59% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reflecting improved terms with our largest supplier.

 Research and development expenses for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were $0.2 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $34,000, compared with approximately $55,000 for the corresponding period in 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $1.7 million compared to $2.1 million during the same period in 2023 due to a decline in stock compensation and bonus accruals.

 Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $0.2 million, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net loss was driven by decreased operating expenses reflecting a reduction in bonus accrual and stock compensation expense. Additionally, we continue our intense focus on managing expenses and working toward improving efficiency with the aim of providing our unique products and services in a more streamlined manner.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $295,000, compared to $11,000 during the same period in 2023 reflecting primarily our operating profit for the quarter.

 As of September 30, 2024, Nephros had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 million, compared to $4.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decline in cash from year-end 2023 was driven primarily by the operating loss for the first half of 2024, as well as payment of annual employee bonuses and an investment in inventory in the first quarter of 2024.

 Adjusted EBITDA Definition and Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net loss calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and excluding all interest-related expenses and income, tax-related expenses and income, non-recurring expenses and income, and non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, non-cash inventory write-offs, and non-cash compensation. The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the third quarter and year to date of the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years:

Management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in Nephros’ financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. To compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with net income loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Nephros urges investors to review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income loss and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.
