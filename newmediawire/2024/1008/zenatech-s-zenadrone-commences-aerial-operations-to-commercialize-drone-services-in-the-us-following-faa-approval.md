# ZenaTech's ZenaDrone Commences Aerial Operations to Commercialize Drone Services in the US Following FAA Approval

TORONTO, Ontario - (NewMediaWire) - October 08, 2024 - ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, today announced that its subsidiary, ZenaDrone, has commenced aerial operations to launch commercial drone services in the US. This was made possible due to recently achieving Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) exemption approval.

 ZenaDrone will be setting up Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) operations, initially through its Phoenix, Arizona office, making its drone hardware and software solutions available to customers for use in land surveying, inspection, monitoring, tracking, and other applications using the ZenaDrone 1000 product. As part of these operations, the company will be building up flight hours and airworthiness accreditation required for full commercial operations.

 The Company is currently completing the FAA application process to receive an aerial spraying license (14 CFR Part 137) to use ZenaDrone 1000 for plant nourishment, soil treatment, and pest control purposes in agriculture settings.

 “After over a year and a half of application submission and approval timelines, and preparation to ensure we can operate in compliance with FAA requirements, we are excited to be able to commence operations for commercial services and revenue generation in the US,” said CEO Dr. Shaun Passley, Ph.D. “We are hopeful this work will pave the way for similar regulatory approvals in additional countries where we’ve applied and seek to operate in the future.”

 The company previously announced that ZenaDrone had been granted an exemption by the FAA for visual line-of-sight commercial applications and data collection in the US, subject to specified conditions and limitations. This approval enables live testing, evaluation, and demonstration of ZenaDrone 1000 with US-based customers and partners. The company will begin testing for beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) use at an overseas location in the next few months.

 The ZenaDrone 1000 is an autonomous drone product designed for stable flight, maneuverability, heavy lift capabilities, incorporating innovative software technology, AI, sensors, and purpose-built attachments, along with compact and rugged hardware engineered for industrial use. It has been used in the agriculture sector enabling smart farming, plant tracking, and crop management. ZenaDrone’s products have also been piloted in the field with the US military for delivery of temperature-controlled critical medical supplies.
