# Free estate planning webinar provides tools for a secure financial future

(NewMediaWire) - October 08, 2024 - DALLAS — An estimated $84.4 trillion worth of financial assets will be transferred through estates over the next few decades according to recent data[1]. In honor of National Estate Planning Awareness Week (Oct. 21-27), the American Heart Association, celebrating 100 years of lifesaving service, will offer a free webinar to help individuals navigate estate planning. The event will take place virtually on Tuesday, Oct. 22 at 2 p.m. (EDT) / 1 p.m. (CDT) / 11 a.m. (PDT). Participants will learn how to establish financial plans now to securely protect themselves, their loved ones and assets when they are no longer able to.

 This interactive event will cover the basic principles of financial planning for the future, offer free planning tools and resources to help you create or update your plan, as well as specific information on how a charitable bequest can leave a meaningful gift to the American Heart Association, as well as other organizations close to the heart. The free webinar will be hosted by Ed Rodbro, CAP®, senior charitable estate planning advisor, and feature speakers Cuthill Financial Group principal, Kevin C. Cuthill and Pitcairn Trust Company’s managing director of fiduciary and legal services, Leslie K. Heffernen. Participants will have an opportunity to ask the experts questions live.

 “National Estate Planning Awareness Week enables the American Heart Association to provide this tremendous resource to help people make informed financial planning decisions,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and former executive vice president and chief diversity officer for The PNC Financial Services Group. “We invite individuals from across the country to join us as we celebrate our first century milestone and intentionally plan to help secure a bold future where everyone, everywhere can live longer, healthier lives.”

 In its centennial year, the Association is celebrating the improvements in health outcomes it has contributed to over the last one hundred years – including cutting the death rate from cardiovascular disease in half. As it enters its second century, the Association remains relentlessly focused on saving and improving lives through groundbreaking scientific research and public health and public policy education. Planned giving can have a remarkable impact on saving lives. For example, more than $3 billion contributed from planned gifts alone means the American Heart Association can sustain its historic ability to serve as the No. 1 non-governmental funder of cardiovascular scientific research, contributing more than $5 billion in research funding since 1949. Specifically, American Heart Association donors who choose to give a legacy gift through charitable estate planning are recognized for their leadership as members of the Paul Dudley White Legacy Society. The group was named in honor of one of the American Heart Association founders who today is widely regarded as the father of preventative cardiology. Dr. White’s vision of a world with better research, treatment and education helped the Association emerge as the world-renowned leader in cardiovascular care. His vision continues to drive the organization’s work into the next century.

 Advanced online registration for the webinar is required.
