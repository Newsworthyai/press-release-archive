# Physical activity boosting resources support classroom performance

(NewMediaWire) - September 04, 2024 - DALLAS — This back to school season, the American Heart Association and the National Football League (NFL), in collaboration with its 32 NFL clubs, are offering students exciting ways to move more with NFL PLAY 60™. Physical activity is vital for youth health and well-being, especially as students return to school. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, active kids learn better, focus more, think more clearly, react to stress more calmly, and perform and behave better in the classroom[1].

 The American Heart Association, devoted to a world of healthier lives for all and celebrating 100 years of lifesaving service, recommends that kids get a minimum of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day. Developing healthy habits and reducing sedentary behaviors in kids is key to immediate and long-term health benefits. The benefits of physical activity are unmatched when it comes to lowering risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other diseases. But the perks of physical activity also extend to the classroom as active kids have better sleep, improved cognition, and an overall better quality of life. Helping students understand the full benefits of getting active can establish healthy habits at a young age for a better chance of healthier adulthood.

 "At the American Heart Association, our future is about improving yours. Engaging children in 60 minutes of physical activity alongside the NFL with the longstanding NFL PLAY 60 programming is one way we are working to advance health and hope for everyone,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Our collaboration with the NFL as the 2024-25 season kicks off demonstrates our shared commitment to a world of longer healthier lives through physical activity, heart health and safety.”

 Rooted in American Heart Association science, NFL PLAY 60 helps children engage in physical activity and improve their physical and mental wellness. This year’s in-school activation will provide students opportunities to move throughout the 2024-2025 NFL season from Kickoff to the 2025 NFL Draft.

 One-way students can get active with NFL PLAY 60 is through a series of NFL PLAY 60 Fitness Break broadcasts. The first of the two broadcasts will air on Thursday, September 19 at 1 p.m. ET/ 12 p.m. CT / 10 a.m. PT with the theme Move More for Whole Health. The broadcast will breakdown the levels of physical activity including warm-ups, moderate intensity, vigorous intensity and cool downs with the help of the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers. An additional Fitness Break broadcast will be held later in the school year on Thursday, February 6, just before Super Bowl LIX. Advanced registration for both broadcasts is required.

 “As the 2024 NFL season kicks off, we’re thrilled to once again partner with the American Heart Association to encourage children to get moving through our NFL PLAY 60 initiative,” said NFL Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility Anna Isaacson. “Now heading into its 18th season, PLAY 60 has emerged as a national model to promote youth health and well-being. The NFL is committed to building on our efforts to ensure children across the country have access to the resources they need to live healthy lifestyles.”

 The second opportunity for students to get active is through the new Daily Movement Moment Challenge during the month of October, which will utilize the NFL PLAY 60 app, available free on iOS and Android devices. The daily Movement Moment feature on the app is a 15-minute opportunity for students to incorporate movement into their day by following an NFL PLAY 60 avatar who guides them through four different exercises. The featured exercises change daily. A paper tracker will be provided for teachers to use within their classrooms to indicate that they completed the daily Movement Moment as a group. Teachers will indicate the NFL club geographically closest to them on their tracker and 32 winners, one for each of the club teams, will be randomly selected to receive a $1,000 NFL PLAY 60 grant to be used towards the purchase of physical activity equipment.

 The last PLAY 60 resource available to students to meet their daily movement goal is the NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Library, which features two-to-three minute on-demand exercise videos from each of the 32 NFL teams featuring players, NFL Legends, cheerleaders and mascots.

 The NFL and the American Heart Association have been teaming up since 2006 to inspire kids through fun and engaging ways to get physically active for at least 60 minutes a day. Information on NFL PLAY 60 resources and available grant opportunities can be found online at heart.org/NFLPLAY60.
