# ZenaTech Enters the Drone Sensor and Components Market Establishing a New Taiwan Subsidiary to Win More US Defense Contracts for Its AI Drones

TORONTO, Ontario - (NewMediaWire) - October 29, 2024 - ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, today announced it will establish a new company in Taiwan to manufacture drone sensors and components for use in the drone products produced by its subsidiary ZenaDrone. The new company, named Spider Vision Sensors Ltd., will ensure ZenaDrone’s products are compliant with the US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an important requirement for the company to win more business with the US Military.

 Spider Vision Sensors Ltd. will manufacture drone sensors, electronics, and components such LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), thermal, infrared, multi-spectral and hyper sensors, cameras, and PBCs (Printed Circuit Boards). Having in-house manufactured sensors and components will enable ZenaDrone to have a steady supply to fulfill customer orders and drone production needs at its Sharjah, UAE, and future Arizona-based drone manufacturing facilities.

 Taiwan was selected due to its size and skills as an electronics hub, and the availability of low-cost alternative components versus those from China. The new company is currently at the prototype stage, and the manufacturing facility is expected to be open in November.

 “Establishing a drone sensor and components manufacturer in Taiwan will help bring our products to market faster and removes dependencies on any Chinese made electronics. This will position us to win more US military contracts via achieving Green UAS (Uncrewed Arial Systems) and Blue UAS certifications as an approved supplier,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.

 NDAA compliance refers to adhering to the provisions outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act, which is a U.S. federal law that specifies the budget and expenditures for the Department of Defense (DoD). The Blue USA program is a stringent government approved supplier list of drone companies that wish to do business with the DoD; suppliers must meet strict NDAA cyber security and supply chain sourcing requirements.
