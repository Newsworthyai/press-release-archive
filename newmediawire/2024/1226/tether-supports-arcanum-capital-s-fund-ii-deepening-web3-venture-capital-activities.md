# Tether Supports Arcanum Capital's Fund II, Deepening Web3 Venture Capital Activities

HAMILTON, BERMUDA - (NewMediaWire) - December 26, 2024 - Arcanum Capital ISA (“Arcanum Capital”) announced today that Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has made a novel venture capital fund investment, into Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II (Offshore) ISA, an incorporated segregated account of DigitalArray ISAC Ltd. (the “Fund”), dedicated to nurturing the next generation of decentralized technologies. This landmark investment underscores the significance of Arcanum Capital’s mission to accelerate the development of transformative Web3 technologies, including the Bitcoin ecosystem, the intersection of blockchain and AI, blockchain infrastructure, innovations in payments, and privacy-focused technologies. Tether’s historic investment not only bolsters the fund’s capacity to support these critical initiatives but also marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of venture capital within the blockchain space.

Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and CSO of Holepunch, shared his excitement about the collaboration, stating, “In a world increasingly shaped by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, the need for resilient technology to safeguard our freedoms has never been more crucial. We are proud to partner with Arcanum Capital to stand at the forefront of empowering people with the tools and knowledge to protect their sovereignty.”

James McDowall, Managing Partner of Arcanum Capital, also commented on the partnership: “We are honored to have Tether as a founding investor in our second fund. Their contribution not only signals a strong vote of confidence in us as asset managers, but also validates our unique mission and approach. Our passion lies in the transformative technologies we invest in, and we are proud to have Tether alongside us in supporting this mission."

In line with Tether’s investment thesis, a portion of the Fund will focus on companies utilizing Tether’s stablecoin for innovations in payments, as well as further bolstering the efforts of projects that use Holepunch technology. One example of these is Keet, a messaging app that allows users to call, text, or video-call directly without relying on a central server. Unlike apps like WhatsApp, which can be disrupted by attacks on Meta, Keet remains operational without a single point of failure, ensuring continuous, secure communication.

Arcanum Capital has also secured Luganodes, the world's fastest growing blockchain infrastructure provider, as a Limited Partner in The Fund, as well as selecting them as their preferred staking partner. This strategic partnership aims to combine Arcanum's proven research and thesis-driven investment approach with Luganodes' technical expertise, steadfast staking infrastructure, and exclusive access to deal flow.

Arcanum Capital, Tether, and Luganodes are united in their vision to push the boundaries of what is possible with decentralized technologies, ensuring a more resilient, secure, and equitable digital future for all.
