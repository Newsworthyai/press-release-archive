DEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that Applied Therapeutics was not adhering to trial protocol and good clinical practices for its drug candidate, govorestat, which, in turn, created an exceedingly severe risk that the trial data would be rejected by the FDA in the context of a New Drug Application.

THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Applied Therapeutics investors may, no later than February 18, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP encourages Applied Therapeutics investors who have suffered significant losses to contact the firm directly to acquire more information.
