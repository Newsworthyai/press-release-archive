# SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc. & Subsidiary SuperCloud International, Inc. Raises $23 Million in Funding to Fuel Expansion of Revolutionary 5G Entertainment Platform and Content Production Studio

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - (NewMediaWire) - September 12, 2024 - SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc. (“SGHI” or “Company”), a privately held technology and entertainment holding company with B2B and B2C brands and production services, today announced that it has successfully raised $23 million in funding over the past year. The capital will be used to accelerate the nationwide expansion of the Company’s flagship 5G-powered internet and live TV service, UMAXX.TV, as well as to propel monetization of its content production subsidiary SuperCloud Studios which was formed following a business combination with EyeOnChannel.

This recent funding raise, supported by both private and institutional investors, signals continued confidence by investors in SGHI’s ability to reshape the entertainment and connectivity industries and underscores the company’s momentum as a leader in the convergence of 5G technology, entertainment, and digital privacy. Founded by renowned tech entrepreneur Jim Devericks, SGHI has recently focused on rapidly expanding its revolutionary UMAXX.TV service—the first 5G TV and internet platform in the U.S. UMAXX.TV offers consumers and businesses an unmatched entertainment and web browsing experience, enhanced by military-grade data privacy and security through a proprietary closed-loop 5G network.

Beyond UMAXX, SGHI has been finalizing its business combination with EyeOnChannel, a premier content production and distribution company, and working to monetize its existing content while finalizing development plans for hundreds of hours of new and engaging proprietary programing. The new content will be distributed through various channels such as national third-party platforms and owned channels like UMAXX.TV.

“This successful funding round is a testament to the trust our investors have placed in our vision and the groundbreaking potential of our 5G technology and expertise in entertainment production and distribution,” said Jim Devericks, Chairman, Founder, and CEO of SuperCloud Global Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary SuperCloud International, Inc. “We were very strategic in our raising efforts and only looked to work with great partners who understood the opportunity before us. With these additional resources, we will further accelerate the rollout of UMAXX.TV across the U.S., and continue to push the boundaries of digital privacy, content production, and next-generation entertainment.”

UMAXX.TV, SuperCloud International’s flagship product, has been making waves in the industry as a first-of-its-kind service that combines ultra-fast 5G internet with over 350 high-definition live TV channels. Built on a proprietary, encrypted 5G network, UMAXX.TV offers unparalleled data privacy protections that are not available from traditional providers. With the demand for secure, high-speed internet and live TV on the rise, the service has seen rapid adoption across various consumer demographics, from families to tech-savvy individuals and businesses.

The fresh capital infusion will allow SGHI to further expand UMAXX.TV’s availability nationwide, enhancing both its infrastructure and service offerings to meet the needs of an increasingly data-conscious consumer base.

Furthermore, the company plans to invest in its growing portfolio of entertainment technologies, including its free-speech-focused social media platform, WhereFreedomSpeaks.com. The platform was the first to integrate and offer live TV and on-demand streaming into a seamless "socialtainment" experience, offering users a unique blend of social interaction and entertainment, all while safeguarding user privacy through SuperCloud’s proprietary Convergent Cloud Access System™.
