# Nominate a stroke hero today: 2025 Stroke Hero Awards open for submissions

(NewMediaWire) - October 01, 2024 - DALLAS – Strokes can strike at any age, challenging survivors to overcome physical, emotional and cognitive changes. Nominations are open now for the 2025 Stroke Hero Awards from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, which is celebrating a century of lifesaving impact this year. The awards recognize stroke survivors, caregivers, advocates and experts making a difference in the stroke community.

 Every 40 seconds someone in the U.S. has a stroke[1], according to the American Heart Association’s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update. Nearly 1 in 4 stroke survivors face the risk of a second stroke[2], in some instances because they don’t know what caused the first stroke—an issue the Association addresses through research and community programs. The awards honor everyday people who have used their experience to help others in extraordinary ways.

 The 2025 Stroke Hero Awards categories are:

 * NEW! F.A.S.T. Hero - honors an individual who recognized the warning signs of a stroke and acted fast to get help for the person having a stroke.
* Survivor Hero – Honors an individual who has survived a stroke and used their experience to educate, inspire and bring awareness about stroke.
* Pediatric Hero – Honors an individual younger than 18 who has survived a stroke and overcome significant hurdles and whose family has used its experience to educate, inspire and bring awareness to stroke.
* Caregiver Hero – Honors an individual who has cared for a stroke survivor and used their experience to educate, inspire and bring awareness about stroke on a local or national level.
* Equity Hero – Honors an individual working to ensure equitable health outcomes for those at risk for stroke, stroke survivors and stroke caregivers.
* Group Heroes - Honors a group committed to educating, inspiring and raising awareness about stroke. Groups can include stroke support groups, stroke teams, families, private associations, medical facilities and more.
* Voters’ Choice Hero - Honors an individual or group making an outstanding effort to educate, inspire and bring awareness about stroke. Judges select candidates from the nominations in the other six categories and public voting, open March 4-18, 2025, determines the winner.

 Submit your nominations by 8 p.m. CT on Dec. 3, 2024 at Stroke.org/HeroAwards. Winners will be announced on May 1, 2025, during American Stroke Month.
