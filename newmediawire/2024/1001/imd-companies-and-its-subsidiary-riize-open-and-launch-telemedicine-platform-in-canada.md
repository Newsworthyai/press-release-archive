# iMD Companies and Its Subsidiary Riize, Open and Launch Telemedicine Platform in Canada

RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif.  - (NewMediaWire) - October 01, 2024 - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC: ICBU) and its subsidiary Riize, LLC (Riize Health) have completed the target expansion into the Canadian marketplace.

The Riize Health telemedicine platform has officially been approved and we’re now taking orders in Canada.  The platform incorporates the same pharmaceutical and medical practitioner solutions that continue to produce dynamic growth in the U.S. for its sexual wellness product lines.

We’re proud to have met the original projected Canadian start date of end of September to early October 2024.  Reilly Schueler, CEO of Riize Health, states, "We are very excited about the potential for new and continued growth with the addition of our international operations in Canada.  As part of IMD Companies, we look forward to this additional new market opportunity as well as growth into other areas.  We couldn’t be happier."

Riize Health's 100% online system provides discreet and secure access to licensed medical professionals for the assessment and prescribing of personal health products. The convenience of telemedicine is becoming a growing choice for many consumers, especially for highly personal products.

In addition to the success of its core sexual wellness products, Riize Health anticipates adding a product line for Hair Growth in Q4, followed by products for TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy) and HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) in the coming weeks, further establishing itself as an innovative provider to the men's and women's personal health care market.

Rick Wilson, President and CEO of iMD Companies, Inc., states, “Having the ability to be an International Company and finalize the strategic launch in Canada with our amazing subsidiary Riize, enables iMD Companies to look at other International opportunities in the near future as well. Our product line expansion and entry into new markets is key to our revenue projections.”
