 DEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company’s business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Cassava’s drug, simufilam, was not capable of abating the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease, even in mild to moderate cases; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ statements about the company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

 THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Cassava investors may, no later than February 10, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors.
