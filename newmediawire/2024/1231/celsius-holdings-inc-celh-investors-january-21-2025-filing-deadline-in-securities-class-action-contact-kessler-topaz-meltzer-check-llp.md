 DEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Celsius materially oversold inventory to Pepsi far in excess of demand, and faced a looming sales cliff during which Pepsi would significantly reduce its purchases of Celsius products; (2) as Pepsi drew down significant amounts of inventory overstock, Celsius’ sales would materially decline in future periods, hurting Celsius’ financial performance and outlook; (3) Celsius’ sales rate to Pepsi was unsustainable and created a misleading impression of Celsius’ financial performance and outlook; (4) as a result, Celsius’ business metrics and financial prospects were not as strong as indicated in Defendants’ Class Period statements; and (5) consequently, Defendants’ statements regarding Celsius’ outlook and expected financial performance were false and misleading at all relevant times.

 THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Celsius investors may, no later than January 21, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
