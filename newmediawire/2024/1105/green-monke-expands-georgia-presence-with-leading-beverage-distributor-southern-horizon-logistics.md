# Green Monke Expands Georgia Presence With Leading Beverage Distributor, Southern Horizon Logistics

Green Monké is Bringing Its Award-Winning Portfolio - Including Its THC-infused Happy Sodas - to the State of Georgia

 SAVANNAH, Ga. - (NewMediaWire) - November 05, 2024 - Green Monké USA (“Green Monké”), an award-winning hemp-D9 beverage brand, has entered into a distribution agreement with Southern Horizon Logistics in partnership with Southern Crown Partners, two premier beverage distributors in Georgia. Under this agreement, Green Monké has fulfilled its first purchase order, delivering Orange Passionfruit and Mango Guava Happy Sodas, each containing 5 mg of THC and 5mg of CBD. This marks Green Monké’s first major push into the Georgia market via alcohol distributors, with the initial launch expected to reach over 200 retailers, including convenience outlets, bars, restaurants and venues throughout the state.

 Southern Horizon Logistics is a premier, Georgia-based distributor of hemp-derived Delta-9 (D9) beverages and products. Southern Horizon Logistics, in partnership with Southern Crown Partners, is a well-established beverage distributor with over 100 years of experience, serving 61 counties across the Lowcountry of South Carolina and the Coastal Plains of Georgia, distributing a variety of beverages, including beer, wine, spirits, and non-alcoholic options. Their strong market presence and deep-rooted connections make them an ideal partner for Green Monké’s expansion into the region.

 Our distribution launch with Southern Horizon Logistics builds on earlier success for Green Monké in the state of Georgia. Over the past year, Green Monké Happy Sodas have served as the official hemp-beverage at Enmarket Arena in Savannah, Georgia where they have become the top-selling alcohol alternative. Now that Green Monké is available in local retailers, bars, and restaurants, consumers who first experienced the award-winning taste of Green Monké at an Enmarket Arena event will be able to enjoy our Happy Sodas throughout the state.

 “We are thrilled to partner with Southern Horizon Logistics to introduce our THC-infused Happy Sodas to Georgia,” said Pat Gleeson, CEO of Green Monké. “Their expertise and local knowledge have put us in an excellent position to build the hemp beverage category in the Peach State. Our Georgia launch represents a homecoming of sorts, with one of our original flavors, Georgia Pie Iced Tea, being a fan favorite.”

 This expansion comes at a pivotal moment, as Georgia is set to implement new hemp industry regulations on December 1, 2024. These regulations place limits on the amount of delta-9 THC in cannabis products, capping beverages at 10 mg of delta-9 THC per serving, age-gating purchases, and ensuring these psycho-active products are not marketed to children. These changes are part of Georgia’s efforts to create a stable and sustainable framework for hemp-derived products.

 "Like the recent regulatory progress we’ve seen in Minnesota and Wisconsin, we fully support Georgia’s regulation of hemp-derived products," commented Gleeson. "Since the federal legalization of hemp-derived Delta-9, demand for these beverages as alternatives to alcohol has skyrocketed. In Georgia, a strong regulatory framework fosters market growth by mapping these products on to the beer distributors,  retailers and on-premises establishments, which are trained to sell to people of age of majority. These stakeholders are incented to build this up-and-coming industry focused on happy, chill vibes"

 Looking ahead, Green Monké is poised to expand beyond Georgia through Southern Horizon Logistics’ extensive distribution network across the Southeast, where Southern Horizon Logistics operates with 725 dedicated team members.
