# NFL's Bears add lifesavers to the chain of survival in Chicago

(NewMediaWire) - October 22, 2024 - CHICAGO — The American Heart Association and the Chicago Bears brought cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training to the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Girls Flag Football State Finals on Saturday, Oct. 19. More than 150 youth athletes, coaches and league administrators learned lifesaving skills building their confidence and capabilities to respond in the event of a cardiac emergency. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Chicago Bears is helping to support that critical link in the community” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate 100 years of lifesaving work, we know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education, and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more bystanders certified with the knowledge of CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 Participants used the Association’s CPR in Youth Sports Kits which include manikins and AED training tools, which will later be donated to continue the community education efforts. Hands-Only CPR participants learned the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “The Chicago Bears are proud to have partnered with the American Heart Association and IHSA on this milestone day in Illinois sports to increase access to CPR education. As the game of football grows, there will be a need for continued education for participants to improve outcomes in medical emergencies. The athletes competing today are pioneers in this sport and will play a critical role in increasing awareness around CPR education and its impact on future generations of this sport,” said Tanesha Wade, executive vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion & chief impact officer at the Chicago Bears.

 The American Heart Association is a founding member of the Smart Heart Sports Coalition established by the NFL in 2023. The coalition is actively advocating for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based public policies that will prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. According to the American Heart Association, as many as 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac outside of a hospital annually, and about 40% of those occur among student-athletes. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes nationwide.
