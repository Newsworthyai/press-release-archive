# One World Products Secures First Order for Hemp-Based Reusable Containers, Pioneers Renewable Materials for the Automotive Industry

LAS VEGAS, Nev. - (NewMediaWire) - October 15, 2024 - One World Products, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCQB: OWPC), a Nevada-based leader in sustainable industrial hemp solutions, recently showcased fully validated hemp-based molded containers - developed for an initial order of 1,400 units from Flex-N-Gate, a tier 1 supplier to the automotive industry.

These production-ready reusable containers, developed in collaboration with Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS Corporation, and West Michigan Compounding (WMC), marked a significant milestone in OWP’s efforts to deliver renewable material solutions for automotive part packaging applications. The presentation, held in Detroit, served as a proof-of-concept for wider adoption of sustainable packaging solutions across the industry.

For decades, the automotive industry has used reusable containers and pallets to move and protect parts in the supply chain. Reusable totes are designed for a long service life and travel hundreds of trips during their life cycle. At the end of their service life, reusable totes and pallets are fully recyclable.

OWP’s proprietary hemp-based renewable materials, developed in collaboration with Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS, and WMC, are designed to replace traditional plastics with eco-friendly alternatives. These solutions enable automakers to reduce their carbon footprint and support environmental initiatives within the automotive supply chain. The validation from key partners, including the order from Flex-N-Gate, underscores OWP’s leadership in renewable materials and its ability to meet the stringent requirements.

“The initial order from Flex-N-Gate highlights the trust our partners place in our solutions and sets the stage for future opportunities,” said Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of One World Products. “Our work with Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS, and West Michigan Compounding demonstrates our collective capability to drive innovation in renewable materials for automotive applications.”
