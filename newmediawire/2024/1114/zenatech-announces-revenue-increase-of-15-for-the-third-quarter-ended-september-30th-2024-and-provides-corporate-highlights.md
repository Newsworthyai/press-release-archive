●      The company announced that a multinational auto parts manufacturer is the first paying customer trial that is currently underway for the IQ Nano solution for autonomous inventory management in one of their US warehouses. The drone reads bar codes collecting inventory information for input into their internal ERP software platforms.

●      ZenaTech announced the acquisition of a total of four software companies from two of its associated companies during the third quarter (subject to shareholder and regulatory approval), adding recurring revenue and important functionality to be integrated into its drone solutions. These include: Jadian, a company providing compliance, permit and inspection software for government, health, and retail businesses; DeskFlex, an AI room booking and office space optimization software company; Interactive Systems, a warehouse management software platform including inventory management, e-commerce, order processing, and handheld devices and other interface connections company; and InterlinkONE, a warehouse management solution for maintaining multiple warehouses, software platforms, and software integrations company.

●      ZenaTech’s CEO and CTO participated in a Trade Mission to Taiwan and announced that the company is establishing a sensors and component manufacturing facility, and the first Asian office in Taipei, Taiwan to supply components that will be used in ZenaDrone products. The new company, Spider Vision Sensors Ltd., will ensure ZenaDrone’s products are compliant with the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to enable receiving approved supplier status to sell to the U.S. Military.

●      The company’s common shares were cross listed for trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) under the symbol “49Q” to increase liquidity and build an investor base in Europe, along with its customer base and current operations and offices in Europe.

“Our first quarter as a public company consisted of laying the groundwork for growth by making strides on many fronts, including our products by launching the IQ Nano autonomous AI drone and starting our first paid inventory management trial with a significant multinational customer. Our four acquisitions added considerable recurring revenue and functionality to enhance our drone solutions. We achieved a regulatory win to commence our aerial operations and testing, operation expansion and manufacturing in Arizona. Establishing a components and sensor manufacturing office in Taiwan will ensure low cost and compliant supply for our drones enabling us to become a U.S. military approved supplier,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.
