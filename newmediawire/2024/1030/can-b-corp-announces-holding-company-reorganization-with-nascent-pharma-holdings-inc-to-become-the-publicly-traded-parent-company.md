HICKSVILLE, N.Y. - (NewMediaWire) - October 30, 2024 - Can B Corp. (OTCQB: CANB) (“Can B” or the “Company”) today announced that it has implemented a reorganization in which a new holding company, Nascent Pharma Holdings, Inc., has become the publicly-traded parent of Can B and its subsidiaries.  As a result of the reorganization, existing shares of Can B stock have been automatically converted, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of common stock of Nascent Pharma Holdings, Inc.  The Board and executive officers of Can B will continue in the same roles at Nascent Pharma Holdings, Inc.
