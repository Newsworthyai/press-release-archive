 REMSleep has received delivery of silicone material for production of inventory of the new 510(K) cleared Deltawave nasal pillow interface mask.. Remsleep is waiting on molder to begin production.  We are expecting Deltawave to be available for market soon.  We have major distributors waiting to receive samples and expect to have Deltawave available for direct to consumer as soon as we receive our first inventory.

 The Deltawave journey has been long and brutal.  We are hardly unaware of the agony.  However, we know it can’t possibly be much longer before Deltawave is available for sleep apnea sufferers, which has been the goal.
