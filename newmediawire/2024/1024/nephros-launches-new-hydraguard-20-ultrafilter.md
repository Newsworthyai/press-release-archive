# Nephros Launches New HydraGuard 20" UltraFilter

New Filter Targets Additional Industries and Water Quality Compliance

SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. - (NewMediaWire) - October 24, 2024 -  Nephros, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEPH) Nephros, Inc., a leader in advanced filtration technology, is excited to announce the release of the HydraGuard 20” UltraFilter. This latest innovation enables the company to break into new markets and aid in compliance with water quality standards such as ANSI/AAMI ST108.

The HydraGuard 20” model is an extension of the existing HydraGuard and designed to provide a higher-volume capacity and flow rate, while removing harmful contaminants like bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. With this product, Nephros is poised to serve a broader range of customers, including companies within medical device manufacturing and pharmaceutical production, to ensure the highest level of water purity for industries that require strict quality standards.

“We are thrilled to introduce this new product to the market,” said Robert Banks, President & CEO of Nephros. “Previously, a 20” model of our 222 O-ring cartridges was only available for use in dialysis water purification. Now, we can expand the application of our infection control technology into industries and settings which require the highest levels of water purity to prevent contamination and ensure product safety.”

Robert Banks continued, “By targeting new industries like sterile processing and pharmaceuticals, where water safety is mission-critical, Nephros is positioning itself for sales growth. We will continue to pursue innovation with the goals of increased market share and further strengthening of our position as a leader in filtration technology.”

The HydraGuard 20” filter opens the door to expanded revenue opportunities and greater support for businesses and facilities struggling to establish or maintain compliance with strict regulatory standards. Most notably, the issuance of ANSI/AAMI ST108 in late 2023 introduced new metrics for sterile processing, such as water testing schedules and parameters for bacteria and endotoxin presence. Solutions like the HydraGuard, along with other Nephros infection control products, provide exceptional retention of microbiological contaminants and support purification of water beyond the new standards. Regarding endotoxins specifically, Nephros in-line filters have the additional benefit of performance based on size exclusion, which achieves reliable and consistent retention compared to the more typical charged membranes.
