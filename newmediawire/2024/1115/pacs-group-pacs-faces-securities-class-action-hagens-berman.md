 PACS Group (PACS) Securities Class Action:

 The complaint alleges that, in the IPO offering documents and throughout the Class Period, PACS and additional defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that PACS engaged in schemes to: (1) submit false Medicare claims; (2) bill thousands of unnecessary respiratory and sensory integration therapies to Medicare; and (3) falsify documentation related to licensure and staffing.

 The lawsuit follows Hindenburg’s Nov. 4, 2024 report, which was the product of an investigation that spanned five months and involved interviews with numerous former employees and competitors, concluded that PACS’s business model relies heavily on exploiting taxpayer-funded healthcare programs. The famed analyst alleges that the company:

 ·       Abused a COVID-era waiver to inappropriately access Medicare benefits for thousands of patients.

 ·       Falsified patient records to inflate revenue and earnings.

 ·       Engaged in fraudulent licensing practices to circumvent regulatory oversight.

 On the news of the Hindenburg report, the price of PACS Group shares plunged $11.93, or over 27% lower.

 Then, on Nov. 6, 2024, PACS revealed that it received civil investigative demands from the federal government “regarding the Company’s reimbursement and referral practices that may or may not relate to this week’s third-party report.” PACS also announced the postponement of its Q3 2024 financial results.

 This news drove the price of PACS shares crashing $11.45, or over 38% lower, to close at $18.09 (well below the $21 IPO price).

 In response to the allegations, law firm Hagens Berman has initiated an investigation into PACS Group’s business practices and disclosures. The firm is seeking to represent investors who may have suffered significant losses due to the company's alleged misconduct.

 “We’re focused on whether PACS may have misled investors and regulators about its business practices and purported value-creation strategies,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.
