MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. - (NewMediaWire) - November 15, 2024 - Western Michigan University Athletics and the Broncos Will Reign Collective are excited to announce a new partnership with Roy, Inc.  This partnership, secured by Bronco Sports Partners in collaboration with Van Wagner, provides WMU alums and supporters with an additional tool to support and resource the Broncos Will Reign Collective, with 100% of their support going directly to the student-athletes of their choosing.

"We're thrilled to partner with Western Michigan University and Broncos Will Reign Collective to bring the power of Roy directly to Bronco Nation," said Cale Johnston, CEO of Roy.
