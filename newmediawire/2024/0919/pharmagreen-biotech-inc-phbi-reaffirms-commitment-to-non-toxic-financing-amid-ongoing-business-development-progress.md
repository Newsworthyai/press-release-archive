# Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc. (PHBI) Reaffirms Commitment to Non-Toxic Financing Amid Ongoing Business Development Progress

CARSON CITY, NV - (NewMediaWire) - September 19, 2024 - Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc. (OTC PINKS: PHBI) ("Pharmagreen" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the continued advancement of its business development efforts on a significant project in collaboration with a foreign government. Considerable progress has been made, and the Company is optimistic about the wide-ranging benefits this initiative will bring to all involved parties.

By incorporating Pharmagreen’s proprietary Standard Organic Non-Spray Cultivation Procedures (SONSCP), local farmers will be empowered to elevate their agricultural practices through sustainable, organic techniques. In collaboration with its partners, Pharmagreen plans to introduce a premium, connoisseur-grade product line for the global market. Details of this product line will be shared in a forthcoming series of press releases as new information becomes available.

The partnership between Pharmagreen, the foreign government, and local communities is expected to deliver a variety of substantial benefits, including the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies, regional economic diversification, environmental sustainability, job creation, enhanced tourism, and the production of value-added goods for global markets. Additional advantages include research and development opportunities as well as health and wellness benefits. This project is designed to grow year after year and is intended to be a continuous initiative.

As previously communicated, Pharmagreen has avoided toxic financing options since last year and remains committed to maintaining this stance. The Company’s current operations are being funded by its CEO, Peter Wojcik, a significant shareholder who is focused on continued growth and value creation for Pharmagreen and its shareholders. Mr. Wojcik is committed to ensuring the Company remains in good standing.

To facilitate the execution of this project on a non-dilutive basis, Pharmagreen has proposed a partnership structure to form a local subsidiary, which will serve as the operating entity for the initiative. This project is expected to generate significant sustained revenues and profits, details of which will be shared in future press releases.

In addition, Pharmagreen’s all-natural MaxGenomic® supplement is currently available for purchase on Amazon and through the Company’s online store at www.maxgenomicproducts.com. As previously mentioned, Pharmagreen plans to expand its premium product offerings with the introduction of a connoisseur-level product line for the global market.

Further updates and details will be provided in future announcements.

Peter Wojcik, CEO of Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc., expressed his deep commitment to the company since its inception, stating, "I have been personally dedicated to Pharmagreen from the very beginning. I firmly believe that the strongest foundation for any company lies in robust business development supported by sustainable, non-destructive financing options. When those conditions are not immediately available, it is essential to work even harder to achieve them while remaining adaptable to what is both feasible and sustainable."
