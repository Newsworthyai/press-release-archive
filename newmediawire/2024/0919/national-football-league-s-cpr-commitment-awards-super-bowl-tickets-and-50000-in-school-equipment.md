# National Football League s CPR commitment awards Super Bowl tickets and $50,000 in school equipment

(NewMediaWire) - September 19, 2024 - DALLAS — Students who learned Hands-Only Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can win Super Bowl LIX tickets and their school can be eligible for a $10,000 physical education makeover as part of an American Heart Association collaboration with the National Football League (NFL) Foundation encouraging Hands-Only CPR adoption. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “The exciting incentives provided by the NFL encouraged more students to engage with and complete the Hands-Only CPR module – expanding the knowledge base to their family members of how to respond in a cardiac emergency,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Together with the NFL, we were able to impact more schools and teach more students in the lifesaving skill of CPR.”

 Students who participate in the Association’s in-school program, Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™, receive free Hands-Only CPR instruction so they can be confident and capable to respond in a cardiac emergency. More than 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year[1], 70% of those occurring at home[2]. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association shows that children as young as age four can impact the survival rate by calling 911[3].

 The American Heart Association is the global leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official guidelines for CPR. The collaboration with the NFL is the Association’s most recent demonstration of the vow to CPR education with the commitment to double survival rates of cardiac emergencies by 2030. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. More than 350,000 people in the US have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest every year. If a teen or adult collapses, witnesses should immediately call emergency services and begin chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 beats per minute and a depth of approximately two inches.

 The following five students each received two tickets to Super Bowl LIX taking place in New Orleans in February 2025.

 * Addison Legg of Aurora, Colo.
* Mason Balderas of Escondido, Calif.
* Roman Lopez of Lansing, Mich.
* Sabrina Wilcox of Metairie, La.
* Samvidh Kandula of Franklin, Mass.

 The following schools received $10,000 to use for a physical activity equipment makeover.

 * Castle Hill Elementary School in San Antonio, Tex.
* Dickinson Elementary School in De Pere, Wis.
* E Rivers Elementary School in Atlanta, Ga.
* Kyle R. Wilson Elementary School in Woodbridge, Va.
* Mountain View Elementary School in Elko, Nev.

 “Our partnership with the American Heart Association is focused on promoting health and wellness for all,” said NFL Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility Anna Isaacson. “Over the past few years, we’ve grown our relationship with American Heart Association to spearhead CPR education and training. The NFL is proud to leverage our platform to ensure communities across the country are equipped to act as lifesavers.”

 The NFL’s support includes the production of an introduction video by Damar Hamlin, Buffalo Bills safety and cardiac arrest survivor. In the video which appears, prior to the Kids Heart Challenge Hands-Only CPR online learning module, Hamlin shares that CPR saved his life and encourages kids to learn the lifesaving skill. Each elementary student who completed the online learning module earned an entry for two tickets to Super Bowl LIX in 2025. Additionally, Kids Heart Challenge participating schools received entries to win a $10,000 fitness equipment makeover for student participation.

 The NFL Foundation recommitted to supporting CPR education for the 2024-2025 school year. Once again, five student participants will receive tickets to Super Bowl LX taking place in 2026 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif and five schools will receive $10,000 fitness equipment makeovers. Entries are available now to those completing Finn’s Mission. Parents and school administrators can visit heart.org/schools to learn how their students can participate.

 With a foundation set in physical activity and rooted in proven science, Kids Heart Challenge has expanded beyond the gymnasium to meet the needs of today’s youth and educators as science has proven the strong connection between physical and mental health. The program offers a variety of activities to get elementary students’ hearts pumping such as dance, basketball or jumping rope paired with digital missions such as Hands-Only CPR. The Association has worked with schools across the nation for 48 years promoting physical health and wellness.

 The Association encourages everyone, everywhere to join in the Nation of Lifesavers initiative and make CPR awareness and education a permanent fixture in all communities across the country. Take 90 seconds to learn how to save a life now at www.heart.org/nation.
