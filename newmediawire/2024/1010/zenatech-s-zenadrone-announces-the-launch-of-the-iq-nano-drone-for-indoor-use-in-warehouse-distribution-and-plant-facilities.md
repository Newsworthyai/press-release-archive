TORONTO - (NewMediaWire) - October 10, 2024 - ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, today announced that its subsidiary, ZenaDrone, is launching its IQ Nano product, part of the IQ series of indoor/outdoor drones. The IQ Nano is designed for customers in sectors such as warehousing and logistics to save costs and improve productivity while performing indoor inspection, monitoring and tracking processes including inventory management.

The ZenaDrone IQ Nano is a 10x10-inch drone designed to perform regular and frequent inspections for applications such as bar code or RFID scanning, facility maintenance inspections, security monitoring, and 3D mapping specific to the needs of companies with warehouse, distribution, plants and industrial facilities.  It is designed for autonomous use featuring integrated sensors, high-quality cameras and data collection. Weighing 1.5kg and with a flight time of up to 20 minutes before utilizing the automatic battery charging station, it is designed for hovering stability and for safety with obstacle avoidance capabilities.

“The IQ Nano is breakthrough technology that will eliminate dull and repetitive tasks for warehouse and logistics customers, saving them significant time and money while conducting inspection, maintenance, security and inventory monitoring tasks inside their facilities,” said CEO Dr. Shaun Passley, Ph.D. “The IQ Nano incorporates our own indoor global positioning system (GPS), similar to the space-based radio-navigation GPS utility, enabling safety and obstacle avoidance indoors.”

ZenaDrone IQ Nano Features:

Charging pad: Convenient charging solution without cords or cables, making it easier to maintain multiple drones.

Tethered cable: Offers stable power and data connection for longer flight times or hovering in one place for longer periods, for real-time data transmission during indoor inspections.

Intelligent Battery: IQ Nano is designed to have a flight time of up to 20 minutes and features an intelligent flight battery that enhances its time in the air.

Reliable Video: The enhanced video transmission and sensing systems make it highly reliable in gathering visual data in the air.

Retractable landing gear: Enables a compact and streamlined design, improving maneuverability in limited space areas.

Durability: Carbon-fiber shell that can withstand impact without severe damage, and propeller guards to protect its rotors to ensure uninterrupted flight.

Portability: Designed to fit in a case for quick deployment from site to site for ease of carrying and designed to be unobtrusive and stackable for storage.

User-Friendly Controls: Designed so controls work alongside onboard sensing system and video transmission to provide smooth and intuitive operability even for new pilots
