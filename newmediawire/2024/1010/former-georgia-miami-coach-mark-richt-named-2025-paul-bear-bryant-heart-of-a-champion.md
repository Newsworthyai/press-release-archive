# Former Georgia, Miami coach Mark Richt named 2025 Paul  Bear  Bryant Heart of a Champion

(NewMediaWire) - October 10, 2024 - HOUSTON  —  Former University of Georgia and University of Miami football coach   Mark Richt has been named the recipient of the American Heart Association’s 2025 Paul 'Bear' Bryant Heart of a Champion Award presented by Houston (Texas) based-St. Luke’s Health, honoring his exceptional contributions to college football and the community while supporting the Association’s relentless pursuit of a world of longer, healthier lives for everyone everywhere. The Heart of a Champion Award recognizes individuals whose notable contributions and positive influence have helped define the way we experience sports; and whose life exemplifies characteristics for which Coach Bryant was known, including integrity, perseverance, determination and grit.

 “Coach Richt is an incredible example of leadership on and off the field,“ said Nancy Brown, American Heart Association chief executive officer. “His work elevated all those around him - a fitting honor to the coaching legacy established by Paul “Bear” Bryant - and his presence is deeply missed in his retirement. The culminating event where this year’s award will be presented gives college football fans the opportunity to fuel the mission of the American Heart Association in his memory.”

 The American Heart Association, a global force for healthier lives for all celebrating 100 years of lifesaving work, gives this award annually to celebrate Coach Bear Bryant’s legacy and raise awareness and critical funds for research to end needless suffering and death from cardiovascular disease and stroke, leading causes of death globally. The football coaching legend died from a heart attack in 1983, just 28 days after his final victory and retirement.

 One of the top coaches in the history of college football, Richt posted a career mark of 171-64 while coaching at the University of Georgia and the University of Miami. Richt is one of only five coaches in FBS history to record 145 or more wins in his first 15 seasons, including Hall of Famers Bob Stoops, Barry Switzer and Tom Osborne.

 "I am honored beyond measure to be chosen for the Bear Bryant Heart of a Champion Award," said Richt. "Coach Bryant's legacy is one of unmatched integrity, and leading with integrity was a primary goal of mine during my coaching career. To build a championship program on the field, you need to build a good team, and that starts with building good men. It was a privilege to serve the men I coached and it is a privilege to continue to serve today."

 Richt’s coaching career began as a graduate assistant under the legendary Bobby Bowden at Florida State University. In all, Richt spent 15 seasons in Tallahassee, serving as a quarterback coach and offensive coordinator. During his tenure, he mentored Heisman Trophy winners Charlie Ward and Chris Weinke, while the Seminoles captured a pair of national titles and played for another. Six of Richt’s quarterbacks at FSU played in the NFL.

 In 2001, Richt became a head coach for the first time at the University of Georgia. In his 15 years leading the Georgia program, Richt racked up 145 wins – second only to Hall of Fame coach Vince Dooley. Under his leadership, the Bulldogs qualified for 15 consecutive bowl games, including three New Years Six bowls. His Bulldogs finished in the top 10 seven times, captured two SEC titles – the 2002 title being UGA’s first SEC title in 20 years) – and earned a pair of SEC Coach of the Year honors. Richt returned to his alma mater, the University of Miami, for a final season in 2016.

 After playing for legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger from 1979-82, Richt coached Miami to three bowl games, two top-20 finishes, and the school’s first division title since joining the ACC. For his coaching efforts, Richt was named both the ACC Coach of the Year and Walter Camp Coach of the Year in 2017. In 2023, Richt was honored with induction to both the College Football Hall of Fame and National Football Foundation Hall of Fame.

 In addition to the honors Richt has earned through his coaching, he has been an active servant leader in the community. Richt is active with H.E.R.O. for children, Eagle Ranch orphanage facility and led two mission trips to Honduras. He has been a celebrity spokesperson for the National Guard Youth Foundation and a key supporter of The Healing Place of Athens for men with addictions. While at UGA, he founded the Paul Oliver Network, a program that supports lettermen in their transition to life after football. In 2016, Richt was named the first-ever honorary head coach of the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team for his commitment to giving back to others. In 2013, Richt received the Stallings Award given for commitment to humanitarian and community service efforts, and in 2010, he was named to the AFCA Board of Trustees. Since retiring as a coach, Richt has worked as an analyst on the ACC Network.

 Richt joins an impressive list of college football legends honored by the American Heart Association with the Heart of a Champion Award. ESPN College GameDay host and former coach Lee Corso received the inaugural Heart of a Champion Award in 2020, followed by former Mississippi State football coach Sylvester Croom in 2021, former Stanford University head coach David Shaw in 2022, former Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio in 2023 and legendary quarterback and the “First Lady of Football” Archie and Olivia Manning in 2024.

 The Heart of a Champion Award is one of five individual honors presented annually during the Bear Bryant Awards Ceremony, presented this year by Marathon Oil, on Wednesday, January 22, 2025 in Houston and will air on CBS Sports Network.
