# Let s talk about sex: Heart patients want guidance from health care professionals

Research Highlights:

 * A small survey of adults aged 30 to 89 (average age of 65) in Sweden who have heart conditions found that there is a significant difference between the sexual health information they seek and what is provided to them by their health care professionals and the health care system.
* Despite 76% of patients with heart conditions reporting that sexual health affects their mood and well-being, only 5% received information or counseling about sexual health.
* Researchers suggest health care professionals adjust their patient care practices to ensure that discussing sexual health becomes a standard and respected topic in health care settings. This means that every person with heart disease would receive information or at least be encouraged to seek information about their sexual health.
* Note: The study featured in this news release is a research abstract. Abstracts presented at the American Heart Association’s scientific meetings are not peer-reviewed, and the findings are considered preliminary until published as full manuscripts in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

 (NewMediaWire) - November 11, 2024 - DALLAS — Older adults with heart conditions reported in a survey that their sexual health impacts their mood and well-being. However, they also noted that most health care professionals did not offer them sexual health information, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2024. The meeting, Nov. 16-18, 2024, in Chicago, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

 A survey of older adults aged 30 to 89 (average age of 65) with health conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, heart failure or who were heart attack survivors living in Sweden were asked questions about access to sexual health information and perceptions about a connection to heart health. Recruitment took place through patient organizations, clinical outpatient departments and social media. There were 135 survey respondents.

 The topics patients wanted to discuss the most included medication side effects (60%), erectile dysfunction (50%), impact on relationships (47%), anxiety before sex (35%) and pain during sex (13% of women). Patients most favored conversations with health care professionals (79%); and/or getting information at various times from different sources (43%).

 The analysis found:

 * 78% of respondents said they wanted information on sexual health; however, only 5% said they received it.
* 76% of respondents said sexual health affects their mood and well-being.
* 65% of men believe their heart disease impacted their sexual health, while 35% of women said they think that their heart disease impacted their sexual health.
* Men more often desired information on sexual health than women (87% vs. 64%).

 “That so many heart patients feel it actually affects their sexual health was surprising to us, even though it’s been known for a while that this topic is not routinely discussed with heart patients,” said study lead author Tiny Jaarsma, Ph.D., a professor of nursing at the University of Linkoping in Sweden. “There is not much information published specifically for patients with heart disease. People may also worry about the trustworthiness of many Internet sources.”

 "I believe the health care professionals should change their patient standards to make discussing sexual health a standard and respectable topic in health care settings. This way, every person with heart disease would receive information or at least be encouraged to seek information about their sexual health," she explained. "Currently, we are asking questions like 'Are you vaccinated? Do you have a healthy diet? Do you exercise?' We should also address sexual health as a routine topic of discussion, just like any other health concern."

 The American Heart Association recommends that people who have experienced a heart attack or have been diagnosed with heart disease and stroke should check with a health care professional before resuming sexual activity.

 “This study aligns with a small body of research indicating that feelings of shame and discomfort about sex serve as obstacles to counseling heart patients,” said American Heart Association volunteer expert Jennifer H. Mieres, M.D., FAHA, professor of cardiology at Zucker School of Medicine, Cardiovascular Institute at Northwell Health in Lake Success, New York. “The societal and cultural stigma associated with sex, as well as the limited knowledge among health care professionals about educating patients on sexual health, can affect the incorporation of sexual health into the care of heart patients. It’s important to address these factors to provide comprehensive patient care.”

 Jaarsma said the study's strength is that it focused on people with heart conditions living at home instead of patients in a hospital or clinical setting, increasing anonymity. Limitations include that the survey was done in Sweden and administered online, so people who were less comfortable using technology might not have participated.

 Study background and details:

 * Researchers conducted an online national survey in Sweden in the spring of 2024. There were 21 questions, and participants answered only one survey.
* The survey was developed based on literature and previous international surveys about sexual health in patients with heart conditions. Recruitment took place via patient organizations, clinical outpatient departments and social media. All data was collected anonymously.
* 59% of the 135 respondents were men. In Sweden, it is illegal for medical research studies to ask for racial/ethnic information from participants.
* Respondents self-reported: high blood pressure 47%, heart attack survivors 36%; experienced irregular heartbeats 30%; and heart failure 24%.
