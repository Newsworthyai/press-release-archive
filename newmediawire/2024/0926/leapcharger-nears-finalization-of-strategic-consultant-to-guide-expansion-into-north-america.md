# LeapCharger Nears Finalization of Strategic Consultant to Guide Expansion Into North America

CARSON CITY, NV - (NewMediaWire) - September 26, 2024 - LeapCharger Corporation (OTC: LCCN) ("LeapCharger” or the "Company"), an electric vehicle (EV) charging company with disruptive and innovative technology providing eco-friendly and sustainable solutions, is pleased to announce that it is in the final stages of selecting a strategic consultant to support and guide its entry into North America. This planned expansion marks a significant milestone in the company's journey to becoming a global leader in clean energy and sustainable charging solutions.

 North America, with its rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy infrastructure, and smart technology, offers a lucrative opportunity for LeapCharger to expand its cutting-edge charging solutions. By entering this market, the company aims to (1) meet the growing demand for EV infrastructure, (2) develop innovative sustainable energy solutions and (3) collaborate with industry leaders.

 LeapCharger is currently in the final stages of selecting a strategic consultant with deep expertise in market entry, regulatory compliance, and scaling operations in North America. This consultant will play a crucial role in developing LeapCharger's go-to-market strategy, identifying key opportunities, and navigating the regulatory and competitive landscape of the region.

 Praveenkumar Vijayakumar, CEO of LeapCharger, commented, "Our planned expansion into North America is a bold step in LeapCharger’s vision of revolutionizing charging solutions on a global scale. We are excited to be finalizing a partnership with a strategic consultant who shares our vision and can guide us in successfully entering this dynamic market. This move represents not only a business expansion but also our commitment to sustainable energy adoption worldwide."

 Once the strategic consultant is formally engaged, LeapCharger will begin detailed market planning, including building partnerships with local stakeholders, rolling out pilot projects, and tailoring its technology to meet the unique needs of the North American market. The company anticipates launching its first charging stations in key cities across the U.S. and Canada by mid-2025.

 “As we plan this entry into the North American market, we have continued to collaborate with key industry leaders in the electric vehicle (EV) space across the UAE, including forging strategic relationships with some of the largest developers and influential politicians. With Dubai accelerating its green initiative, LeapCharger is poised to leverage its partnerships to continue positioning itself as a market leader in the EV charging infrastructure sector. As the city continues its ambitious sustainability goals, Leap Charger is dedicated to playing a pivotal role in the transition to cleaner, more efficient transportation solutions,” added Vijayakumar.

 “We believe that our overall strategy will have a significant impact across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. As these nations collectively push forward with ambitious sustainability and green energy initiatives, LeapCharger’s innovative charging solutions position the company to become a key player in transforming the region's EV infrastructure. The GCC’s focus on reducing carbon footprints and investing in future technologies makes it a crucial market for LeapCharger’s growth,” concluded Vijayakumar.
