# Target: BP  initiative helps more than 9M Americans with hypertension

(NewMediaWire) - October 09, 2024 - DALLAS — At a time when uncontrolled hypertension is rising in the United States, the American Heart Association and American Medical Association (AMA) are nationally recognizing 1,812 health care organizations — 103 more than in 2023 — for efforts to prioritize control of their patients’ blood pressure (BP).

 Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a leading preventable risk factor for heart disease, stroke and premature death. According to the 2024 American Heart Association Statistical Update, nearly half of U.S. adults — 122.4 million — are living with high BP. High BP accounts for more than $52 billion in annual health care costs.[1]

 Target: BP™ is a national initiative created in 2015 by the American Heart Association and American Medical Association in response to the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure. Together, the associations:

 * leverage American Heart Association science and the evidence-based AMA MAP™ framework to help care teams organize their approach to providing evidence-based care;
* assist and support health care organizations to improve and sustain BP control with professional education, practice tools and resources, including support through the associations’ quality improvement programs; and
* recognize organizations annually with achievement awards celebrating commitment to improvement, adoption of evidence-based BP care and achieving BP control rates of 70% or greater among their patients.

 The organizations participating in Target: BP this year represent 47 states or U.S. territories and serve more than 34 million patients, including 9 million people with hypertension. Nearly half of participating organizations are nonprofit health centers that receive federal funding to reach medically underserved populations, known as federally qualified health centers, reflecting the associations’ shared commitment to improving health equity.

 Among those organizations recognized for their efforts, more than half achieved Gold or Gold+ award level recognition, which requires BP control rates of greater than or equal to 70%. About 41% of awardees achieved Silver recognition, which requires BP control data to be submitted and 4 out of 6 evidence-based BP activities to be completed. The remainder received Participation-level recognition for submitting data for the first time and committing to reducing the number of adult patients with uncontrolled BP.

 “High BP is a ‘silent killer,’ often presenting no obvious symptoms,” said Keith Churchwell,  M.D., FAHA, American Heart Association volunteer president, associate clinical professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine and adjunct associate professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. “Programs like Target: BP help health care organizations and care teams work to close gaps in hypertension control through patient awareness and education on managing risk factors, such as lifestyle choices and family history, and improving overall well-being.”

 Since the American Heart Association and American Medical Association launched Target: BP™ in 2017, more than 4,150 health care organizations have joined the nationwide movement to make heart health a priority — sharing a common goal to improve health outcomes associated with heart disease, the No. 1 killer in the U.S.

 “With the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure in the U.S., it is imperative that all Americans have access to quality health care, and that all physicians and care teams have the tools they need, to help patients better control their high blood pressure,” said AMA President Bruce A. Scott, M.D. “We must collectively work to improve blood pressure control and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease to improve the health our nation.”

 New award levels and criteria will be launched in 2025, including a new Silver+ award level and new criteria for Silver+ and Gold+ awards.
