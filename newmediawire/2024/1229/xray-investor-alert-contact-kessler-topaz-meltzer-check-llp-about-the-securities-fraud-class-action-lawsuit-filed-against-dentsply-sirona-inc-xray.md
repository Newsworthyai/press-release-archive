DEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaints allege that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) DENTSPLY targeted low-income people who did not have access to good oral hygiene education, a dentist, or dental insurance, which often meant patients signing up for Byte, a direct-to-consumer aligner solution, had underlying dental issues that would have made them ineligible for treatment; (2) the push for Byte growth and sales commissions caused sales employees to sell to contraindicated patients; (3) as a result of the above, the Byte patient onboarding workflow did not provide adequate assurance that contraindicated patients did not enter treatment; (4) before and during the Class Period, reports of Byte patient injuries were pouring in; (5) DENTSPLY knew that its Byte aligners were causing severe patient injuries for years but did little to investigate those injuries or notify the FDA; (6) DENTSPLY had no systems in place to notify the FDA of these injuries, which Dentsply is required to do within 30 days of learning of a problem; (7) the FDA had received a sharp uptick in reports of serious injuries from Byte patients; (8) as a result of the above, DENTSPLY materially overstated the goodwill value of Byte; and (9) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about DENTSPLY’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:DENTSPLY investors may, no later than January 27, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP encourages DENTSPLY investors who have suffered significant losses to contact the firm directly to acquire more information.
