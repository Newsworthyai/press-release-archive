# 5 health technology start-ups finalists in global heart disease solution competition

(NewMediaWire) - November 08, 2024 - DALLAS – High blood pressure, obesity and other risk factors contribute to high rates of heart disease and stroke worldwide, including in the U.S. where cardiovascular disease is the leading killer.[1] While experts work to improve outcomes for patients, there is a need for accelerated advances in healthcare technology to help close the gap between clinical recommendations and daily habits.

 The American Heart Association Center for Health Technology & Innovation announced five finalists in its 7th annual Health Tech Competition, a live forum for healthcare technology start-up companies to showcase innovative solutions for treating and preventing cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Through the competition, the Association - the leading voluntary health organization devoted to a world of longer, healthier lives for all for more than 100 years - aims to drive technological advancements with the potential to transform heart and brain health patient outcomes.

 Winning ideas in the Health Tech Competition involve, engage or support patient treatment and solve a pervasive problem in antithrombotic, coronary artery disease/acute coronary syndrome, cardiovascular kidney metabolic syndrome, cardiometabolic, electrophysiology, heart failure, hypertension, imaging, lipids, resuscitation, stroke, surgery or vascular medicine. The competition is supported financially by the Laerdal Million Lives Fund and produced by the American Heart Association.

 Finalists will present their innovative technologies during the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2024, a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

 Final presentations will take place live before a panel of expert volunteer judges at McCormick Place in Chicago on November 16-17, from 11:30 a.m. – 1 p.m. (CT) in the Health Innovation Pavilion in the Science and Technology Hall.

 * Flow Medical, based in Chicago
* Heka Heart, based in San Mateo, California.
* Powerful Medical, based in New York City
* Proton Intelligence, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
* Rheoxtech, Inc., based in Chicago

 The presentations will be evaluated using the following criteria:

 * Validity: How well is the working prototype or product functioning in the market with customers?
* Scientific rigor: How well does validation research utilize evidence-based health research?
* Impact: To what extent does the product improve patient outcomes through innovative technology?

 The competition will be conducted in two parts – formal business and science “pitches” - each evaluated by an expert panel:

 Part 1: Business Pitch Judges

 * Robert A. Harrington, M.D., FAHA, volunteer past president of the American Heart Association (2019-2020), chair of the American Heart Association’s Health Tech Advisory Group for the Center for Health Technology and Innovation and the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine and provost for medical affairs of Cornell University
* Jeff Trost, managing partner at the Laerdal Million Lives Fund
* Ken Nelson, partner at the Med Tech Advantage Fund
* Lee Schwamm, M.D., FAHA, volunteer member of the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth Expert Panel; senior vice president and chief digital health officer of Yale New Haven Health; and associate dean of digital strategy and transformation at Yale School of Medicine
* Heather Provino, business growth and healthcare specialist at Scanlon Group
* Lisa Suennen, managing partner at American Heart Association Ventures
* Domenico Cianflone, M.D. at Universita Vita Salute, San Raffaele Milano Universita Vita Salute
* Rashmee Shah, M.D., adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine and clinical research scientist at Meta
* Devon Bream, general manager and president at GE Healthcare

 Part 2: Science Pitch Judges

 * Eric Peterson, M.D., MPH, vice provost and senior associate dean for clinical research at UT Southwestern
* Tiffany Powell-Wiley, M.D., social determinants of obesity and cardiovascular risk at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
* Mike McConnell, M.D., clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University
* Alexander J. Blood, M.D., cardiologist, intensivist and clinical researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
* Asif Ali, M.D., University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston
* Marat Fudim, M.D., advanced heart failure specialist at Duke University
* Star Jones, lawyer/TV personality, Divorce Court, and American Heart Association national volunteer

 The competition winner will be selected and announced live in person on November 17.

 The winner will receive membership in the Center for Health Technology & Innovation Innovators’ Network, a consortium that connects entrepreneurs, providers, researchers and payers. Members collaborate with the Center and other Network members in different ways, including building models for clinical outcome studies, which lowers the significant cost of developing those studies independently, helping connect the science to technology and providing evidence that a digital platform improves healthcare outcomes – a key concern for providers and payers.

 Innovators' Network members gain access to the Association's digital guidelines, recommendations and best-in-class science as they develop digital healthcare technologies.

 “The Center for Health Technology & Innovation is dedicated to fostering impactful solutions for global health challenges,” said Harrington. “Through their network, members can collaborate, access valuable resources and accelerate advancements that address critical issues through cutting-edge science and technology.”
