# Mobile-health Network Solutions Reports 77 Percent Revenue Increase for Fiscal Year 2024

SINGAPORE - (NewMediaWire) - October 23, 2024 - Mobile-health Network Solutions (Nasdaq: MNDR) (“MaNaDr” or “the Company”), a leading Asia-Pacific telehealth provider, today announced that for the fiscal year 2024 ended June 30, 2024, the Company had revenue of $14.0 million, a $6.1 million, or 77 percent, improvement on revenue of $7.9 million for fiscal 2023. This improvement was due to increased revenue of $6.0 million contributed by the Company’s telemedicine and other services segment, and $0.1 million by MNDR’s sale of medicine and medical devices segment.

 Cost of revenue increased by $4.7 million, or 69 percent, in fiscal 2024, mainly due to a 70 percent increase in the number of telemedicine cases compared to fiscal 2023.

 Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2024 was $6.4 million as compared to $2.2 million in fiscal 2023.

 The Company’s gross profit increased by $1.4 million, or 132 percent, to $2.5 million during FY 2024, mainly due to the 77 percent year-over-year increase in revenue and an increase in gross profit margin to 18.2 percent during FY24 from 13.9 percent during FY23.

 Due however to a $13.9 million, or 316 percent, increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2024 compared to the previous fiscal year, the company incurred a net loss of $15.6 million, or $(.56) per share, for fiscal 2024, as compared to a net loss of $3.2 million, or $(.13) per share, for fiscal 2023.

 The largest contributor to the $13.9 million increase in fiscal 2024 total operating expenses was a $9.1 million non-cash, share-based compensation expense during that year, compared to zero for fiscal 2023. This expense consisted primarily of share-based payments to employees pursuant to the Company’s established Employee Incentive Plan and to non-employees in consideration for IPO-related and business development services rendered to the Company.

 Fiscal 2024’s increase in total operating expenses also comprised a $3.0 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses mainly due to increases in IPO-related professional fees, IT-related cloud server maintenance expenses, traveling, business development, and insurance expenses; an increase of $1.6 million in salaries and benefits for staff who contributed significantly to the Company’s successful IPO and fiscal 2024 increase in revenue; and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses arising from a new office lease entered during FY 2024.

 Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, was $6.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The total weighted number of shares outstanding was 27,808,375 at June 30, 2024, and 25,482,000 at June 30, 2023.

 “We are proud to have achieved substantial improvements in both our total revenue and total number of telemedicine cases during fiscal 2024,” said co-CEO Dr. Siaw Tung Yeng, PBM, Senior Consultant Family Physician. “Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we are confident that the non-cash, share-based compensation to non-employees and IPO-related portions of our total operating expenses will decline sharply from fiscal 2024 levels, thus significantly boosting our bottom line.”

 Co-CEO Dr. Rachel Teoh Pui Pui, PBM, Family Physician, added, “Our unique identity as an affordable, quality, 24/7 provider of telehealth services offering nearly all types of medical specialists available on a near-instantaneous basis is establishing an ever-wider footprint in Singapore and across southeast Asia. We believe this growth will continue to accelerate in the years ahead.”
