# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Provides Global Patent Update And Expands Defence Market Reach

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - October 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to provide an update on its international patent filings for its Mobile Radio Station technology—an innovation that underpins the Company’s growing presence in the global defence and critical infrastructure sectors.

 Patent Overview

 CiTech’s invention defines a deployable, autonomous mobile radio station designed for rapid establishment of secure communications in remote or high-threat environments. The system overcomes the limitations of conventional mobile LTE and radio infrastructure by integrating transportability, energy autonomy, and intelligent automation.

 The patented design substantially expands CiTech’s Total Addressable Market, extending beyond traditional telecommunications infrastructure into defence, disaster response, remote industrial operations, mining, and emerging aerospace and satellite applications.

 Core System Features

 * Integrated Mobile Platform – Housed within a standard ISO shipping container containing all communications, power, HVAC, and control systems.
* Scissor-Lift Communications Tower – Deploys hydraulically from a stowed position to approximately 16 metres, supporting payloads up to 250 kg and wind-rated to 45 m/s.
* Autonomous Deployment - PLC-based automation enables full deployment - including tower lift, solar array expansion, and stabilising leg extension - in approximately 30 minutes, with remote or local control.
* Hybrid Power Architecture - Incorporates DC generators, up to 4.8 kW solar input, and 150 kWh of onboard battery capacity for continuous off-grid operation.
* Redundant Climate Control - Dual 5 kW HVAC systems maintain internal environmental stability in all conditions.

 Competitive Defence Advantage

 CiTech’s Nexus 20 platform delivers a fully self-contained, air-liftable communications hub capable of autonomous field operation, ideal for rapid network establishment in defence operations, disaster recovery, and remote mission support.

 A key differentiator of CiTech’s design is its super-rigid, precision-engineered mast, which maintains complete stability even under extreme wind conditions. Unlike competitor systems that suffer vibration and movement during operation, CiTech’s mast design ensures consistent, uninterrupted signal delivery—a critical requirement for mission-critical defence and communications environments.

 Its energy independence, automation, and structural integrity significantly reduce personnel exposure and logistics, enhancing reliability and operational readiness in demanding field conditions.

 The system’s modular and AI-enabled architecture also positions CiTech for next-generation applications, including:

 * Rapid-deploy satellite ground stations and mobile telemetry for aerospace and UAS test ranges.
* Counter-UAS and electronic perimeter defence, areas of growing focus in NATO and European defence programs.
* Critical infrastructure protection and smart city security, enabling mobile monitoring for ports, airports, and large-scale civic events.

 Global Patent Coverage

 CiTech has filed patents for “A Mobile Radio Station” in:Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States.

 The South African patent has been granted, with all other jurisdictions under or awaiting examination. This extensive global IP coverage ensures broad protection of CiTech’s Nexus 20 technology across major defence and communications markets.

 CEO Comment

 “Achieving global patent coverage for our Nexus 20 platform strengthens CiTech’s strategic position in the defence and critical communications sectors,” said Brenton Scott, Chief Executive Officer of CiTech. “Our patented, rigid-mast design delivers stable, uninterrupted connectivity in any environment - providing a decisive operational advantage for defence, emergency response, security/surveillance and industrial users worldwide.”

 Summary Insight

 The Nexus 20 patent establishes CiTech as an innovator in autonomous, cyber-resilient, and energy-independent communications infrastructure. By combining mechanical innovation, renewable energy systems, and intelligent control, CiTech delivers a new class of mobile infrastructure solutions for defence, emergency, and strategic industrial operations worldwide.
