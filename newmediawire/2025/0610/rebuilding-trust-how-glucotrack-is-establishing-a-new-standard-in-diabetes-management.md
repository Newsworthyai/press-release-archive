# Rebuilding Trust: How Glucotrack Is Establishing A New Standard In Diabetes Management

By JE Insights, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - June 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - While the genesis of typical modern medical technologies focuses on a specific design element or research protocol, for Glucotrack Inc. (NASDAQ: GCTK), the basis of innovation begins at the human level. It’s the reason why earlier this year, the medical device firm – which specializes in the development of a fully implantable continuous blood glucose monitoring (CBGM) system – formed a Patient Advisory Board (PAB).

 This group of individuals, who live with type 1 diabetes, offered day-to-day insights into the challenges, frustrations and limitations of current diabetes management tools. Unlike traditional focus groups, which often align with marketing interests, Glucotrack’s PAB was structured specifically for ongoing dialogue between the company’s development team and the patients whose lives have been directly shaped by glucose monitoring technologies.

 Throughout the board’s inaugural meeting, Glucotrack encouraged patients to speak candidly about their experiences with traditional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Over the course of the dialogue, the company reports that a clear motif emerged: diabetes patients carried a deep distrust toward existing glucose monitoring solutions – a distrust that has both emotional and clinical consequences.

 The Trust Deficit: Addressing Core Concerns Among Diabetes Patients

 Throughout the first PAB meeting, type 1 diabetes patients – while acknowledging the broader advancements in medical technology – still had deep issues regarding the reliability of the data that traditional CGMs provide. Among the key issues raised were the following:

 * Inaccuracy: Common CGM systems sometimes produced less accurate (or delayed) readings, especially following an exercise session, during illnesses or when taking medication (including over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol).
* Compression lows: False alarms have been triggered by simple actions such as sleeping on the sensor.
* Allergic reactions: While many people tolerate the adhesives with no complaints, the reality can be far different for some.
* Emotional toll: Some patients described hiding their diabetes from friends, partially in an effort to avoid looking sick.

 To respond to this opportunity gap, Glucotrack has developed its CBGM. Rather than an improved iteration on an existing design, the CBGM fundamentally alters the diabetes management paradigm. Specifically, the innovative system addresses the pain points discussed in the aforementioned PAB:

 * Long-term functionality: Minimal maintenance is required for the CBGM and the system is designed to last for up to 3 years.
* Fully implantable system: Glucotrack’s system utilizes no adhesives because it does not attach anything to the body; therefore, it is not visible to onlookers and lacks the cumbersome qualities of wearables.
* Direct blood glucose measurements: The CBGM eliminates the problem of lag associated with interstitial fluid readings and thereby improves trust in the real-time accuracy of glucose data.

 From Theory To Reality

 Glucotrack’s CBGM system has already transitioned from preclinical potential to human clinical demonstrations. Earlier this year, the medical device company completed a first-in-human feasibility study of its CBGM.

 Conducted in the catheterization lab at InCor Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, from December 2024 through January 2025, the study involved six participants (four females, two males), all of whom were on intensive insulin therapy. The device insertion was performed by interventional cardiologists, followed by a four-day inpatient observation period.

 Encouragingly, the researchers reported no procedural or device-related serious adverse events. In addition, the CBGM sensor lead and electronics performed as expected. Notably, the test system accurately captured and stored sensor data throughout the insertion period, achieving a 99% data capture rate.

 While the study was not designed to exhaustively evaluate sensor accuracy, the readings from the CBGM featured a compellingly small delta relative to reference blood glucose values across all matched samples. Using the same accuracy metric as traditional CGM systems (MARD: Median Absolute Relative Difference) the CBGM achieved an average MARD of 6.7% across 68 matched pairs. Most commercially available CGM systems currently achieve MARD in the range of 7.9-10%.

 Moving forward, Glucotrack announced on May 13 of this year that it received ethical approval from St. Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne for a year-long clinical study of its CBGM system. The trial will enroll up to 30 patients (including both type 1 and type 2) who are on intensive insulin therapy.

 Primarily, the objective of the study will center on the performance evaluation and safety of the CBGM over a 12 month duration. Should initial results prove encouraging, Glucotrack will request a study extension.

 Leading the clinical investigation is Professor David O’Neal (MBBS, MD, FRACP), who is the Director and Founder of the Diabetes Technology Research Group based at the University of Melbourne. Alongside O’Neal is Associate Professor Neale Cohen (MBBS, FRACP), Head of the Diabetes Clinical Research Laboratory at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne.

 Glucotrack is eager to showcase the groundbreaking solutions that the CBGM can deliver. “This technology shows great promise for the ability to improve glycemic control and offer patients expanded choice in continuous glucose monitoring systems. The ability to directly measure glucose in blood rather than interstitial fluid could represent a significant advancement for people with diabetes seeking more accurate real-time glucose values,” stated Prof. O’Neal.

 A Glimpse Toward The Future: Glucotrack At ADA 2025

 With momentum from the feasibility study and the launch of the Australian long-term trial, Glucotrack is set to step into the spotlight at the 2025 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Scientific Sessions, one of the largest and most influential gatherings in the global diabetes care industry.

 As part of the Innovation Hub in the Exhibit Hall, Glucotrack will maintain a physical presence throughout the event, offering attendees the opportunity to directly engage with the CBGM system and the team behind it. Product samples will be available during all open exhibit hours, giving healthcare professionals a chance to see up close what distinguishes the innovative device from the rest of the pack.

 In addition, Glucotrack will host two presentations:

 On Saturday, June 21, from 2:10 to 2:30 p.m. CDT, Glucotrack will deliver a live presentation in the Innovation Hub titled “Re-Imagining the Future of Continuous Glucose Monitoring with CBGM.” This session will explore how the company’s implantable system addresses the core shortcomings of traditional CGM technologies and redefines what patients can – and should – expect from their monitoring tools.

 On Sunday, June 22, from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. CDT, the team will present a scientific poster in the Poster Session under the title “Early Feasibility Study of Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor in Adults with Diabetes.” This session will provide a detailed review of the first-in-human clinical data, highlighting accuracy benchmarks, safety outcomes and the implications of real-time blood-based monitoring.

 Together, these events mark Glucotrack’s formal entry into the wider professional conversation on the future of diabetes care. What’s more, they reaffirm a guiding belief central to the company’s mission: leveraging technology to address the human condition.

 Setting The Stage For A New Standard

 As a whole, the formation of the Patient Advisory Board, the launching of a long-term clinical study and Glucotrack’s participation in a key industry conference affirm its ultimate end game: deliver a paradigm-shifting solution for diabetes management. It’s a transition that’s gaining real traction, moving beyond clinical potential to real-world results.
