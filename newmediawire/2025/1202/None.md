# Neurothera Labs Signs Non-Binding Term Sheet to Acquire Majority Stake in a Quantum Algorithm Bio Data Analysis Company

VANCOUVER, BC - December 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neurothera Labs Inc. (TSXV: NTLX) (“Neurothera” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotech company and a majority-owned subsidiary of SciSparc Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPRC), today announced that it has entered into a non-binding term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) with a pioneering quantum computing bio data company focused on quantum-enabled clinical analytics (the “Target Company"). Under the terms of the Term Sheet, Neurothera will acquire a 55% equity interest in the Target Company, calculated on a post transaction fully diluted basis, from certain selling shareholders of the Target Company (the “Selling Shareholders”), in consideration for the issuance to the Selling Shareholders of that amount of common shares in the capital of Neurothera (“Common Shares”) as is equal to 40% of the Common Shares, calculated on a non-diluted post transaction basis (the “Acquisition”).

 By harnessing the principles of quantum computing, bio data can be stored, manipulated, and analyzed far more efficiently than existing technologies, potentially revolutionizing the field through accelerated processing and enhanced insights. This innovative approach is based on key quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and inherent parallelism to deliver faster computations and superior machine learning performance. In turn, it strives to redefine clinical trials via quantum intelligence, seamlessly integrating quantum computing with bioinformatics and clinical data science to potentially unlock precision and speed in medical research and development.

 Closing of the Acquisition remains subject to the completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, receipt of all required corporate and regulatory approvals, including that of the TSX Venture Exchange, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be entered into or that the Acquisition will be completed on the terms described, or at all.
