# NRx Pharmaceuticals (NRXP) Announces FDA Receipt of ANDA for KETAFREE With July 2026 Review Goal Date

LOS ANGELES, CA - December 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, said the FDA has received its Abbreviated New Drug Application for KETAFREE(TM), a preservative-free intravenous ketamine formulation, deeming the submission “substantially complete” and assigning a July 29, 2026 review goal date. CEO Jonathan Javitt said KETAFREE is designed to provide a single-patient, preservative-free alternative to current multidose ketamine vials that contain Benzethonium Chloride, a compound no longer recognized as safe by the FDA. The Company said KETAFREE aligns with MAHA initiatives to remove toxic substances from medicines and supports domestic supply-chain priorities, with potential 2026 approved drug sales if approved on schedule. NRx noted the program is separate from NRX-100, its Fast Track-designated treatment for suicidal depression, and said it continues to advance its broader pipeline and HOPE Therapeutics clinics.
