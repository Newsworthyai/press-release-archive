# Quantumzyme Expands AI-Driven Enzyme Engineering Platform to Broaden Green API Manufacturing Applications

SAN DIEGO, CA - November 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantumzyme Corp. (OTCQB: QTZM), a global leader in computational enzyme engineering and digital biocatalysis, today announced the expansion of its proprietary AI-powered enzyme design platform to target additional high-volume Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) beyond ibuprofen. This strategic initiative marks a major milestone in advancing green pharmaceutical manufacturing, while reducing hazardous waste, toxic solvent use, and carbon emissions at scale.

 Building on the company’s validated enzymatic process for green ibuprofen synthesis, the expanded program leverages Quantumzyme’s enzyme families, machine learning predictive models, and in silico design workflows to develop sustainable pathways for other APIs with significant global environmental impact.

 Quantumzyme’s enzyme engineering platform integrates advanced AI-driven computational modeling, in silico directed evolution, mechanistic simulation, and high-throughput validation to deliver optimized biocatalysts that replace traditional energy-intensive chemical reaction steps.

 The expanded R&D pipeline includes multiple high-volume APIs, including chiral intermediates such as phenylephrine and related compounds accessible via ketoreductases, which are widely used in the global generics sector. This expansion highlights the scalability of Quantumzyme’s digital biology architecture and its ability to rapidly adapt and redeploy enzyme systems across diverse synthesis targets.

 “The global API market is projected to exceed $300 billion USD by 2030, with generic drugs representing the majority of production volume,” stated Naveen Kulkarni, CEO of Quantumzyme. “Much of this manufacturing currently occurs overseas using legacy chemistries that generate heavy waste streams and carry high solvent and carbon intensity. Our goal is to try and develop an approach that is both sustainable and eco-friendly.”

 Quantumzyme’s biocatalysis-first approach offers a sustainable alternative that delivers:

 * Reduced chemical waste and solvent usage
* Lower carbon footprint
* Elimination of toxic reagents
* Improved cost and yield efficiency

 In addition, the company’s platform supports domestic API manufacturing and aligns with U.S. supply chain resilience and sustainability goals.

 “Our vision is to redefine chemical manufacturing through sustainable innovation,” added Kulkarni. “By extending our enzyme engineering platform beyond ibuprofen, we are advancing greener chemistry, supporting supply chain resiliency, and moving closer to a future where enzyme-driven production becomes the industry standard for high-volume APIs.”
