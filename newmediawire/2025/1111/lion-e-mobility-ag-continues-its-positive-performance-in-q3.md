The collaboration combines LION Smart’s expertise in direct battery cooling technology with Castrol’s advanced thermal fluids and deep knowledge in battery thermal management. The partnership seeks to significantly enhance battery thermal management for passenger cars, trucks, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) worldwide through the use of direct battery cooling - a cutting-edge approach that enables faster charging and discharging of battery cells immersed in a lightweight dielectric fluid. Castrol ON EV Thermal Fluids will be applied to deliver superior heat dissipation, increased power density, and improved battery safety and lifespan.First order for large-scale energy storage system LION E-Mobility AG continues to make strong progress in its Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) business. Following the cooperation agreement signed with LEAP Energy in April 2025, the company has secured its first grid-scale project in Germany - a 5 MW / 20 MWh installation scheduled for delivery in Q1 2026. LION’s state-of-the-art battery containers are designed for large-scale applications, combining Chinese cost competitiveness with German engineering, service, guarantees, and bankability. Market interest in this value proposition is high: the current pipeline exceeds 7.5 GWh with potential clients across Europe.In August 2025, LION E-Mobility AG has entered a strategic partnership with Münchner Solarkraftwerke to jointly realize large-scale solar and storage projects. The collaboration grants LION direct access to a fast-growing market for photovoltaic-coupled and stand-alone storage systems, reinforcing its strategic focus on energy storage.
