# UNLOCKD Inc. (OTCID: BFCH) Nears Key Milestones in Brand Partnership, Equity Funding, and Digital-Asset Integration

LANCASTER, PA - November 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTCID: BFCH), doing business as UNLOCKD Inc., today issued a corporate update outlining progress across its near-term execution priorities, including the final phase of its equity seed round, the expected closing of a previously disclosed Letter of Intent (LOI) with a global consumer brand, and the continued modernization of its balance-sheet and digital-asset infrastructure.

 LOI approaching binding stage

 On October 31, 2025, UNLOCKD executed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with a well-known global consumer-brand partner to pursue a strategic commercial collaboration within the wellness and functional-beverage sector.

 As described in the Company’s November 3, 2025 Supplemental Disclosure, the LOI establishes a structured framework under which UNLOCKD would oversee the development, production, and market introduction of a new wellness-oriented beverage line aligned with the partner’s global brand standards within an emerging, rapidly growing functional-beverage category.

 Under the contemplated structure, UNLOCKD will retain 90% ownership and full operational control through a dedicated subsidiary, with rights limited to the North American market. All revenue generated from this collaboration is expected to be recognized directly on BFCH’s consolidated financial statements.

 The LOI is non-binding except for confidentiality and exclusivity provisions but will automatically become binding once the specified closing conditions are satisfied. Management expects those conditions, together with the completion of the Company’s equity seed round, to be finalized within the next two weeks, after which the partner’s identity will be publicly disclosed through a joint announcement.

 Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, Chairman and CEO, commented: “Every step we’ve taken since July has been deliberate. This collaboration represents the first commercial activation under the UNLOCKD platform and validates the discipline behind our turnaround. We’re now positioned to bring a globally recognized brand into the wellness-beverage space under a structure that delivers real alignment, ownership, and value creation.”

 Final phase of $175K equity seed round

 UNLOCKD remains in the final stage of its $175,000 equity-only seed round, authorized by the Board on November 5, 2025. All securities are being issued as restricted common stock pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of the Securities Act.

 No convertible notes or variable-rate instruments are involved. The raise is expected to close within the same general timeframe as the LOI conditions.

 Upon completion, management believes the round will provide sufficient capital to execute near-term commercial objectives and create the valuation basis for a future Regulation A offering at a higher price point.

 Balencic added, “As promised, this is a clean, equity-only raise. No new debt, no dilution beyond what’s been disclosed. We’re raising efficiently, deploying with precision, and staying fully aligned with shareholders.”

 Balance-sheet position and financial update

 The Company also expects to file its Q3 2025 financial report this week, which management anticipates will reflect the elimination of more than $2 million in legacy convertible debt, an approximately 85 percent reduction in total liabilities, and a return to positive shareholders’ equity for the first time in several years. These improvements follow structural actions completed in July that removed toxic financing instruments, cancelled more than 235 million unsupported or non-beneficial shares, and restored long-term balance-sheet integrity.

 “We’ve built a foundation that can scale responsibly,” said Balencic. “By eliminating toxic debt, tightening the share structure, and restoring positive equity, we’ve set the stage for sustainable growth and meaningful long-term value creation.”

 Digital-asset modernization and tokenization roadmap

 On November 9, 2025, the Board adopted two new resolutions to advance UNLOCKD’s digital-asset and tokenization strategy:

 1. Digital-Asset Treasury Policy and Cryptocurrency Holdings - authorizing measured acquisition and custody of select digital assets as part of the Company’s corporate treasury.
2. Authorization to Accept Digital-Asset Consideration for Equity Issuances - permitting qualified investors to subscribe for equity using cryptocurrency under existing securities-law exemptions.

 These initiatives formalize the next stage of the modernization roadmap first described in the October 20 shareholder update. Management expects to add cryptocurrency to the balance sheet later in Q4 as part of a broader plan to strengthen liquidity optionality, hedge inflation exposure, and establish infrastructure for compliant, utility-driven tokenized ownership.

 Balencic stated: “Since August, we’ve been laying the foundation for how digital assets can provide balance-sheet utility and long-term shareholder value. We’ve seen growing interest from investors who want to contribute cryptocurrency in exchange for restricted equity as a way to align with the Company’s growth and potentially outperform traditional crypto holdings over time. The next evolution of capital markets is already underway. Tokenization is how ownership becomes more transparent, participatory, and borderless. For a diversified consumer-brand platform like UNLOCKD, it’s a logical progression that connects investors, consumers, and brands within one aligned ecosystem. We look forward to sharing more progress in the near future.”
