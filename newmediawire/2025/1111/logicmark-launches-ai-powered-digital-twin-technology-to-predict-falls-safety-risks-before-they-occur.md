# LogicMark Launches AI-Powered Digital Twin Technology to Predict Falls, Safety Risks Before They Occur

By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - When it comes to monitoring independent seniors, much of the focus is reactionary, whether it's watching for falls, prolonged inactivity or when vital signs drop below critical thresholds. But what if the care could be preventive? What if there were a digital twin of the person under monitoring that could spot unseen dangers and alert caregivers before a threat becomes life-altering?

 That’s becoming a reality thanks to LogicMark Inc. (OTC: LGMK), the provider of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communication devices and technology for the growing care economy. In healthcare, digital twins are virtual replicas of patients that use real-time data from medical devices and wearables to model health outcomes, predict risks and support personalized care. LogicMark’s patented, AI-powered Care Village Digital Twin is predictive health technology that creates a real-time virtual twin of the person under monitoring. The virtual twin analyzes the person’s data to predict future outcomes, enabling caregivers to take proactive and preventive steps instead of reacting after the fact.

 The company’s Caring Platform as a Service (CPaaS) collects and analyzes user data from its medical alert devices and caregiver applications. Using this, it builds a baseline wellness profile for each person under care. Caregivers are notified of the potential risk if the person falls below the baseline, drawing on the company’s extensive experience in emergency response and alert systems.

 The Future State Of Caregiving

 As an example of the potential for this system, consider a 65-year-old woman who typically walks 10,000 steps a day with her elderly friends around the neighborhood. Her family lives in another state and uses the Care Village app to track her daily steps, remind her to take medications and monitor her medical alert devices. Suddenly, her step count drops from 10,000 to 5,000 steps per day. This shift continues, and LogicMark’s AI could predict that a fall or health emergency is imminent. After comparing her steps with her previous data or other digital twins within the LogicMark ecosystem, LogicMark estimates that there was a higher risk she could fall. Her caregivers are notified, and the data is broken down so they can share it with her doctors.

 Or consider a 70-year-old man who lives alone and is monitored by one of LogicMark’s devices. The data regarding his step count, poor medication adherence or other falls is applied to his digital twin. Over the course of 48 hours, his step count declines from his normal routine and he does not take his medications as scheduled. That triggers the system to alert caregivers that a fall is imminent. The caregiver can be more vigilant, and a fall can be prevented because the digital twin was able to notice that small change in the person before it became something worse.

 These examples highlight the range of data LogicMark’s technology uses to deliver more proactive and personalized care across multiple scenarios.

 The Evolution Of Digital Twins

 LogicMark’s digital twin is unique because it draws from personalized and individualized data to create a baseline profile that is unique to that device user. LogicMark has real-time, powerful first-party data at its fingertips directly from the devices.

 Their digital twins are dynamic and continuously updated with new data to further inform the AI about the person being monitored. The digital twins can be compared within the LogicMark system and cross-referenced via AI to evaluate the probability of falls or safety risks based on a number of data points. Each device user has their own digital twin, so LogicMark has a large pool of data to pull from, and each will evolve as more information - such as behaviors, activities, falls, locations, steps and medication data - is added.

 LogicMark’s Care Village Digital Twin predictive health technology brings more peace of mind to independent seniors and caregivers thanks to its ability to predict potential falls and health-related events. With this technology, caregivers have to worry less and less about false alarms. LogicMark’s AI can run misalignment analysis and other predictive tools against the digital twin to assess whether the person under monitoring is at risk and how serious that risk might be based on a specific behavioral pattern.

 Proactive is better than reactive, and that’s exactly what LogicMark is doing with Care Village Digital Twins, and for good reason. More and more older adults are independent and on the go, and they don’t want something like a potential fall stopping them.

 By transforming care from reactive to proactive, LogicMark’s Digital Twin technology empowers older adults to live independently, confidently and safely, and also improves patient outcomes.
