# Search Atlas CEO Manick Bhan Pioneers "Vibe SEO" Revolution, Stating It Will "Not Replace but Empower Marketers"

NEW YORK, NY - November 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As businesses grapple with rising marketing costs and increasing demand for faster campaign deployment, Search Atlas CEO and CTO Manick Bhan emerges as a leading voice in the revolutionary “Vibe SEO” movement.

 Manick declares that “businesses adopting Vibe SEO methodologies could reduce the time it takes to deploy marketing efforts, allowing teams to push out changes quicker and easier than ever before,” according to his Vibe SEO presentation during the Search Atlas Live 2025 event in New York City on September 26, 2025. Vibe SEO is the practice of using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate SEO through a conversational UI that makes optimization intuitive and human-like.

 “Vibe SEO will never replace your brain, but it will save you time, make you more efficient, and help you deploy and build quicker while iterating faster,” says Bhan, who is recognized as a frontrunner in the Vibe SEO movement and a leading expert at the intersection of AI and marketing automation. “Just as vibe coding transformed software development from complex, time-intensive processes to intuitive, rapid application creation, Vibe SEO will fundamentally change how businesses approach marketing strategy.”

 Amplifying Human Intelligence Through Agentic Marketing Tools

 The Vibe SEO philosophy centers on transforming marketing tools into agentic experiences that mirror the intuitive nature of modern coding practices. Rather than replacing human intelligence, Vibe SEO amplifies marketing professionals’ capabilities, enabling them to build, deploy, and iterate strategies with unprecedented speed and precision.

 “We’re seeing agencies cut their SEO implementation time from weeks to hours using our current tools,” notes Bhan. “When Vibe SEO fully materializes, we anticipate this becoming minutes for strategy deployment, all while keeping the marketer’s strategic thinking at the center of every decision.”

 Businesses Could Get Left Behind If They Do Not Adopt AI into Their Marketing

 “AI is changing how we work and also how we search for and buy products,” says Bhan. “The businesses that embrace Vibe SEO principles now will have massive competitive advantages as the methodology becomes mainstream.”

 “We’re not replacing marketers – we’re giving them superpowers to execute their vision faster and more effectively than ever before. At its core, Vibe SEO is about giving marketers the tools to be more human - to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationship building while AI handles the repetitive, technical work,” concludes Bhan. “It’s not about replacing jobs; it’s about making every marketing professional exponentially more powerful.”
