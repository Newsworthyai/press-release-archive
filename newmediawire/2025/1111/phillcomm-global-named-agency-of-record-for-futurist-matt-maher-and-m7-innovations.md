# PhillComm Global Named Agency of Record for Futurist Matt Maher and M7 Innovations

NEW YORK, NY - November 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - PhillComm Global, the world’s premier PR firm for emerging industries, today announced it has been appointed the agency of record for futurist Matt Maher and his firm, M7 Innovations. The partnership marks a powerful alignment between two forces shaping the future of innovation, technology, and storytelling.

 Maher is a thought leader, and the founder of M7 Innovations. He has guided executive teams at Fortune 100 companies through the ever-changing worlds of technology and media, advising, conceptualizing and executing creative, forward-thinking solutions. His thought leadership has been featured in Forbes, Barron’s, Quartz, Digiday, Adweek, and Vogue, which recently named him one of the Top 100 Innovators of 2024. Matt also sits on the international advisory boards of CHANEL and The Glimpse Group (NASDAQ: VRAR), and under his leadership, M7 was selected as the 35th official member of The MIT Media Lab Consortium.

 M7 Innovations is an independent research and development firm that explores innovation across media, technology, and consumer behavior. The company operates through two main areas: strategic advisement for long-established global brands navigating technological evolution, and thought leadership through keynotes, workshops, and immersive experiences.

 At the heart of M7’s philosophy is perspective. The firm helps organizations see around corners, reflecting a brand’s current reality while revealing new opportunities for growth. M7 works closely with leadership teams to uncover challenges from the inside out and to ensure that legacy and innovation move forward together.

 “Matt and M7 Innovations embody the forward-thinking ethos that defines this new era of technology and communication,” said Jon Lindsay Phillips, CEO of PhillComm Global. “Our mission has always been to champion voices who are shaping the future, not just observing it. Matt’s ability to connect the dots between humanity and innovation aligns perfectly with the kind of bold storytelling and insight PhillComm was built to deliver.”

 PhillComm Global will lead strategic communications, thought leadership positioning, and media relations for Maher and M7. The agency will amplify their influence across emerging technology, artificial intelligence, spatial computing, the evolving internet and the expanding world of immersive media.

 “I have always believed that innovation is most powerful when it is understood - when it inspires action rather than intimidation,” said Matt Maher, Founder of M7 Innovations. “Partnering with PhillComm Global gives us the opportunity to share that message more widely, to translate complex ideas into stories that spark imagination, curiosity, and progress.”

 Together, PhillComm Global and M7 Innovations will continue to help businesses, brands, and audiences navigate and shape what comes next.
