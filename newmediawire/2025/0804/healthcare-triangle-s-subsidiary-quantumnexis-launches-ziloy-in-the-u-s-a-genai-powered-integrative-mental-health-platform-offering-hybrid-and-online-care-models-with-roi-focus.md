# Healthcare Triangle's Subsidiary QuantumNexis Launches ZILOY in the U.S. - A GenAI-Powered Integrative Mental Health Platform Offering Hybrid and Online Care Models With ROI Focus

PLEASANTON, CALIF. - August 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCTI) (“HCTI” or the "Company"), a leader in digital transformation solutions including managed services, cloud enablement, and data analytics for the healthcare and life sciences industries - today announced the U.S. launch of ZILOY, a GenAI-powered integrative mental health platform developed by its wholly owned subsidiary, QuantumNexis. Offering both hybrid and online care models, ZILOY delivers personalized wellness journeys that unite modern psychiatry, clinical psychology, therapeutic yoga, and clinical nutrition - powered by artificial intelligence and led by licensed clinicians.

 ZILOY enters the U.S. market amid a historic surge in mental health demand, presenting a significant growth opportunity. Over 60 million adults - more than 23% of the population - experienced a mental illness in the past year, yet fewer than half received treatment. Anxiety disorders alone impact 42 million Americans, and one in four adults is diagnosed annually. The current system faces critical bottlenecks - long wait times, high costs, and inconsistent access - underscoring the urgent need for scalable, tech-enabled solutions. ZILOY directly addresses this gap with a GenAI-powered platform built for clinical impact, digital scale, and enterprise ROI, positioning Healthcare Triangle (HCTI) for long-term value creation

 ZILOY is designed to bridge critical gaps in today’s fragmented behavioral health ecosystem. By combining evidence-based clinical science with time-honored holistic practices, the platform empowers individuals and families to proactively manage mental wellness across all life stages - from childhood through senior care.

 “ZILOY is more than a product launch - it represents a bold leap forward in our GenAI-driven vision to reshape the future of integrative mental health,” said Suresh Venkatachari, Chairman of QuantumNexis. “With the strategic support of HCTI, we’re proud to launch in the U.S market with a platform built for scale, trust, and clinical impact and it will be fully commercially available by Q4 2025. ZILOY reflects our commitment to delivering high-growth, high impact digital solutions that create long-term value for individuals, enterprises, and shareholders.”
