# Neutra Corp's Subsidiary, Neutra Life Sciences, Expands Rapidly With New Joint Venture Partnerships

HOUSTON, TX - August 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neutra Corp (OTC: NTRR) is hitting its stride with the purposeful growth in the clinical research industry with Neutra Life Sciences. Since the successful launch of its Site Management Organization (SMO), Neutra Life Sciences has strategically positioned itself for significant growth in the latter part of 2025 and the beginning of 2026. Neutra Life Sciences has solidified its multi-specialty platform by securing another suite of Joint Venture Partnerships.

 These new joint venture sites will be in the onboarding process:

 * Podiatry
* Radiation Oncology
* Dermatology

 Expanding into more specialties gives Neutra Life Sciences a significant advantage over other organizations in the space. This diversification in medical specialties allows NLS to serve a broader patient population and meet increasing demands in clinical research.

 Looking ahead, Neutra Life Sciences plans to continue expanding into additional specialties, further enhancing its ability to support Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and Sponsors with a wider array of clinical indications. This strategic growth enables the company to play a critical role in accelerating the development of innovative treatments across a broader spectrum of therapeutic areas.

 “Our growth reflects the increasing demand for high-quality, integrated clinical research solutions,” said Sydney Jim, President and CEO of Neutra Corp. “By aligning with established private practices and opening these new specialized sites, we are not only expanding our service offerings but also fostering innovation in patient care and research.”

 Neutra Life Sciences remains focused on building a robust network of clinical research sites, delivering exceptional services to its partners, and advancing its mission to improve health outcomes through cutting-edge collaboration.

 Neutra has made the strategic decision to divest its subsidiary, VIVIS Corporation, a hemp-based cannabis entity, as part of a broader shift toward long-term growth in the life sciences sector. This transition reflects the company's renewed focus on advancing its clinical research capabilities through its newly launched site management organization (SMO). By reallocating resources and leadership attention to the SMO business, Neutra aims to support high-quality clinical trials and expand its presence in the evolving healthcare and biotechnology landscape. This move underscores the company’s commitment to innovation and delivering value in areas with greater regulatory stability and long-term market potential.
