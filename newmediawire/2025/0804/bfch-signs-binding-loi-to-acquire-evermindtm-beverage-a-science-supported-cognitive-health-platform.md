# BFCH Signs Binding LOI to Acquire EVERMIND™ Beverage - A Science-Supported Cognitive Health Platform

Accretive Acquisition Adds IP-backed Consumer Brand, Strengthens Balance Sheet, and Reinforces $0.01 Equity Benchmark Ahead of Eventual Uplisting and Expanded Capital Strategy

 CRESTVIEW, FL - August 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTC: BFCH), doing business as EVERMIND Holdings, Inc. (“EVERMIND”), today announced it has signed a binding Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire ERApeutics, LLC, the developer of EVERMIND™ - a physician-formulated functional beverage platform for cognitive health.

 Designed as a creamy, plant-based protein shake, EVERMIND™ delivers both short- and long-term brain health benefits in one convenient daily ritual. The brand is shelf-stable, science-supported, and ready for commercialization.

 The transaction is structured as a $4,000,000 equity acquisition, based on the total issuance of 400,000,000 restricted common shares at a fixed price of $0.01 per share. This marks the Company’s second major transaction executed at the $0.01 benchmark, following the previously disclosed $2 million convertible note settlement at the same price.

 “This isn’t just a beverage asset - it’s a platform,” said Dr. Jordan Balencic, CEO of BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. “EVERMIND™ is shelf-stable, IP-backed, and commercialization-ready. I believe it’s the next CELH of brain health. What Celsius did for metabolism, EVERMIND aims to do for mental clarity, mood, and cognitive performance. It’s built to scale, to spin off, and to anchor our broader wellness ecosystem.”

 ERApeutics, LLC has raised $1.67 million in equity capital at a $4 million pre-money valuation, with a cap table that includes two institutional investors. The EVERMIND™ asset package includes six flagship proprietary nootropic and adaptogenic formulations, an R&D pipeline, academic research, registered trademarks, a fully integrated Shopify-based e-commerce stack (thinkevermind.com), and commercialization-ready branding.

 EVERMIND™ currently carries over $1.1 million in development-stage assets, reflecting the internal buildout of its formulations, regulatory preparation, and go-to-market strategy. These are non-cash contributions recorded on the company’s books that represent meaningful brand equity and commercialization readiness. The EVERMIND™ roadmap also features a pipeline of complementary functional formats, such as light sparkling beverages, powders, and concentrated shots -each engineered for distinct cognitive use occasions.

 The acquisition is expected to materially strengthen BFCH’s balance sheet by adding structured, IP-backed assets and aligning with the Company’s OTCQB uplisting strategy. With the elimination of over $2 million in toxic convertible debt, total liabilities reduced to under $94,000, and multiple asset-based transactions priced at a fixed equity benchmark, BFCH is creating the financial and operational foundation necessary for future institutional engagement.

 “We’re building a balance sheet that meets the standards of institutional capital,” added Balencic. “From fixed-price asset acquisitions to disciplined equity structuring, every move we’re making supports our OTCQB uplisting roadmap and broader capital markets strategy. The $0.01 benchmark, now used in both debt resolution and asset acquisition, is more than symbolic. It’s a contractual reference point guiding how we build value. BFCH is no longer a distressed vehicle -it’s a reset platform, positioned for growth.”

 The functional beverage space continues to attract institutional attention. Recent transactions -such as Keurig Dr Pepper’s $300M valuation investment in Poppi, Coca-Cola’s majority stake in Health-Ade, and Unilever’s acquisition of Liquid I.V. -validate growing investor appetite at the intersection of wellness, flavor, and function. EVERMIND™ positions BFCH to participate in this momentum with a differentiated, brain-first platform.

 The transaction is expected to close within 60 to 90 days, subject to standard confirmatory due diligence and final documentation. Upon completion, EVERMIND™ will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of EVERMIND Labs, with future spin-off optionality.
