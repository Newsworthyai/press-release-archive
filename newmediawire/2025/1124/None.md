# Regen Launches Travaleo, a Boutique Hotel Real Estate Tokenization Platform, and Announces Its First Tokenized Offering, TRYOI

NEW YORK, NY - November 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Genesis Holdings, Inc. (OTC: GNIS), dba Regen, today announced the official launch of Travaleo (https://www.travaleo.com), its boutique-hotel–focused real estate tokenization platform, specifically engineered to open institutional-grade hospitality investments to the global accredited investor market. As part of the platform’s debut, Regen also announced the introduction of its first digital security token, TRYOI, a Bitcoin-treasured, asset-backed token offering anchored by YOO Aruba, a YOO-branded luxury residence project in Aruba, set to start construction mid-January 2026. The token will also acquire already built and income-producing YOO branded projects across the world.

 Built on deep expertise in luxury real estate development and advanced blockchain infrastructure acquired through Metrospaces, Travaleo represents a segmented and specialized approach to real estate tokenization - distinguishing itself in a crowded market by focusing exclusively on branded boutique hotels and luxury residences, a category historically accessible only to institutional investors and private equity groups.

 “Real estate tokenization is evolving, but what investors truly want is specialization, transparency, and real assets with global brand value,” said Oscar Brito, Chief Executive Officer of Genesis. “With Travaleo, we’re targeting one of the most resilient segments in hospitality - YOO-branded boutique projects - while fusing it with a Bitcoin-anchored structure that offers a powerful hedge against global fiat debasement. TRYOI is not just another token; it is a gateway to asset-backed wealth, monthly income, and long-term appreciation.”

 TRYOI Coin - Investment Summary

 Structured as a $25 million digital security token offering, TRYOI consists of 250 million tokens priced at $0.10 each, giving accredited investors direct, compliant ownership in a curated portfolio of boutique hotel assets.

 Investment Highlights

 * Target 5–6% cash-on-cash return, distributed monthly after stabilization
