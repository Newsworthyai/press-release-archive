# BioCorRx Reports Business Update for the First Quarter of 2025

BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. Acquired LUCEMYRA® (lofexidine), an FDA-Approved Opioid Withdrawal Medication, from USWM, LLC

 ANAHEIM, CA - May 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BioCorRx Inc. (OTCQB: BICX) (the “Company”), a developer and provider of innovative treatment programs for substance abuse and related disorders, today provided a business update for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and reported on recent corporate developments.

 Additionally, BioCorRx Inc. announced, on March 4, 2025, that the Company’s subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LUCEMYRA® (lofexidine), a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescription medication for opioid withdrawal from USWM, LLC. LUCEMYRA is the first and only non-opioid medication approved by the FDA to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms, providing critical relief for patients undergoing opioid detoxification.

 Lourdes Felix, CEO, CFO, and Director of BioCorRx Inc., commented, “In Q1 2025, we completed a strategic asset acquisition through our subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., with USWM LLC. We are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. This strategic move has already begun to drive revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025, with notable net product revenues from LUCEMYRA®. The net revenues were $134,899 compared to $3,620 in the same period in 2024. Continuing our trend of managing and reducing operating expenses remains paramount. We’ve continued to decrease operating expenses by approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2024. We expect LUCEMYRA® to remain a key revenue driver and believe its continued growth will enhance shareholder value.”

 BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. also continues the development of sustained-release naltrexone products, with ongoing research supported by a significant grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant is designated for the development of BICX104, a subcutaneous, long-duration naltrexone implantable pellet intended for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder (MUD), either as a standalone therapy or in combination with bupropion. MUD is a significant public health challenge, affecting individuals, families, and communities across the nation. With no approved medications currently available specifically for MUD, and an expanding demographic at risk of methamphetamine-related overdose deaths, this funding will greatly accelerate our research efforts to develop BICX104 as a potential treatment. We look forward to sharing additional development updates soon, including an update for BICX104 for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).

 A copy of the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on the Company’s website at https://ir.biocorrx.com/.

 Important Safety Information

 What is LUCEMYRA?

 LUCEMYRA is a non-opioid prescription medicine used in adults to help with the symptoms of opioid withdrawal that may happen when you stop taking an opioid suddenly. LUCEMYRA will not completely prevent the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is not a treatment for opioid use disorder.

 Important Safety Information

 LUCEMYRA can cause serious side effects, including low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and fainting. Watch for symptoms of low blood pressure or heart rate, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint at rest or when quickly standing up; if you experience these symptoms, call your healthcare provider right away and do not take your next dose of LUCEMYRA until you have talked to your healthcare provider. Avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated and be careful not to stand up too suddenly from lying or sitting, as these may increase your risk of low blood pressure and fainting. When your treatment is complete, you will need to stop taking LUCEMYRA gradually, or your blood pressure could increase. After a period of not using opioid drugs, you can become more sensitive to the effects of opioids if you start using them again. This may increase your risk of overdose and death. Before taking LUCEMYRA, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you have low blood pressure, slow heart rate, any heart problems including history of heart attack or a condition called long QT syndrome, liver or kidney problems, or if you drink alcohol. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, plan on becoming pregnant, or are breastfeeding; it is not known if LUCEMYRA can harm your unborn baby or whether LUCEMYRA passes into your breast milk. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tranquilizers, or sleeping pills, as taking these with LUCEMYRA can cause serious side effects.
