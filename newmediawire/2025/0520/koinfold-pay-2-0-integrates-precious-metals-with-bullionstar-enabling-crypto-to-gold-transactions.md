# KOINFOLD Pay 2.0 Integrates Precious Metals With BullionStar, Enabling Crypto-to-Gold Transactions

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - May 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - KYN Capital Group, Inc. (OTC: KYNC), Unveils KOINFOLD Pay 2.0, Enabling Precious Metals Purchases with Cryptocurrency.

 KYN Capital Group announces a transformative feature in KOINFOLD Pay 2.0, allowing users to purchase physical precious metals - gold, silver, and platinum - directly with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This seamless integration empowers investors to diversify portfolios by converting digital assets into tangible bullion via the KOINFOLD app.

 Through a partnership with BullionStar’s Bullion Savings Program (BSP), KOINFOLD users can acquire gold, silver, or platinum by the gram at competitive costs. Each gram is backed by physical metals stored in secure, audited vaults, with daily transparency reports accessible on BullionStar’s website.

 BullionStar operates state-of-the-art vaults in Dallas, Texas; Singapore; and Wellington, New Zealand. Customers retain full legal ownership of their bullion, stored outside the banking system to reduce counterparty risk. The vaults are fully insured, audited by LBMA-approved firms like Bureau Veritas, and accessible 24/7 via BullionStar’s platform for buying, selling, auditing, or withdrawing metals. Tax advantages, such as GST exemptions for investment-grade metals in Singapore and similar benefits in the U.S. and New Zealand, enhance investor value.

 “This partnership merges cryptocurrency’s flexibility with the timeless stability of precious metals,” said Rick Wilson, CEO of KYN Capital Group. “By integrating KOINFOLD with BullionStar, we’re enabling users to hedge against inflation and volatility with secure, transparent access to physical bullion, driving significant revenue growth for our company.”

 “Our vision from the onset is to make precious metals incredibly accessible, convenient, and available at great prices to everyone all over the world.”
