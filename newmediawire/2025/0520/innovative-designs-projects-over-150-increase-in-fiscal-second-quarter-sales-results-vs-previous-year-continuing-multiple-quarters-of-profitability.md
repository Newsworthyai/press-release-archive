# Innovative Designs Projects Over 150% Increase in Fiscal Second Quarter Sales Results vs Previous Year, Continuing Multiple Quarters of Profitability

Increasing Recognition of Superior and Patented Evacuated Cell Insulation as the Best Option in Homebuilding Driving Ongoing Record Sales

 PITTSBURGH, PA - May 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative Designs, Inc. (OTC Pink: IVDN) today is able to project its revenue growth for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, ending on April 30th, will exceed previous expectations and deliver over $750,000 (at least 150% increase over the fiscal 2nd quarter of 2024). This new milestone will continue the Company’s profitability, which now spans the last three trailing quarters. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2025 IVDN sales revenue will have already approximately reached the total for all of fiscal 2024.    Management expects to file a finalized financial report ahead of the June 15th SEC posting requirement.

 Continued demand for Innovative Designs Insultex House Wrap® is being driven by new government building codes specifying continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements. For new construction, our patented and unique evacuated cell Insultex House Wrap®, adds an R-6 moisture barrier membrane that does not need additional insulation boards or other support as with other products from competitors. This makes Insultex House Wrap®, the best overall insulation house wrap choice available on the market today. For full product specifications and details visit: http://www.insultexhousewrap.com.

 Randy Kimbler of Insultex® Distributor Built Link Solutions, LLC commented, “Due to the sharply increasing interest that the superior Insultex® solution is generating, we have recently expanded our marketing campaign into new states which include: Connecticut, Massachusetts, South Dakota, Montana and Maryland. We have also been increasing the size of our sales staff to meet the rising level of inquiries being receiving as the advantages of the Insultex® product line are becoming more recognized in the national homebuilding industry. There is no better option for insulation performance and cost effectiveness so we anticipate the market demand to continue to rise, going forward and we will be ready to respond.”

 Joseph A. Riccelli Jr., CEO of Innovative Designs, stated, “Insultex House Wrap® is taking its place as a product of choice by more and more homebuilders and remodelers. The continuing record results in our revenue growth clearly illustrate this trend. We expect to be filing our official fiscal second quarter financial report within the next 30 days with finalized numbers, but at this time, we can confidently project at least the record totals cited above which will put IVDN well on a path to its best year ever in 2025. To support this strong sales growth rate, we are still working to boost “Insultex House Wrap® production levels from our US-based facilities in Massachusetts and other locations. Additionally, we are anticipating having IVDN stock uplisted to the higher OTCQX tier in the near term as we have completed all steps necessary for this advancement.”
