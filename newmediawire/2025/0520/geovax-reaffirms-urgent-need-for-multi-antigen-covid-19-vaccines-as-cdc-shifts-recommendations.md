# GeoVax Reaffirms Urgent Need for Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccines as CDC Shifts Recommendations

GEO-CM04S1 Demonstrates Superior Protection in Immunocompromised Populations; Fully Aligned with HHS Priorities for Durable, Broad-Spectrum Immunization

 ATLANTA, GA - May 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today issued a statement in response to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) anticipated changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

 According to recent reports, HHS is preparing to limit blanket vaccine guidance in favor of a risk-based approach focused on older adults and those with chronic health problems. This pivot away from one-size-fits-all vaccine recommendations underscores the urgent need for next-generation immunization strategies - precisely the role that GeoVax’s multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine, GEO-CM04S1, is designed to fulfill.

 “As public health strategy shifts toward protecting those most vulnerable, the demand increases for vaccines that work where others fall short,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. “GEO-CM04S1 delivers broad, durable immunity even in immunocompromised patients - a population estimated at over 40 million adults in the U.S. that are inadequately served by the current authorized, single-antigen mRNA vaccines.”

 GEO-CM04S1: Purpose-Built for the New Vaccine Paradigm

 GEO-CM04S1 is based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform and expresses both Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins - offering multi-antigen protection against SARS-CoV-2. This broader design induces both antibody and T cell responses, essential for robust, durable protection against continually evolving COVID-19 variants and is especially critical in populations with weakened immune systems.

 Recent interim results from a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrated a superior T cell response rate versus a leading mRNA vaccine. The trial’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended and implemented continuing enrollment in the GEO-CM04S1 arm while halting the underperforming mRNA comparator arm.

 Aligned with the New HHS Biosecurity Vision

 GEO-CM04S1 is fully aligned with the new strategic direction from HHS Secretary Kennedy, who has called for a focus toward multi-antigen vaccine technologies that can deliver durable, variant-adaptive immunity while prioritizing safety and domestic production.

 GeoVax’s MVA vaccines offer:

 * Multi-antigen breadth: Including both S and N antigens for protection across variants.
* Durability: Sustained antibody and T cell immunity - even in immunocompromised individuals.
* Safety: MVA is non-replicating and approved for use in vulnerable groups such as transplant patients, pregnant women, and children.
* Domestic advanced manufacturing: Using an avian continuous cell line platform that eliminates reliance on specialized pathogen-free eggs and a slow vaccine manufacturing process, enabling scalable U.S.-based vaccine production aligned with President Trump’s recent Executive Order on pharmaceutical onshoring.

 “The HHS call for broader, more resilient vaccine solutions is well-founded,” Dodd added. “GEO-CM04S1 is not only scientifically advanced but strategically aligned with our nation’s public health and biosecurity goals.”

 Multiple Trials Support Path to Licensure

 GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three active Phase 2 trials, evaluating its use among:

 1. Immunocompromised blood cancer patients in preparation for stem cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy (in comparison to mRNA-based vaccine),
2. Immunocompromised patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (in comparison to mRNA vaccine), and
3. Healthy adults, previously vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine as a more robust, more durable booster following mRNA vaccination.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The Company is also developing GEO-MVA, a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
