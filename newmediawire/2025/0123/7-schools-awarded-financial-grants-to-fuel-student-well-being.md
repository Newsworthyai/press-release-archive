# 7 schools awarded financial grants to fuel student well-being

(NewMediaWire) - January 23, 2025 - DALLAS — The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is championing student health and well-being by awarding financial grants to seven schools nationwide. These grants, provided through the Association’s Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ programs, enable schools to invest in resources like fitness equipment, water bottle filling stations, and educational tools to support healthier environments. By directly funding these in-school resources, the Association aims to foster healthy habits in youth to combat issues like childhood obesity—which, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), affects nearly 20% of children and teens.

 “These grants are about more than just funding; they’re a commitment to shaping a healthier future for our students,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and former executive vice president and chief diversity officer for The PNC Financial Services Group. “When schools have the resources to encourage healthy habits, we’re not just improving lives today—we’re building a foundation for lifelong well-being and success.”

 All schools nationwide that participated in the Kids Heart Challenge or American Heart Challenge during the 2024 fall semester were eligible to apply for grants. Awarded twice each year, these grants reflect the American Heart Association’s dedication to improving cardiovascular health for all people. This cycle’s grant recipients are:

 * Lowell Elementary, Waterloo, Iowa
* Moore Magnet Elementary School, Clarksville, Tennessee
* Royal Academy of Excellence, San Antonio, Texas
* Shirley Township Elementary, Mount Union, Pennsylvania
* St. Rose of Lima School, DeSoto, Missouri
* Virginia Community Unit School, Virginia, Illinois
* Woodbine Elementary School, Sacramento, California

 The Kids Heart Challenge and American Heart Challenge initiatives are rooted in proven science showing that kids who stay active are more likely to grow into healthy adults. Each year, these programs reach more than  10 million students in approximately 20,000 schools nationwide. Students learn how to improve their overall health while making a positive impact on the health of others. Through engaging lesson plans and interactive technology, students get active, have fun and learn lifesaving skills like Hands-Only CPR.

 The next grant application deadline is May 25, 2025. For more information about the American Heart Association’s in-school initiatives and how to participate, visit heart.org/getstarted.
