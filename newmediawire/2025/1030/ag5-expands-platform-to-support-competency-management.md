# AG5 Expands Platform to Support Competency Management

AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS - October 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - AG5, a leading provider of skills management and compliance software, has expanded its platform to include full competency management capabilities, helping organisations bridge the gap between workforce skills and operational needs.

 The update extends AG5’s core skills matrix software into a more comprehensive solution that enables HR, training, and operations teams to map, track, and manage employee competencies in real time.

 “Our clients are looking for more than visibility - they want control and clarity over workforce capability,” said Rick Van Echtelt, CEO of AG5. “Adding competency management tools was the natural next step to help them link skills data directly to job roles, audits, and compliance goals.”

 The new features allow companies to define role-based competencies, assess proficiency levels, and automatically identify skills gaps across teams and departments. By integrating these functions directly into AG5’s existing platform, organizations can ensure that training, compliance, and resource planning are all aligned to actual workforce readiness.

 Competency management is increasingly recognized as a critical element of workforce planning - particularly in regulated industries like manufacturing, energy, and aviation - where maintaining compliance and safety depends on clear documentation of employee qualifications and certifications.

 AG5’s visual competency matrices enable managers to easily identify who is qualified for specific tasks, which employees require further development, and how competencies evolve. This data-driven approach reduces manual tracking, streamlines audits, and supports continuous improvement initiatives.

 “Our goal is to make competency management something every team can act on daily - not just during audits or reviews,” added Rick. “This release brings us closer to that vision.”

 With this expansion, AG5 reinforces its position as a trusted partner for companies seeking more innovative, more transparent ways to manage workforce skills, training, and compliance.
