 A Partnership-Driven Gateway

 tZERO Connect unifies the firm’s Application Programming Interface (API) suite and its global partnership network under one banner - enabling banks, broker-dealers, asset managers, and fintech platforms to embed tokenized asset functionality directly within their existing environments.

 Through these integrations, institutional partners can offer clients compliant digital asset capabilities without requiring investors to leave their native applications.

 “Our mission is to make it simple for institutions to access the benefits of tokenization in a robust cross-asset and cross-border 24/7 marketplace,” said Alan Konevsky, CEO of tZERO. “tZERO Connect allows partners to plug directly into our ecosystem - bringing tokenized securities to investors where they already are - bridging traditional and digital market infrastructure.”

 API-First Institutional Connectivity

 With primary issuance APIs now live and secondary trading APIs coming in late 2025/early 2026, tZERO Connect offers seamless programmatic access to the company’s broker-dealer, clearing, custody, and trading capabilities.

 Partners can route orders, access market data, and manage tokenized securities activity while maintaining full control of their client experience.

 tZERO’s regulated entities provide the underlying brokerage, clearing, and custody functions – delivering institutional-grade compliance, security, and transparency.

 Global Collaboration, Local Expertise

 tZERO Connect supports a “follow-the-sun” model designed to link global financial ecosystems through regional partnerships. By connecting best-in-class partners across custody, settlement, and jurisdictions, tZERO extends the reach of compliant digital asset infrastructure worldwide.

 “APIs are the connective tissue of modern financial markets,” added Konevsky. “By combining an API-first mindset with our partnership approach and strategy across supply, demand, global rails, defi connectivity, institutional services and public markets innovation, tZERO Connect builds the rails that let institutions operate seamlessly across asset classes - from traditional to digital.”
