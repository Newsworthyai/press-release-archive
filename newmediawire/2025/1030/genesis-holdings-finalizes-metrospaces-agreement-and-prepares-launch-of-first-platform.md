# Genesis Holdings Finalizes Metrospaces Agreement and Prepares Launch of First Platform

NEW YORK, NY - October 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Genesis Holdings, Inc. (OTC: GNIS) today announced the finalization of its strategic agreement with Metrospaces, Inc. (OTC: MSPC), confirming the acquisition by Genesis of key tokenization and PropTech assets as it prepares to unveil its first digital real estate investment platform in the coming weeks.

 As part of the next phase of integration, Oscar Brito has been named Co-Chief Executive Officer of Genesis and will remain as Chief Executive Officer of Metrospaces, to help guide the Genesis’ entry into the rapidly evolving security token market. Mr. Brito will oversee the rollout of Genesis’ segmented platform strategy - focusing initially on branded boutique hotels and short-term premium residences, with future offerings in multi-family and luxury redevelopment.

 “With this agreement finalized, we are now fully aligned and operational,” said Oscar Brito, Co-CEO of Genesis. “Over the next few weeks, we’ll begin unveiling a series of vertically specialized platforms that enable investors to participate in real estate in a more direct, transparent, and liquid way than ever before. Tokenization isn’t just a trend - it’s a fundamental transformation of how real estate is financed, owned, and accessed.”

 Management expects Genesis’ first Security Token Offerings (STOs) will be rolled out through platforms built on the technology and expertise acquired from Metrospaces. Each offering will be tailored to a distinct real estate segment - such as boutique hotels, branded residences, or vacation rental portfolios - ensuring aligned investor incentives and consistent yield performance.

 In parallel, Genesis plans to introduce a Bitcoin treasury strategy for select STO products, aligning the company’s treasury reserve with long-term stores of value while enabling a unique hedge against fiat currency debasement. The hybrid nature of its token structure - combining asset-backed real estate returns with crypto-aligned capital protection - will differentiate Genesis in a crowded market.

 Genesis’ upcoming platforms, including MetroCrowd and MetroHouse, are expected to formally launch in Q4 2025.
