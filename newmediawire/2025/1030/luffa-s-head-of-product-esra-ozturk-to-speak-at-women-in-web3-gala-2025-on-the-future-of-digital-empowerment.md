# Luffa's Head of Product, Esra Ozturk, to Speak at Women in Web3 Gala 2025 on the Future of Digital Empowerment

LONDON - October 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Luffa, the decentralized messaging platform redefining how fans and creators connect, today announced that its Head of Product, Esra Ozturk, will be a featured speaker at the Women in Web3 Gala 2025: An Evening of Innovation and Impact, hosted by the Global CSR Foundation (GCSRF) aboard a luxury yacht in Marina del Rey, California, on November 8, 2025.

 Ozturk will join a global lineup of visionaries and industry leaders for the panel “The Future of Digital Empowerment: Web 3, AI and Ownership Economy” scheduled at 7:10 pm during the Women in Web 3 Gala. The discussion will explore how emerging technologies are rewriting the rules of ownership, creativity, and opportunity, and how women are leading the charge in building a more inclusive, values-driven digital world.

 “We’re at a turning point where creativity, ownership, and identity are no longer defined by platforms - they’re defined by people,” said Ozturk. “At Luffa, we’re building the infrastructure that allows fans, creators, and brands to own their relationships and value directly. It’s not just about technology - it’s about restoring humanity to the digital economy.”

 Since joining Luffa earlier this year, Ozturk has been leading the company’s product vision and strategy, developing decentralized tools that power authentic connection and collaboration across culture, entertainment, and commerce. With a decade of experience driving product innovation at the intersection of behavior, technology, and community, including previous roles at Uber, Meta, and Zillow, Ozturk is shaping what it means to build technology that serves people, not platforms.

 “Esra brings the rare ability to fuse technical depth with cultural insight,” said Yu Xiong, Founding Advisor at Luffa. “Her leadership reflects our core belief that technology should amplify creativity and human connection, not replace it.”

 The Women in Web3 Gala convenes global changemakers across technology, art, finance, and philanthropy to celebrate women driving innovation in blockchain and AI. Through its immersive, yacht-based format, the event fosters meaningful dialogue and partnerships shaping the future of the digital ownership economy.
