# Senior Care Gets An Upgrade: How LogicMark's Patented Token &amp; Privacy Technology Helps It Better Manage Customer Data Security

By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - October 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - When it comes to monitoring an elderly person in the home or on the go, keeping their health data private and secure is of the utmost importance. After all, if it falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to identity theft, stigmatization, discrimination, elder fraud and even abuse.

 That’s particularly true when third parties are involved. If health data falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to commit medical identity theft, Medicare scams and prescription drug fraud. Unscrupulous people can use it to steal money from vulnerable people and take advantage of our loved ones.

 Taking Privacy Seriously

 It’s why LogicMark Inc. (OTC: LGMK), the maker of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communications devices and IoT technologies designed to create a connected care platform for seniors when they are in or out of the home, takes privacy and security so seriously.

 After all, it collects a lot of data on the people its devices are monitoring and feeds it into a powerful AI and machine learning driven platform designed to help patients and their caregivers manage care at home and on the go.

 Through its data platforms, caregivers, healthcare providers and emergency responders know if a person under monitoring falls down, stops moving, wanders out of a predetermined area or if they don’t take medications. The data is used to monitor vitals, track movements, call for help when the person can’t and even offers a proactive safety perspective.

 While that data is important to help the person under management, it’s not necessary for it to be saved or for others outside the care group to have access to it permanently. Making sure it can be accessed and controlled depending on the situation is a big focus of LogicMark and its technology.

 Patented Technology

 To make sure customers’ data is protected, LogicMark incorporates patented token and privacy technology into its systems. Its patent-protected technology enables encrypted data sharing with strict access controls. That ensures sensitive personal health data is secure, yet available when it's urgently needed.

 To take it to the next level, LogicMark’s patent covers encrypted blockchain technology and encrypted data containers and management. Using blockchain makes it extremely difficult and almost impossible for third parties to access, tamper with or change data. By encrypting it, the information is protected from falling into unauthorized hands.

 Offering patented token and privacy technology in its system, LogicMark can give its customers the peace of mind knowing their information will not be available to everyone but is accessible when it's needed most, such as during an emergency, reports the company. The company offers a level of data security equivalent to HIPAA-level protections, without an oversight body.

 Accessible When Necessary

 Take a scenario in which a person under monitoring experiences a medical emergency while their caretaker is unavailable. The 24/7 monitoring service is granted access to the medical data that the caretaker had previously entered, a video feed or call with the user, as well as the record of a fall happening at that moment. The monitoring service only has temporary access to that data. When emergency services – like an EMT or 911 – arrive at the person’s home, the monitoring service can provide the necessary medical information to the first responders, which prevents medication contradictions during care. Once the monitoring service personnel end the call, the data will no longer be accessible to the 24/7 monitoring service.

 Or take another scenario in which there is a minor emergency where a non-primary caretaker responds and takes a person under monitoring to urgent care. The person under monitoring’s medication and medical history are made available to the non-primary caregiver for that visit, but the primary caretaker controls the duration and visibility. That ensures the data is not permanently stored on the non-primary caretaker’s device unless it is explicitly needed. Those are just two examples of how LogicMark’s patented privacy and token technology ensure the data and privacy of the person under monitoring are protected in major and minor emergencies.

 Monitoring a person’s health and safety is a necessary part of the equation. Protecting their data is the other half. LogicMark does it from devices to patented technology, ensuring its customers are protected from falls and preventing data from falling into the wrong hands.
