# GeoVax Announces Issuance of Patent Covering Novel Vaccine Construct for Preventing Malaria Infection

Patent Supports Multi‑Antigenic VLP-MVA Vaccine Design for Products Used Against Endemic and Emerging Infectious Diseases

 ATLANTA, GA - June 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancers, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued U.S. Patent No. 12,329,808, from patent application No.18,394,580, titled “Compositions and Methods for Generating an Immune Response to Treat or Prevent Malaria.”

 The patent covers compositions comprising GeoVax’s recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vector expressing immunogenic proteins from Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria). The novel construct supports expression of virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) or gametocyte surface protein Pfs230 fused to a Marburg virus glycoprotein transmembrane domain, together with the Marburg VP40 matrix protein. The expressed proteins are assembled in vivo as VLPs, which is an antigen presentation design used to enhance vaccine potency and induce both humoral and T-cell responses.

 David Dodd, GeoVax President and CEO, commented, “This new patent further demonstrates our commitment to advancing critically important vaccines that address both globally persistent and emerging high-consequence pathogens. The vaccine construct exemplifies our multi-antigenic platform strategy that is critical to pandemic preparedness and global health security. While our clinical-stage programs remain our immediate focus, protecting our innovation pipeline through issued patents supports long-term value creation and future public health impact.”

 GeoVax’s intellectual property estate now encompasses over 135 granted or pending patent applications across 23 distinct patent families, reinforcing the company’s strategic position across oncology, infectious diseases, and biodefense platforms. This broad portfolio includes strong protection for its Gedeptin® oncolytic cancer therapy, recently expanded to cover synergistic combinations with radiation, and multiple MVA‑based vaccine constructs targeting SARS‑CoV‑2, Mpox/smallpox, Zika, Ebola, Sudan, and Marburg viruses.

 Malaria remains a persistent global health threat, causing over 600,000 deaths yearly, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. The use of GeoVax’s versatile MVA-based platform offers the potential for inducing durable immunity against both such latent and emerging pathogens.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
