# Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) Announces the Launch of TEL-CDR, the CDRChain Utility Token to Power Next-Gen Telecom Settlement Ecosystem

NEW YORK, NY - June 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) ("Accredited Solutions" or the "Company") is thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of TEL-CDR, the official utility token of the CDRChain ecosystem - a transformative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize the settlement of voice and SMS traffic in the telecommunications industry.

 TEL-CDR will serve as the core transactional and governance medium within the CDRChain platform, enabling faster, more efficient, and transparent settlement processes between telecom carriers, MVNOs, infrastructure providers, and messaging aggregators. This milestone represents a major leap forward in ASII's mission to modernize global telecom infrastructure through blockchain technology.

 “The launch of TEL-CDR is a defining moment for our Company and for the telecom sector as a whole,” said Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions. “This isn’t just a new crypto asset - it’s the foundation of an entirely new way to handle the clearing and settlement of telecom services on a global scale. We are building a system where trust, speed, and automation are embedded by design.”

 Key Highlights of the TEL-CDR Utility Token Initiative:

 Token Name: TEL-CDR

 Initial Issuance: $50 million worth of tokens to be issued.

 Blockchain Infrastructure: Built on scalable, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain architecture.

 Functionality: Enables settlement payments, platform governance, staking incentives, and partner access rights.

 Ecosystem Utility: Drives interoperability and automation for all CDRChain platform participants.

 Economic Inclusion: Empowers small and mid-sized telecom providers to settle and trade with equal transparency and speed.

 The Company will be announcing the official token launch and pre-launch dates in the coming days. In the meantime, interested parties are encouraged to visit https://cdrchain.ai/ and join the waiting list to receive priority updates and early access opportunities.

 A detailed white paper outlining the TEL-CDR utility token structure and functionality is available at: https://cdrchain.ai/utility-token. With no dominant players currently offering a decentralized settlement solution for telecom, TEL-CDR has the potential to become the industry’s most important and widely adopted transaction layer. The platform opens the door to a unified, blockchain-native marketplace for telecom settlement. ASII invites carriers, MVNOs, telecom infrastructure providers, SMS aggregators, and enterprise telecom managers to explore TEL-CDR and become part of this groundbreaking evolution.

 Shareholder Update

 The Company would also like to address the notion that a reverse stock split of its common stock may be required. Accredited Solutions does not view a reverse split as a foreseeable alternative. Thanks to the strategic rescission of the Globetopper acquisition and the advancement of our blockchain-focused initiatives, our need to access traditional capital markets has been significantly reduced.

 Additionally, we anticipate that the use of proceeds from the TEL-CDR token offering will support key infrastructure and platform expansion, while also providing opportunities to bolster ASII’s working capital. This approach may allow us to avoid further dilution through new funding rounds and even consider reacquiring portions of existing convertible preferred stock. We remain committed to building shareholder value responsibly and sustainably.
