# Isiah Thomas Unveils Elite Technical Leadership Team for OWPC's Eco Bio Plastics as It Positions to Lead the $1 Trillion Global Sustainable Materials Market

MIDLAND, MI - August 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Eco Bio Plastics, a wholly owned subsidiary of One World Products, Inc. (OTC: OWPC), which is to become Isiah Enterprises, Inc., today announced the formation of a world-class technical leadership team to accelerate its expansion across the booming sustainable plastics, packaging, and automotive materials sectors. This announcement marks a major milestone in Eco Bio’s evolution from a legacy plant acquisition into a category-defining innovator in green manufacturing.

 The Global Opportunity: A Trillion-Dollar Shift

 According to recent industry reports, the global market for sustainable plastics and bio-based packaging is expected to surpass $1 trillion by 2032, fueled by tightening government regulations, electric vehicle adoption, and ESG investment mandates across manufacturing sectors.

 Within the automotive industry alone, OEMs are under mounting pressure to replace petroleum-based plastics and mineral-filled materials with lighter, recyclable, and more sustainable alternatives. Eco Bio Plastics - now led by a handpicked team of industry experts - is uniquely positioned to deliver scalable solutions at the intersection of innovation, policy compliance, and industrial performance.

 Meet the Technical Team Driving the Future of Eco Bio

 Fukuji Saotome will continue as President & Head of Technical Operations, leveraging his deep operational knowledge to guide plant execution and quality control during this pivotal growth phase. He holds BA with Honors from the University of Kent at Canterbury, England and MiM from Thunderbird Graduate School of International Management.

 Steve Albrecht will continue in his role as Chief Financial Officer of Eco Bio Plastics. Albrecht joined the company in 2015 and has overseen its financial operations since then. Prior to Eco Bio, he held senior finance roles - including CFO, Controller, and Director of Finance - across four companies over a 30-year career. He holds a BA in Accounting from Alma College.

 Joining them are three highly respected automotive and industrial leaders with a combined century of experience:

 * Larry Lyons - Vice President of Engineering: Former Chrysler engineering executive, Lyons brings proven leadership in product development, materials design, and OEM integration. He will guide Eco Bio’s automotive applications to meet the most demanding technical specifications.
* Fred Massat - Applications Engineering Manager: A veteran in OEM Interior applications development, Massat leads the customer-facing engineering team, ensuring that Eco Bio’s recycled and bio-based plastics are application-ready and production-compatible.
* Ed Luibrand - Materials Engineering Manager: An industry-leading expert in thermoplastic & elastomer technology, Luibrand will oversee Eco Bio’s advanced materials lab, developing high-performance formulas for the next generation of green packaging and mobility components.

 Why Now: Scale Meets Sustainability

 “This is our moment,” said Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of OWPC. “With global demand surging for sustainable materials, and new regulatory incentives aligning with our strengths, Eco Bio Plastics is positioned to become one of the fastest-growing players in American green manufacturing.”

 Eco Bio’s advanced micronization and pelletization process enables the production of ultra-small, application-ready biofibers derived from organic matter including agricultural byproducts, natural fibers, and plant-based residues - offering automotive, food, and industrial clients a cost-effective, ESG-compliant alternative to traditional materials. In-house micronization allows Eco Bio to produce fine powder compounds ideal for coatings, polymer blends, and talc-free formulations - meeting growing demand for recyclable, lightweight, and high-performance solutions across multiple sectors. Its patent-pending process produces the only pelletized bast fiber on the market, opening the door for additional sustainable fiber plastic compounds.

 Already working with partners such as Stellantis, Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS Corporation, and West Michigan Compounding, OWPC and Eco Bio are aggressively expanding capacity to meet growing demand in EV component housing, packaging inserts, and molded industrial parts.

 Investor Outlook: Growth Backed by Execution

 Eco Bio Plastics is expected to drive significant revenue growth for OWPC, particularly as regulatory support, supplier mandates, and EV-driven innovation accelerate adoption of recycled material solutions.

 With its new leadership structure, the company is now pursuing:

 * Government-backed grants through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), and Small Business Administration (SBA)
* New contracts in both automotive and industrial packaging sectors
* Vertical integration into proprietary material formulations and intellectual property licensing

 “Investors looking for real traction in the green economy can now look to our company,” said Thomas. “We have the team, the technology, and the timing. This is just the beginning.”
