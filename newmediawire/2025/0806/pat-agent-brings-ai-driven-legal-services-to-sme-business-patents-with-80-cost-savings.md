# Pat-Agent Brings AI-Driven Legal Services to SME Business Patents With 80% Cost Savings

NEW YORK, NY - August 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hestia Insight Inc. (OTCQB: HSTA) (“Hestia Insight” and the “Company”) today announced the launch of its proprietary “Pat-Agent”, an AI-enhanced patent service that assists small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) with filing patents with the USPTO for up to 80% cheaper and dramatically faster than traditional means. As an extension of the Company’s DealSight AI fundraising suite, Pat-Agent is poised to address the critical needs of over 234,000 SMEs filing patents annually.

 Company Uses Own Service, Proves Results

 Hestia Insight has so much confidence in Pat-Agent that the Company used its own AI-powered patent services to file its own omnibus patents from the start of its launch of Pat-Agent. This bold move proved up to 80% in cost savings while cutting timelines from 2 months to 10 days. An early adopter customer of the Company achieved identical results utilizing Pat-Agent, while broadening their claims to include much larger markets and building a strong Defensible IP Moat.

 Targeting Explosive $10.8B Legal AI Market

 According to MarketsandMarkets, the legal AI market will continue to explode at 28% per year to reach $10.8 billion by 2030. While Harvey AI serves Fortune 500 firms at $100M ARR, Pat-Agent focuses specifically on the underserved SME intellectual property market - 234,000 SMEs, which cannot afford $10,000+ for initial filings and $50,000 for final filing and response fees.

 Edward Boyle, Chief Strategy Officer of the Company and Pat-Agent's creator, stated, “I previously founded an AI startup at Stanford with Apple funding and was always amazed at how archaic, expensive and time-consuming the patent filing process was." Mr. Boyle continued, "While working with over 100 CEOs on AI strategy over the last 2 years, I realized that this IP protection hurdle was a universal issue. This SME IP market represents a massive opportunity that's been underserved by legal AI solutions."

 AI-Powered Patent Intelligence

 Pat-Agent's services transform patent prosecution by analyzing thousands of related patents in minutes, generating comprehensive graphical maps showing exactly where each proposed claim stands within the existing patent landscape. The platform provides objective scoring on all four USPTO patentability criteria and precise predictions of Patent Examiner acceptance probability.

 "I couldn't believe the depth of comparison to major competitors and how Pat-Agent helped us craft claims that opened up clear white space in a crowded IP field," said an Influencer Marketplace client.

 About half of patents are currently rejected, but Pat-Agent can analyze the Examiner's report and file amendments in days instead of months at a fraction of traditional costs.
