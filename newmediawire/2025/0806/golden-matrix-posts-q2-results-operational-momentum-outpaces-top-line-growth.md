# Golden Matrix Posts Q2 Results; Operational Momentum Outpaces Top-Line Growth

LAS VEGAS, NV - August 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) (“Golden Matrix” or the “Company”), a developer, licensor, and global operator of online gaming platforms, today announced financial and operational results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. The quarter saw an acceleration in operating metrics which continue to outperform. Product enhancements drove a 30% increase in wager volume at Meridianbet and new registrations climbed 124%.

 Brian Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix, commented, "Our second quarter was a challenging quarter. Due to customer-friendly sports outcomes within our European business, our second quarter revenue grew 10% year-over-year. Adjusting for this, we remain on track for our full-year revenue guidance and are confident in the strength of our business and the opportunities ahead.”

 Financial and Strategic Highlights

 * Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $43.2 million, representing a 9.6% growth over last year. Foreign exchange was a benefit of 4.5%.
* Gross profit reached $24.4 million in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting a gross margin of approximately 56%. This is a 135-basis point improvement over the prior year.
* The Company had a net loss of $3.6M or a 3-cent loss per share. This was a decline of $3.6 million, or 3-cents a share, from the same period last year. Our operating costs grew by $2.4 million more than the incremental gross profit generated. This coupled with $1.5 million in interest expense from our debt prepayment gave rise to the loss.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by $2 million, or 37%, to $3.4 million, as increased gross profit was offset by the increase in operating spend to expand our business geographically, improve our market share, and advance our gaming technology in support of full-year growth initiatives.
* The Company’s Raffle ticket businesses have shown resilience, strong engagement and exceptional performance. Mr. Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix, stated: “We have recently built and deployed new state-of-the-art systems to support our raffle ticket businesses. This new technology is already showing excellent results. Our largest raffle ticket business, RKings Competitions, delivered several standout milestones this quarter, beating the all-time daily revenue record by 12%. More recently, on 1st August, RKings beat that daily record by an additional 40%, with more than 30,000 orders in a single day.”

 Meridianbet’s Core Value Drivers Accelerate

 Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet, commented, "Meridianbet delivered solid operational performance in Q2, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $29.2 million. Online revenue, a key strategic focus, increased 20%, demonstrating strong momentum in our core growth channels."

 * Brazil: In Brazil, Meridianbet is now fully operational with a license through 2029. Brazil is projected to be a $5.6 billion market this year. The Company’s experience in emerging markets provides a thoughtful playbook to capture share efficiently.
* Casino: Meridianbet’s casino businesses continue to outperform. GGR surged 29% with turnover reaching $434 million - up 30% year-over-year. The Company also expanded its content library by 2,500 games, resulting in casino turnover per player increasing by 50% quarter-over-quarter. These results continue to validate Meridianbet’s content strategy and player engagement initiatives.
* User Metrics: Active users expanded 15% year-over-year, and new registrations climbed 124%, driven primarily by Meridianbet’s Brazil launch. First deposits increased 165% quarter-over-quarter and Sports revenue per player grew 28% despite challenging conditions.
* Expanse Studios: Meridianbet’s proprietary game development arm established 13 partnerships in the U.S. social casino segment, crossed the 1,000 B2B partner milestone, secured certifications in Brazil, Peru, Croatia, and Romania, and launched the exciting new title - Gates of Olympia.

 Financial Outlook

 Golden Matrix expects full-year 2025 revenue to range between $185 million and $188 million, reflecting a growth rate of 22% to 24% over 2024. This reflects the impact of the customer-friendly outcomes experienced in our European business late in the second quarter. We have seen July revenue growth from our European business recover as expected, up both sequentially and over 2024 by roughly 25% in constant currency. This is a return to our expected trends and consistent with our transactional volumes.

 Rich Christensen, CFO of Golden Matrix, added, "We remain focused on expanding our presence in regulated markets, enhancing our proprietary technology stack, and driving shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. We are well-positioned to build on our success, with a strong balance sheet and significant opportunities across both existing and new markets to accelerate."

 (1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Tax, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based Compensation Expense and Restructuring Costs", included in the tables at the end of this release.

 In terms of GAAP accounting and Meridianbet being the accounting acquirer, the comparisons presented are correctly stated and are reflective of our new structure. Comparisons presented in terms of GAAP are the consolidated Company’s results against Meridianbet Group historical results and not against Golden Matrix Group’s historical results.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA or AEBITDA, is a “non-GAAP nancial measures” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized in accordance with GAAP, is unaudited, and has limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reect the signicant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP nancial measures, please see the section titled “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based Compensation Expense and Restructuring Costs” included at the end of this release.
