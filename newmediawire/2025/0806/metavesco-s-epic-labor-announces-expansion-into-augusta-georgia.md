# Metavesco's Epic Labor Announces Expansion Into Augusta, Georgia

CUMMING, GA - August 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Epic Labor, is expanding operations into Augusta, Georgia. Opening of this new location will mark the fifth active branch and underscores its commitment to becoming a leading provider of on-demand labor across the Southeastern United States.

 “Epic Labor started with the acquisition of two staffing offices last fall,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “Since then, we’ve opened two additional branches organically, with Augusta being the next market we’re entering as part of our aggressive expansion plan.”

 Epic Labor provides fast, reliable staffing for construction, warehouses, events, and hospitality clients. With its 24/7 dispatch model and two-hour worker replacement guarantee, the company is uniquely positioned to solve urgent labor needs in high-demand sectors.

 The Augusta expansion aligns with the company’s previously announced roadmap to 98 offices, which targets a mix of acquisitions and de novo launches across key metro areas in the Southeast, including Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida.

 “Each new location brings us closer to our goal of becoming the dominant player in short-notice, high-performance labor,” Schadel continued. “Augusta represents a strong industrial and hospitality market that’s ideal for our model.”

 Further details regarding the office grand opening and staffing plans will be provided in a future update.
