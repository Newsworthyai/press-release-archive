 The legendary El Santo GLENDALE, CA - November 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - One of Mexico's most revered heroes, the legendary Luchador El Santo (Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta), is being permanently honored with a unique display at the Martial Arts History Museum. El Santo was more than a professional wrestler; he was a cultural phenomenon—an iconic figure, movie star, comic book hero, and a devoted philanthropist whose impact transcended wrestling to influence Mexico and the world.

 Today, preparations are underway to celebrate this legendary figure, ensuring that future generations can appreciate the profound mark he made.

 The Martial Arts History Museum is currently assembling a unique exhibit dedicated to the "Silver Masked Man." Thanks to the collaboration and generosity of El Santo's grandson, Santo Jr., an actual fighting mask signed by Santo Jr. will soon be featured in the museum's display.

 “This is a huge donation to the museum. We do our best to look at different cultures and how the martial arts played a unique role in their development,” says museum president Michael Matsuda. “Our thanks go to Art Camacho and the El Santo family for thinking of the museum and what this recognition means to the world.”

 The museum recognizes that fighting arts such as wrestling, boxing, and European fighting systems all play a significant role in martial arts history. The display will also nod to the monumental impact many Hispanic martial artists have made on the arts, including Robert Trias, the first non-Asian to open a martial arts school in America. Benny Urquidez, the greatest kickboxing champion in the world. Lilly Rodriguez, the mother of women’s kickboxing. Graciela Casillas, the first women’s kickboxing champion and boxing champion, and Olympic Gold Medal Winners Arlene Limas and Steven Lopez.
