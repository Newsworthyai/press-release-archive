# Roy Partners With Wrestling Star Kennedy Blades to Empower Female College Athletes and Expand NIL Opportunities

MINNEAPOLIS, MN - February 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Roy, the NIL app revolutionizing how fans support college athletes, is proud to announce a groundbreaking partnership with Kennedy Blades, a rising star in women's wrestling and Olympic Silver Medalist. This collaboration aims to drive more NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) opportunities for female athletes, with a special focus on wrestling.

 The University of Iowa recently made history by launching the first Power Five women’s wrestling program, and Blades is at the forefront of this movement. Through her partnership with Roy, she is not only advocating for her own NIL opportunities but is also committed to helping her teammates and other female wrestlers secure much-needed funding. NIL is transforming college athletics, but access to opportunities remains uneven. This initiative aims to create a more inclusive and balanced landscape by amplifying untold stories, fostering strategic partnerships and advocating for greater representation. Double Your Impact: Roy Will Match Your Payment to Iowa Women’s Athletes

 Double Your Impact: Roy Will Match Your Payment to Iowa Women’s Athletes.* As part of this initiative, Roy is matching contributions up to $100 per fan for Iowa women’s athletes during the months of February and March. Fans can download the Roy app, select their favorite player, and make a direct contribution- Roy will match it dollar for dollar. Every cent goes directly to the athlete, ensuring full transparency and impact.

 “Women’s wrestling is growing fast, but many athletes still struggle to secure NIL support,” said Blades. “I’m excited to partner with Roy because they make it easy for fans to directly support us. This is a game-changer, not just for me, but for my teammates and female athletes across the country.”

 Roy offers a transparent solution, ensuring that fan contributions go directly to athletes- without fees deducted from their earnings. Every dollar given supports the athlete chosen, providing a fair and direct way to empower female athletes.

 “Kennedy is an incredible athlete and an advocate for change,” said Cale Johnston, Founder and CEO of Roy. “This partnership is about more than just one athlete- it’s about creating a pathway for female athletes and those in non-revenue college sports to access NIL opportunities. At Roy, we’re committed to giving every athlete a fair shot, and we’re thrilled to have Kennedy lead this movement.”

 Unlike traditional fundraising models, Roy functions as a compliant and fan-driven marketplace- think of it as a purpose-built NIL platform designed specifically for college athletes, rather than a general-purpose payment app. Fans can support their favorite athletes while knowing their money goes where they intend. Additionally, if an athlete transfers, fans receive their money back, adding an extra layer of transparency and security.

 Blades and Roy are working together to raise awareness and drive NIL support for female athletes across the country. As Iowa’s women’s wrestling team continues to gain momentum, this partnership will play a key role in ensuring the athletes have the resources they need to thrive.
