 About the Babine South Gold-Silver-Copper-Zinc Project

 The Babine South Gold-Silver-Copper-Zinc Project is a 100%-owned exploration property of Durango Resources Inc., situated in the Babine Porphyry Belt, north of Smithers, British Columbia. Encompassing approximately 1,070 hectares across two mineral claims, the property hosts historical silver adits from the 1920s and 1930s, with records indicating the production of 94 kilograms of silver from trenching activities. The geological setting features Cache Creek Group greenstones, where mineralization occurs in quartz-carbonate veins and shears within foliated greenstone (amphibolite). Notable minerals identified include argentiferous galena, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, argentite, chalcopyrite, native silver, pyrrhotite, and pyrite. Recent sampling efforts have yielded significant assay results, with values up to 3.39 grams per tonne gold, 3430 grams per tonne (110.3 oz/t) silver, 8.86% zinc, and 1% copper, underscoring the property’s potential for hosting an epithermal polymetallic deposit. Additionally, the presence of ultramafic rocks such as peridotite, pyroxenite, and dunite suggests potential for nickel and platinum group element (PGE) mineralization, aligning with Durango’s focus on critical metals exploration.

 About Critical Metals

 Critical metals are essential components in modern technologies, including renewable energy systems, defense applications, and advanced electronics. Both the United States and Canada have identified specific lists of critical minerals vital to their economic and national security. The U.S. Geological Survey’s 2022 list includes 50 critical minerals, while Canada in 2024 has designated 34 minerals as critical.

 Recent geopolitical developments have heightened concerns over the supply chain security of these critical metals. China, which holds a dominant position in the production and processing of several critical minerals, has implemented export bans affecting the West. These actions underscore the strategic importance of diversifying supply chains and developing domestic sources for critical metals to mitigate geo-political risks and ensure the stability of essential industries.
