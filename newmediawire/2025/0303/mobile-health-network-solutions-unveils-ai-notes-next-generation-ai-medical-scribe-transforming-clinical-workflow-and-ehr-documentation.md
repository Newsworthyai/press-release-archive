# Mobile-health Network Solutions Unveils AI Notes: Next-Generation AI Medical Scribe Transforming Clinical Workflow and EHR Documentation

SINGAPORE - March 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mobile-health Network Solutions (Nasdaq: MNDR) (“MNDR” or “the Company”), a pioneering MedTech company dedicated to enhancing human connection through technology, has launched its proprietary AI Notes, a medical scribe that eliminates the burden of manual notetaking for doctors. AI Notes captures and contextualizes doctor-patient conversations, automatically generating structured clinical notes in real time. It seamlessly integrates with major Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, ensuring accurate and efficient documentation.

 Redefining Healthcare Documentation

 With Mobile-health Network Solutions’ AI Notes, doctors can focus entirely on their patients without being distracted by the need to document interactions. The AI-powered system operates on a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) that is fine-tuned for the healthcare field and periodically re-trained. AI Notes is integrated within both in-person practice management systems and telemedicine platforms, providing seamless documentation support across all healthcare environments.

 A Proprietary Solution in a Competitive Market

 The healthcare industry has seen increasing efforts to integrate AI-powered documentation solutions. However, existing tools are often limited to speech-to-text conversion or require significant manual corrections. Mobile-health Network Solutions’ AI Notes stands apart from competitors by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to extract key information from medical conversations and generate concise summaries that capture critical details. This technology streamlines the process of creating clinical documentation, saving doctors time while ensuring records are both accurate and comprehensive. Unlike competitors who rely on third-party AI models, AI Notes is a purpose-built system designed specifically for the nuances of doctor-patient interactions.

 AI Notes has been developed with the capability to understand English spoken with various accents, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for doctors worldwide. Recognizing the diverse linguistic landscape of global healthcare, Mobile-health Network Solutions is also preparing to introduce multilingual support, starting with Spanish, French, German, Russian, Korean, Malay, Vietnamese, and Mandarin, in the near future. This expansion will enable AI Notes to cater to a broader range of healthcare professionals, facilitating seamless documentation across different regions and languages. By removing language barriers, this innovation will further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical documentation worldwide.

 Reclaiming the Doctor-Patient Moment

 "At Mobile-health Network Solutions, we believe technology should enhance - not replace - human connection in healthcare," said Dr. Siaw Tung Yeng, PBM, Senior Consultant Family Physician, co-CEO of Mobile-health Network Solutions. "Our AI Notes allows doctors to focus on what matters most: their patients. By removing the documentation burden, we are redefining healthcare workflows to be more efficient and patient-centric."

 Enhanced Accuracy and Continuous Improvement

 The clinical notes generated by AI Notes undergo a rigorous review and approval process by doctors before being attached to a patient’s medical records. To further ensure accuracy and compliance, AI Notes incorporates Guardrails AI, which rigorously monitors and validates LLM outputs to maintain documentation integrity. Guardrails AI enforces rules and constraints, ensuring all outputs align with medical standards and ethical guidelines.

 AI Notes ensures that all critical aspects of consultation are meticulously captured and structured. It synthesizes comprehensive patient demographics and medical history, accurately transcribes interactions between doctors and patients while identifying key clinical insights, and documents prescribed medications, treatment plans, and relevant medical records with clarity and precision. These functions enhance the accuracy and completeness of medical documentation while streamlining healthcare providers' workflows. The model does not directly use patient identity data to generate results, safeguarding personal identifiers at all times.

 Expanding the Future of Healthcare Technology

 The launch of AI Notes is a testament to Mobile-Health Network Solutions’ commitment to innovation in digital healthcare. With its scalable and secure cloud-based infrastructure, the platform is poised for rapid adoption across healthcare systems, from independent practitioners to large hospital networks. As the company continues its global expansion, this proprietary technology strengthens its competitive edge in the evolving healthcare market, promising new market opportunities and revenue growth through increased efficiency.
