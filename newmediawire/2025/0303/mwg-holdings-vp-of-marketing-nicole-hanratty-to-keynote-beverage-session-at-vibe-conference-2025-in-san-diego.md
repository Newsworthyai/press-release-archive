# MWG Holdings VP of Marketing, Nicole Hanratty, to Keynote Beverage Session at Vibe Conference 2025 in San Diego

Hanratty to Discuss Consumer Data Driving Hemp-Derived THC Beverages for On-Premise Operators on March 5

 SACRAMENTO, CA - March 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings” or “MWG”), a leading purpose-driven, vertically-integrated cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, is pleased to announce that Nicole Hanratty, Vice President of Marketing at MWG Holdings, will be a keynote speaker at the upcoming Questex’s Vibe Conference event, taking place March 3-5 at the Town and Country Resort in San Diego, California. Hanratty will present, “How Consumer Data is Unlocking Cannabis Beverages for On-Premise,” on Wednesday, March 5, at 10 a.m. PST in the Pacific Ballroom.

 Vibe Conference is the premier event for chain and hotel adult beverage executives and suppliers. This top on-premise conference is held annually and delivers high-level content and networking opportunities. In “How Consumer Data is Unlocking Cannabis Beverages for On-Premise,” attendees can learn how consumer demand is shaping hemp-derived THC beverages in hospitality settings, how dispensary retail sales data can inform on-premise purchasing, and what the numbers reveal about shifting consumer preferences. The session will also explore how the average purchase frequency and price sensitivity metrics of hemp-derived THC beverages largely align with mid to premium cocktail trends.

 “Understanding that a majority of Millennials and Gen Z are shifting spend to include alternative effect-based social beverages like hemp-derived THC beverages is critical for the hospitality industry if they want to stay relevant with these generations,” said Nicole Hanratty, VP of Marketing at MWG Holdings. “This session will give operators actionable insights into how hemp-derived THC beverages can increase average ticket value with menu offerings that meet the mood.”

 Recent data from a Q4 2024 Brightfield Group study shows the growing crossover between alcohol and hemp-derived THC consumers. While 40% of the US population reports consuming alcohol, 52% of hemp-derived THC consumers also report drinking alcohol. These insights signal that hemp-derived THC beverages are complementary rather than competitive, and the evolving hemp-derived THC beverage market presents a unique opportunity for on-premise operators looking to meet consumer demand in both categories.

 With MWG having recently launched 5G Pop and 5G Tea in California, Hanratty has seen first hand the steady and sustained growth of the cannabis beverage segment within Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness licensed dispensaries across the states. According to 2024 BDSA data, cannabis beverage sales continued to grow in California dispensaries even while the broader edibles category experienced some compression last year across the state.

 Hanratty added, “Cannabis beverage sales in dispensaries see spikes in sales beyond OND, notably during summer months and other holidays such as Valentine’s Day, Easter and 4th of July.”

 Joining Hanratty in this discussion will be Angelica Sanchez, Sr. Director of Government Affairs & Compliance at MWG Holdings and Perfect Union. Sanchez played a key role in securing MWG’s adult-use retail, cultivation, nursery, and distribution licenses. She actively collaborates with legislators and local jurisdictions on cannabis-related legislation, codes, and ordinances while also leading internal audits and regulatory guidance for MWG’s store leadership.

 Hanratty is a seasoned marketing strategist with a proven track record of driving brand growth and innovation. She has led transformative initiatives in cannabis retail, including product line expansions and strategic retail shifts that quadrupled sales and set record-breaking revenue milestones.

 During the 2023 industry recession, Hanratty strategized new product lines and retail initiatives to help MWG quadruple brand sales while optimizing costs and profit margins. Her initiatives led to record-breaking revenue and customer counts, with January 2024 sales soaring 25% above the previous year and December 2024 being the company’s highest revenue generating month on record. In April 2024, Nicole launched smish., a captivating print magazine featuring renowned personalities like Jim Belushi and Bill Romanowski, showcasing her creativity and market insight.
