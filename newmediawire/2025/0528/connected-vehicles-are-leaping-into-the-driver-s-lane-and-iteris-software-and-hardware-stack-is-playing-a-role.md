# Connected Vehicles Are Leaping Into The Driver's Lane, And Iteris' Software And Hardware Stack Is Playing A Role

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The idea of vehicles communicating with each other and with roadside infrastructure is no longer in the conceptual stage. It’s beginning to be deployed on the ground as cities, municipalities and government agencies around the world look for ways to enhance safety and reduce traffic congestion.

 After all, connected vehicle (CV) technology enables vehicles to share information about driving conditions, traffic and accidents in real-time. That data can be vital to agencies in charge of the world’s roadways. As a result, the market is predicted to reach $446.6 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 19.5% over ten years. In 2023, the market was only valued at $75.2 billion, underscoring the growing demand for CV technology.

 Iteris Is At The Forefront Of The CV World

 Iteris Inc., a global player in connected vehicle (CV) and connected vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology is helping shape this movement, churning out AI-powered sensors, cameras and software designed to improve intersections and roadways around the world.

 Take Iteris’ V2X Connect software application as one example. V2X Connect, which tests and verifies that connected vehicle devices are transmitting and receiving secure and reliable messages in the field, was recently certified by OmniAir Consortium, the leading industry association promoting interoperability for Intelligent Transportation Systems, tolling and connected vehicles.

 Iteris said that it was certified by OmniAir Consortium because V2X Connect can effectively capture and analyze over-the-air (OTA) network traffic, offering real-time and offline analysis via its mobile application. This helps traffic management agencies and systems integrators efficiently deploy connected vehicle applications.

 The company’s advanced diagnostic tool is used by transportation personnel, system integrators, Iteris distributors and general contractors. The Florida Department of Transportation Traffic Engineering Research Laboratory and USDOT Federal Highway Administration are among the customers using V2X Connect in their connected vehicle initiatives.

 “Iteris’ work on the V2X Connect test system sets a new benchmark in the industry,” says Jason Conley, executive director of OmniAir. “This test system can benefit test laboratories, infrastructure owners/operators, and the wider industry.”

 A Hardware Agnostic, Interoperable Approach

 Then there is Iteris’ VantageARGUS CV - previously known as BlueARGUS - a suite of software designed for transportation professionals who want to harness the full potential of connected vehicle applications and travel-time data. The SaaS offering, which is hardware agnostic and interoperable, can enable a variety of connected vehicle applications, including travel time and speed data collection, management and performance measure analytics.

 While VantageARGUS CV serves as a congestion management solution, its capabilities stretch far beyond that to empower agencies to implement CV applications. The software’s Origin-Destination (O-D) feature provides agencies with in-depth traffic flow and driver behavior data, detailing entire trip sequences and events to enhance traffic control, optimize signals and improve congestion management across designated zones.

 With VantageARGUS CV’s interactive dashboard, the company says users can analyze metrics, monitor connected device uptime status, check travel time routes and speed patterns to optimize traffic flow and integrate statewide and city data - creating a holistic traffic management solution with all the necessary traffic data at agencies’ fingertips.

 “As roads become busier, the quest for smoother traffic flows and enhanced safety intensifies,” says Iteris. “VantageARGUS CV, previously known as BlueARGUS, not only answers this call but paves the way for the future of traffic management.”

 Hardware Completes The Package

 Hand-in-hand with VantageARGUS CV is Iteris’ BlueTOAD Spectra CV, which is a roadside unit that combines wireless technologies – Bluetooth® (2.4 GHz), Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) (5.9 GHz) – into a singular, roadside unit. The BlueTOAD Spectra CV RSU combines DSRC/C-V2X with real-time and historical Bluetooth detection, providing V2X interconnectivity for safety and mobility applications in connected vehicle initiatives and providing synchronization with transportation agency travel-time and performance measures-based systems, reports Iteris.

 Connected vehicles are in the driver’s seat, moving from the research stage to the deployment stage. Iteris says it is putting itself in pole position to be among the leaders with its full stack of hardware and software that can work together or on their own.
