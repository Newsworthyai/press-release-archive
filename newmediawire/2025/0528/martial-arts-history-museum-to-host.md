 (NewMediaWire) - May 27, 2025 - GLENDALE, CA – In a continuing tradition of celebrating Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Month with unique and impactful events, the Martial Arts History Museum is proud to announce a special screening of “The Real Miyagi.” This compelling documentary written by Kevin Derek, delves into the life of Fumio Demura, the legendary martial artist who served as the inspiration for Pat Morita’s iconic Mr. Miyagi character in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai series. The event will take place on Friday, May 31, 2025, at 4:00 PM at the museum, with complimentary entrance for the public.

 The evening will be hosted by Museum Hall of Famer, celebrity personality and talk show host, author, and one of the most prominent figures in the Hawaiian Lua art, Michelle Manu. Joining her will be special guest William Christopher Ford, an actor from both The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai series, offering unique insights into the beloved franchise.

 “Each year we attempt to do something different to pay our respect to the Asian American community,” says Michael Matsuda, President of the Martial Arts History Museum. “The previous year we handed out free stun devices in our combat against Asian-Hate. The following year we hosted self-defense workshops, and this year I think it is appropriate to take a glimpse of the positive contributions of the Asian American community through film.”
