# 15 students named national Youth Heart Ambassadors for 2025-26 school year

(NewMediaWire) - August 20, 2025 - DALLAS — With young Americans facing rising rates of mental and physical health challenges[1], the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is enlisting a new class of Youth Heart Ambassadors to spark change in schools and communities nationwide.

 The Association selected 15 first through 12th grade students from across the country as national Youth Heart Ambassadors for the 2025-26 school year. Representing the Association’s Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ initiatives, the student ambassadors will use their personal connection to heart disease and stroke to encourage others to adopt healthy habits and support children with heart conditions.

 “These terrific, motivated ambassadors are engaging with their peers making a real impact in their schools and communities,” said Lee Shapiro, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and managing partner at 7wireVentures. “Their experiences, leadership and compassion will help build a culture of health for future generations, one child, one story and one heartbeat at a time.”

 Each Youth Heart Ambassador has a personal connection to heart disease or stroke, whether as a survivor or a student advocate, and brings a unique voice to the cause. Together, they’ll promote the importance of physical and mental well-being, raise awareness of heart disease and stroke prevention and advocate for Hands-Only CPR and AEDs in schools.

 Meet the 2025-26 national Youth Heart Ambassadors:

 * Ava, third grade, West Virginia – Born with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect that involves four heart problems, Ava had open-heart surgery at just three days old. She stays active and positive and says her heart makes her feel special.
* Bodhi, second grade, California – After undergoing open-heart surgery at age 3 to correct congenital heart defects, Bodhi now keeps his heart healthy through karate, dance and good nutrition.
* Dylan, fourth grade, Oklahoma – Born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, meaning the left side of his heart didn’t fully develop, Dylan has since undergone three surgeries. Now he shares his story to support advancements and awareness for children with special hearts.
* Heather, 10th grade, California – After surviving a cardiac arrest at school thanks to Hands-Only CPR and an AED, Heather advocates for stronger cardiac emergency response plans in schools.
* Julianna, sixth grade, Florida – Julianna was born with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, an arrhythmia that causes the electrical pathways between the heart’s upper and lower chambers to malfunction. After a successful heart procedure in 2024, she now encourages others to care for their health.

* Julian, fifth grade, Texas – With a dream of becoming a doctor, Julian has been inspired by his family’s experiences with heart disease and now raises awareness as a youth leader.
* Karli, fourth grade, Louisiana – Karli honors her late father by encouraging others to live heart-healthy lives and sharing physical and mental health tips with her friends.
* Lucy, fifth grade, Washington – After her grandfather’s diagnosis with congestive heart failure, Lucy became an advocate for heart health to help families like hers.
