# Metavesco Selected to Participate in SEC Crypto Roundtable

CUMMING, GA - August 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced that it has been selected to participate in an upcoming roundtable discussion hosted by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. The event will take place at the SEC’s Fort Worth regional office on September 4, 2025.

 Commissioner Peirce extended invitations to small and early-stage crypto projects via a public post on X, encouraging participants to share their visions and challenges in navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape. Metavesco responded with its interest in advancing the tokenization of OTC-traded equities, a concept the Company believes could unlock significant global liquidity for small public companies that often face structural barriers on the OTC market.

 “I am honored to be included in this important dialogue with Commissioner Peirce and the SEC,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “Metavesco’s vision goes beyond our treasury strategy in Bitcoin and Ethereum, we want to champion solutions that expand access, transparency, and liquidity for all small-cap public companies. Tokenization of OTC issuer securities has the potential to transform investor participation, open the door to global capital markets, improve liquidity for all market participants, and greatly lower the cost of capital to small companies.”

 The roundtable will bring together innovators in the digital asset space to discuss real-world use cases and explore regulatory frictions that may hinder growth. For Metavesco, participation underscores its commitment to building in public, engaging directly with regulators, and positioning itself at the forefront of innovation.

 “Under the Trump administration, the SEC is now taking a proactive approach to engage with market participants in the crypto and blockchain sector. I believe the actions being taken by the SEC will ultimately be beneficial for the future of capital markets,” Schadel added. “I am incredibly honored to have this opportunity and look forward to sharing our ideas and learning from other participants as the SEC evaluates how to foster innovation while protecting investors.”

 Metavesco expects the official participant list to be published by the SEC ahead of the event.
