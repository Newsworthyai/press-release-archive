 (NewMediaWire) - June 01, 2025 - GLENDALE, CA – The wait is over! After months of anticipation, the Martial Arts History Museum is thrilled to announce its official Grand Opening at its new, expansive location in Glendale. This momentous occasion marks a new chapter for the internationally recognized institution, inviting the community to a vibrant celebration of Asian art, culture, and the enduring impact of martial arts on the world on June 7, 2025.

 The grand festivities are scheduled for this upcoming kicking off at 11:00 am with a dazzling display of traditional Chinese lion dancing. The energetic performance will begin in the Olive Garden courtyard and majestically lead the way across the street into the museum itself. Attendees will be treated to captivating kung fu demonstrations, inspiring speeches from esteemed city dignitaries and special speakers, and a celebratory ribbon-cutting ceremony.

 The Martial Arts History Museum's journey has been one of passionate dedication, spanning over 26 years. From its humble beginnings as a traveling exhibit, to its previous homes in Santa Clarita and Burbank (where it thrived for over 16 years), the museum has now found its magnificent new home at the prominent intersection of Brand Blvd. and Wilson in Glendale. This move to a significantly larger facility allows for an even more immersive and comprehensive visitor experience.

 Inside, visitors will discover a treasure trove of hundreds of authentic artifacts, priceless gis from the martial arts' greatest pioneers, iconic movie props, and a cutting-edge 122-seat theater for film screenings and book signings. The museum offers a unique educational journey, exploring how Asian history and tradition have intricately woven themselves into the fabric of American culture through the martial arts.

 As a non-profit charity, the museum extends its impact beyond historical preservation. It actively hosts a variety of humanitarian events, providing solace and engagement for patients suffering from dementia, and offering uplifting opportunities for individuals with physical and mental challenges. These initiatives reflect the core values of martial arts: discipline, respect, and community empowerment.

 Michael Matsuda, the visionary founder and president of the museum since 1999, expresses his profound excitement: "Our Grand Opening in Glendale is a testament to the power of perseverance and the universal appeal of martial arts. My goal has always been to not only highlight the incredible benefits of these arts but to meticulously preserve their history and showcase the profound influence they continue to wield globally. The museum is a unique gateway to understanding diverse cultures, traditions, art, and music – it truly offers so much more than just the punch and kick."

 Join us in celebrating the dawn of a new era for the Martial Arts History Museum, a place where history comes alive and the spirit of martial arts inspires all.
