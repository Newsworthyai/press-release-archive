# GeoVax Responds to Growing Mpox Threat With Expedited EU Pathway and Platform Aligned to U.S. Biodefense Objectives

With global cases rising and bipartisan momentum for pandemic preparedness, GeoVax’s GEO-MVA vaccine advances on an expedited development track toward commercialization and revenue generation

 ATLANTA, GA - July 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer, today emphasized the growing global public health importance of its GEO-MVA Mpox/smallpox vaccine in response to rising public health threats and a rapidly evolving regulatory environment.

 With favorable regulatory input from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), GEO-MVA is on an expedited path toward market access, accelerating GeoVax’s focus toward regulatory approval and commercialization.

 “GeoVax is entering a value inflection phase,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO. “The EMA’s expedited development path brings us closer to regulatory registration and commercial readiness, providing the opportunity to address urgent public health needs, expanding the critically needed supply option of MVA-vaccine, addressing both expanding outbreak needs and stockpile opportunities.”

 Modern Platform for Variant-Responsive Stockpiling

 GeoVax’s development-stage continuous avian cell line process is anticipated to provide increased production of MVA-based vaccines, the ability to quickly respond to epidemics and pandemics, local implementation of MVA-based vaccine manufacturing and overall reduced production costs.

 With confirmed Mpox cases across multiple U.S. states, throughout Europe and new clade Ib outbreaks in West and Central Africa, the urgency for additional MVA-vaccine supply options is increasingly, critically important.

 “There is a clear need for diversity in stockpile planning,” Dodd added. “GEO-MVA is well-positioned to serve as a complementary or alternative solution where current, single-source options fall short. Ending the current monopoly of MVA-vaccine will benefit public health worldwide, providing an expanded supply option of this critically needed vaccine.”

 EMA Scientific Advice and BARDA RRPV Proposal Expedite Readiness

 GeoVax recently received favorable Scientific Advice from the EMA, confirming an expedited regulatory development path for GEO-MVA. This milestone enhances the product’s standing with international regulatory bodies and opens pathways to revenue-generating opportunities across Europe and beyond.

 In parallel, GeoVax’s advanced MVA-based vaccine manufacturing proposal under BARDA’s Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) remains under active review. The program is designed to fund scalable vaccine platforms, eliminating the dependency for stockpiling of MVA-based vaccines relative to high-consequence threats such as smallpox.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
