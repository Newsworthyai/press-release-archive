# US Nuclear Corp Announces 2024 Financials Showing a 55% Surge in Overhoff Technology Gross Profit to Almost $1.2 Million, on Revenues Over $2 Million, 93% of Total Sales

LOS ANGELES, CA - July 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - US Nuclear Corp (OTC: UCLE), is pleased to announce that the recent migration of manufacturing and production of the Optron LA Facility to its Overhoff Technology Milford, OH, facility is already bearing fruit, with Overhoff revenues increasing and profitability soaring. “Revenues and overall profitability with manufacturing largely under one facility are increasing every month, resulting in dramatically lower overhead, and renewed focus on sales growth and profitability,” said Nikki Truax, Director of Operations for the combined entities. “We believe we have the potential to grow revenues over 50% over the next twelve months, with profitability as early as the 3rd or 4th quarter this year.”

 “We are also in advanced talks with a very profitable company in the irradiation space about a potential merger or acquisition by US Nuclear,” said Mr. Goldstein, President of US Nuclear. “We knew that we had to streamline our operations and maximize our cash flow to be able to fully exploit potential opportunities such as this.”

 “We are also implementing an upgrade to our entire financial reporting efforts by adding key staff and implementing software integrations,” said Mr. Goldstein. “After we file our Q later this month, and our stock has resumed trading, we hope to have our changes fully implemented before the 2nd quarter financials are due and hope to uplist our common stock listing.”

 “We have commenced discussions with our equity partners in Company owned investments in the nuclear fission and fusion space,” said Bob Goldstein. “We own 500k non-dilutable shares in an early-stage thermonuclear fusion-powered reactor company, MIFTI, which has tremendous upside potential.”

 “We also own 10% of an early-stage radionuclide technology, MIFTEC, along with the rights to manufacture and sell the products in North America and Asia. The Company has a 35.2% interest in Grapheton, Inc., a Company making and designing advanced energy storage devices, called supercapacitors. We believe these investments could become very successful and valuable over the next 18 months,” said Mr. Goldstein.

 “US Nuclear and Overhoff Technology monitors are “Best-In-Class” for measuring the levels of radiation and tritium in the fission and fusion nuclear reactor space, for measuring explosives and radiation in the security space, and the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the oil and gas space. We are also developing relationships with companies that test the levels of PFAS forever chemicals in the industrial space,” said Mr. Goldstein. “This consolidation of our product lines and sales efforts will dramatically make our sales and marketing efforts far more effective.”
