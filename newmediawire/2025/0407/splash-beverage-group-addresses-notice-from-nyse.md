FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - April 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) ("Splash" or "the Company"), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands wishes to address the regulatory required notice from NYSE regarding its listing.

 Today, the Company was notified by NYSE American that the Company was unable to demonstrate that it had regained full compliance by the end of the compliance plan period, which expired on April 6, 2025. Unless the Company enters into the Appeal Process with the Exchanges Listing Qualifications Panel it will be compelled to cancel its listing.

 The Company was also informed that should it appeal (subject to any trading halts), it will continue to trade both common stock and warrants on the NYSE American during the appeals process.

 In accordance with NYSE procedures, the Company must notify the Listing Qualification Panel within 7 days from receipt of the Notice. The Company does plan to appeal the determination and believes it will be able to cure the remaining deficiency in its shareholder equity within the 60-to-90-day appeal process.
