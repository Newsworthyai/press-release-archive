An article discussing this reads, “A major contributor to Beeline’s growing pipeline is BeelineEquity, the company’s fractional home-equity sale platform built on blockchain infrastructure. The product enables homeowners to sell a portion of their property’s equity to access liquidity without taking on new debt or monthly payments…The first review of the Beeline Equity product read: ‘Thank you Beeline for leveraging the BlockChain to create liquidity for myself. I sold 17% of my home to generate approximately $200,000 in cash. With the Beeline Equity product, I don’t have any monthly payments and this is a pure sale of equity. I have up to 3 years to buy it back at very fair terms and if not the money is not paid back until my home is sold. Very creative Beeline. This product is going to explode…’ The testimonial reflects a growing appetite among homeowners for alternatives to traditional refinancing or home equity loans.”
