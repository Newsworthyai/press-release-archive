 GeoVax is committed to advancing global health through its diverse product pipeline, which includes:

 * GEO-CM04S1, a Next-Generation COVID-19 Vaccine for Immunocompromised Individuals: Designed to provide robust protection for those with weakened immune systems, who are often underserved in vaccine distribution efforts.
* GEO-MVA: An Mpox/Smallpox vaccine aimed at addressing current global health crises, including in regions like the African continent where Mpox outbreaks have been significant.
* Gedeptin®: An innovative immunotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors and currently undergoing clinical development for head and neck cancers, diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations worldwide.

 "We are honored to have Dr. Montgomery Rice serving in the critical role as Special Advisor to me and our Board of Directors," said David Dodd, GeoVax Chairman and CEO. "Her strategic healthcare insight and dedication to health equity aligns with GeoVax's mission to develop vaccines and therapies that serve the most vulnerable populations. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to her on this well-deserved recognition."

 Dr. Montgomery Rice will be formally recognized at the Atlanta Business Chronicle's second annual Health Care Champion Awards ceremony on March 20, 2025.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
