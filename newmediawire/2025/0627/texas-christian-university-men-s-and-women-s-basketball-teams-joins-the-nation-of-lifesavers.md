# Texas Christian University men s and women s basketball teams joins the Nation of Lifesavers

(NewMediaWire) - June 27, 2025 - FORT WORTH TX — On Thursday, June 26 on the Texas Christian University (TCU) campus, members of the TCU men’s and women’s basketball teams participated in an American Heart Association Hands-Only CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training to learn the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency. According to American Heart Association data, nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Every year, hundreds of thousands of cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals — often with no warning and no time to spare. In those critical moments, knowing how to perform CPR and use an AED can mean the difference between life and death,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “That’s why we’re working tirelessly with organizations like TCU and their men’s and women’s basketball teams to empower more people with the skills, confidence, and courage to step in and save a life using CPR.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR with rescue breathes in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 The Smart Heart Sports Coalition, collaboration of the major sports organizations (NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL and NCAA), the American Heart Association and others founded in 2023 to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.
