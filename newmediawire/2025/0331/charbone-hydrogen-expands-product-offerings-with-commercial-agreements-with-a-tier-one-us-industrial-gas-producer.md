# CHARBONE Hydrogen Expands Product Offerings with Commercial Agreements with a Tier One US Industrial Gas Producer

BROSSARD, QUEBEC - March 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CHARBONE HYDROGEN CORPORATION (TSXV: CH; OTCQB: CHHYF; FSE: K47) (the “Company” or “CHARBONE”), North America’s sole publicly traded pure-play company specialized in green hydrogen production and distribution, is pleased to announce the execution of Commercial Supply Agreements (the “CSA’s”) with a US Tier 1 industrial gases producer and distributor. The first CSA is enabling CHARBONE to have access to certain volumes of hydrogen in advance of its own forth coming hydrogen production. The second CSA is further allowing CHARBONE to expand its product offerings to provide its own customers with a variety of other gases, such as helium and other complementary industrial gas products to hydrogen.

 CHARBONE has been closely monitoring the evolution of the North American geopolitical and economic situation and is now ready to seize multiple new North American opportunities with complementary products, particularly in Canada. CHARBONE has gained an early-mover advantage through its market knowledge and is demonstrating its agility, resilience, and adaptability to develop partnerships and commercial synergies in the low carbon intensity and high purity hydrogen that CHARBONE will be also producing.

 CHARBONE’s mission and vision remain focused on deploying its 16 production plants across Canada and the U.S., including the construction of the Sorel-Tracy flagship project, which is set to begin green hydrogen production in the first half of 2025. The execution of a supply agreements with one of the largest Tier 1 industrial gas producers in the U.S. for the bulk supply of hydrogen and other industrial gases will allow CHARBONE to diversify its revenue streams and increase the usages of its logistics and transportation capabilities to better address the growing demand from its existing customers, serve a larger customer base, and support its new partner in addressing the Canadian market. The world industrial gas market is projected to grow by USD 31.1 billion during 2024-2029, accelerating at a CAGR of 5.7% throughout the forecast period.

 CHARBONE enhances its offerings to serve a larger industrial customer base, including, industrial gas distributors, semiconductor, data centre, natural gas, petrochemical, and refinery/oil industries, reinforcing its operational robustness and reliability as the preferred supplier to tackle the current market's scarcity of dependable options.

 “The CHARBONE management team exhibits remarkable adaptability and agility in responding to rapid market changes. This enhancement to our offerings will solidify and bolster our position as a market leader in hydrogen while leveraging an existing and underserved market, especially in Canada,” stated Dave Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE. “Our new partnership and commercial agreements with a US Tier 1 market leader, provides Charbone fresh diversification opportunities. This collaboration reinforces our leadership in the hydrogen market while generating new revenue streams. Our innovative business model boosts investor confidence by minimizing risk and maximizing growth potential.”
