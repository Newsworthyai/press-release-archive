 Environmental services business line previously provided revenue guidance exceeding $3 million for 2025 with corporate profitability

 Company is expecting to continue stock repurchase program and has announced commencements of dividend payments starting in second quarter 2025 while continuing to use cash flow to invest in growth opportunities

 FISHERS, INDIANA - March 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce its operating and financial results for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “2024 was a foundational year for the business, where we swung to a positive cashflow from operations and set the business up for an exciting 2025 and beyond, with guidance from our environmental services business alone expected to exceed $3 million in revenue in 2025, which is over 400% growth year-over-year. The Company also significantly reduced its overall liabilities during the 2024 year, positioning it to have unfettered growth and the ability to increase returns of cash back to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, while not impairing our ability to continue investing in royalty-bearing projects."

 Tom continued: “As we look forward to 2025 and beyond, we will aggressively seek for new ways to both expand our current portfolio of investments and invest in new opportunities, with a preference to investments in the resource extraction sector and intellectual property surrounding resources.  With our expanding portfolio in mines and technologies touching the rare earth element and critical minerals space, we feel that we are in a very strong position to reap the benefits of renewed interest within the United States to bring this sector and supply chain back to the domestic market.”

 2024 Key Highlights Include:

 * Company stock repurchase program is still in place for accretive opportunities, with 193,052 shares of common stock of Royalty Management purchased or under contract to be purchased by the Company to-date, reducing total shares outstanding by nearly 1.3%.
* The Chief Executive Officer of the Company initiated a stock purchase program under Rule 10B5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
* Reduction of Total Liabilities of over 36% from year-end 2023 to approximately $1.4 million, with Total Assets of just over $15 million, giving the Company an increase of Stockholders’ Equity to $13.6 million, a nearly 23% increase from year-end 2023.
* In the first quarter of 2025, the single largest Company payable of $381,243 was converted to the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, which is convertible into common stock at $1.70 per share, continuing the campaign to reduce liabilities and increase shareholder equity.
* In 2024 the Company had over $220,000 in either one-time, non-recurring costs, or costs that are part of an overall reduction in go-forward expenses and which are not expected to be incurred in 2025.
* Company incurred a narrow net loss of $0.01 per share (adjusted net income of $0.01, when adjusted for one-time or non-recurring expenses), or a loss of approximately $114,000 (positive net income of $108,239 when adjusted for one-time or non-recurring expenses), a significant decrease from a loss of $1.1 million in 2023 (or $0.08 per share).  Contributing to the net loss is a one-time fee for the re-auditing of the Company’s 2022 and 2023 financials due to the dismissal of BF Borgers as the Company’s prior auditor.
* Continued profitability of certain key investments of the Company, including RMC Environmental Services LLC, which provides enough cashflow to the Company to cover all of its expenses, with significant expansion forecasted in 2025.
* Investment into development of intellectual property and patents for separation and purification of platinum group metals, gold, and silver, which follows the Company’s announced creation of a mineral commodity investment and trading division and provides synergistic and value-added technologies to the Company as it evaluates and structures investments into other royalty-bearing opportunities and projects.
* A number of the Company’s strategic investments are in discussions for a liquidity event or an increase in recurring cash flow in 2025, which, if achieved, will result in expanded investment in growth initiatives beyond our current forecasted slate of investments.
* Declaration of a quarterly cash dividend starting on June 30, 2025 in the amount of $0.01 per year (or $0.025 per calendar quarter).  Dividend was declared as a result of an anticipated significant and meaningful increase in revenues in 2025 with additional business secured at RMC Environmental Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and other Company investments and portfolio holdings scheduled to begin generating or expanding revenue in 2025.
