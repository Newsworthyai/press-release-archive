# Giant Mining Corp. Diamond Core Drilling Update From Majuba Hill, Nevada

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce drilling of Hole MHB-32 (“MHB-32”) continues now surpassing a depth of 800 feet (243.8 meters). MHB-32 is the first hole of the 2025 four-hole diamond core drilling program (the “Core Program”) currently underway for the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada.

 The primary objective of core hole MHB-32 is to expand known zones of copper mineralization and toward a new Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 Big Sky Exploration, LLC (“Big Sky”) of Eureka, Nevada, drilled MHB-32, and the hole is being quick-logged and tagged for sampling on-site by Giant Mining geologists (Figure 2).

 The core samples from MHB-32 will be securely transported to Giant Mining’s secured warehouse facility in Elko, Nevada. At this location, the cores will undergo systematic sawing and detailed logging to document lithological characteristics, mineralization, and structural features. Following this, the processed samples will be sent to ALS Group USA, Corp. ("ALS Labs") in Elko, Nevada. At ALS Labs, the samples will undergo rigorous analyses, including assays for copper, silver, gold, and other pertinent elements, to accurately assess the mineral content and support ongoing exploration efforts at Majuba Hill.​

 David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, commented: "We are pleased with the steady progress of our drilling operations at Majuba Hill, a crucial step towards advancing the project toward a new NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate. The scale and potential of this system continue to impress, and this phase of drilling is critical in unlocking further value for our shareholders. It’s also worth noting that copper has recently surpassed USD $5.25 per pound, Gold has surpassed $3,100 per ounce and Silver has surpassed $35 per ounce, the value proposition of our project grows significantly. This increase enhances the in-situ value of our mineralized rock year over year and reinforces the importance of advancing exploration at Majuba Hill, Nevada USA.”

 As previously reported in the March 17, 2025 news release, the 2025 Core Program has been designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings (Figure 3).

 E.L. “Buster” Hunsaker, Senior Consulting Geologist, added: "The upper portion of MHB-32 is encouraging. This hole is targeting the magmatic-hydrothermal breccia bodies intersected in 2024 core hole's MHB-30 and MHB-31which targeted a prominent breccia zone within the western >0.50% copper zone. We anticipate that MHB-32 will further delineate the mineralized zone and potentially confirm deeper extensions of the copper system at Majuba Hill."

 The Company will provide regular updates as the drill program progresses, including assay results, geological observations, and any significant developments encountered during drilling. These updates will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed on the advancement of the Majuba Hill project and its potential to support a future resource estimate.

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth or plastic sample bags and are transported from the Majuba Hill Project to the Giant Mining secure warehouse for core sawing and processing and then samples are delivered to the ALS Labs sample prep facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS then transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 10% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining sample pulps are retrieved from ALS Minerals and retained by the Company for future metallurgical testing.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada, USA — a globally top-ranked mining jurisdiction, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute’s 2022 Annual Survey of Mining Companies.

 Project Size:

9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects

 History:

Historical Producer

 Drilling:

83,930 feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:

Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign

 About Giant Mining Corp.

 Giant Mining is focused on identifying, acquiring, and advancing late-stage copper and copper/silver/gold projects to meet the growing global demand for critical metals. This demand is driven by initiatives like the Green New Deal in the United States and similar climate-focused programs worldwide, which require substantial amounts of copper, silver, and gold for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and the modernization of clean and affordable energy systems.

 The Company’s flagship asset is the Majuba Hill Copper, Silver, and Gold District, located 156 miles (251 km) from Reno, Nevada. Majuba Hill is situated in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations and has the potential to become one of the next major copper deposits, critical for meeting the increasing need for this red metal.
