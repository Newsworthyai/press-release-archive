# NeuralBase Announces Beta Preview of BMP AI Workflow Prototype for Fintech Sector

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neuralbase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and a growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced the availability of a beta preview of its first intelligent workflow assistant, built on the BMP AI platform and designed specifically for financial technology applications.

 This version already demonstrates early-stage capabilities in conversational automation, document-based reasoning, and AI-enhanced workflow support. The beta version is part of Neuralbase AI’s phased development and feedback strategy focused on building high-trust, document-grounded AI systems for compliance-sensitive industries.

 “This beta preview reflects our commitment to building enterprise AI that is secure, explainable, and fully grounded in verifiable documentation,” said Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of Neuralbase AI Ltd. “While still under active development, this prototype provides an important starting point to gather feedback and validate key use cases within fintech operations.”

 The current beta allows users to interact with a document-aware chatbot built using BMP AI’s proprietary retrieval-augmented architecture, which enables grounded, traceable responses from internal source material. The Company plans to continue refining its interface, security controls, and enterprise integration features ahead of a broader rollout targeted for later this year.

 This preview is being offered to select early partners, industry participants, and prospective clients for feedback purposes only. Interested parties are encouraged to contact the Company for access, feedback, or collaboration discussions.
