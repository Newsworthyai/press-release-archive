 (NewMediaWire) - July 09, 2025 - Glendale, CA - The comic book, from tiny publisher Studio 6, just published it's first issue in May 2025, and is drawing praise for being one of the best new martial arts comics in quite some time and will be featured at the Martial Arts History Museum July 23 and 24.

 "Snow Monkey" features teenager Jennifer Caitlin, who dons the ancient helmet of Wukong and gains the experiences and abilities of anyone who's ever worn it. As Snow Monkey, she fights against her father, the crime lord known as the Sensei, who is training his students to be an army of deadly warriors.

 Writer Jason Shaw's kinetic scripts and artist Heubert Khan Michael's sleek and explosive artwork have drawn notice in the martial arts and comic book communities alike, with a Snow Monkey Honor Day now announced for July 24, 2025, at the Martial Arts History Museum in Glendale, CA!

 "We are very excited to honor "Snow Monkey," which is bringing a unique, respectful depiction of the martial arts to comic book culture and the masses," says Michael Matsuda, the Founder and President of the Martial Arts History Museum.

 "We are very excited to be honored by the Martial Arts History Museum and that Jennifer Caitlin's adventures have had such an impact so quickly," says "Snow Monkey" writer and co-creator Jason Shaw. "It has been an 8-year journey to make this book a reality - but this honor by the Museum is further proof it was worth the wait. I couldn't be happier and can't wait to interact with the Martial Arts and comic book communities and make more people aware of 'Snow Monkey'!"

 There will be a signing by Shaw at 4-6 PM on Wednesday, July 23, and Snow Monkey Day, which will consist of a Q&A, another signing, and a presentation by Shaw - will follow from 2-6 PM on Thursday, July 24.

 The Martial Arts History Museum is located at 201 N. Brand Blvd, Suite B100 in Glendale, CA.

 Any questions regarding the signing of Snow Monkey Day should be directed to the Martial Arts History Museum or Jerome Maida directly at 570-540-3899.
