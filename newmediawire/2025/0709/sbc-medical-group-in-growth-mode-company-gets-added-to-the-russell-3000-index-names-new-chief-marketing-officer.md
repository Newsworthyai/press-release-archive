# SBC Medical Group In Growth Mode: Company Gets Added To The Russell 3000 Index, Names New Chief Marketing Officer

By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SBC Medical Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SBC), a global franchise and provider of services for aesthetic clinics, is making inroads on the investor front, recently being added to the broad-market Russell 3000® Index. As of the close of trading on June 30, SBC Medical Group was part of the 2025 Russell indexes reconstitution.

 Membership in the Russell 3000 Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in either the large-cap Russell 1000® Index or small-cap Russell 2000® Index as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes.

 The Russell indexes from global index provider FTSE Russell are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies, with about $18.1 trillion in assets benchmarked against the indexes globally. As of June 2024, in the U.S. alone, about $10.6 trillion in assets are benchmarked against the Russell U.S. indexes, reports SBC Medical Group.

 More Visibility In An Index

 Getting included in the index increases visibility and opens SBC Medical Group up to a broader base of investors. That is particularly true among institutional and individual investors who tend to invest in index funds and ETFs that track the Russell indexes. On the first day of trading after being included in the Russell 2000, shares of SBC closed in the green, which is usual for companies just after inclusion in an index. Furthermore, inclusion in an index can also help reduce volatility as more institutional investors buy and hold the stock, and serves as a validation that the company is gaining significance and is relevant to the economy.

 “The Russell indexes have continuously adapted to the evolving dynamic US economy, and it’s crucial to fully recalibrate the suite of Russell US Indexes, ensuring the indexes maintain an accurate representation of the market,” said Fiona Bassett, CEO of FTSE Russell, of the recalibration.

 Being added to the Russell 3000 is also a nod to the growing popularity of the cosmetic surgery market in Japan and globally. The company ended the first quarter with 251 clinics and reported that 71% of customers visited franchisee clinics two or more times during the quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, SBC Medical reported earnings per share of $0.21, which was up 5% year-over-year, and EBITDA margins of 52%, up from 46% in the year-ago first quarter.

 Boosting The Brand With New CMO

 Separately, SBC Medical Group announced it has named Shinya Inoue as the company’s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Inoue will be in charge of enhancing the company’s brands, including Shonan Beauty Clinic, which SBC reports is one of Japan’s largest aesthetic medical brands. Inoue will also spearhead the evolution and optimization of the company’s marketing infrastructure with a strong focus on digital innovation.

 “We are delighted to welcome Mr. Shinya Inoue as our new CMO,” said Yoshiyuki Aikawa, CEO of SBC Medical Group. “He brings exceptional expertise and a proven track record in brand strategy, organizational development and integrated digital marketing. His leadership will be instrumental as we continue to expand globally and elevate the value of our brand.”

 Inoue was most recently CMO at Pioneer Corporation, where he led the launch of the marketing organization and restructuring of the planning and communication areas, and drove the market introduction of new products. Prior to his work at Pioneer, the executive held marketing roles at P&G Japan, Eli Lilly Japan, Adobe and KDDI. In a statement, SBC Medical Group said Inoue is well recognized for his strengths in designing marketing processes and building organizations from a company-wide perspective, as well as his ability to consistently lead initiatives from research and strategy development to the establishment and operation of execution frameworks and various supporting environments.

 “By supporting customers in their desire to live confidently and authentically, SBC has transformed medical aesthetics from a luxury into a more approachable part of everyday life,” said Inoue. “As a member of this visionary team, I am committed to leveraging my experience to help shape a healthier, more transparent market and contribute to the continued success of SBC Medical.”

 From being added to the Russell indexes to naming a new CMO, SBC Medical Group is positioning itself for more growth as the cosmetic surgery market continues to grow in Japan and internationally. With more exposure on the horizon, this is a company to watch.
