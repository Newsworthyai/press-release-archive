 Board Approval to Raise Capital

 To support the company's strategic transformation, Hestia Insight's Board of Directors has approved a capital raise of up to $5 million. This will be executed through a combination of equity offerings and/or convertible debt instruments.

 Proceeds will be allocated toward:
