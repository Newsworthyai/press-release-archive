# Insurance Canopy Expands Coverage for Cleaning and Landscaping Businesses

New policy option offers small business owners a fast, affordable way to protect employees and meet legal requirements

 PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH - July 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Insurance Canopy is proud to announce the launch of workers’ compensation insurance, now available online to small businesses purchasing cleaning insurance or landscaping insurance. This new coverage can be bundled with a general liability policy to help small businesses meet state requirements, cover their crews, and operate with greater confidence.

 In most states, workers’ compensation insurance is a legal requirement for any business with more than one employee. It helps pay for medical costs and lost wages due to job-related injuries or illnesses while protecting business owners from costly liability claims. With this update, cleaning and landscaping businesses can now easily secure this critical coverage online in minutes, without the hassle of a traditional insurance process.

 President and CEO Daryle Stafford said, “Small businesses go above and beyond to serve and care for their clients and communities. It’s only right that they have coverage that looks out for them, too. By simplifying the process to secure a reliable workers’ compensation policy, we’re helping business owners create safer workplaces where their teams can thrive.”

 Business owners can customize their policy by adding workers’ compensation alongside general liability and other optional coverages, such as:

 * Tools and equipment coverage
* Cyber liability insurance
* Surety bonds
* Trailer and equipment protection (for landscapers)
* Additional insureds to meet client or contract needs

 Insurance Canopy’s industry-specific programs help over 135,000 professionals across 250+ business types find affordable, flexible coverage designed for how they actually work. Business owners benefit from:

 * A 100% online application process with instant Certificates of Insurance (COIs)
* Affordable pricing tailored to small business budgets
* U.S.-based licensed agents offering support without commissions

 “Our mission is to make meaningful insurance more accessible for small business owners,” said Jason Brown, Director of Product Development. “They shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to protect their team, and now, they don’t have to.”
