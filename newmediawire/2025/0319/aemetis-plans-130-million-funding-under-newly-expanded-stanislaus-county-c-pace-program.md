In addition, payments through County property tax bills provide lenders enhanced protections and liquidity, helping raise funds for qualifying projects.Aemetis renewable energy and energy efficiency projects expected to be eligible for C-PACE financing include the Keyes plant mechanical vapor recompression system, the expansion of dairy renewable natural gas production, and the planned Riverbank Sustainable Aviation Fuel plant, as well as refinancing of the recently completed Keyes solar generation system and renewable natural gas upgrading hub.
