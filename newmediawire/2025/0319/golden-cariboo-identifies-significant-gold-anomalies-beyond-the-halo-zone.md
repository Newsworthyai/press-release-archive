# Golden Cariboo Identifies Significant Gold Anomalies Beyond the Halo Zone

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE:GCC) (OTC:GCCFF) (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ) announces that two significantly sized gold in MMI soil anomalies have been identified north of the currently known extent of the Halo zone, beyond the previous drill campaign at the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property (the ‘Property’), located about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of Hixon, central British Columbia, Canada.

 David Mark, P.Geo., has provided an additional memo to the Company, following up on the details  reported in News Release dated January 21, 2025. Detailed analysis of the MMI soil data, which covers an area of about 1.7 km x 0.5 km (1.1 miles x 0.3 miles) and located generally between Hixon Creek and Buckley Creek, “has revealed gold anomalies that have been shown to correlate with known gold mineralization of the trenching and diamond drilling program. This therefore shows that MMI is invaluable in outlining gold targets within the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property. As such, it has revealed numerous gold anomalies throughout the MMI survey area that are new targets for future exploration. Two of the strongest targets are as follows:

 1. A gold anomaly within the northern part of the survey area at its eastern edge. This anomaly is the strongest on the property and has dimensions of 240 meters (787 feet) northerly by at least 135 meters (443 feet) easterly with it being open to the east. This southernmost edge of this gold anomaly is located 260 meters (853 feet) north of the collar of drill hole QGQ24-20.

 2. A gold-copper-silver anomalous zone with additional anomalous values in arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, molybdenum, lead, antimony, and zinc.  It is located at the northern end of the survey area and its dimensions cover an area of at least 200 meters (656 feet) northerly by 500 meters (1640 feet) easterly with it being open to the north, west, and east. This southernmost edge of this anomaly is located 600 meters (1969 feet) north of the collar of drill hole QGQ24-20.”

 These two significant anomalies are of strong exploration interest and, as recommended by David Mark, P.Geo., the Company will expand trenching and drilling activities to target these two northerly zones of the Property within the 2025 exploration season.

 The technical information in this news release has been reviewed by David Mark, P.Geo., a qualified person with respect to NI 43-101.

The Project includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 in conjunction with placer mining activities.
