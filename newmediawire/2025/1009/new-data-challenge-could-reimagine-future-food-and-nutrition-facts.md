# New Data Challenge Could Reimagine Future Food and Nutrition Facts

DALLAS - October 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As global food systems grow more complex, consumers are looking for clear, trustworthy nutritional guidance to help them with their choices around what they’re eating and how it affects them.[1] In its second annual Periodic Table of Food Initiative® (PTFI) data visualization challenge, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is innovating to further improve and simplify food and nutrition information.

 Themed “Future Food + Nutrition Facts,” this year’s data challenge is open until January 30, 2026. Interdisciplinary teams – including public health, nutrition science, bioinformatics, data visualization/design, food systems and policy – are invited to reimagine nutrition information using molecular data from The PTFI, one of the most advanced open-access food composition databases in the world.

 The data challenge aims to translate complex biomolecular and environmental information into actionable insights for a wide range of audiences, from consumers to policymakers, and industry leaders to researchers. The PTFI is an initiative of RF Catalytic Capital Inc. that is managed by the American Heart Association and the Alliance of Biodiversity and the Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), a global agricultural research center based in Rome, Italy. Funding for this data challenge is supported by a financial grant from The Rockefeller Foundation.

 “This is a translational competition meant to rethink what we know about food, how we share that data in compelling ways and how it informs action,” said Selena Ahmed, Ph.D., global director of The Periodic Table of Food Initiative and dean of Food EDU at the American Heart Association. “We encourage collaboration between scientists and designers, farmers and nutritionists, along with other food system stakeholders, to translate molecular food data into more precise and actionable daily decisions that nourish both human and planetary health.”

 The PTFI is building a comprehensive database that includes molecular profiles of thousands of foods worldwide. These profiles include full ingredient and nutritional details, along with information on how and where specific food products were grown. The resulting data reveals the biomolecular complexity of food beyond calories and macronutrients and highlights connections between food, health, biodiversity and sustainability.

 Participants will have access to comprehensive profiles and data informing the origin, structure and relevance of a wide array of whole and processed foods from The PTFI’s scientific database. They will be challenged to create compelling visualizations that move beyond traditional nutrition facts. Winning designs will show how food and nutrition information can better reflect nutritional quality, molecular diversity, sustainability impact or cultural relevance.

 “For the first time in history, we are able to detect the full richness and complexity of all the chemistry contained in the world’s food biodiversity. But how do we communicate that? How do we make it mean something, have impact and ultimately improve human and planetary health?” said John de la Parra, Ph.D., director of Food Initiatives at The Rockefeller Foundation. “That is what this challenge seeks to address. This competition is a step toward transforming complex food data into visuals and tools that drive better decisions, from policy to plate.”

 The competition is open to global participants, as permissible by law, and includes two tracks: a general design category and a specialized research category for scientists and researchers submitting technical summaries. The challenge will award $40,000 in cash prizes, including $20,000 for the top entry, with winning visualizations showcased at an upcoming PTFI Science Symposium in 2026 and across digital platforms.

 Top entries will be evaluated on creativity, scientific accuracy, accessibility and real-world relevance. There is no cost to enter. Register for the webinar detailing the challenge here. Full challenge guidelines and submission rules will be made available during the webinar.
