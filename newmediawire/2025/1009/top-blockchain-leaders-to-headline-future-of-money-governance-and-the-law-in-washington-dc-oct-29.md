# Top Blockchain Leaders to Headline Future of Money, Governance and the Law in Washington, DC, Oct. 29

WASHINGTON, DC - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Government policymakers, blockchain industry innovators, and financial experts from around the world will converge at the US Capitol from Oct. 29-30 for two days of discussions and keynotes for the 2025 Future of Money, Governance, and the Law (FoMGL), hosted by the Government Blockchain Association (GBA) and the Edge of Company.

 U.S. Representative Bill Huizenga, Vice Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and one of Congress’s leading voices on financial markets and innovation, will join a distinguished group of global policymakers for a discussion on government policy. He will be joined by the U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, Baroness Pola Uddin of the UK House of Lords, Dr. Lisa Cameron, founder of the UK-US Crypto Alliance, and Dan Spuller of the Blockchain Association. Together, they will examine how governments can craft responsible frameworks for digital assets that foster innovation, ensure market integrity, and strengthen international financial cooperation in the digital age.

 The world-class event will see policymakers and global thought leaders meet under one roof to meet both the biggest challenges and opportunities of crypto, digital assets and blockchain head-on, sparking meaningful connections, inspiring collaboration, and accelerating the adoption of transformative technologies that will define the coming decades.

 Featuring a day of compelling programming and high-level dialogue, the event seeks to bring lawmakers up to speed about the rapid evolution of technologies like AI, blockchain, quantum computing and more, while examining the impacts these technologies are having across the public and private sectors.

 Attendees can expect immersive discussions on issues like decentralized finance (DeFi), AI governance, national security, tokenization and more, featuring high-impact keynote speakers led by industry pioneers and public officials.

 “This year’s event comes at a pivotal moment as interest in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and AI technologies reaches new heights,” said Gerard Dache, Executive Director of the GBA. “FoMGL bridges the gap between innovation and public policy, informing legislation, shaping regulatory frameworks, and advancing the future of digital governance.”

 The event will culminate with two published reports by the Digital Asset Roundtable of Experts (DARTE), and the GBA’s report on Preventing Government Fraud, Waste & Abuse with Blockchain. These reports will be shared with policymakers worldwide as an educational tool, as governments around the world seek new and innovative technologies to solve problems.

 Critical global infrastructure that will determine crypto’s positioning on the world financial stage is already being built, so the time to address the legal frameworks, regulations, and social impact is right now.

 On October 29th, a 1920s-themed gala will blend learning, laughter, and connection at a luxurious off-site location, creating unforgettable memories and fostering relationships that will carry the momentum of the event far beyond its two-day runtime.

 The FoMGL daytime sessions on the 30th are free for the public to attend, but due to limited capacity, priority will go to government policymakers, GBA members, and invited guests.
