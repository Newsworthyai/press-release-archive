# CHARBONE Hydrogen Successfully Completes the Dismantling of Hydrogen Equipment in Quebec and Announces the Arrival of the Main Components in Sorel-Tracy

BROSSARD, QUEBEC - October 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CHARBONE HYDROGEN CORPORATION (TSXV: CH; OTCQB: CHHYF; FSE: K47) (“CHARBONE” or the “Company”), a company dedicated to building a North America’s first clean Ultra High Purity (“UHP”) hydrogen production and distribution network, is pleased to announce that it has successfully completed the dismantling of the hydrogen production assets acquired in Quebec City and that the main components of this equipment have now arrived in Sorel-Tracy.

 This milestone marks a major step forward in the schedule for commissioning CHARBONE's first clean UHP hydrogen production unit, which is still scheduled to start up in November 2025.

 “We are proud to have completed this crucial logistical milestone on time,” said Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE. “The transfer of this strategic equipment to our Sorel-Tracy site brings us closer to the first production of clean UHP hydrogen in Quebec, while optimizing our investments through the reuse of proven assets.”

 The dismantling and transport operations were successfully carried out by CHARBONE's technical teams and their specialized partners, ensuring the complete preservation of the integrity of the modules and systems. The company plans to begin reintegration and connection work at the Sorel-Tracy site in the coming weeks.

 This transaction stems from the strategic transaction announced on September 5, 2025, through which CHARBONE secured hydrogen production and refueling assets. In addition to accelerating time to market, this acquisition allows CHARBONE to significantly reduce its capital costs and benefit from already operational and proven equipment.

 “We would like to thank our partners, suppliers and internal teams for the quality of their work and their commitment,” added Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE. “CHARBONE's vision of building a modular clean UHP hydrogen production network in North America is becoming more tangible and concrete every day.”
