# Duo Duo Projects Compassion Beyond Borders Gathering in London Reflects a Global Movement to End the Dog and Cat Meat Trade

SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Duo Duo Project hosted a poignant global gathering in London, uniting animal advocates, supporters, and partners from around the world with a shared mission: to end the dog and cat meat trade. The Compassion Beyond Borders Symposium was more than an event - it was a powerful reminder that compassion has no boundaries, and that a global movement for kindness is well underway.

 For over twelve years, Duo Duo Project has worked on the ground in China 365 days a year to change hearts and minds through humane education, community outreach, and sustainable stray population control. Founded by Andrea Gung, the organization’s mission is rooted in a belief that empathy can dismantle cruelty and that the world can - and must - end this practice within our lifetime.

 “When we began, it felt impossible,” said Andrea Gung, Founder and Executive Director of Duo Duo Project. “But I have seen with my own eyes how compassion can change culture. This is no longer a dream - it’s a movement that’s winning hearts across borders and proving that change is possible when compassion leads.”

 The London event brought together members of the international “Duo Duo Pack,” volunteers, and advocates from multiple continents to celebrate progress and chart a course toward lasting change. Attendees experienced moving photos and videos documenting Duo Duo’s work, including an update on the organization’s Spay and Neuter Training Center - the first of its kind in China. The center is a groundbreaking initiative to train veterinarians and animal welfare workers in humane methods to reduce stray populations, addressing one of the root causes of the dog and cat meat trade.

 “When we cut off the supply of stray animals who fall victim to the horrific meat trade, the trade itself begins to collapse,” said Gung. “Every spay or neuter procedure represents not just one life saved, but a step toward ending this cruelty forever.”

 The atmosphere in London was filled with emotion, unity, and a renewed sense of purpose. Many attendees traveled from as far as Asia and North America to celebrate the achievements of the Duo Duo Project and to strengthen the community of advocates determined to see this fight through to victory.

 One of the most memorable moments of the evening was the presentation of Duo Duo Project’s first-ever Compassion Beyond Borders Awards, honoring allies who exemplify global collaboration in animal welfare. This year’s honorees were Nancy Janes of Romania Animal Rescue and Karen Reed of Dogs Trust UK. Reed’s award was accepted on her behalf by Charlotte, a member of the Duo Duo Pack UK. The awards symbolized the organization’s growing network of partners who are transforming compassion into tangible change worldwide.

 During the event, Christy, Director of Campaigns and Development at Duo Duo Project, spoke about the urgent yet achievable nature of this mission. “We are living in a time when so many horrors are out of our control,” she said. “But the horror of the dog and cat meat trade can be stopped in our lifetime. This is a winnable campaign.”

 That belief - that this is indeed a winnable campaign - has become the heartbeat of the Duo Duo movement. From educational initiatives that reach Chinese youth to partnerships that elevate animal welfare standards globally, Duo Duo Project’s work has proven that cultural transformation is possible through consistent, compassionate engagement.

 “What began as a mission to save one dog named Duo Duo has become a global movement,” Gung reflected. “Every volunteer, every donor, every voice that joins us brings us closer to ending this trade once and for all.”

 Looking ahead, the organization continues to raise funds to complete the Spay and Neuter Training Center through its Virtual Buy-A-Brick Campaign, which enables supporters worldwide to directly contribute to building the infrastructure of compassion. Each contribution brings the center closer to completion—and with it, a world where fewer animals are at risk.

 As Gung shared in closing, “To everyone who joined us in London and to all who support us from every corner of the globe - thank you. You are the heart of this movement. Together, we are proving that compassion truly has no borders.”
