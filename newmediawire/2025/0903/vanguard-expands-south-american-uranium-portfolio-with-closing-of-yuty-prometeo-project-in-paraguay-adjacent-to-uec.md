# Vanguard Expands South American Uranium Portfolio with Closing of Yuty Prometeo Project in Paraguay Adjacent to UEC

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vanguard Mining Corp. ("Vanguard" or the "Company") (UUU: CSE |UUUFF: OTCID | SL51: Frankfurt) is pleased to announce that, further to its Definitive Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated June 17, 2025, and its Letter of Intent (“LOI”) dated April 8, 2025, the Company has closed the acquisition of the Yuty Prometeo Project (“Paraguay Uranium”) in southeastern Paraguay.

 The four concessions - including the three San Jose and one Yuty Uno concession - collectively span approximately 90,000 hectares (222,395 acres) within the prolific Paraná Basin, one of South America’s most promising uranium regions. The project area is located adjacent to Uranium Energy Corp.’s (“UEC”) established Yuty Deposit, which hosts an Indicated resource of 8.96 million pounds of U₃O₈.

 David Greenway, CEO of Vanguard Mining Corp., commented, “Closing on the Yuty Prometeo concessions is a major milestone for Vanguard and underscores our commitment to building a dominant uranium portfolio in South America. Paraguay offers a unique combination of political stability, investor-friendly policies, and untapped mineral potential that make it an ideal jurisdiction for long-term uranium exploration. With our ground positioned directly alongside UEC’s established Yuty deposit, we see clear opportunity to apply modern exploration techniques across a historically prospective district. This acquisition not only strengthens our strategic footprint in the Paraná Basin but also advances Vanguard’s broader mission to secure critical minerals that will drive the global clean energy transition.”

 This acquisition follows Company updates issued on April 17, 2025 (engagement of senior geologist Ariel Testi, CPG, to prepare an initial NI 43-101 technical report on the Yuty Prometeo Project), June 12, 2025 (initiation of a site visit, core review and data compilation in Paraguay to support that report), and June 17, 2025 (execution of a Definitive Share Purchase Agreement to acquire 100% of 1302343 B.C. Ltd., which holds an 85% interest in Paraguay Uranium S.A., owner of the four Yuty Prometeo concessions).

 About the Yuty Prometeo Project

 The Yuty Prometeo consists of four (4) concessions—three (3) San Jose concessions and one (1) Prometeo concession - covering a combined area of approximately 90,000 hectares (222,395 acres) within the uranium-rich Paraná Basin in southeastern Paraguay.

 The Prometeo Concession spans approximately 27,666 hectares (68,368 acres) and is directly contiguous to UEC’s Yuty Project. Historical records reference 28 drill holes on the property, with uranium values ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% U₃O₈. Data from previous work by the Anschutz Corporation suggest that the Prometeo block lies on trend with UEC’s adjacent Transandes block.

 The San Jose Concessions encompass approximately 62,210 hectares (153,754 acres) across three contiguous claims situated along the Upper Permian–Carboniferous contact, approximately 100 km northwest of UEC’s Yuty Project and 40 km west of its Coronel Oviedo Project. A radiometric car survey conducted over a 40 km by 10 km area delineated significant uranium anomalies across the property. Collectively, these concessions represent a strategically positioned and highly prospective uranium exploration asset within one of South America’s most promising uranium districts.

 About UEC’s Yuty ISR Project

 UEC’s adjacent Yuty ISR Project, covering approximately 117,359 hectares (290,000 acres) in southeastern Paraguay, hosts an Indicated resource of 8.962 million lbs and an Inferred resource of 2.203 million lbs U₃O₈, as disclosed in its July 1, 2022, technical report titled “Yuty Uranium Project Initial Assessment US SEC Subpart 1300 Regulation SK Report, Paraguay SA.” The project has been identified as amenable to in-situ recovery (“ISR”), the same extraction method UEC employs at its operations in Texas. Vanguard cautions that mineralization on adjacent properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company’s own projects.

 On March 30, 2012, UEC acquired all outstanding shares of CUE Resources Ltd., securing a 100% undivided interest in the Yuty Project.[1]

 Resource Estimates

 The current disclosed resource for UEC’s Yuty Project is 8.962 million lbs of U308 Indicated, and 2.203 million lbs of U308 Inferred, which has been finalized in a technical report prepared for UEC titled “Yuty Uranium Project Initial Assessment US SEC Subpart 1300 Regulation SK Report, Paraguay SA” dated July 1, 2022. [2]

 Vanguard’s management cautions that past results or discoveries on properties adjacent to Vanguard’s projects may not be indicative of mineralization on the Company’s own properties.

 About Paraguay

Known for its political stability, low sovereign risk, and investor-friendly regulatory environment, Paraguay offers a supportive framework for mineral exploration and development. The country has a democratic government, strong legal protections for foreign investment, and a growing interest in unlocking its untapped mineral potential, particularly in uranium, rare earth elements, and base metals. With abundant land, a relatively low population density, and improving infrastructure, Paraguay is increasingly recognized as a geopolitically stable and strategically attractive destination for mining companies seeking long-term growth opportunities.

 Restricted Share Units Issuance
