# 45Drives Launches Groundbreaking 45HomeLab and 45Professional Storage Setup Wizard to Simplify Linux Storage Server Configuration for Home and Professional Users

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 45Drives, a global leader in open-source storage solutions, is proud to announce the release of the 45HomeLab and 45Professional Storage Setup Wizard, a powerful new client application designed to make configuring resilient, secure, and high-performance Linux/ZFS storage servers accessible to everyone - from homelab newcomers to seasoned MSPs. The new tool is a major leap forward in 45Drives’ ongoing mission to make enterprise-grade storage both open and usable.

 The 45Drives Storage Setup Wizard is available as a free, open-source desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It allows users to easily discover and configure their HL15, HL8, or HL4 storage servers over a local network, without needing to attach a monitor, keyboard, or have prior Linux or ZFS experience. The wizard not only automates best-practice storage and backup setup, but teaches users what’s happening under the hood as part of 45Drives' commitment to transparency and education.

 “This is the culmination of everything 45Drives stands for: power, transparency, and education in open computing,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives. “We believe that your data should be secure and your tools understandable. The Storage Setup Wizard puts our best practices into the hands of any user - no command-line wizardry required. It’s not just automation; it’s automation with insight.”

 “The 45Drives Setup Wizard is going to let you take their cool, prosumer hardware and make it so much easier to deploy and maintain,” said Brett Duncan, also known as Raid Owl. “The fact that we’ll now have a nice piece of software to run client backups is going to be great as well. Oh, and shoutout to the Houston Commander! I’m excited to see where this is headed.”

 “The fact that a convenient client tool has been demanded from the likes of TrueNAS and Unraid… and it’s never been provided… has always been something of an anathema to me,” said Robbie Andrews from NAS Compares. “This is an interesting development from this brand who are making quite a good name for themselves being the fair use option in the market right now. Bravo. These are clearly fundamentals - building blocks where the client application is going to grow outward from. Clearly, 45Drives has looked at HexOS and gone, you know what, hold my beer. Providing a free tool alongside an open-source OS can only be a good thing. Why do 45Drives need a client tool? Quite simply, even though they are doing an over-the-counter solution, it is still right now arguably as complicated as setting up with something like TrueNAS… They are trying to stop that.”

 Key Features of the 45HomeLab Storage Setup Wizard:

 * Zero-Peripheral Setup: Configure your storage server directly from your client desktop - no monitor, mouse, or keyboard required. Simply connect both the server and your desktop to the same router or switch. Once connected, the server can be used for network-based storage.
* Simple Guided Setup: Designed for users without Linux or ZFS experience. The intuitive process walks you through step-by-step, without sacrificing clarity or control.
* Smart RAID Configuration: The wizard detects the server model and drive configuration, automatically setting up a RAID array based on 45Drives’ best practices for performance, resiliency and redundancy.
* Scheduled Client Backups: Easily configure automated backups from your local workstation to your storage server, minimizing the risk of data loss due to device failure. Easy restore option in case of a client failure.
* Scheduled Scrubs: Protection against bit rot/data corruption.
* Scheduled Snapshots: Protection against accidental or intentional deletion.
* Transparent and Educational: Unlike overly automated tools that obscure critical
* decisions, this wizard shows you exactly what it’s doing - and why - at every step.
* Offsite Backups and Restore Configuration (*coming soon after release): Set up secure, automated offsite backups to another server or to the cloud, providing critical protection against natural disasters or site failures.

 Why It Matters

 Linux/ZFS-based storage servers are widely recognized for their unmatched performance, flexibility, and reliability. But for many users, that flexibility introduces steep complexity. The Storage Setup Wizard bridges that gap - giving users the benefits of powerful open-source storage without the steep learning curve. Whether you’re a homelabber backing up family photos or an MSP deploying systems for clients, this tool ensures data is set up right the first time.

 Availability and Support

 * Tightly integrated with every 45HomeLab HL4, HL8, and HL15 server, as well as all 45Professional systems.
* Fully open source and actively maintained on the 45Drives GitHub.
* Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop platforms.

 Target Users

 * Anyone looking for an easier way to set up and manage storage servers
* HomeLab Enthusiasts: HomeLab enthusiasts who are new to storage servers and have no Linux experience will appreciate the convenience of setup. There's no need for monitors or keyboards - just connect your server and desktop to the same router or switch and configure everything from your desktop browser.
* MSPs: Professionals seeking a fast, consistent, and reliable setup process across deployments.

 The 45HomeLab Storage Setup Wizard represents a major evolution in how users can interact with and understand their storage infrastructure, upholding the values of openness and user empowerment that define the 45Drives community.
