# New research finds 62% of AFib patients were unaware of the condition before diagnosis

(NewMediaWire) - September 03, 2025 - DALLAS — Atrial fibrillation, or AFib, often goes unrecognized despite affecting millions and increasing stroke risk by up to 5 times[1]. New consumer patient research from the American Heart Association, conducted by The Olinger Group, finds that most people with AFib (62%) had no prior knowledge of the condition before being diagnosed[2]. During September, AFib Awareness Month, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is raising awareness nationwide about the condition, and that early identification and treatment of AFib are critical to stroke prevention.

 Anyone can develop AFib, and risk increases with age. It is important to know the signs and risk factors:

 1. Recognize AFib symptoms and risks. Irregular heartbeat is a common symptom of AFib, while high blood pressure and family history are key risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing the condition.
2. AFib is manageable and treatable. With the right plan you can lower your stroke risk and live fully.
3. You are not alone on your AFib journey. Find support and connect with others at MyAFibExperience.org.

 AFib is a quivering or irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. According to the latest statics from the American Heart Association, the heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia) affects over 6 million people in the U.S., and that number is expected to double by 2030[3].

 “This projected rise is driven by several factors, including the growing prevalence of high blood pressure, a major risk factor for AFib, as well as increasing rates of diabetes, obesity and an aging population,” said José Joglar, MD, American Heart Association volunteer, professor of cardiac electrophysiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and chair of the 2023 guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation. “It’s important for people to understand their risk factors, recognize potential symptoms and have regular conversations with their health care professional. Early detection and proactive management can make a life-saving difference.”

 To better understand this growing public health issue, the Association conducted a nationwide online survey of 1,200 participants, including 770 patients with AFib and 430 caregivers, between January and March 2025. The study assessed awareness of the condition, as well as motivations and barriers to treatment

 The findings reveal gaps in public knowledge about AFib and highlight areas where increased awareness is essential to promote earlier recognition and diagnosis of the condition.

 Learn the signs and risk factors

 Symptoms can vary widely or be completely absent. Many people associate AFib with a racing or irregular heartbeat, however, other symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, chest pain or fainting may occur.

 While anyone can develop AFib, risk increases with age and is higher among people with uncontrolled high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, overweight, have had a prior heart attack or a family history of the condition.

 According to the research, AFib patients reported experiencing an average of three symptoms before receiving a diagnosis[4], highlighting the need to recognize early warning signs, understand personal risk factors and discuss them with a health care professional.

 Managing AFib

 Being diagnosed with AFib may feel overwhelming. However, with the right care plan, you can effectively manage AFib and reduce your risk of stroke and other complications.

 Collaborating with a health care team helps patients understand their specific type of AFib and develop a personalized plan. Treatment options for AFib may include medication, procedures and lifestyle changes such as weight management, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking and managing conditions like high blood pressure to support long-term health.

 Support is within reach

 You’re not alone on your AFib journey. People living with AFib and caregivers can find support and connect with others through the American Heart Association’s online community MyAFibExperience.
