 PITTSBURGH, PA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative Designs, Inc. (OTCQB: IVDN) is now able to project its revenue growth for the fiscal 3rd quarter of 2025, ending on July 31st, will total over $600,000 (more than a 100% increase over the fiscal 3rd quarter of 2024). Additionally, in the month of August, IVDN surpassed the $2 million revenue mark for its fiscal 2025 year. The milestone will continue the Company's profitability, which now extends to 4 consecutive quarters. Management expects to file a finalized financial report ahead of the September 15th SEC posting requirement.

 In addition to the record setting revenue results and profitability this year, Innovative Designs is becoming a financially stronger entity with other significant balance sheet improvements. The Company has now paid off its long term and convertible debt obligations with over $85,000 in debt satisfied and without issuing any new shares for this purpose. Management is committed to maintaining a low share structure for IVDN which currently stands at only about 38 million shares outstanding and a 17 million public float.

 The debt resolution has been made possible by our rising revenue stream and increasing accounts receivables collections which have also significantly boosted on-hand cash reserves. For this reason, IVDN is no longer seeking private placement investments and recommends that interested persons make their stock purchases in the open market.

 Joseph A. Riccelli Jr., CEO of Innovative Designs, stated, “We are proud to have reached the $2 million revenue mark for the first time in IVDN history and we can still extend this record to another new high point in Q4. Our superior Insultex House Wrap® is continuing to be discovered by more homebuilders and remodelers who are recognizing its clear advantages for the current building codes and the more demanding insulation requirements that exist today. We expect to file our official fiscal third quarter financial report on time with finalized numbers. The improved Company balance sheet, thanks to our successful debt resolution initiative, is also contributing to help us reach our objective of increasing shareholder value for all IVDN investors. We expect to see increasing of the company going forward.” Continued demand for Innovative Designs Insultex House Wrap® is being driven by new government building codes specifying continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements.
