# Giant Mining Expands New Copper Discovery at Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project, Nevada With AI-Driven Drill Program as Phase 2 Exploration Begins

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5 | CSE: BFG.WT.A | CSE: BFG.WT.B) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the commencement of its highly anticipated 2025 Phase 2 Exploration Program at the Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project in Pershing County, Nevada.

 Building upon the success of Phase 1, this next phase leverages a porphyry-driven, magmatic-hydrothermal breccia model to unlock the district-scale potential at the Majuba Hill.

 With the United States accelerating efforts to re-shore critical mineral supply chains, copper has emerged as an indispensable resource - essential for electrification, grid modernization, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing. Majuba Hill, located in one of the world’s most mining-friendly jurisdictions, is poised to become a key domestic source of copper, supporting America’s transition to a sustainable, self-reliant future.

 2025 Phase 2 Surface Exploration Highlights-Figure 1:

 * Southern Breccia Zone - Historic Workings Area: Integration of drill-defined breccia zones into the 3D digital model and copper mineralization, positioning Majuba Hill for future exploration.
* Northern Breccia Zone - Newly recognized Breccia Body Targeting: Comprehensive surface mapping, core data analysis, and the addition of 93 new soil samples to evaluate the zone’s full extent.
* Ball Park Breccia - Newly recognized Breccia Body with multiple Breccias: Improve geologic characterization by utilizing historical drill data to delineate potential high-grade breccia-hosted mineralization.
* 789 Resistivity Target - Advanced AI Integration: Deployment of ExploreTech’s AI-driven geophysical modeling to refine IP/resistivity targets using the latest porphyry-breccia exploration techniques.
* New soil samples will extend the existing soil sample grid and provide additional geochemical characterization data for the newly recognized Northern Breccia Zone and Ball Park Breccia.

 2025 Phase 1: AI Drill Hole Highlights:

 Final assay results have been received for Phase 1 of the Spring 2025 diamond drilling program (the “Core Program”) for core hole MHB-36, completed at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Project (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada (Figure 2).

 This was the fifth and final drill hole of the program, completed to a total depth (TD) of 1,100 feet (335.3 meters).

 “The final assay results from MHB-36 confirm the effectiveness of our AI-driven targeting strategy at Majuba Hill,” stated David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining. “ExploreTech’s proprietary geophysical modeling successfully identified a high-potential breccia zone in the Southern Corridor, expanding our understanding of Majuba’s copper mineralization. With these results in hand, we are confident that our Phase 2 program will build on this momentum and further unlock the district-scale copper, silver, and gold potential of Majuba Hill in Nevada.”

 Core hole MHB-36 was designed by Exploration Technologies, Inc. (“ExploreTech”) using its proprietary AI-assisted geophysical modeling system to test a high-potential resistivity anomaly in the Southern Zone Breccia Corridor of the Majuba Hill project area. The AI-driven targeting approach sought to identify geologically favorable zones with potential for copper mineralization beyond those already known.

 The primary objective of the Core Program was to delineate and better understand the geometry and extent of the copper-bearing breccia zones. Assay results and geological interpretation outline a distinct copper-mineralized breccia body at Majuba Hill (Figure 2).

 Highlights

 - MHB-36 intersected numerous 5 to 20 feet (1.5-6.1 m) long intervals of supergene and hypogene copper in veins and disseminated in the rhyolite porphyry and within Triassic age metasediment roof pendants in the intrusive and magmatic-hydrothermal breccia bodies (see Table 1). The copper values are directly correlative to the presence of chalcopyrite (Figure 3). Including:

 - 1.5 ft (0.5 m) @ 1.21% Cu from 741.5 to 743 feet (225-226.5 m)

 - The South Resistivity Anomaly (Figure 2) outlined by the ExploreTech geophysical modeling process distinctly identified the zone with hypogene (chalcopyrite) copper mineralization. Based on the recent review and modeling by Giant’s technical team and consultants, this resistivity anomaly is directly adjacent to the deeper parts of the magmatic-hydrothermal breccia body.

 - Copper within the “Mineralized Tourmaline-Early Breccia” (Figure 2) included enriched and primary (hypogene) copper mineralization as previously announced on May 22, 2025 and July 15, 2025 (Table 1).

 - Previously reported Copper occurred in long intervals of copper mineralization within both the main “Mineralized Tourmaline-Early Breccia” and the surrounding “Late Stockworked Rhyolite” (Figure 2).

 Buster Hunsaker, Consulting Geologist, commented: “The ExploreTech process gives Giant Mining a solid vectoring tool. With this AI-driven process, the Company can utilize the extensive property-wide, IP/Resistivity database. The presence of the copper (as chalcopyrite) is directly related to the magmatic-hydrothermal breccias and the ExploreTech process pointed us straight to the anomalous zone.”

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth sample bags and are transported from the Giant Mining secure warehouse to the ALS Labs Sample Prep Facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS Labs then securely transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 5% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining pulps will be retrieved from ALS Labs.
