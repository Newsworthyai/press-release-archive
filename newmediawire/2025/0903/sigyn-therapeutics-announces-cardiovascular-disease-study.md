# Sigyn Therapeutics Announces Cardiovascular Disease Study

Future Study Could Lead to a Groundbreaking Approach to Reduce Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

 SAN DIEGO, CA. - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: SIGY), a developer of next-generation blood purification technologies, today announced plans to commence a multi-site clinical feasibility study of Sigyn Therapy™ in high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD) subjects. According to the World Health Organization, CVD is the number one cause of death globally.

 Sigyn Therapy™ is a first-in-class whole-blood adsorption technology designed for use on dialysis machines located in hospitals and clinics around the world. Specific to cardiovascular disease, Sigyn Therapy™ reduces the circulating presence of inflammatory molecules that promote CVD progression while simultaneously targeting cholesterol transporting lipoproteins that contribute to heart attacks, strokes, and other major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

 The Company had previously reported that the protocol of its clinical feasibility study would enroll dialysis dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with endotoxemia and concurrent inflammation. These are conditions that promote cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of ESRD patient deaths.

 Based on insight from pre-clinical invitro studies, the Company is expanding its feasibility study protocol to quantify lipoprotein reduction resulting from the administration of Sigyn Therapy™. The successful completion of the Sigyn feasibility study would set the stage for a pivotal efficacy study necessary to pursue potential market clearance.

 The use of an extracorporeal device to reduce lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] from the bloodstream is commercially known as lipoprotein apheresis (LA). LA is an established FDA-approved device precedent to treat cardiovascular disease. Published clinical studies of LA have reported 55% to 98% reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in treated patients.

 While the clinical benefit of lipoprotein apheresis is well established, treatment access in the United States is limited to fewer than 60 specialized apheresis centers. Whereas Sigyn Therapy™ is deployed on dialysis machines located in approximately 7,500 U.S. dialysis clinics. Beyond its potential for broad commercialization, Sigyn Therapy™ can be conveniently administered to ESRD patients during their regularly scheduled dialysis treatments.

 “Targeting the bloodstream reduction of Lp(a) and LDL-C while simultaneously suppressing dialysis-induced endotoxemia and inflammation introduces a broad-spectrum strategy to extend ESRD patient lives by addressing multiple core drivers of cardiovascular disease,” stated Jim Joyce, Sigyn Therapeutics’ CEO and co-inventor of Sigyn Therapy™.

 The Potential Value of Extending ESRD Patient Lives

 In the United States, the dialysis industry generates annual revenues of approximately $34 billion based on the administration of ~85 million dialysis treatments to more than 550,000 individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the absence of an effective therapeutic intervention, most ESRD patients will die from cardiovascular disease. Based on reported dialysis treatment revenues, extending the lives of ESRD patients by just one month could increase top-line industry revenues by approximately $2.8 billion. The primary revenue beneficiaries would be Fresenius Medical Care and Davita, Inc., who control 75% of the U.S. dialysis market based on public financial filings.
