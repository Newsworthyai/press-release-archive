MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - LifeQuest World Corp. (OTCID: LQWC) (“LifeQuest” or the “Company”), an emerging leader in sustainable environmental technologies, today announced that it has entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of a well-established solid waste management company based in the Pacific Northwest.

 Under the terms of the proposed transaction, LifeQuest will issue a total of 2,888,290 Series B Preferred Shares of LifeQuest and make a US$500,000 cash payment as consideration. The Series B Preferred Shares are convertible into 288,829,000 shares of common stock and carry voting rights on an as-converted basis.

 Strategic Rationale

 The acquisition represents a significant milestone in LifeQuest’s growth strategy. By combining the nearly 50 years of leadership in the U.S. waste equipment sales and service market with LifeQuest’s international wastewater treatment business, LifeQuest aims to become a vertically integrated environmental solutions provider for wastewater and solid waste management.

 The acquired company has a proven track record in the Pacific Northwest with a customer base exceeding 3,000 accounts, a growing trash and recycling chute installation division, and exclusive distribution rights for an innovative aerobic food waste bio-digester. This platform provides LifeQuest with a strong foundation for expansion in the U.S. solid waste management market.

 This acquisition also complements LifeQuest’s international footprint in wastewater treatment qualified sale pipeline of circa $28 million across Africa, the Philippines and Southeast Asia.
