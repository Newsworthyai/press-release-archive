# OptiCool Names Lawrence "LL" Lee as First Chief Channel Officer to Lead Partner-First Strategy

WEBSTER, N.Y. - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - OptiCool Technologies, a leading provider of two-phase liquid cooling systems, today announced the appointment of Lawrence “LL” Lee as its first Chief Channel Officer (CCO), underscoring the company’s commitment to a partner-first growth strategy at a time when AI adoption is driving unprecedented demand for high-density cooling.

 As CCO, Lee will lead OptiCool’s channel go-to-market strategy - recruiting, enabling, and scaling partners to bring advanced cooling solutions directly to customers. By aligning product, marketing, customer success, and finance teams around partner needs, he’ll ensure the channel becomes a central driver of OptiCool’s expansion. This appointment marks a pivotal step in making advanced liquid cooling broadly available through the channel, an approach that sets OptiCool apart in a market long dominated by direct vendor sales.

 “The rapid adoption of AI is driving unprecedented demand for high-density cooling, and OptiCool is uniquely positioned to meet that challenge,” said Lee. “By fully embracing the channel, we are creating an ecosystem where partners can bring advanced cooling solutions directly to their customers. This partner-first approach enables distributors and advisors to expand beyond traditional colocation offerings and deliver next-generation cooling at scale - while accelerating OptiCool’s growth as a leading supplier in the data center market.”

 Lee brings more than 25 years of experience in corporate strategy, enterprise sales, and global channel development to the role. He most recently served as Vice President of Global Partnerships & Alliances at Zenlayer where he helped grow the company from $100M to $400M in annual recurring revenue, by building a global partner ecosystem that included strategic relationships with Equinix, Digital Realty, Bridgepointe, Intelisys, and others. Under his leadership, the program earned recognition from AWS, Equinix, and Digital Realty with multiple Partner of the Year awards. Earlier in his career, Lee co-founded Unitas Global and built its channel from the ground up, creating a partner network that became a key driver of growth and the company’s eventual acquisition by Digital Alpha Advisors.

 At OptiCool, Lee will focus on enabling Technology Solutions Distributors (TSDs), VARs, OEMs, and distributors - along with data center operators - to capitalize on the surge in high-density workloads, creating first-in-class channel sales agreements and driving partner-led engagement worldwide.
