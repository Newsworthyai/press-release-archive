# 69 schools awarded wellness grants to support healthier communities nationwide

(NewMediaWire) - September 03, 2025 - DALLAS — Only 1 in 4 children in the U.S. gets the recommended amount of daily physical activity, and about 1 in 3 is overweight or obese[1]. To help address these growing health concerns[2], the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, has awarded wellness grants to 69 schools across the country to support healthier learning environments.

 Through its Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ initiatives, the Association awards annual financial grants that provide schools with resources to meet their health and wellness needs — from the purchase of physical education equipment and playground upgrades, to water filling stations and counseling services. These resources open the door for more students and staff to be active, eat smart, manage stress and live longer, healthier lives.

 “Healthy living should be possible no matter where you live,” said Lee Shapiro, J.D., volunteer chair of the board of the American Heart Association and managing partner at 7wireVentures. “Every school has unique needs, and these grants provide resources that support students, staff and their communities based on their unique needs — whether that’s through enhancing nutrition, increasing activity or improving mental well-being.”

 All schools that participate in the Kids Heart Challenge or American Heart Challenge are eligible to apply for grants, which are awarded multiple times each school year. This cycle’s recipients span 37 states. A complete list of awardees and project summaries is available here.

 The Kids Heart Challenge and American Heart Challenge reach more than 10 million students in approximately 20,000 American schools each year. Participants and their families learn how to eat smart, manage stress, avoid tobacco and vaping, recognize the warning signs of a heart attack and stroke and more. Students are also introduced to Hands-Only CPR, a lifesaving skill that children as young as nine can learn and use if they witness a sudden cardiac arrest.

 Schools interested in participating can sign up for the 2025–26 school year at heart.org/jointhechallenge.
