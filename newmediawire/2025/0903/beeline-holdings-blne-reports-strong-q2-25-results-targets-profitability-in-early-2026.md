# Beeline Holdings (BLNE) Reports Strong Q2/25 Results, Targets Profitability in Early 2026

LOS ANGELES, CA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Beeline Holdings (NASDAQ: BLNE), a U.S.-based digital mortgage lender, reported strong results for the second quarter of 2025, highlighting both financial and operational progress. The company posted US$1.7 million in revenue for the quarter ended June 30, representing a 27% increase quarter-over-quarter, while cutting operating costs by 40% to US$5.6 million. Net loss narrowed to US$4.1 million, a 68% improvement from the prior quarter, and adjusted EBITDA also improved. Beeline reduced debt by US$2.7 million during the quarter, bringing its year-to-date repayment to US$6.2 million, and ended Q2 with US$6.3 million in cash. Management reiterated its expectation to reach profitability by January 2026, supported by growing revenue streams and continued cost discipline.

 Operationally, Beeline advanced on several fronts, including funding US$52 million in mortgages, up 31% from Q1, and debuting new products and technology. The company piloted BeelineEQUITY, a cash-out equity alternative that allows homeowners to sell a fractional interest in their property, completing what it described as a first-of-its-kind U.S. transaction. It also launched BlinkQC, an AI-driven quality control software offered on a SaaS basis, and rolled out Bob, an AI mortgage chatbot that demonstrated strong lead conversion rates. These initiatives, combined with Beelineâ€™s ability to close loans twice as fast as the industry average, position the company to capture market share in a sector projected to grow at a 13.57% CAGR over the next eight years. Analysts covering the company see meaningful upside, with Ladenburg Thalmann recently initiating coverage with a Buy rating and a price target implying more than 200% potential appreciation.
