# BioCorRx Provides Update on OTC Markets Quotation Status and Planned Form S1 Filing

OTC Markets Quotation Update: Continued SEC Reporting and Planned Form S-1 Resale Registration

 ANAHEIM, CA - December 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BioCorRx Inc. (OTCQB: BICX) (the “Company”), a developer and provider of innovative treatment programs for substance abuse and related disorders, today announced that it has been notified that its common stock will transition from the OTCQB® Venture Market to the OTCID™ Market due to a technical eligibility matter related to OTCQB® public float requirements. This transition is not the result of any delinquency in the Company’s SEC reporting obligations. The Company remains current in its periodic reporting and disclosure obligations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

 OTC Markets Group launched the OTCID™ Market in July 2025 as part of a broader structural update to the U.S. OTC equity markets, replacing the former Pink “Current Information” category with a baseline disclosure market for issuers that publish current information and provide a management certification.

 BioCorRx has been a fully reporting public company for approximately 14 years and intends to maintain a high level of transparency with shareholders. To address the public float requirement and support eligibility to regain quotation on the OTCQB Venture Market, the Company intends to file a Form S-1 resale registration statement with the SEC. The Company does not expect to raise capital or receive any proceeds in connection with this filing. There can be no assurance that the registration statement will be declared effective or that the Company will be able to regain or maintain quotation on the OTCQB Venture Market.

 The Company does not anticipate any change to its business operations or SEC reporting obligations as a result of the quotation tier transition. Shareholders may continue to access the Comnpany’s SEC filings on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, and there will be no change or interruption in the Company’s SEC reporting or the availability of its public disclosures.

 Important Safety Information

 What is LUCEMYRA?

 LUCEMYRA is a non-opioid prescription medicine used in adults to help with the symptoms of opioid withdrawal that may happen when you stop taking an opioid suddenly. LUCEMYRA will not completely prevent the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is not a treatment for opioid use disorder.

 Important Safety Information

 LUCEMYRA can cause serious side effects, including low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and fainting. Watch for symptoms of low blood pressure or heart rate, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint at rest or when quickly standing up; if you experience these symptoms, call your healthcare provider right away and do not take your next dose of LUCEMYRA until you have talked to your healthcare provider. Avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated and be careful not to stand up too suddenly from lying or sitting, as these may increase your risk of low blood pressure and fainting.

After a period of not using opioid drugs, you can become more sensitive to the effects of opioids if you start using them again. This may increase your risk of overdose and death.
