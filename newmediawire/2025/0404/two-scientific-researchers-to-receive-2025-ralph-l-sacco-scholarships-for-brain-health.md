# Two scientific researchers to receive 2025 Ralph L. Sacco Scholarships for Brain Health

(NewMediaWire) - April 04, 2025 - DALLAS and MINNEAPOLIS, April 4, 2025 — The American Academy of Neurology and the American Heart Association have awarded the 2025 Ralph L. Sacco Scholarships for Brain Health to two researchers, Hortense Triniac, Ph.D., of Milwaukee and Katy Walsh, Ph.D., of Boston. Each will receive a $150,000 two-year scholarship to support continuing scientific research in brain health. This is the second year this scholarship has been awarded.

 The Ralph L. Sacco Scholarships in Brain Health, also known as the Sacco Scholars program, are made possible by a generous bequest to the American Academy of Neurology, the world’s largest association of neurologists and neuroscience professionals and experts in brain health and the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, from the late Ralph L. Sacco, M.D., M.S., FAAN, FAHA. Sacco was the only neurologist to have served as president of both organizations. He passed away in 2023 from a brain tumor.

 “There is a critical need for growing the body of science related to how vascular disease impacts cognitive decline, dementia and brain health more broadly,” said Keith Churchwell, M.D., FAHA, American Heart Association volunteer president, an associate clinical Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut and adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “We look forward to seeing the work of these two scholars as these research projects build upon Dr. Sacco’s decades of work in saving and improving lives.”

 “It is an honor to award two new Ralph L. Sacco Scholarships in Brain Health as we build a strong community of researchers dedicated to scientific discovery," said American Academy of Neurology President Carlayne E. Jackson, M.D., FAAN. "By accelerating research, we can achieve scientific breakthroughs that enhance brain health at every stage of life, improving brain health for all.”

 Triniac is a postdoctoral fellow in the Zheng Laboratory of the Versiti Blood Research Institute and Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. She is being awarded the scholarship to study whether the risk of a stroke may be reduced by specific interactions of several types of proteins – apolipoprotein B (apoB) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) – both of which are naturally produced in the liver. The apoB-containing lipoproteins produce low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the so-called “bad” cholesterol) when they enter the bloodstream, which may induce a chronic inflammatory response that can lead to plaque build-up and clots in the arteries. The tPA protein breaks down blood clots to allow blood to flow. Zheng Lab’s previous studies showed that tPA lowers the lipidation of apoB and the production of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver cells and when there are higher concentrations of tPA, there are lower levels of VLDL and LDL in the blood. Triniac’s new research will look at whether liver tPA lowers the risk of stroke by reducing lipid accumulation in blood vessels and improving blood clot breakdown. This research may lead to new therapies that reduce the risk of stroke and improve brain health.

 Walsh is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Kozberg Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Her research project will include investigating mechanisms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), caused when abnormal proteins build up in blood vessels in the brain, often leading to a bleeding stroke. There are currently no treatments available to patients with CAA, the strokes are often deadly and it is a leading cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Variations in human DNA in apolipoprotein E (APOE), a protein that helps the brain function by managing the movement of cell building blocks, may alter a person’s risk of developing CAA. Walsh will be studying a recently identified rare APOE variant that may improve blood vessel function to remove the protein waste that builds up in the brain. This study may significantly improve the understanding of factors contributing to CAA pathology and potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies for patients.

 “The Sacco Scholars program is helping address the critical need for funding for early career researchers while also advancing the AAN’s mission of promoting brain health for all—from a person’s earliest years of development to their oldest years,” said AAN Chief Executive Officer Mary E. Post, M.B.A., CAE. “In an era where cognitive well-being is increasingly recognized as paramount to overall health, we are proud of this program that aims to improve lives and make a meaningful contribution to the landscape of brain health.”

 “Dr. Ralph Sacco was a dear personal friend and served for more than 20 years as a dedicated volunteer for the American Heart Association. He was the first neurologist to ever serve as our volunteer president and was a champion for our work recognizing the importance of brain health,” said Nancy Brown, the American Heart Association’s chief executive officer. “He was also a valued mentor to many young scientists. It is heartening to see that his legacy of influencing the careers of countless physicians, researchers and healthcare professionals continues through this unique scholarship program.”

 Triniac and Walsh begin their two-year research projects on July 1, 2025.
