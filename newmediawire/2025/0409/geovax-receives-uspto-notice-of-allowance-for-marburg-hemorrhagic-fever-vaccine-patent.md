# GeoVax Receives USPTO Notice of Allowance for Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Vaccine Patent

Continues to Strengthen Its Pandemic Preparedness and Biodefense Vaccine Portfolio

 ATLANTA, GA - April 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a Notice of Allowance for Patent Application No. 18/394,555 titled “Replication-Deficient Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Expressing Marburg Virus Glycoprotein (GP) and Matrix Protein (VP40).” The allowed claims generally cover prevention of Marburg virus infection utilizing GeoVax’s proprietary MVA-based Marburg vaccine.

 Previous presentations of data from nonhuman primate studies demonstrated that immunization with GeoVax’s vaccine candidate, GEO-MM01, conferred 80% survival in cynomolgus macaques following a lethal dose of Marburg virus. Vaccination protected from viremia, weight loss and death following challenge with a lethal Marburg virus dose. Evaluation of immune responses following vaccination demonstrated the presence of both neutralizing antibodies and functional T cells, indicating a breadth of responses that combine for optimal protection. GeoVax is currently evaluating study designs to assess the potential for administering different dose levels of the vaccine and different routes of vaccine delivery to optimize utility and efficacy.

 David Dodd, GeoVax President and CEO, commented, “While our focus and development priorities continue to be our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, our Mpox/smallpox vaccine and cancer immunotherapy programs, developing vaccines against lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses represents our commitment to addressing highly fatal endemic threats throughout the world. Such viruses have mortality rates between 50%-90% depending on the specific virus strain. Our team is committed to supporting the successful advancement of such a vaccine, as we recognize the critically important medical and biodefense need, reflected by the inclusion of Marburg virus in the FDA Priority Review Voucher program. Within the critically needed area of hemorrhagic fever viruses, GeoVax has successfully developed vaccine candidates addressing Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and Marburg, all having demonstrated impressive results when evaluated in non-human primates. The USPTO’s recognition of our Marburg vaccine technology further validates our approach and underscores the growing value of our wholly owned, co-owned, and in-licensed intellectual property estate, now standing at over 135 granted or pending patent applications spread over 23 patent families.”

 Dodd continued, “Our focus extends beyond individual product candidates—we are building a broad, durable defense platform against hemorrhagic fever viruses. We believe this strategy, supported by compelling preclinical data and prioritized by global health authorities, positions GeoVax to play a central role in pandemic preparedness and biodefense.”

 About Marburg Virus

 Marburg virus (MARV) is a hemorrhagic fever virus of the Filoviridae family, which also includes Ebola virus, and causes severe human disease with up to a 90% fatality rate. The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats, and human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces and materials. MARV is rated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Risk Group 4 Pathogen. In the United States, the NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ranks it as a Category A Priority Pathogen and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists it as a Category A Bioterrorism Agent. MARV typically appears in sporadic outbreaks throughout Africa and the virus continues to pose potential public health and biodefense threats. There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics against the diseases caused by MARV.

 About the GeoVax MVA Platform

 GeoVax’s vaccine platform utilizes modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), a large virus capable of carrying several vaccine antigens, that expresses proteins that assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) immunogens in the person receiving the vaccine. The production of VLPs in the person being vaccinated can mimic the virus production that occurs in a natural infection, stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize, prevent, and control the target infection. The MVA-VLP derived vaccines can elicit durable immune responses in the host similar to a live-attenuated virus, while providing the safety characteristics of a replication-defective vector.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
