# Quantum Critical Metals Reports 150 Meters of 38gpt Gallium, 694gpt Rubidium, 72gpt Niobium, 8gpt Cesium, and 9gpt Tantalum from Diamond Drilling at Discovery Project, Quebec

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantum Critical Metals Corp. (TSX.V: LEAP) (OTCQB: ATOXF) (Frankfurt: 86A1) (“Quantum” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has re-examined its drill core assays at its 100% owned Discovery project, located in the Eeyou Istchee (James Bay) region of Québec, and has discovered elevated and consistent intervals of gallium, rubidium, cesium, niobium, and tantalum. Notably, the Company intersected:

 - 37gpt gallium, 936gpt rubidium, 72gpt niobium, 8gpt cesium, and 10gpt tantalum over 30 meters from 9m to 39m.

 - 38gpt gallium, 694gpt rubidium, 72gpt niobium, 8gpt cesium, 9gpt tantalum over 150 meters from 44 to 194 meters.

 - 37gpt gallium, 651gpt rubidium, 57gpt niobium, 15gpt cesium, 11gpt tantalum over 73 meters from 17 to 90 meters.

 - 44gpt gallium, 801gpt rubidium, 66gpt niobium, 16gpt cesium, 36gpt tantalum over 43 meters from 16 to 59 meters.

 The Company’s 2018 and 2022 drill programs totalled approximately 2,432 meters, and 1,696 meters respectively, for a total of 4,128 meters across 22 holes (Figure 1). These programs were originally initiated for gold exploration, but given recent geopolitical developments regarding critical metals, the Company revisited these results to investigate any further potential that may exist than what was originally considered in the past.

 As a function of this review, management believes it has uncovered its second gallium-rubidium-cesium discovery, joining the NMX East gallium-rubidium-cesium project in the Company’s portfolio https://www.quantumcriticalmetals.com/blogs/news/durango-reports-107-68-meters-of-38-85-gpt-gallium-701-gpt-rubidium-24-98-gpt-cesium-and-3-61-gpt-thallium-from-surface-in-diamond-drilling-at-nmx-east-critical-metals-project. The zones containing anomalous gallium, rubidium, cesium, tantalum and niobium were mostly pegmatite dykes, however several intercepts contained metasediments, granite and granophyre rock types. Meanwhile the Company has also identified indicators of a potential VMS system intersecting these results, including anomalous lead-copper-zinc, which management believes also warrant further attention and investigation. The Company is encouraged by these results and will provide more detail once this additional review has been completed.

 Summaries of both these drill program results and the Discovery project are below. Access to the full results are available on the Company’s website at https://www.quantumcriticalmetals.com/pages/discovery-polymetallic-project-quebec

 Assay QA/QC

 Drill core was sawed in half and core samples were collected every 1 metre. Samples were not collected across lithology types. Geological plastic bags were used with sample tags placed inside the bag and the sample ID was written on the outside of the bag using waterproof marker.

 In 2018 the samples were shipped to ALS Canada Ltd in Val D’Or for gold and multi-element analysis. Gold was analysed by fire assay with an ICP-AES finish. Multi elements were analysed by Aqua Regia digestion and ICP-AES.

 In 2022 the samples were sent to Northern Mining Analytical Laboratory (NMAL) in Timmins, Ontario for gold fire assay – atomic absorption spectrometry and gravimetric analysis. The samples were then sent on to Activation Laboratories in Ancaster, Ontario. Samples were digested using sodium peroxide fusion and analysed for trace elements using ICP-OES/MS. For the drilling campaign, a blank, standard and duplicate were inserted every 30 samples.

 A review of the QAQC samples submitted during the drilling campaigns was completed. QAQC samples were submitted every 30 samples in the sample series, alternating between standards, blanks and duplicate order. Review of the results indicates that acceptable levels of error were received from Act Labs for the sets of QAQC samples.

 About the Discovery Project

 The 100% owned Discovery Project spans 6,082 hectares and is located southwest of the past producing Troilus gold and copper mine, as well as the Moblan lithium deposit. The Discovery property is situated in the Frotet-Evans Greenstone belt, a volcanic-sedimentary assemblage which contains a central sedimentary basin. The Discovery property is located in the eastern region of the belt (Simard,1987; Brisson et al.,1997; Brisson et al.,1998 a,b,c). Multiple stages of deformation affected the rocks at Discovery and produced folds with axes of ENE-WSW to EW in orientation and destroy strike slip faults with an E-W trend.

 Several rounds of geophysical surveys (EM and Mag, AMT, Gravity) and soil geochemistry lines were completed on the Discovery property from 2013 to 2017. Exploratory drilling was completed in 2018 and 2022 to try to locate the source of the gold occurrences at surface. In 2014, an exploration campaign was conducted and returned up to 41.6 and 46.6 gpt gold in channels samples located 36 metres apart. Field mapping was completed in 2022, 2023, and 2024.

 The Discovery Property Polymetallic Potential

 The Discovery Project covers an important geological NE-SW regional structure and the Company recognizes this property for its polymetallic potential.

 Gold: found within quartz veins hosted within a metabasalt, up to 46.6 g/pt. Historically, elevated gold contents have been found in veins which appear to have an orange, brown iron-stained appearance and are typically deformed, sheared and locally folded. These veins vary from <1 cm in size up to 1m+ scales. The mineralized veins are known to have a West-East orientation and have a steep dip.

 Critical Metals: While reviewing the historical drill data and assays of the Discovery Property, the geological team noticed anomalous gallium, rubidium, niobium, cesium and tantalum values in the drill core assays. Gallium, rubidium, cesium, tantalum, niobium have been found in 2018 and 2022 drill holes, hosted mostly in pegmatites. Over 50 pegmatites outcrops have been mapped to date on the property. The pegmatites of the property occur in multiple orientations but the majority of large outcrops are found in a NE/SW orientation and NW/SE orientation. Contacts of pegmatites are typically bulbous indicating a deep and relatively hot emplacement setting but are typically sharp and show little evidence of extensive host rock contamination of melt from the pristine pegmatite compositions. Pegmatites are heavily deformed leading to internal flow-like structures which surround large phenocrysts of microclines. Pegmatite emplacement predates quartz vein formation of the region as quartz veins can be seen cross cutting pegmatites at several locations.

 Base Metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb): several zinc soil anomalies, banded magnetite in outcrop, outcrops containing massive and breccia in-fill pyrite and pyrrhotite, and possible Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn anomalies in drill core are also present and require further investigation.
