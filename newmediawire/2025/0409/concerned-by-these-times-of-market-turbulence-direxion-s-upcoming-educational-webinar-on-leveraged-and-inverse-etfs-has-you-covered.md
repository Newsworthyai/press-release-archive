A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

 An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.
