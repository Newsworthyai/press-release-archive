# BTCS Expands Its Block-Building Capabilities To Include Binance Chain Via Strategic Acquisition

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BTCS Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCS), the blockchain infrastructure and technology company aiming to expand the market of fee-based products that run on the Ethereum network, further strengthened its position by adding Binance Chain to its block-building operations.

 With a market cap of around $80 billion, Binance Chain is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market. It is used to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) functions, build decentralized apps or DApps and support non-fungible tokens (NFTs). BTCS says adding Binance Chain to its operations gives it a greater foothold in the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM-based ecosystem.

 Further Strengthening Its Ethereum Chops

 EVM is a decentralized virtual environment that is known for its consistency and security when executing smart contracts and DApps. BTCS was able to add Binance Chain to its block-building operations through the acquisition of TxBoost, a Binance Chain block builder. The acquisition aligns with its strategy of partnering and/or acquiring key players in the Ethereum ecosystem.

 “Builder+ supporting Binance Chain is a natural extension of our Ethereum-focused infrastructure strategy,” Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, said when announcing the expansion. “Given Binance Chain’s roots as a fork of Ethereum and its EVM compatibility, we’re able to leverage components of our existing technology stack to quickly scale, which aligns with our strategic objectives of increasing revenue and improving margins.”

 Builder+ represents the company’s block building operations, utilizing advanced algorithms to construct optimized blocks for on-chain validation designed to maximize validator earnings. It has been driving growth at the company, accounting for about $2.5 million of revenue - more than half of its full-year 2024 revenue.

 “In 2024, BTCS solidified its position as the leading publicly traded Ethereum infrastructure company, pioneering block-building operations at scale,” said the company when reporting fourth quarter and full-year earnings results. “The success of Builder+, which optimizes block construction to maximize transaction fee (gas) revenue, drove record growth, underscoring the strength of both our strategic direction and execution.”

 For the full year 2024, BTCS reported record revenue of $4.1 million, up 204% from $1.3 million for 2023. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $2.3 million was up 612% from the year-ago quarter and 214% higher sequentially. BTCS expects to replicate that success with the addition of Binance Chain to Builder+ and further scale its operations across compatible blockchains.

 Driving Future Revenue Growth

 The addition of Binance Chain to BTCS’ block-building operations supports the company’s goal to achieve full-year 2025 revenue of $20 million, which it laid out in a recent 8-K filing. BTCS believes the addition of Binance Chain along with other ongoing strategic efforts such as its Scaled Validator Implementation Plan, which is designed to boost vertically integrated validator revenue by 10%, its partnership with ETHGas, which unlocks ultra-low-latency scaling on the Ethereum blockchain enabling transaction confirmations that are lightning fast, and it's Staking Protection Plan, which enhances financial stability and operational security for Ethereum blockchain validators, will help it achieve its goal and create shareholder value.

 Founded in 2014, BTCS pioneered Bitcoin mining as the first U.S. public company in the space. Over the years, BTCS has shifted its focus to Ethereum, leveraging its expertise to drive growth in validator node operations and block building. Since shifting to Ethereum, BTCS has become a key participant in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake ecosystem, operating 522 validator nodes.
