 Steve Lilley, Protocase president and co-founder, said, “The best way to bring the work we do to life for the listener is to largely get out of the way and let our customers, partners and heroes share the fascinating details of how they’re changing the world. This is a show about many thrilling and rarely explored corners of the science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing realms, and we’re happy to act as the nexus of such an important conversation.”
