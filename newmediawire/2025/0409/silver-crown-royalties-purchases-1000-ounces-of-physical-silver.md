 Peter Bures, Silver Crown’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We strive to maintain an adequate working capital position of at least six months. We feel it is only prudent as a silver only royalty company to convert a portion of that cash to physical silver. SCRi’s ultimate vision is to provide a vehicle that serves as a hedge against currency devaluation, and we therefore feel it would be hypocritical to have exposure to 100% fiat money. We appreciate that our investors want exposure to silver, not fiat, which they can achieve easily without our assistance. The purchase was made with a cash payment received from PPX effectively converting a cash payment to physical silver bullion delivery.”
