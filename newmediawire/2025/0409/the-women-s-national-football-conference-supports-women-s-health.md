# The Women s National Football Conference supports women s health

(NewMediaWire) - April 09, 2025 - DALLAS — According to the American Heart Association’s 2025 Heart Disease & Stroke Statistical Update, cardiovascular disease remains the greatest health threat for women, yet less than half of women are aware it is their leading cause of death[1]. Additionally, women receive bystander CPR in a public settling less often than men do[2]. That is why today, the American Heart Association and the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC) have teamed up to urge women to take action and champion better health by learning Hands-Only CPR.

 The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, and the WNFC Commissioner’s Office unveiled the seven current WNFC players, who will support efforts to build awareness of heart disease and CPR education in women. The 2025 player ambassador class will amplify public service announcements (PSAs), social media content and local community education events.

 The 2025 player ambassadors are:

 * Lawanda Pearson - Chicago Winds
* Breanne Ward - Seattle Majestics
* Khahina Yisrael - Atlanta Truth
* Natalie Nicks - Mississippi Panthers
* Carolyn Lewis - Washington Prodigy
* Katie Wise - Tennessee Trojans
* Antoinette Van - Texas Elite Spartans

 "We are proud to announce this inspiring collaboration between the WNFC and the American Heart Association,” said WNFC Commissioner Janice Masters. “Our league is built on the strength, determination and leadership of our athletes, qualities that align perfectly with the American Heart Association’s mission to improve heart health and save lives. Having WNFC athletes serve as ambassadors for the Association is a testament not only to their commitment on the field, but also to their dedication to making a meaningful impact in their communities. Together, we are championing heart health awareness and empowering people to live longer, healthier lives."

 The WNFC’s commitment to CPR education and the health of the league’s players is demonstrated in the coaching requirements. All the nearly 200 coaches on the field are required to be certified in CPR, AED and first aid. By ensuring every coach is equipped with life-saving skills, the WNFC sets a high standard for health and safety in sports, demonstrating its leadership both on and off the field. The league’s dedication to player safety and overall well-being is supported both on and off the field through efforts like the player ambassadors.

 “We continue our mission-critical work asking our sisters, mothers, daughters and friends to join us and make bold moves to reach our goals—so that everyone, everywhere can live their healthiest lives,” said Nancy Brown chief executive officer at the American Heart Association. “We are proud to work with the Women’s National Football Conference as both organizations are working to meet people where they are to change the future of health for women everywhere.”

 Since 2004, the American Heart Association has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps of women’s greatest health threat, cardiovascular disease (CVD) through its Go Red for Women™ movement, meeting the evolving needs of women now, and at every age, every stage and every season of their lives as their trusted, relevant source for credible, heart and brain health solutions.

 This is the latest player ambassador announcement by the American Heart Association. The roster of Nation of Lifesavers Player Ambassadors also features current National Football League (NFL) players and NBA/NBA G League players. The Nation of Lifesavers Player Ambassadors are led by cardiac arrest survivor and Buffalo Bills safety, Damar Hamlin.
