# AXIM Biotechnologies Announces Exclusive Latin America License &amp; Distribution Agreement With JK Medical for TearScan® Ocular Diagnostic Tests

Countries: Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia

 SAN DIEGO, CA - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. (OTC: AXIM), a diagnostics company focused on rapid, point-of-care ophthalmic testing, today announced it has entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement with JK Medical, Inc. (“JK Medical”) initially covering seven Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia. Under the agreement, JK Medical will market and distribute AXIM’s TearScan® Lactoferrin Diagnostic Test for aiding in the diagnosis of aqueous-deficient Dry Eye Disease (DED) and the TearScan® IgE Diagnostic Test for aiding in the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis within the covered territory.

 The collaboration pairs AXIM’s pioneering lateral-flow diagnostics with JK Medical’s regional market access and commercialization capabilities to accelerate adoption of point-of-care ocular testing across Latin America.

 “This partnership represents a major step in expanding access to rapid, clinic-friendly ocular diagnostics throughout Latin America,” said Catalina Valencia, CEO of AXIM Biotechnologies. “By combining AXIM’s TearScan® portfolio with JK Medical’s established footprint, we can support eye-care professionals with objective biomarkers that complement clinical evaluation for DED and ocular allergy.”

 “We’re proud to partner with AXIM to bring innovative, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostics to our ophthalmology and optometry customers,” said Juan Carlos Torres, CEO of JK Medical, Inc. “Latin America’s providers are eager for in-office tools that can streamline diagnosis and guide treatment decisions for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis.”

 Agreement Highlights

 • Exclusivity: JK Medical receives exclusive rights to market and distribute TearScan® tests across Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia. Under the Agreement, a 4 year period of exclusivity commences once regulatory approval is obtained in 2 out of the 7 countries with the exception of Chile where commercialization can occur immediately.

 • Portfolio Coverage: TearScan® Lactoferrin Diagnostic Test and TearScan® IgE Diagnostic Test.

 • Market Access & Commercialization: JK Medical to lead distribution, education, onboarding; AXIM to provide product supply, training, and technical support.

 • Regulatory Pathways: Collaboration on country-specific registrations and compliance activities.

 About Dry Eye Disease

 Unmet Need in Dry Eye DiagnosisDry Eye Disease (DED) affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide, including tens of millions across Latin America. Clinicians face challenges in differentiating between aqueous-deficient DED (ADDE) - where the lacrimal glands do not produce enough tears - and evaporative DED (EDE), where tears evaporate too quickly due to meibomian gland dysfunction. Beyond ADDE and EDE, there is a third critical question: is there an allergic component?

 Visual Inspection Insufficient to Diagnose DED

 While visual inspection is part of the process, it has significant limitations for diagnosing dry eye. Visual cues alone cannot determine whether the cause is meibomian gland dysfunction (EDE or evaporative dry eye), inadequate tear production (ADDE or aqueous deficient dry eye), or a combination of both. Some patients may not have obvious visual signs but still experience significant symptoms. Conversely, some patients may show visual signs of damage, such as staining, but not report symptoms.

 AXIM’s Diagnostic Approach

 By testing for Lactoferrin levels, the clinician can determine whether the patient has ADDE if Lf levels are below normal. If, however, Lactoferrin levels are normal, the clinician can then test IgE levels for allergic conjunctivitis. If IgE levels are normal, then by process of elimination, the DED may be due to EDE, prompting the clinician to undertake additional targeted testing. It is advisable to administer both tests because DED being multifactorial, a patient may have a combination of conditions.

 These two point-of-care, inexpensive and rapid tests, thus, provide the clinician with tools to diagnose ADDE and allergic conjunctivitis very quickly and by process of elimination further testing for EDE may be indicated. Since each of these conditions requires different treatment approaches, rapid, point-of-care tools are essential.

 AXIM’s TearScan® portfolio is the only point-of-care solution that enables eye-care professionals to:

 * Identify whether a patient has ADDE, allergy, or a combination of these conditions.
* Make the correct differential diagnosis at the first visit.
* Select targeted therapies and track treatment efficacy over time.

 With TearScan® Lactoferrin (Lf) and TearScan® IgE tests, physicians can save valuable chair time while giving patients faster, more accurate answers. These diagnostics are quickly becoming the primary front-line tools in dry eye and ocular allergy care.
