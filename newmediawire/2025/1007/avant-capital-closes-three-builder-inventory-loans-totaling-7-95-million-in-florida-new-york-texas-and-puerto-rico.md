NEW CANAAN, CT - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Avant Capital (“Avant”), a leading Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, today announced that it has closed three separate builder inventory loans totaling $7,950,000. The loans, secured by condominium, co-op and residential portfolios across Florida, New York, Texas and Puerto Rico, reflect Avant’s continued focus on providing flexible capital solutions for sponsors with individually deeded residential assets.

 The transactions include:

 * Jacaranda Trace Condo Portfolio - Venice, FL: A $4,100,000 bridge loan secured by 21 condominium units within a 55+ active adult community. The borrower, LifeStar Living, plans to renovate the units and market them under Life Lease agreements. The sponsor is led by a longtime sports agent and one of the most influential figures in NBA history.
* Capital Associates Co-op Portfolio - New York, NY: A $2,500,000 bridge loan secured by 10 sponsor-owned cooperative units located across three Manhattan buildings on the Upper West Side, NoMad, and Midtown East. The sponsor brings more than 45 years of experience in the New York real estate market and a portfolio, exceeding 2,000 multifamily apartments and 1 million square feet of commercial space.
* Mystic Meadow & Rio Mar Villas - Houston, TX & Rio Grande, PR: A $1,350,000 bridge loan secured by a luxury single-family residence in Houston’s Hermann Lake community and three resort condominiums located within the Wyndham Rio Mar resort in Puerto Rico. Two of the Villas are operated as short-term rentals, providing immediate income support.

 “These transactions highlight Avant’s bread-and-butter - providing inventory loans secured by condo portfolios, co-op shares and residential units that sponsors are leasing, repositioning, or preparing for sale,” said Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant. “We continue to deliver flexible capital solutions that support experienced sponsors with high-quality residential inventory nationwide.”

 In 2025, Avant is targeting bridge loan opportunities ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide, with a focus on multifamily, senior housing, residential portfolios and industrial assets across high-growth markets such as Florida, Texas, New York, North Carolina and Georgia. The company also acquires non-performing loans secured by commercial real estate.
