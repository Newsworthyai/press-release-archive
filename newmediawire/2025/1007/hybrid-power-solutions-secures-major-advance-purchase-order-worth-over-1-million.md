 HPS Spark: Portable Fuel-Free Power Solution

 Key Features and Specifications:

 Power and Energy Capacity: Delivers up to 48,000W of peak power and 30kWh of energy storage, enabling it to handle demanding loads such as site trailers, welding equipment, or heavy-duty tools.

 Hybrid and All-Electric Modes:

 * All-electric model provides net-zero emissions, fully offsetting fuel needs when paired with solar panels.
* Hybrid model integrates with existing generators, reducing fuel costs by up to 75% during off-grid or round-the-clock operations.

 Portability and Durability: Compact, towable design built for rugged environments; proudly engineered and assembled in Canada for reliability in extreme conditions.

 Environmental and Cost Benefits: Eliminates diesel exhaust, noise, and maintenance hassles, supporting sustainability goals while lowering operational expenses through solar recharging and minimal downtime.

 Applications: Ideal for remote job sites, urban maintenance (e.g., powering equipment underground without emissions), and fleet electrification. Recent deployments include trials with major Canadian transit agencies, where it has enabled extended work shifts by replacing noisy diesel units.

 HPS Terra: Scalable Battery Energy Storage MicroGrid

 Key Features and Specifications:

 Power and Scalability: Rated at 167kVA continuous output, with expandable architecture for larger systems. It combines battery storage with seamless integration for solar, wind, or traditional generators.

 Hybrid Integration: Excels in hybrid configurations, storing excess renewable energy (e.g., from solar panels) for on-demand use, even in low-light conditions. This ensures reliable power 24/7 without full reliance on fossil fuels.

 Portability and Versatility: Mobile microgrid format suitable for containerized deployment; supports on-grid, off-grid, and backup roles with advanced monitoring for remote control.

 Durability and Efficiency: Engineered for harsh industrial environments, featuring robust thermal management, safety protocols, and longevity to minimize downtime.

 Applications: Powers major infrastructure projects, such as underground transit upgrades or remote construction sites. For instance, a Canadian transit operator used Terra systems to gain an extra hour of daily productivity by switching from diesel generators. It's also positioned for expansion into mining, rail, and marine sectors.
