# CHARBONE Hydrogen Secures Harnois Energies' Hydrogen Assets to Accelerate Clean Ultra High Purity Hydrogen Production at Sorel-Tracy

BROSSARD, QUEBEC - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CHARBONE HYDROGEN CORPORATION (TSXV: CH; OTCQB: CHHYF; FSE: K47) (“CHARBONE” or the “Company”), a company dedicated to building a North America’s first clean Ultra High Purity (“UHP”) hydrogen production and distribution network, is pleased to announce that it has officially taken possession of hydrogen production and refuelling assets from Harnois Energies Inc. (“Harnois”).

 This strategic transaction will enable CHARBONE to rapidly relocate and repurpose proven hydrogen production equipment at its flagship Sorel-Tracy facility, allowing for the first production of clean UHP hydrogen by early Q4 2025. By utilizing proven, already operational assets, CHARBONE expects to significantly reduce capital installation costs and accelerate time-to-market compared to deploying new systems.

 Further to CHARBONE’s announcement made on September 5, 2025, under the terms of the agreement, CHARBONE has issued 13,333,334 common shares at $0.075 per share, representing $1 million in equity consideration to Harnois. Additional cash payments will be made in staged tranches over two years, preserving capital for growth initiatives.

 Importantly, Harnois elected to receive a substantial portion of the consideration in CHARBONE equity at market value. This decision underscores Harnois’ recognition of the strategic long-term benefits of aligning with CHARBONE as Quebec’s leading clean UHP hydrogen supplier, while Harnois continues to focus on its core energy distribution businesses.

 “This is a transformative moment for CHARBONE,” said Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE. “With these assets, we will begin producing clean UHP hydrogen in Sorel-Tracy much sooner than anticipated, while optimizing capital efficiency. We are proud to welcome Harnois as a shareholder in the capital of CHARBONE.”
