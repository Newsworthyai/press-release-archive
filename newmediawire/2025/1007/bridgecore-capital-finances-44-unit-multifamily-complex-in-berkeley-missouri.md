# BridgeCore Capital Finances 44-Unit Multifamily Complex In Berkeley, Missouri

BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF. - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BridgeCore Capital, Inc. today announced it has closed a $1,800,000 refinance of a 44-unit, two-story, 1957-vintage, multifamily complex in Berkeley, Missouri.

 The borrower sought to extricate itself from an existing loan as quickly as possible due to multiple technical defaults resulting from complexities with the existing agency lender. BridgeCore harnessed its comprehensive resources and experience to meet a critical timing challenge, solving the borrower’s insurance and entity-related specifications, while providing highly competitive loan terms.

 BridgeCore coordinated directly with the mortgage advisory team and title company to close the transaction within the expedited timeframe, allowing the borrower to avoid accruing additional default interest and to pursue its business plan by freeing itself from countless servicing impediments.

 BridgeCore also employed a practical and creative approach to solve a number of unexpected ancillary issues that arose during the course of the due diligence and closing process. These included removal of one of the guarantors, adjusting the insurance coverage period at loan commencement, and restructuring an entity certification into a written consent.
