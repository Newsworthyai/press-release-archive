# NeuralBase Expands Global Footprint With New Headquarters in Dubai, Provides Update on Name Change and Forward Split

LAS VEGAS, NV - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), now known as BMP AI Technologies Inc., an innovator in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and automation systems, is proud to announce the opening of a new regional office in Dubai, which reflects the Company’s global expansion strategy and its commitment to advancing next-generation enterprise technologies.

 The new Dubai office marks a significant step in BMP AI’s mission to establish a strong presence in the Middle East, a region rapidly emerging as a global hub for innovation, digital transformation, and smart infrastructure. The office will serve as a regional hub for research, development, and client engagement, supporting the Company’s growing portfolio of enterprise AI and blockchain solutions across healthcare, fintech, education, and government sectors.

 "Dubai’s ecosystem offers unmatched access to global talent, forward-thinking regulation, and a gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa,” stated Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of BMP AI Technologies Inc. "Establishing a physical presence here allows us to collaborate more closely with partners, accelerate deployments, and bring our next-generation AI and blockchain products to a wider market."

 On a separate note, on July 24, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors approved changing the Company’s name from NeuralBase AI Ltd. to BMP AI Technologies Inc. to better reflect its expanding technological focus and global operations. Further, on September 9, 2025, the Company declared a 5-for-1 forward split of its common stock, setting a record date of September 26, 2025. As with all corporate actions, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) must review and declare each of the name change and the split effective.

 “Both the name change and the split require an application to FINRA, are processed in order of submission and undergo a lengthy review process before market effectiveness,” added Dobale. “We submitted our name change application first, and our lawyers have advised that they believe that we are in the final stages of receiving FINRA clearance on our name change to BMP AI, which we expect will come over the next few days.”

 "Upon market effectiveness of our name change to BMP AI, our lawyers have advised that they will request for FINRA to declare a payment date for the split as soon as possible thereafter. We are, however, subject to FINRA and their processing times for both the name change and the split."
