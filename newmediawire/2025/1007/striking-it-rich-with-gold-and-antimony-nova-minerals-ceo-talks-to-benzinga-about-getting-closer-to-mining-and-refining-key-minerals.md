# Striking It Rich With Gold And Antimony: Nova Minerals CEO Talks To Benzinga About Getting Closer To Mining And Refining Key Minerals

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - October 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Christopher Gerteisen, the CEO of Nova Minerals Ltd. (NASDAQ: NVA), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All Access.

 Nova Minerals is a gold, antimony and critical minerals exploration and development company focused on advancing the Estelle Project, which comprises 514 km2 of Alaska mining claims. It contains multiple mining complexes across a 35 km long mineralized corridor of over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects, including two already defined multi-million ounce resources and several drill-ready Antimony prospects. The company is working on a feasibility study and has defined almost 10 million ounces of gold.

 “Our objective is to get something out to market sometime next year on the gold side,” Gerteisen told Benzinga in the interview. In addition to the two gold projects, Gerteisen said there are twenty other prospects at the site that they are seeing gold, copper, silver and antimony in. That last one is a big opportunity for Nova Minerals, one that is seeing a lot of interest from the Department of Defense, said Gerteisen.

 Antimony is used in “cleantech, greentech, hightech” and munitions, and is not produced anywhere in the U.S., Gerteisen told Benzinga. As it stands, Russia and China are the only producers and have been shutting the U.S. out. That has heightened the Department of Defense’s interest in producing antimony on U.S. soil. “We’ve been a real first mover in bringing that production back to the U.S.,” said Gerteisen, noting the company is in the advanced stage of getting a non-dilutive grant from the Department of Defense to fast-track the production of antimony.
