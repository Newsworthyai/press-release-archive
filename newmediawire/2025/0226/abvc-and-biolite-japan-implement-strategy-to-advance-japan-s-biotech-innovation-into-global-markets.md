# ABVC and BioLite Japan Implement Strategy to Advance Japan's Biotech Innovation Into Global Markets

FREMONT, CA - February 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on innovative treatments in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous system), and oncology/hematology, announces a new strategy with its joint venture partner, BioLite Japan. The parties aim to accelerate the growth of Japan's biotechnology industry by facilitating access to Taiwan’s capital market and leveraging cutting-edge AI resources for advanced development.

 Empowering Japan's Biotech Startups

 Japan’s biotech industry is valued at over $120 billion, with over 3,000 biotech startups seeking opportunities to expand globally. [1] BioLite Japan seeks to identify high-potential Japanese biotech innovations and guide them through the complex process of international expansion. This includes helping them to secure capital, navigate regulatory frameworks, and form strategic partnerships across Asia and the United States.

 Taiwan: A Gateway to Growth

 Taiwan’s biomedical sector, valued at $23.5 billion[2], offers a strong foundation for biotech companies looking to expand. BioLite Japan will assist Japanese biotech firms trying to enter Taiwan’s thriving biomedical landscape, including the prestigious Hsinchu Biomedical Park. Taiwan’s AI-driven healthcare sector, which is growing at 15% annually, will be instrumental in accelerating drug discovery and biotech innovation.

 Silicon Valley: The Manufacturing Hub

 To further strengthen the value chain, ABVC will provide manufacturing support through its wholly owned subsidiary, BioKey, Inc., located in Silicon Valley, California. The GMP-certified facility will serve as the primary production base, to help ensure high-quality biotech manufacturing. The global biotech contract manufacturing market, currently estimated at $150 billion, presents a major opportunity for companies leveraging state-of-the-art U.S.-based facilities.[3]

 “This strategic plan is expected to help expand ABVC’s global footprint,” said Uttam Patil, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of ABVC. “By bridging Japan’s cutting-edge biotech innovations with Taiwan’s AI resources and our manufacturing strength in Silicon Valley, we believe we will establish a seamless ecosystem for biotech advancement. "Our experience navigating the FDA regulatory landscape positions us as a strong partner in the joint venture. With a proven track record of advancing clinical-stage programs through regulatory approvals, we bring valuable expertise to accelerate innovative therapies' development and commercialization. This collaboration will leverage our deep regulatory insights to help provide streamlined and efficient pathway to market success."

 Toru Jay Seo, Ph.D., CEO of BioLite Japan and former Worldwide Business Development, Chief Business Officer of Pfizer Inc., echoed this enthusiasm:

 “We are excited to collaborate with ABVC to provide Japanese biotech startups with a clear pathway to international success. By leveraging Taiwan’s capital market and AI-driven technologies alongside BioKey’s manufacturing capabilities in Silicon Valley, we believe we can build a comprehensive value chain that accelerates innovation and global market entry for Japan’s most promising biotech companies. Through this collaboration and expertise of the parties, Biolite Japan will execute an initiative to promote JP biotechs for global expansion.”

 Looking Ahead

 Through this strategic alliance, ABVC and BioLite Japan aim to position biotech startups in Japan for success in international markets. We believe the partnership offers a comprehensive pathway for biotech innovation to thrive globally.
