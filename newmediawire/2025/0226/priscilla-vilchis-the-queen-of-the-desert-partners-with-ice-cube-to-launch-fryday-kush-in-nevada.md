 The product line includes flower, pre-rolls, blunts, vaporizers and more, and will be available on Nevada dispensary shelves March 2025. The partnership was recently featured in Javier Hasse’s Forbes article,  “Why Ice Cube Ditched Alcohol—And Built A Cannabis Brand Instead: ‘Once I Found Good Weed, That Was It.” In the article, Hasse highlights how Ice Cube and Vilchis share a dedication to top-shelf cannabis, which carried over into the development of Fryday Kush.

 “Partnering with Ice Cube to bring Fryday Kush to Nevada is an exciting milestone for both Premium Produce and the cannabis industry as a whole,” said Priscilla Vilchis, CEO, Premium Produce. “Both Ice Cube and I share a strong drive and unwavering commitment to integrity, which makes this collaboration even more meaningful. As we continue to expand our celebrity portfolio, we are proud to provide our expertise in quality and distribution to help launch iconic brands like Fryday Kush. This partnership exemplifies our dedication to innovation and excellence, and we look forward to building upon the strong foundation we’ve laid in Nevada, California, and beyond.”

 Premium Produce, also known as “REINA,” oversees operations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Lynwood, California, as well as delivery and distribution licenses in California. A trailblazer in the industry, Vilchis became the first licensed female minority in Los Angeles County and the youngest female minority licensed in Nevada. Vilchis was one of the initial CEOs to secure preliminary licenses from the City of Lynwood, California, granting approval to cultivate and manufacture recreational cannabis in The Golden State.

 Vilchis has a track record of success in Nevada, including past collaborations with cultural icons Lil’ Kim, Hulk Hogan, Lil Wayne, and Ric Flair to launch their brands. Her deep understanding of the market and her unwavering commitment to quality position this partnership for success.

 The venture is being led in conjunction with Budding Equities, which owns and licenses intellectual property through contracts with movie studios and celebrities. Premium Produce is one of Nevada’s premier cannabis companies, and will oversee the manufacturing and distribution of Budding Equities’ joint venture brands, including with Ice Cube to kick off the new year.

 Adding to its growing celebrity portfolio, Premium Produce will also manufacture and distribute Budding Equities’ Jay and Silent Bob (JSB) and Pineapple Express cannabis brands, partnering to launch Budding Equities’ full portfolio of premium cannabis brands in Nevada and further solidifying its role as a key partner in high-profile collaborations.
