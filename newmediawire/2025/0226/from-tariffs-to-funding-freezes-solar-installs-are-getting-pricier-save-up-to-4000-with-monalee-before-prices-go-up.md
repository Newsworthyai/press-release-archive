# From Tariffs To Funding Freezes, Solar Installs Are Getting Pricier: Save Up To $4000 With Monalee Before Prices Go Up

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - February 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Solar Prices Rise March 1st! Lock in up to $4,000 OFF before tariffs increase. Get instant, transparent pricing today!

 The solar market in the U.S. is in a state of flux. Despite pro-solar legislation, namely the Inflation Reduction Act put on the books during the Biden Administration, the cost to install solar panels is poised to rise this year and beyond. Monalee, a climate tech company helping accelerate the adoption of solar, wants to help homeowners save before prices reset.

 Thanks to its technology-first approach, Monalee says customers can lock in the price of their solar panel system and save as much as $4,000.

 There are several reasons why solar prices will increase in the days and weeks to come. Take tariffs for starters. The Trump Administration recently slapped a 10% tariff on all products coming from China and has threatened Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on imported goods. While the latter two are delayed, even the prospect that they could go into effect is raising prices on the equipment and materials needed to install solar on residential rooftops.

 It doesn’t help that Trump has already implemented tariffs on several goods needed in the solar industry the last time he was president, and the new ones are on top of that. Consumers bear the brunt of tariffs as higher costs are passed on to them. In solar they could end up paying thousands of dollars more for a rooftop system.

 But not with Monalee, if customers act soon. Monalee says it’s able to secure the same solar panel systems at a lower price compared to the top traditional solar companies in the U.S. thanks to its technology, which cuts the middleman out of the equation. With Monalee there aren’t any high sales commissions, fuzzy pricing or rigid plans. You can customize your solar and payment plan, and get access to premium equipment and a lifetime warranty – something that isn’t common in the residential solar marketplace.

 Inflation Reduction Act At Risk

 It’s not just tariffs that could raise prices of solar in the coming weeks. The Inflation Reduction Act, which has been a boon for the solar industry thanks to a $369 billion investment in clean energy and tax credits of up to 30% for homeowners and businesses that install solar, is at risk from the current administration. While President Trump hasn’t said he would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act in its entirety, the Trump Administration has signaled it could scale back pieces of the legislation, including subsidies, and has already taken steps to freeze some of the funding. That would mean homeowners could lose thousands of dollars in incentives and savings on green energy in the near future.

 It also means homeowners who were on the fence or planned to install solar down the road may want to consider acting now, before the savings disappear. As of now homeowners can still get the tax break under the Inflation Reduction Act. Plus they have a little time left before the impact of tariffs is felt. But time is running out, which is why it behooves consumers to work with a solar panel company that can get it done quickly, not delaying the installation for months.

 No high sales commissions, just premium solar at competitive prices. Customize your system and save up to $4,000 before March 1st!

 Monalee Gets The Job Done Quickly

 Monalee checks that box. Unlike many of its rivals, Monalee leverages advanced machine learning to give customers the best solar design based on their homes and needs – and it does it in minutes. Anyone can go to their site, enter their home address and receive an accurate solar quote in less than 10 seconds. Through Monalee’s state-of-the-art design platform, you know exactly how many panels you’ll need, the best layout to maximize sun exposure and the bottom line cost including discounts and rebates before you sign up. And Monalee does all that at what it says is a discount to rivals.

 Save Before It’s Too Late

 To sweeten the pot Monalee is offering deals and discounts before the tariffs set in and federal government incentives potentially go away:Solar Only*

 5.2 - 7.2 kW Receive Up to $700 OFF

 7.2 - 10 kW Receive Up to $1,500 OFF

 Above 10 kW Receive Up to $2,000 OFF

 That’s in addition to the savings Monalee offers by cutting out the middleman and relying on technology to design the solar layout.

 To make it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, the company recently partnered with GoodLeap, the fintech company that provides financing options for residential solar and sustainable home improvements. GoodLeap is just one of the companies Monalee customers can finance their purchases with.

 Solar is feeling the brunt of the new administration’s approach to trade and government programs but that doesn’t mean all of the benefits of this green energy go out the window. By installing solar panels homeowners can reduce their monthly energy bill and do their part to stop global warming.
