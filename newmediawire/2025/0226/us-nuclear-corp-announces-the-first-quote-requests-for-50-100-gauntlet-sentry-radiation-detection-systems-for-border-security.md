# US Nuclear Corp. Announces the First Quote Requests for 50-100 Gauntlet Sentry Radiation Detection Systems for Border Security

LOS ANGELES, CA - February 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - US Nuclear Corp.  (OTC: UCLE), is pleased to announce that the Company has begun to quote on price and delivery for up to 80 Gauntlet Sentry Radiation Detection Systems for a border state, which has Nuclear Reactor sites as well. “The recent press release for the launch of the Gauntlet Sentry Radiation Detection System has attracted a lot of attention,” said Bob Goldstein, President of US Nuclear. “The system can also detect explosives, and can be modified to detect Tritium, which is being used in the development of nuclear fusion. It’s perfect for border security, as well as security for government buildings and military installations.”

 “The Overhoff Technology division has also seen a dramatic increase in order inquiries over the last month,” said Operations manager Nikki Truax. “Last week we closed on an order for 10 400SB and 15 357Rm Tritium air monitors, with a total value of approximately $500k, for 2nd quarter delivery.”

 “The Company is also pleased to report that it’s in advanced talks with a merger candidate that could add approximately $4-5M in annual revenues, along with $1-1.5m in net income,” said Mr. Goldstein. “The deal could be consummated in the 2nd quarter, if the target company passes due-diligence.”

 “The previously announced consolidation of our Los Angeles operations with our Overhoff Ohio operation is progressing smoothly, and is more than 50% complete,” said Mr. Goldstein. “Our expenses estimated for February will be $30-40k less than January, with another $30-40k in March! When the move is fully completed by months-end, these cost reductions will save the Company $60-80k per month, or almost $1 million annually, equating to $.02 per share!”
