# Hippos, LLC's Cultivation and Manufacturing Division OG Yields Introduces Cannabis Brand 'Hugs'

New Product Line to Provide Relief and Comfort to Missouri’s Medical & Recreational Cannabis Communities

 VIENNA, MO - February 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hippos, LLC, Missouri’s premier cannabis company with retail locations statewide and award-winning brands produced by its OG Yields division, is proud to announce the launch of its newest brand, Hugs. With a profound commitment to improving the lives of individuals seeking relief from daily discomfort, Hugs is poised to revolutionize the cannabis landscape in the state of Missouri. Hugs, with its poignant tagline "Hugs Help," represents more than just a product line; it embodies compassion, support, and a dedication to wellness.

 The Hugs line launches with its new line of THC-containing topical products, specifically formulated to provide localized relief without any psychoactive effects. Unlike THC products that are ingested or inhaled, which enter the bloodstream and can produce a psychoactive "high," Hugs topicals are applied directly to the skin. When applied this way, THC interacts with receptors in the skin, but does not reach the bloodstream in significant amounts. This means that the topical is able to provide targeted relief without affecting mental clarity or cognition. Whether consumers are looking for relief after a workout, to soothe localized discomfort, or to care for their skin, Hugs topicals product line offers a soothing non-intoxicating option.

 As part of the brand launch, Hippos is introducing its meticulously crafted Cannabis Salve, a harmonious blend of emu oil, THC, and essential oils designed to support not just relief but a holistic approach to skin health and discomfort.

 Hugs Cannabis Salve Ingredients and Benefits:

 * Emu Oil: Provides deep skin moisturization and enhances therapeutic effects for superior relief.
* Cannabis (THC) Distillate: Delivers targeted, localized pain relief.
* Lavender, Chamomile, & Helichrysum Essential Oils: A powerful blend offering anti-inflammatory properties, skin regeneration, and a calming aroma.
* Beeswax: Creates a protective barrier that locks in moisture and essential nutrients.

 "At Hippos Cannabis, we believe in the transformative power of cannabis to enhance lives and alleviate discomfort," said Nicholas Rinella, CEO of Hippos Cannabis. "With Hugs, we’re extending our commitment to serving the diverse needs of Missouri's cannabis industry by offering high-quality products designed to provide comfort and relief in their daily lives."

 Whether you’re dealing with life’s everyday challenges or simply seeking balance, Hugs provides a natural, plant-based option that may provide relief. Hugs will continue to expand its product offering throughout 2025, introducing new solutions to address the evolving needs of Missouri’s cannabis industry.

 The dynamic new brand is available for purchase at all Hippos’ dispensary locations, marking a significant milestone in Hippos' mission to redefine the standards of quality and care.
