# United Health Products Provides Update on FDA and OTC Markets Applications

MT. LAUREL, NJ - March 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - United Health Products, Inc. (OTCPK: UEEC) today provided an update on the company’s regulatory and capital markets activities.

 As previously disclosed, the FDA requested that certain additional sterilization and biotoxicity tests be included in the company’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. An IDE approval is a precondition to commencing the enrollment of 27 patients in UHP’s supplemental clinical study. The company has received the results of these tests which confirm that the sterility and biocompatibility of its CelluSTAT Hemostatic Gause meet the applicable product safety requirements for a Class III, absorbable medical device. UHP has submitted these results to the FDA as part of its revised IDE application.

 Separately, in response to UHP’s application for an uplisting of its common shares to be quoted on the OTCQB market, OTC Markets requested certain additional information from the company. This information has now been made available, allowing OTC Markets to complete its review of the application.

 There can be no assurance that the FDA Premarket Approval or the OTCQB uplisting applications will be granted.
