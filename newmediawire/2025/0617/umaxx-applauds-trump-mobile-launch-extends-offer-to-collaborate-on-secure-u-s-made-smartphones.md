# UMAXX Applauds Trump Mobile Launch, Extends Offer to Collaborate on Secure U.S.-Made Smartphones

Liberty Phones Are Ready Now and Built to Deliver on the Promise of Privacy, Security, and American Manufacturing

 FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA - June 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - UMAXX, a U.S.-based entertainment and communications brand offering privacy-first smartphones, internet, and live TV services, today issued a statement of support following the Trump Organization’s announcement of its new mobile phone initiative.

 The company praised the move as “a major step forward for American digital sovereignty,” and extended an open invitation to the Trump team to collaborate using UMAXX’s existing line of fully U.S.-assembled, privacy-first smartphones.

 “We congratulate the Trump team on recognizing the importance of protecting Americans from the unchecked surveillance of Big Tech and bringing and keeping manufacturing of technology here in the United States,” said Jim Devericks, CEO of SuperCloud International, parent company of the UMAXX brand. “This is a movement we’ve been leading for years - and we believe our Liberty Phones are perfectly aligned with the Trump Mobile vision.”

 UMAXX launched its Liberty and Liberty Plus smartphones in late 2024, and they are available to consumers today. Built with U.S.-sourced components and assembled domestically, the Liberty Plus is one of the only smartphones in the world that offers true hardware-level privacy protections -featuring physical kill switches to disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, camera, and microphone access. Running on PureOS, an open-source operating system purpose-built to eliminate hidden tracking and spyware, the Liberty line is compatible with all major carriers, including UMAXX’s own global service and, most likely, the new Trump Mobile network, via SIM. While others are just beginning to explore privacy-first devices, Liberty Plus is already delivering on that promise.

 Additionally, each Liberty Phone also comes preloaded with UMAXX’s award-winning live TV service, offering over 350 HD channels as part of an all-in-one, secure mobile, internet, and entertainment experience.

 “Building a secure, American-made smartphone is no easy task,” Devericks added. “We know, because we’ve done it. The Liberty Phone platform is tested, proven, and shipping now - and we’d be proud to see it support the Trump Mobile mission.”

 UMAXX confirmed that it had held early discussions with members of the Trump Organization regarding Liberty Phones in 2024.

 “Our door remains open,” said Devericks. “We’d welcome the opportunity to supply Liberty Phones as part of a broader push to give Americans the digital freedom they deserve.”

 Liberty Phones are available now through UMAXXLibertyPhones.com, with plans starting at $99/month for unlimited talk, text, and 22GB of high-speed data on UMAXX’s secure, private 5G network.
