# Carolindica Launches Hemp-Derived Nano THC Pops, A Flexible Ice Pop Treat in Six Fruity Flavors

Freezeable, Drinkable, Mixable THC Pops Are a Chill New Way to Beat the Heat and Elevate the Summer Experience

 RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA - June 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Carolindica, a North Carolina-based hemp industry leader of high-quality hemp-derived wellness products, is turning up the heat and increasing the chill factor with the launch of its new hemp-derived Nano THC Pops, a nostalgic and refreshing way to enjoy infused wellness treats this summer.

 Crafted for adults 21+ with both comfort and fun in mind, plus just the right amount of summertime nostalgia, these infused freeze pops blend bold summer flavors with potent focused effects. Each fruit-flavored ice pop delivers a dose of hemp-derived Delta-9, making them a perfect choice for adult consumers looking for a convenient, discreet, and fun format to enjoy their edibles. The rapid onset of nano-emulsified Delta-9 THC offers a fast-acting, deliciously cool experience for personal wellness and recreational social use during summer activities.

 “We wanted to create something playful that also speaks to the quality and type of experience our customers expect,” said Chris Karazin, Founder of Carolindica. “Most products are focused entirely on the effects of cannabinoids, while we wanted to bring a more immersive experience that not only feels great, but tastes great as well. These ice pops combine cutting-edge nano-emulsion technology with the joy of summer while offering an accessible format for a unique social experience that fits in with the heat of the season.”

 Carolindica's new Nano THC Pops provide:

 * A flexible edible that is freezeable, drinkable, or mixable
* 10mg (with 20mg CBD), 25mg, 50mg, or 100mg doses of fast-acting Delta-9 THC
* Nano-emulsified THC for rapid absorption
* Summer nostalgia in a random selection of vibrant, fruity flavors: Blue Raspberry, Fruit Punch, Grape, Lime, Strawberry, & Tangerine
* Purity, potency, and safety guarantee through third-party lab testing

 Carolindica’s innovative products are in response to the growing demand for alternative cannabis formats that prioritize both a comfortable experience and accessible ease of use. Carolindica’s THC pops stand out in the increasingly crowded edible market by tapping into consumer nostalgia and innovation by offering a low-key, summer-ready alternative to traditional edibles, beverages, and vapes.

 As individual states, plus the U.S. House, continues debating the future legality of hemp-derived THC, Carolindica remains committed to setting the gold standard for safety, transparency, and product integrity. They lead the hemp industry as experts in responsible and safe intoxicating hemp usage.

 “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the hemp space right now, but that’s exactly why we keep innovating and stand behind our commitment to responsible usage,” said Karazin. “We believe in safe access, smart regulation based on science, and creating consistently unique products that bring wellness and enjoyment to our consumers’ lives.”

 Carolindica’s Nano THC Pops are available now at www.carolindica.com and in select retail partners nationwide.
