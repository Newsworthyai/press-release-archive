# American Heart Association announces new volunteer leaders for 2025-26

(NewMediaWire) - July 01, 2025 - DALLAS — The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, has named its volunteer leadership for fiscal year 2025-26. Beginning July 1, Lee A. Shapiro, J.D., a Florida-based financial expert in health technology, will start the first of a two-year term as volunteer board chairperson and Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, a New York City-based cardiologist, will start a one-year term as the new volunteer president. Both are long-time volunteer leaders for the American Heart Association and have served on numerous boards and committees locally and nationally.

 Shapiro, of Sarasota, Florida, is a managing partner at 7wireVentures, an investment firm he co-founded over a decade ago. He also served as chief financial officer of Livongo Health and is former president of Allscripts where his leadership was integral in the execution of over $4B in mergers, acquisitions and financings. He holds a Juris Doctorate degree from The University of Chicago Law School and a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the University of Illinois. Based on his industry experience, Shapiro is a frequent speaker at widely attended industry conferences and is a published contributor to the Forbes Business Council.

 In his role as the American Heart Association’s volunteer chairperson, Shapiro is the lead volunteer officer responsible for the governance of the business affairs of the Association and presides over meetings of the board of directors and executive committee. Previously serving as the volunteer chair-elect and volunteer treasurer for the national board, Shapiro has long supported the organization’s mission on the local and national levels. He and his wife Valerie served as chairs for the Heart of Chicago Heart Ball, and their leadership helped it grow to become the No. 1 Heart Ball gala event in the U.S. In addition, their generous financial gifts have inspired donors everywhere to honor the women in their lives through the Association’s Millions Honoring Moms campaign.

 “I am honored to serve as the next volunteer chairperson of the American Heart Association,” Shapiro said. “These are very exciting times as we explore innovative technologies and strategic collaborations that will accelerate the way our organization can support all individuals and communities in achieving health and wellness.”

 Rosen, of Lake Success, New York, is the Association’s 89th volunteer president. In this role, she serves as the lead volunteer scientific and medical officer of the organization. She is currently the Senior Vice President, Women's Health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women’s Health of Northwell Health, the largest health care system in the state of New York. Additionally, she is the Partners Council Professor of Women’s Health and a professor of cardiology at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Rosen received her medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine, completed her residency in Internal Medicine and served as chief resident at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, and completed a fellowship in cardiovascular disease at the New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, which included advanced training in echocardiography.

 A practicing cardiologist for more than 30 years, Rosen is a leading expert in women’s cardiovascular health and is a published author and documentary producer on the topic. She is a long-time volunteer for the American Heart Association and its Go Red For Women® movement. She received the 2018 American Heart Association Women in Cardiology Mentoring Award and was recognized as the 2021 Association’s Physician of the Year. Additionally, Rosen received the 2023 WomenHeart Wenger Award for Excellence in Medical Advocacy and was named to Modern Healthcare’s 50 Most Influential Clinical Executives class of 2024.

 “I’ve seen far too many instances where a woman’s health is downplayed leading to tragic consequences and that’s one of the reasons I’ve dedicated my career to challenging the outdated notion that heart disease only impacts men,” Rosen said. “Women face unique risks when it comes to heart health, and we need to ensure that we are addressing those through science and through practice. Additionally, most women take on the role of health gatekeeper for their families and the more we can support them in understanding the importance of heart health for all people at all ages, the closer we are to meeting the American Heart Association’s mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.”

 Robert H. (Bob) Swan, M.B.A., of Menlo Park, California has been named as the Association’s new volunteer treasurer. In this role, he is responsible for governance of the Association’s funds and securities. Swan is currently an operating partner on the growth investing team of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz where he advises growth-stage portfolio companies as they scale their businesses. He previously held the positions of CEO and CFO of Intel, was an operating partner at General Atlantic LLC, a global growth equity investment firm, and was the CFO of eBay Inc. for nine years including during the spin-off of PayPal in 2015. Originally from Syracuse, New York, Swan earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University at Buffalo and his MBA degree from Binghamton University. He serves on the board of directors at Nike, eBay, GoTo and Flexport and previously served on the board of Applied Materials.

 “Now, more than ever, it’s imperative that the American Heart Association serves as a change agent in driving scientific breakthroughs, improving systems of care and advocating for policies that support our mission as a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “With strong leadership from committed and passionate volunteers like Lee Shapiro, Dr. Stacey Rosen, Bob Swan and our entire board of directors, the American Heart Association is well positioned to continue our work as a global catalyst in ensuring health and hope for everyone, everywhere.”

 The Association also announced its volunteer chairperson-elect and volunteer president-elect.

 Linda R. Gooden, M.B.A., a retired executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Corporation, is beginning a two-year term as the Association’s volunteer chairperson-elect. Gooden is the immediate past volunteer treasurer of the board and is a long-time volunteer of the Association. She has provided instrumental leadership in implementing the organization’s multiyear cybersecurity program and commencing the process to implement a new financial system. Gooden and her husband are also contributors to the Association’s Bernard J. Tyson Impact Fund, supporting work in their local Washington, D.C., region to break down social and economic barriers to equitable health for all.

 Manesh R. Patel, M.D., FAHA, is the new volunteer president-elect for the Association.
