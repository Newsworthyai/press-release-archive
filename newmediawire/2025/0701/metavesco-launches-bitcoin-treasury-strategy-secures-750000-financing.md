# Metavesco Launches Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Secures $750,000 Financing

CUMMING, GA - July 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded holding company operating Epic Labor and other growth assets, today announced it has launched Phase 1 of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy after closing a $750,000 five-year term loan. Proceeds will be deployed immediately to:

 1. Fund the first phase of Metavesco’s Bitcoin treasury initiative, enabling the Company to retain up to 100 % of BTC generated by its existing mining fleet effective July 1
2. Cover operating expenses and fund expansion at Epic Labor

 “This financing is a lifeline that does more than bridge working capital; it lets us flip the switch from forced sellers to long-term holders,” said Ryan Schadel, President & CEO. “Our three-phase treasury plan begins with hodling our self-mined coins, then ramps to systematic market purchases funded by capital inflows from our staffing business, expected to begin later this year, and finally allocating 10-15% of our total assets into Bitcoin.”
