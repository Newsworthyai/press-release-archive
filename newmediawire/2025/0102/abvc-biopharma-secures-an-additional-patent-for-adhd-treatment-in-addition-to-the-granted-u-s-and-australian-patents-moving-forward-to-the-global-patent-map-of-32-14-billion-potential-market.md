FREMONT, CA - (NewMediaWire) - January 2, 2025 - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in ophthalmology, neurology, and oncology/hematology, is announcing the approval of its patent application by Taiwan’s Intellectual Property Office (TIPO). The patent, titled "Polygala Extract for Treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" (Application No. 110106546), marks a significant milestone in ABVC’s global intellectual property portfolio.
