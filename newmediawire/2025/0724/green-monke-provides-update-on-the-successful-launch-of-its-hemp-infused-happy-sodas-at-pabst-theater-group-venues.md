# Green Monke Provides Update on the Successful Launch of its Hemp-Infused Happy Sodas at Pabst Theater Group Venues

Green Monke Becomes the Top-selling Non-alcoholic Beverage at Pabst Theatre Group’s Five Iconic Venues in Milwaukee

 MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN - July 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Green Monke (“Green Monke”), an award-winning hemp-D9 beverage brand, has enjoyed resounding success during its first six months serving Green Monke Happy Sodas at the Pabst Theatre Group (“PTG”) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

 The Pabst Theater Group Launch

 The partnership with The Pabst Theatre Group allows Green Monke to reach a diverse audience across five iconic venues in Milwaukee:

 1. Miller High Life Theatre (4,000-person capacity)
2. Riverside Theater (2,500-person capacity)
3. Pabst Theater (1,350 person capacity)
4. Turner Hall Ballroom (1,000-person capacity)
5. Vivarium (400-person capacity)

 These venues together host over 700 live events annually, reaching over 7.4 million people. Additional details about the partnership can be found here.

 After six months of this partnership, PTG has noticed a significant shift toward non-alcoholic beverages. Non-alcoholic beverages now account for 10-13% of total beverage sales at these venues. Green Monke makes up the majority share of non-alcoholic sales, in short order, outperforming zero-alcohol beer and ready-to-drink cocktails.

 * Green Monke makes up 69% of non-alcoholic beverage sales at larger venues (4,000+ capacity).
* Green Monke captures 52-62% of non-alcoholic beverage sales at mid-sized and smaller venues (under 2,000 capacity).
* Green Monke captures 55% of non-alcoholic beverage sales at mid-sized and smaller venues (under 500 capacity).

 "Since adding Green Monke to our selections, we have found that it fills an important need that we were missing, especially with the reductions in beer sales and the desires that our customers have to seek out n/a options,” said Gary Witt, president & CEO of the Pabst Theater Group. “These percentages speak to how quickly our customers adapted to Green Monke and how it has become an important contributor to our experience and our success at our bars."

 Consumers and bartenders have wholeheartedly embraced Green Monke's Happy Sodas as a high-quality, hemp-derived alcohol alternative. Demonstrating that these drinks enhance the live entertainment experience, delivering on taste, effect, with an elevated night, and a hangover-free morning after.

 Additionally, PTG and Green Monke are pioneering "Green Monke HIGHBalls". A series of mixed functional non-alcoholic cocktails that blend the brand's signature hemp-infused sodas with complementary ingredients.

 * California Sober: Your Favorite Green Monke + Lemonade + Grenadine
* Tropic Sunset: Green Monke Orange Passionfruit + Strawberry Puree + Triple Sec Non-Alc Syrup

 The possibility of incorporating Green Monke into beloved cocktail staples to create alcohol-free HIGHballs has inspired bartenders and captivated patrons. By substituting Green Monke, they mix known great-tasting drinks with on-hand ingredients to provide enhanced HIGH ball cocktails that serve consumers’ changing preferences.

 “Live entertainment venues are seeing a revolution in social drinking, and our success at Pabst Theatre Group Venues speaks to that,” commented Pat Gleeson, Green Monke President. “Our THC-infused beverages aren't just a natural fit; they're the perfect pairing for unforgettable live moments. Audiences crave them, venues love them, and the good vibes speak for themselves.”

 Looking Ahead

 In addition to sampling events at PTG shows, Green Monke is supporting both distributors and Pabst venues through hyper-local marketing initiatives. This summer, Green Monke has partnered with a local social media and podcast company to drive awareness and increase sales across both on- and off-premise channels. The campaign includes targeted social media activations, regional influencers, and on-premise stunts.

 This comes alongside on-the-ground sales representatives distributing marketing materials to generate traffic at venues and retail locations throughout Wisconsin; a standard Green Monke is setting for future venue launches, supporting both awareness and direct sales.

 Over the coming months, Green Monke is exploring opportunities to bring its Happy Sodas to larger stadiums nationwide, focusing on large cities in the South, Northeast, and upper Midwest. Green Monke expects to combine THC drinks and live entertainment, providing a refreshing alternative to alcoholic beverages for diverse and influential audiences, including building on its successful pilot launch at EnMarket Arena in Savannah, Georgia.
