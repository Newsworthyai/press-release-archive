# NeuralBase to Participate in The AI Conference 2025 in San Francisco as Part of Expanded Market Engagement Strategy

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and recognized as a growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced that it will participate as an attending delegate at The AI Conference 2025, taking place September 17-18 at Pier 48 in San Francisco, California. The Company’s participation is part of its broader market engagement initiative focused on expanding visibility, attracting strategic partnerships, and advancing its enterprise adoption strategy in key innovation centers.

 Hosted by leading figures in the AI research community, The AI Conference is widely regarded as one of the most influential vendor-neutral events in the artificial intelligence space. The conference draws a global audience of AI researchers, engineers, investors, and decision-makers from across the enterprise, academic, and venture ecosystems.

 “This conference aligns perfectly with our mission to build enterprise-ready AI systems that are secure, explainable, and grounded in real operational data,” stated Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of NeuralBase AI Ltd. “We’re looking forward to connecting with global leaders in AI and showcasing the strategic vision behind BMP AI.”

 NeuralBase AI’s attendance at the San Francisco conference follows the Company’s recent announcement of its intention to file for a corporate name change to BMP AI Technologies Inc. and request a new trading symbol, subject to regulatory approval. The event also marks a key milestone in the Company’s business development and partner outreach initiatives as it moves toward broader commercialization of the BMP AI platform.

 Following the San Francisco event, the Company also plans to participate in the Global AI Show Abu Dhabi this December, where it aims to deepen strategic dialogue with enterprise, government, and infrastructure partners across the Gulf region. Together, these engagements reflect a coordinated global strategy to accelerate commercial deployment of the BMP AI platform in both developed and emerging innovation hubs.

 The Company is not a sponsor or speaker at either event and will participate in a general attendee capacity. Further updates related to product roadmap, industry events, and market expansion efforts will be shared in the weeks ahead.
