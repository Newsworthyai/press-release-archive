# Texas Mineral Resources Announces Positive Drilling Confirmation of Alhambra Geophysics

SIERRA BLANCA, TEXAS - July 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (OTCQB: TMRC)

 Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (“TMRC” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce preliminary exploratory drilling results in the Black hawk Mining District in Grant County, New Mexico as part of our ongoing evaluation of the 2021 mineral exploration and option agreement with Santa Fe Gold Corporation (“Santa Fe”). This arrangement provides the Company the right to pursue a joint venture arrangement with Santa Fe to jointly explore and develop one or more target silver properties to be selected by the Company among patented and unpatented mining claims held by Santa Fe within the project area located in the Black Hawk Mining District in Grant County, New Mexico.

 Guided by the geophysical results announced in 2023, TMRC has drilled 20 diamond drill holes aggregating 2751.5 feet at the historic Alhambra mine. Eight drill holes were directed to test Electro-Magnetic anomalies separate from the Alhambra vein itself. Three were multi-targeted to test Electro-Magnetic features and also to intersect the Alhambra vein. Eight were drilled to intersect the Alhambra vein in the upper workings. One drill hole encountered an unexpected mine working and was abandoned. Of the eleven holes testing Electro-Magnetic anomalies, ten intersected strongly altered carbonate veins at or near the expected depth.

 The objective of this first phase of drilling was twofold. First was to test the validity of the Electro-Magnetic survey method, conducted by Zonge International, in locating veins in this district. Second, we wanted to drill the historic Alhambra vein itself to assess if any ore remains within the upper part of the historic workings and to better understand the geologic-geochemistry characteristics of these veins.

 Drilling was conducted during March, April and May 2025. Approximately half of these holes targeted Electro-Magnetic anomalies defined by a geophysical surveying method, marketed by Zonge Intl. as NANOTEM, used to locate shallow metallic features such as pipe, tanks and unexploded ordinance. The methodology was adapted to conditions in the Black Hawk district. Data collected by Zonge was sent for mathematical processing to Computational Geoscience Inc. in Vancouver. B.C.

 Field examination during the drilling suggests the following:

 1. Of the eleven holes drilled to test TDEM anomalies, separate from the Alhambra vein, ten intersected visible sulfide bearing veins at or near the projected depths of the anomalies.
2. The TDEM method appears to be successful in locating veins in this district but does not differentiate between the native silver and the sulfide bearing veins.
3. Of the eleven holes directed to intersect the upper Alhambra vein, three encountered unmapped underground workings, one failed to encounter the vein and seven intersected strongly brecciated, carbonate veins between stopes.
4. Drill core is stored at a secure site, and logging and analysis of the core is ongoing.
5. Analyses of the samples are pending, and a complete report will be released once analysis is complete.

 Daniel Gorski, CEO, states that, “The success of NANOTEM in identifying veins in this district is encouraging for ongoing exploration and development of the project.”

 The Black Hawk Mining District, Grant County, New Mexico is one of a genetic type of ore deposit commonly called the “Five Element Veins.” At the Alhambra these lenticular structures have been described as being carbonate filled structures, typically two to three feet wide with a central high grade “core” varying from one inch to eighteen inches thick.

 TMRC extends its sincere appreciation to the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources whose geologists and students are assisting in the logging, sample preparation, and analysis of these drill core.

 Upon completion of necessary evaluation of the data, TMRC will plan the next phase of work in this district.

 Completion of a joint venture agreement with Santa Fe, if any, is subject to the successful outcome of a multi-phase exploration plan leading to a bankable feasibility study planned to be undertaken by TMRC. There can be no assurance that the Company and Santa Fe will enter into a formal joint venture agreement, that there will be a successful outcome to any multi-phase exploration plan, that we will have the financial resources to fund exploration activities in the future, that any bankable feasibility study will be completed, or that this project will be commercialized.

 About Texas Mineral Resources Corp.

 Our primary focus is to develop and commercialize, along with our joint venture operating partner, the Round Top heavy-rare earth, technology metals, and industrial minerals project located in Hudspeth County, Texas, eighty-five miles southeast of El Paso, in which TMRC currently owns an approximate 19.3% interest. Additionally, the Company is pursuing other potential domestic mining opportunities, primarily gold and silver. The Company’s common stock trades on the OTCQB U.S. tier under the symbol “TMRC.”
