Total licensing revenue crosses $1.046 million; strategic collaboration with OncoX evolves toward expanded product development and global oncology footprint

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - July 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today announced receipt of a $100,000 milestone payment from OncoX BioPharma, Inc. under its strategic licensing agreement signed in 2024. With this latest payment, ABVC and its subsidiaries have now recorded a total of $1,046,000 in cumulative licensing income from AiBtl, ForSeeCon, and OncoX.

 “This milestone payment builds upon the 2024 licensing agreement with OncoX, and reflects the shared belief that our strategic collaboration can lead to new product and market opportunities,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer. “These funds not only validate the commercial value of our late-stage oncology platform, but also support ongoing collaborative efforts aimed at expanding OncoX’s therapeutic focus and enhancing its market presence.”

 “We’re excited to move into the next stage of collaboration with ABVC,” said Yen Wen Pin, CEO of OncoX BioPharma. “This milestone payment represents more than a transaction - it’s an investment in long-term innovation. We are actively working on broadening our oncology development programs, and the continued partnership with ABVC will help bring novel botanical-based treatments to global markets.”

 Advancing Botanical Oncology

 The OncoX agreement supports the development and global commercialization of botanical therapeutics in oncology, including preclinical programs with strong in vitro and early animal efficacy data. The broader deal value includes potential future milestone and royalty-based payments, contributing to ABVC’s long-term revenue outlook.

 While the licensing agreements were initially executed in 2024, the partnership between ABVC and OncoX has expanded beyond the original licensing agreement to include joint business development initiatives focused on product line enhancement and potential market diversification.

 Strategic Impact for Shareholders

 This payment reinforces the Company's previously stated 2025 guidance, supported by prior achievements such as:

 - 234% year-over-year increase in revenue (2024)

 - 77% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share

 - Total potential value of disclosed licensing agreements and related products estimated at over $959 million (AiBtl: $667M, OncoX: $105M, ForSeeCon: $187M)

 These continued payments reflect growing market interest in ABVC’s differentiated drug development model. The OncoX collaboration is expected to drive future regulatory filings and commercialization opportunities in oncology.

 Management believes the Company's product pipeline has excellent market potential. According to Precedence Research, the global cancer therapeutics market is projected to reach $393.61 billion by 2032, up from $164 billion in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 9.2%.[1]
