# Safeguarding Users' Assets: BTCC Reports Total Reserve Ratio of 132% For July, ETH Leads At 170%

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BTCC, one of the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchanges founded fourteen years ago, had a total reserve ratio of 132% for July, marking the fourth month in a row in which it maintained reserves well above 100%.

 The reserve ratio is the amount of customer funds the exchange holds in reserve compared to the amount of customer funds deposited. It measures the exchange’s ability to cover withdrawals by customers. The higher the reserve ratio, the greater the exchange’s ability to meet withdrawals; the lower the reserve ratio, the higher the risk the exchange could run into trouble.

 BTCC, which prides itself on transparency, has been releasing Proof of Reserves (PoR) reports since April, and reserves have been above 100% in every month since then.

 Safeguarding Users’ Assets

 Proof of Reserve is an audit procedure that verifies assets held by exchanges through cryptographic proof, public wallet ownership checks and repeated audits, reports BTCC. Custodians provide transparent proof that on-chain reserves truly exist, demonstrating that the total tokens held and freely available on the platform are greater than or equal to the total token assets of all users.

 In centralized trading platforms, each user's assets are recorded through a ledger in a database. Securely proving that the platform is properly safeguarding all users' assets is a challenge that each platform must address. BTCC uses Merkle tree tools to verify platform reserves and user asset proof reports, allowing users to verify their assets within the platform. Being able to verify the assets can give users peace of mind that their assets are safe. Several cryptocurrency exchanges have gone under over the years, including FTX and BlockFi, resulting in large losses for customers.

 In April, BTCC reported that the ratio was 161%. In May, the figure was 152%, and in June, it was 135%.

 Ethereum Leads The Way

 In the latest PoR report, BTCC said the exchange had strong asset backing across all major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum showing the highest reserve ratio at 170%. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has a reserve ratio of 120%, while XRP has a reserve ratio of 145% and Tether has a reserve ratio of 143%. USD coin ended the period under review with a reserve ratio of 110% while Cardano had a reserve ratio of 120%. BTCC said the strong reserves across all the digital coins demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to maintaining sufficient reserves

 "July has been a remarkable month for the cryptocurrency market," said Alex Hung, head of operations at BTCC Exchange. "Rising geopolitical tensions and new US tariff policies have driven increased safe-haven demand, with Bitcoin breaking through the historic $120,000 milestone for the first time. Throughout this period of market volatility, BTCC has maintained its strong financial position while continuing to grow both our asset base and user community."

 BTCC: Standing The Test Of Time With Zero Security Incidents

 BTCC is one of the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchanges, founded in June 2011, providing crypto futures trading services to users worldwide. The exchange offers perpetual futures on over 390 crypto and spot trading on more than 300 currencies, including BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP and SHIB. The cryptocurrency exchange adopted industry-leading security standards early on, which it credits with zero security incidents since its inception fourteen years ago. As of April, BTCC has over 9.1 million registered users around the world. For the second quarter, BTCC reported a volume of $850 billion in futures trading.

 Crypto exchanges come and go but BTCC has been able to stand the test of the time, thanks to its security, transparency and ability to safeguard customers’ assets. With reserve ratios that surpass 100% for consecutive months, BTCC is demonstrating why it's one of the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchanges.
