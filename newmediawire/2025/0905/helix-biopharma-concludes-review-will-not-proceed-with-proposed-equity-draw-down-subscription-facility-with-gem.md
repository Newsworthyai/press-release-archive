# Helix BioPharma Concludes Review, Will Not Proceed With Proposed Equity Draw-Down Subscription Facility With GEM

TORONTO, ONTARIO - September 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Helix BioPharma Corp. (TSX: “HBP”, OTC: “HBPCF”, FRANKFURT: “HBP0”) (“Helix” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage oncology company shaping a near future where today’s hard-to-treat cancers are vincible, announced today that it has elected not to proceed with the previously announced equity draw-down subscription facility with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (together, “GEM”).

 The Company entered into a non-binding term sheet dated October 15, 2024 with GEM, and disclosed the proposed subscription facility in news releases dated February 24, 2025 and March 26, 2025 and in the Company’s Management and Information Circular dated January 31, 2025.[1] The Company received shareholder approval of the financing arrangement at the Company’s annual general and special meeting on March 26, 2025. However, following a thorough evaluation of market conditions and long-term corporate objectives, Helix determined that the GEM facility no longer aligns with its capital strategy or its commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value. The letter of intent expired in accordance with its terms and the Company has elected not to proceed to execution of the binding agreements or pursue the financing with GEM.

 Independently of this decision, Helix continues to engage in constructive discussions with financial partners to explore alternative financing structures that may better align with the Company’s needs and strategic direction. The Company remains steadfast in its commitment to securing the capital required to advance its clinical programs and achieve its corporate objectives.
