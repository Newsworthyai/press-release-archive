# Martial Arts History Museum to Host Book Signing and Reading with Author Tim Kirk

GLENDALE, CA - September 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Martial Arts History Museum is thrilled to announce a special book signing and reading event with acclaimed author Tim Kirk. The free event will take place on Saturday, September 6, 2025, at 4 p.m. at the museum. The evening will celebrate the launch of Kirk’s debut novel, All My Damned Mother’s Sons.

 Kirk, who has previously published a novella and a collection of short stories, describes this novel as a passion project inspired by the singers and songwriters of the early rock and roll era. “I was inspired by many of the singers and songwriters who didn’t get a chance to ride down the golden road that Elvis paved, and by Elvis who did,” Kirk said. “I’m glad I wrote it because, ultimately, it rocks.”

 The novel is a journey through music history, following a main character who is a singer and guitarist traveling in the tracks of Elvis Presley from 1959 to 1973. The book immerses readers in the music, style, and fashion of the time, with Elvis playing a major role in the narrative.

 Kirk chose the Martial Arts History Museum as the ideal venue for his book signing, citing a personal connection to the martial arts world. “When I discovered the Martial Arts History Museum, I immediately felt that this was the place I’d like to launch the book signing for All My Damned Mother’s Sons,” he explained. “Michael has been kind enough to open the doors to this remarkable museum for this reading.” The connection runs even deeper for the author, whose seventeen-year-old daughter is a black belt in Tang Soo Do and will perform a martial arts form presentation before the reading.

 The museum strongly encourages attendees to arrive early to explore its fascinating exhibits. “I strongly urge you to come early before the 4 o’clock reading to explore this exciting museum. There is so much to see!” Kirk added.
