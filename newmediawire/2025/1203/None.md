# NRx Pharmaceuticals (NRXP) Amends IND to Advance NRX-101 With TMS for Depression Treatment

LOS ANGELES, CA - December 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, said it amended its Investigational New Drug filing for NRX-101 to include use of the drug in combination with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for depression, including suicidal depression. The update follows evidence suggesting NRX-101 may significantly enhance TMS outcomes, with published studies showing more than two-fold improvements in symptom reduction and clinical response rates exceeding 80%. The Company noted NRX-101’s D-cycloserine component appears to augment neuroplasticity associated with TMS, while its low-dose lurasidone is intended to mitigate D-cycloserine’s known risk of low-grade hallucinations. NRx said it aims to validate the findings in a well-controlled trial of about 120 participants and is in partnership discussions with TMS device manufacturers to pursue joint registration studies and potential label augmentation.
