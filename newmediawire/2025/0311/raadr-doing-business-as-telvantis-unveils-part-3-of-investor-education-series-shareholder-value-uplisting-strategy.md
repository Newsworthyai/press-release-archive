# Raadr (Doing Business as Telvantis) Unveils Part 3 of Investor Education Series: Shareholder Value & Uplisting Strategy

NEW YORK - March 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc. (OTC: RDAR), doing business as Telvantis, (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), concludes its three-part Investor Education Series by outlining its strategy for enhancing shareholder value and preparing for a potential national exchange uplisting.

 After detailing the Company’s business model and revenue growth strategies in Parts 1 and 2, Part 3 highlights capital allocation, share structure optimization, and uplisting preparations - critical steps as Telvantis executes its long-term plan to scale past $1 billion in revenue and achieve stronger market positioning.

 “We are focused on long-term value creation”

 "Our primary objective is building sustainable, long-term value for shareholders through disciplined financial management, operational efficiency, and strategic expansion," said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “While we recognize the volatility of the OTC market, our focus remains on executing a strategy that positions Telvantis as a premier player in the communications industry. We are preparing this company for its next phase of growth, including uplisting to a major exchange.”

 Capital allocation: balancing growth & shareholder value

 Telvantis follows a structured capital allocation strategy designed to fuel growth while protecting shareholder interests. This includes:

 * Expanding organically & via acquisitions – Leveraging strategic M&A to accelerate expansion, enhance service offerings, and diversify revenue streams.
* Debt & equity management – Optimizing capital structure to align with risk and growth objectives.
* Share buybacks (when appropriate) – The Company has previously stated its intent to conduct buybacks when shares trade below intrinsic value.
* Cost efficiency & operational leverage – Continuing to streamline costs while maintaining strong cash flow generation.

 “Our long-term goal is to create a business that generates strong, consistent returns - not just quarter-to-quarter fluctuations,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. “We are actively managing our capital structure to support growth while mitigating shareholder dilution. This means raising only the capital needed, from the right investors, and maintaining financial discipline in every stage of our expansion.”

 Uplisting strategy: path to a national exchange

 Telvantis has clearly outlined its intent to uplist and is actively preparing for this next phase. Key initiatives include:

 * Completing PCAOB financial audit - A crucial step toward achieving higher financial transparency and attracting institutional investors.
* Meeting listing requirements - Strengthening financial reporting and corporate governance to align with national exchange standards.
* Building institutional investor interest - Engaging with strategic capital partners to support long-term stock stability and price appreciation.
* Growing revenue & profitability - Executing a five-year growth roadmap targeting $1 billion in revenue with 30-50M in operating profit by 2029.

 “We understand that investors are eager to see a clear roadmap to a major exchange, and we are methodically executing each step to get there,” added Contreras. “Our focus remains on scaling our business the right way - not through short-term financial engineering, but through real, sustainable growth.”

 Why this matters for shareholders

 * Growth & expansion - Clear roadmap to expand revenue, profitability, and market presence.
* Financial transparency - Audit and reporting improvements for institutional-grade governance.
* Shareholder value focus - Optimized share structure, controlled capital raising, and buyback planning.
* NASDAQ/Uplisting potential - Commitment to meeting the standards for a national exchange listing.

 What’s next for Telvantis?

 * Continued execution of growth strategy - Expanding revenue streams, enhancing operational efficiency, and building strategic partnerships.
* Additional corporate updates - Expect more shareholder communications, including updates on financial performance, acquisitions, and technology initiatives.
* Engagement with institutional investors - Strengthening relationships to support long-term shareholder value.
