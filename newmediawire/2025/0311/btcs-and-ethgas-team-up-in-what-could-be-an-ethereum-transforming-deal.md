# BTCS And ETHGas Team Up In What Could Be An Ethereum-Transforming Deal

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - March 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BTCS Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCS), the blockchain infrastructure and technology company, aims to expand the market of fee-based products that run on Ethereum’s network through its recent partnership with ETHGas – a blockchain technology company offering a real-time institutional marketplace for Ethereum blockspace – enabling what it says is a fast and customizable experience for validators and end users.

 The companies said the partnership is intended to unlock ultra-low-latency scaling on Ethereum’s blockchain, which they say will enable transaction confirmations that are about 100 times faster than Solana, a competing blockchain. Under the terms of the deal, BTCS will serve as a Priority Builder, and invested $250,000 into ETHGas.

 “As a pioneer in blockchain infrastructure and digital asset innovation, BTCS is thrilled to partner with ETHGas to expand the overall market of fee-based products, to drive revenue for BTCS while helping make Ethereum transactions more efficient and cost-effective for the ecosystem,” said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS when announcing the partnership. “Our investment in ETHGas aligns with our strategy to drive scalable revenue growth and improve margins by expanding order flow, refining our tech stack, and controlling blockspace. Our planned ETHGas integration should help achieve this goal by increasing both order flow and blockspace.”

 Founded in 2014, BTCS pioneered Bitcoin mining as the first U.S. public company in the space. Over the years, BTCS has shifted its focus to Ethereum, leveraging its expertise to drive growth in validator node operations and block building. Since shifting to Ethereum, BTCS has become a key participant in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake ecosystem, operating 522 validator nodes, and according to rated explorer, building blocks that account for over 1% of all transactions on Ethereum’s network.

 Speeding Up The Network, Making It More Uniform

 ETHGas’s secret sauce lies in its ability to re-engineer the Ethereum pipeline for block construction, enabling validators to sell blockspace prior to a spot block auction. Ethereum block construction occurs when a collection of transactions is assembled into one block and then added by a proposing validator to the blockchain. Block builders purchase blockspace from proposing validators and decide which transactions to include based on fees and other criteria.

 For end users such as traders, ETHGas says it provides several precision order execution products to customize their access to blockspace and hedge gas price volatility. Gas is the fee paid to execute an action, such as interacting with a smart contract or sending ETH. A common complaint when it comes to Ethereum is the fluctuating and often high transaction fees (gas fees). To gain more adoption there need to be more transparent and competitive transaction fees. ETHGas aims to deliver that.

 ETHGas says it aims to create a real-time, gasless Ethereum in which the trading of gas is in the background among institutional and specialized players. ETHGas says it has partnerships with blockspace builders representing over 90% of the market and is working with validators to ensure broad network participation and adoption. The aim of ETHGas and BTCS with this partnership is to bring more speed and cheaper transaction fees to Ethereum and spur the adoption of the blockchain.

 “BTCS’s partnership validates our mission to open up and democratize access to blockspace. This collaboration helps pave the way for a much faster, more efficient Ethereum enabling transaction costs or ‘gas prices’ to be risk-managed within a traditional commodity risk-management framework,” said Kevin Lepsoe, founder of ETHGas. “Together with BTCS, we enhance accessibility, in particular, to global asset managers as they look to scale their ETH and Staked ETH Fund offerings.”

 Improving Ethereum One Block At A Time

 BTCS’ partnership with ETHGas is part of the company’s mission to improve Ethereum, making it more accessible and user-friendly as competition in the blockchain market heats up. It’s also part of the company’s effort to grow revenue and control blockspace. After all, ETHGas brings more efficiency and speed to Ethereum, which should, in turn, draw more users, which means more revenue for BTCS.

 The partnership builds on BTCS' previous efforts to expand its operations, drive revenue and improve Ethereum. In January, BTCS announced its Staker Protection Plan, which is designed to enhance financial stability and operational security for Ethereum blockchain validators and overcome some of the pain points of staking. Under the plan, BTCS says validators can gain stable income via pre-sold blockspace on the Ethereum network and as much as 90% of execution layer reward profits, which it says can potentially increase earnings by up to 4%.

 In a world of increasing blockchain competition, BTCS is working hard to build efficiency, transparency and competitiveness on the Ethereum blockchain. The partnership with ETHGas marks a major stepping stone in that direction. To learn more about BTCS and its deal with ETHGas, click here.
