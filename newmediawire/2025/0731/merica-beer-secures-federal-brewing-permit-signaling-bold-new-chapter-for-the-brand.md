# Merica Beer Secures Federal Brewing Permit, Signaling Bold New Chapter for the Brand

HOUSTON, TEXAS - July 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Aristocrat Group (OTC: ASCC) - Merica Beer, the unapologetically patriotic beer brand known for its all-American attitude and crisp, bold flavor, is proud to announce that it has officially been granted its Federal Brewer’s Permit from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). This regulatory milestone allows Merica Beer to take full control of its brewing operations and expand production under its own license.

 Merica Beer has steadily grown a loyal following of freedom-loving beer drinkers across Texas and is now ready to expand nationally. With the federal brewing permit now in place, the company is entering a new phase of independence

 “Getting our federal brewing permit is more than just a legal step - it’s a statement of who we are,” said Derek Sisson, founder of Merica Beer. “This brand was built on the ideals of freedom, hard work, and doing it your own way. Now we can expand our footprint - and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”

 With its own brewing permit now in motion, Merica Beer is preparing for broader distribution, limited-edition labels, 16oz cans, and bottles crafted entirely by its internal team.

 The company will continue to focus on American-grown ingredients and aims to become a staple of both backyard barbecues and bar taps nationwide.

 More announcements - including new placements, events, and expanded availability - are expected in the coming weeks.
