# 45Drives Announces Next Wave of Creators for 2025 Creators Summit in Wilmington, NC: Tom Lawrence, Craft Computing, and Allan Jude Join the Lineup

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA and WILMINGTON, NC - July 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - On the heels of the recent announcement that electronic music visionary and open tech advocate deadmau5 will headline this year’s event, 45Drives is thrilled to unveil the next wave of featured participants for the 2025 Creators Summit, taking place September 8-12, 2025 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

 Joining this year’s growing lineup are three of the most influential voices in open infrastructure and systems education: Tom Lawrence of Lawrence Systems, Jeff of Craft Computing, and Allan Jude, VP of Engineering at Klara Inc. and a long-time contributor to FreeBSD and OpenZFS. These creators will join engineers, customers, and community leaders for an unprecedented week of collaboration, technical deep-dives, and real-time content creation.

 Now in its third year - and hosted in the U.S. for the first time - the 2025 Creators Summit will be the company’s most ambitious to date. The weeklong event will feature dual-track programming tailored to both enterprise users and creative professionals, along with the global debut of 45Studio, a new division and product suite designed for video editors, VFX artists, game developers, and other high-performance creative workflows.

 Tom Lawrence said, “I'm looking forward to attending the 2025 45Drives Creators Summit. 45Drives doesn’t just talk about supporting open source and innovation - they create real opportunities to make it happen. The summit brings together creators, engineers, and open-source advocates to collaborate and exchange ideas. Why creators? Because 45Drives believes these valuable conversations shouldn’t stay within the walls of the event. They should be shared across our collective channels so others can learn from and benefit from the work being done.”

 This year’s Enterprise Track will explore next-gen storage performance using ZFS, Ceph, and DRBD on bleeding-edge platforms like the Stornado F16. Engineers and creators will work hands-on with ultra-high-performance NVMe servers, real-world use cases, and open software stacks to stress-test what’s possible in modern data infrastructure.

 In parallel, the Creative Artist Track will focus on open workflows for creators - from direct-from-server 4K editing to real-time game engine rendering. This track is built for independent filmmakers, music producers, YouTubers, and DIY professionals looking to push the limits of creative technology without vendor lock-in or legacy complexity.

 Dr. Doug Milburn, President and Co-Founder of 45Drives, said, “This isn’t just a tech summit - it’s a philosophy in motion. We believe the open-source community gets stronger when creators are embedded in the process, not just reporting on it from the outside. This year, with the launch of 45Studio and our growing presence in the U.S., we’re building a platform not just for open hardware, but for the future of creative and enterprise computing itself.”

 Allan Jude’s presence brings deep systems-level insight to the summit’s technical sessions. As a long-standing FreeBSD and OpenZFS committer and co-host of the BSDNow.tv podcast, Allan will join peer experts to explore the state of open-source file systems and infrastructure design at scale.

 Events will be held at 45Drives’ new U.S. facilities and partner venues across Wilmington, with active participation from local education partners including UNCW and Cape Fear Community College. Many sessions will be open to the public, giving local creators, students, and IT professionals the opportunity to participate in live keynotes, demos, and panel discussions.

 With more creators, media, analysts, customers, and ecosystem partners still to be announced, 45Drives is setting the stage for its most collaborative and community-driven summit yet.
