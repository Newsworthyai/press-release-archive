# Telvantis Closes First Half 2025 With $98M+ in Revenue; $1.8M Operating Profit; Sees Strong Commercial Momentum in June and Beyond

NEW YORK, NY - July 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Telvantis Inc. (OTC: RDAR) (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based technology-driven telecommunications and enterprise solutions provider, today announced approximately $98 million in revenue in the first half for 2025, confirming strong recovery of the business. The Company’s full first half results will be filed with OTC Markets and available to the investing public within the prescribed filing due date.

 The Company has surpassed its 2024 performance for the same period substantially with approximately $4.4 million in gross profit and an operating profit before financing costs of $1.8 million, including public company costs, compared to $ 3.2 million in gross profit and an operating profit before financing costs of $ 1.4 million for the 2024 period. This growth is supported by strong commercial momentum in June 2025, and overall gross profits for the second quarter 2025 of approximately 5.2%, compared to approximately 1% in Q1 2025.

 Importantly, the Company’s revenue and margin trajectory now continues to accelerate, validating Telvantis’ position as an emerging force in the telecom technology space. This milestone comes on the heels of Telvantis’ completing its full repayment of obligations related to the reverse merger in 2024 and the advanced process for its first US-based acquisition.

 The second quarter 2025 performance for revenues, gross margins and operating profit represents a strong improvement over the first quarter 2025.

 Note that all mentioned numbers are unaudited.

 “The first half of 2025 marked a very sharp recovery of our business,” commented Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “Volumes have more than doubled from Q1 to Q2 2025 and gross profit is really picking up,” added Contreras.

 “These results are testament to the team’s commitment and hard work. We saw a very strong finish of Q2 and expect to continue this momentum into the second half of the year. Coupled with previously announced potential acquisitions, we have significant opportunities for the business at the moment,” added Conteras.

 “This first half year shows what is possible. We recovered swiftly and continue to push the boundaries for the business and our team,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. “Our broader strategy is just unfolding in its very early steps. But it is unfolding rapidly. We believe much more is coming and we remain laser focused on driving value for our shareholders.”

 Key Revenue Drivers

 * Enterprise Messaging (CPaaS): Telvantis powers secure A2P messaging and verification services across fintech, healthcare, and ecommerce clients worldwide.
* Telecom Carrier Optimization: Revenue from high-volume routing and traffic management across Telvantis' 300+ global carrier relationships.
* Global Expansion: Strong international delivery capacity and new B2B relationships fueled growth across both months.

 Delivering Scalable Growth

 These numbers signal that Telvantis’ restructuring and transition efforts in 2024 have culminated in a functional, revenue-generating and profitable model that is now scaling quickly.

 “The first six months prove that our plan is working,” added Daniel Gilcher. “We’re entering the second half of 2025 with positive momentum, potential acquisitions being pursued and continuous growth ambitions for the company.”

 What Comes Next

 * H1 2025 Summary: The Company will announce a H1 investor call shortly.
* Acquisition Strategy: The Company expects closing of its initial previously-announced acquisition over the coming weeks.
* Uplisting & Transparency: First Half Year Results will be reviewed by Company auditors.
