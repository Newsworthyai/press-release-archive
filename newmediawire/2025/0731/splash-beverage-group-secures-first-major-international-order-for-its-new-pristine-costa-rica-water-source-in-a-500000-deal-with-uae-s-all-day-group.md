# Splash Beverage Group Secures First Major International Order for Its New Pristine Costa Rica Water Source in a $500,000 Deal With UAE's All Day Group

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - July 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) ("Splash" or the "Company"), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced a major milestone just weeks after unveiling its acquisition of exclusive rights to a world-class natural water source near a globally recognized area of Costa Rica associated with exceptional health and lifespan. The Company has received its first official purchase order for premium bottled water from this special aquifer, an order valued at a minimum of $500,000 from the All Day Group, a premier retail and convenience operator based in the United Arab Emirates.

 This early success, secured before full commercialization efforts have even begun, highlights the extraordinary demand for the naturally alkaline, mineral-rich water sourced from deep within Costa Rica’s cloud rainforest. Filtered through volcanic rock, the water is already attracting global interest from premium retailers and hospitality groups seeking purity, sustainability, and wellness credentials.

 The All Day Group is widely recognized as one of the most innovative and upscale operators in the Middle East's high-end convenience and lifestyle retail space. With locations that blend contemporary design, gourmet food, luxury goods, and a focus on wellness, All Day’s selection of Splash’s new water brand speaks to the product’s positioning in the elite hydration space. The initial order includes both 500ml and 1000ml bottles and is expected to be the first of several large international placements.

 “This order is validation of everything we believed when we moved to acquire this Costa Rican asset,” said William Meissner, President and Chief Marketing Officer of Splash Beverage Group. “We just announced the deal, and already we’re seeing strong international demand from some of the world’s most discerning retailers. It’s a powerful signal of how special this water is, and of how quickly this brand could scale.”

 The Company credits its early success to the global hospitality and retail relationships brought by Utopia Holdings, Splash’s strategic partner in the Costa Rica acquisition. Utopia’s international network continues to play a vital role in accelerating interest in the water, especially among wellness-focused buyers and premium retail chains across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.

 “This is more than a purchase order, it’s clear evidence that what we have is globally relevant and in demand,” Meissner added. “To have a group like All Day place an order of this size before we’ve even officially launched commercial operations is incredibly encouraging. It gives us momentum, and a big boost as we prepare to scale.”

 As previously announced, Splash acquired exclusive rights to the Costa Rica source - a volcanic aquifer located in one of the world’s recognized longevity hotspots in a transaction valued at $20 million. Independent analysis confirms the aquifer produces naturally alkaline spring water with mineral content and purity levels that exceed many of the category’s global leaders.

 This initial international order underscores Splash Beverage Group’s strategic focus: acquiring and scaling high-margin beverage brands with meaningful wellness and sustainability stories, backed by operational control of rare and premium assets.
