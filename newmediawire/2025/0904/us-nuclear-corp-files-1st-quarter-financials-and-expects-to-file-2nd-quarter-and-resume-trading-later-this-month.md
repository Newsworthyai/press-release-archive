# US Nuclear Corp Files 1st Quarter Financials and Expects to File 2nd Quarter and Resume Trading Later This Month

LOS ANGELES, CA - September 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - US Nuclear Corp (OTC: UCLE) is pleased to announce that the Company has filed its first quarter financials, which can be accessed at the link below. The Company expects to submit its second quarter financials for review later this week and expects to become current shortly after the review is completed, enabling trading in the stock to resume.

 “We have strengthened our financial reporting by adding a staff accountant at the Overhoff facility, while implementing a streamlined system to produce audit-ready monthly reports, with reviews bi-monthly,” said Bob Goldstein, President of US Nuclear. “Additionally, our LA facility will be closed this month, and all operations and financial reporting will be done at our Overhoff facility in Ohio.”

 “We have launched a new task force called Project 2036,” said Nikki Truax, Director of Operations for Overhoff Technology. “This initiative targets a 20% reduction in our monthly expenses, while increasing sales 36% annually, effectively doubling sales every 2 years. To achieve this, we plan to expand our sales team and distributor network, establish consistent monthly customer outreach through prospect mailings, and participate in trade shows to drive growth. Our focus will be on our top-selling products using volume pricing strategies, complemented by bundling with new products that we believe align well with customer needs.”

 “We have continued discussions and have closed on one transaction with our equity partners in Company-owned investments in the nuclear fusion sector,” said Bob Goldstein. “We own over 600k shares in MIFTI, an early-stage company developing a thermonuclear fusion-powered reactor which has tremendous upside potential. We are working closely with MIFTI to optimize the long-term value of this investment.”

 “We also own over 14% of the radionuclide technology company MIFTEC, which we are in active discussions regarding a potential transaction in the near-term,” said Mr. Goldstein. The Company also has a 35.2% interest in Grapheton, Inc., a Company making and designing advanced energy storage devices, called supercapacitors. We believe these investments could become very successful and valuable over the next 18 months,” said Mr. Goldstein.

 “US Nuclear first quarter results were impacted by disruptions caused by the closing of the LA facility, shipments packed and shipped to the Overhoff facility, and associated reductions in staffing,” said Mr. Goldstein. “We expect to show growth in sales, and more importantly, progress in our march to profitability by the fourth quarter. Our first quarter loss from operations of $523,880 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $451,459 for incentive out-of-the-money warrants for employees and consultants, which, adjusted for that charge, would have produced a loss from operations of $72,421, a 50% reduction from the $144,429 operating loss from a year ago. We were close to breakeven on lower sales, even with the disruptions.”
