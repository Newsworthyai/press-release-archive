# Rainmaker Unveils ATMOCELL 5K: Fourth-Generation Air-to-Water System Producing 5,000 Liters of Drinking Water Daily

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - September 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. (OTC: RAKR), a global leader in sustainable water technology solutions, today announced the launch of its ATMOCELL 5K, the company’s most advanced Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG) system to date. This fourth-generation Air-to-Water system delivers up to 5,000 liters of pure drinking water per day, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution to the world’s escalating water scarcity crisis.

 Designed for deployment in remote communities, industrial operations, and disaster relief zones, the ATMOCELL 5K provides a reliable alternative to strained infrastructure and costly bottled or trucked-in water supplies.

 Breakthrough Technology with Integrated Purification

 Unlike previous models requiring third-party filtration, the ATMOCELL 5K integrates a chemical-free, multi-stage purification system. Atmospheric water is processed through dual polypropylene filters, granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis (RO), and LED ultraviolet (UV) sterilization, producing drinking water that meets or exceeds international standards.

 “This launch represents a major leap forward for Rainmaker’s Air-to-Water technology,” said Michael O’Connor, Chairman and CEO of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. “By integrating advanced purification directly into the system, we have eliminated dependency on external filtration. This milestone was made possible through the expertise of our subsidiary, Miranda Water Technologies, whose proven track record in water and wastewater innovation continues to drive Rainmaker’s competitive edge.”

 Innovative, Scalable, and Sustainable

 Each ATMOCELL 5K unit features secure internal storage and can be connected to external distribution systems. The technology is supported by Miranda’s SmartCell remote monitoring platform, which delivers real-time performance data, water quality oversight, and predictive maintenance from anywhere in the world.

 Operating on grid, solar, wind, or hybrid energy sources, the ATMOCELL 5K ensures minimal environmental impact and adaptable deployment across diverse geographies. Its compact, modular design enables rapid installation and scalability, aligning with growing demand for decentralized, resilient water infrastructure.

 Meeting the Global Demand for Water Security

 With billions of people facing water scarcity, population growth pressures, and failing infrastructure, Rainmaker’s technology positions the company at the forefront of a high-growth market. The ATMOCELL 5K not only addresses urgent humanitarian and municipal needs but also represents a strategic opportunity for industries and governments to invest in sustainable water security solutions.

 “This system empowers communities and organizations to control their water source,” added O’Connor. “It changes lives, strengthens resilience, and directly addresses one of the most pressing challenges of our time.”
