# Run Ventures Launches $290M Fund to Back the Next Generation of Tech Trailblazers

SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Run Ventures today announced the launch of a $290 million early-stage venture capital fund focused on leading Series A investments for technology companies in high-growth ecosystems across the United States. Founded by veteran investors Brandon Tidwell and Ben Dahl and based in Salt Lake City, the firm will back ambitious entrepreneurs building companies in artificial intelligence and other transformative sectors. The firm’s name reflects its core philosophy: helping founders go faster and further in their entrepreneurial journey.

 Track Record and Foundation

 Tidwell and Dahl previously invested together across two funds at Signal Peak Ventures, with a track record that includes companies such as Filevine, Authenticx, and Bark. Run Ventures builds on that experience with a strategy centered on Series A leadership, while also selectively participating in seed-stage investments.

 The Opportunity Beyond the Coasts

 “We’re witnessing a powerful convergence of talent, opportunity, and technology across the country’s rising tech centers,” said Tidwell. “At the same time, AI is accelerating company-building faster than ever before. By combining our investment experience with a commitment to founders outside the coasts, we’re positioned to identify and empower the next generation of entrepreneurs solving previously intractable problems.”

 Traditionally, Series A firms have preferred to invest close to home, concentrating capital in Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston. Run Ventures was built on a different premise: with Salt Lake City as its base and strong national connectivity, the firm is structured to lead investments in markets such as Austin, Denver, and Atlanta, providing capital and hands-on partnership wherever founders are building.

 Founder Partnerships

 Ryan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Filevine, added: “What sets the team at Run Ventures apart is their authenticity and accessibility. Throughout Filevine’s accelerated growth, they’ve transcended the typical investor role to become essential collaborators - helping us raise subsequent rounds of capital, recruit key additions to our team, and provide substantive expertise precisely when it matters most.”

 Investment Approach

 For entrepreneurs, Run Ventures promises a deeply engaged, roll-up-your-sleeves approach. “It’s often more enjoyable to go running with a partner than hitting the pavement alone,” said Dahl. “We see ourselves as the running partners to founders - encouraging, coaching, and pushing them forward.”

 Brandon and Ben have assembled a dynamic, energetic team that is deeply committed to founders. With a name inspired by grit, momentum, and shared victories, Run Ventures is more than a firm - it’s a mindset. Entrepreneurs take the lead, and Run Ventures is right beside them, in stride, ready to go the distance.
