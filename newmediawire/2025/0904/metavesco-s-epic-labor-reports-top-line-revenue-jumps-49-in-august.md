# Metavesco's Epic Labor Reports Top Line Revenue Jumps 49% in August

CUMMING, GA - September 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced sales results for its Epic Labor staffing subsidiary for the month of August 2025.

 Epic Labor generated $167,115 in top-line revenue during August, a sharp increase compared to $89,458 in July. Importantly, July reflected four weeks of operations while August included five weeks. On a per-week basis, Epic Labor averaged $33,423 in revenue per week in August versus $22,365 in July, representing a 49% increase in weekly performance.

 “Epic Labor continues to scale, and while we are not yet cash-flow positive, we are getting very close,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “Each month brings us closer to building Epic Labor into the cash flow powerhouse I envision. For co-owners, this is key to our flywheel: converting operating cash flow into Bitcoin, Bitcoin miners, and Ethereum. Unlike other Digital Asset Treasuries who only issue stock to buy crypto, our goal is to build sustainable businesses that can acquire digital assets with asymmetrical upside, without dilution.”

 Epic Labor, which currently operates four staffing locations, specializes in providing on-demand blue-collar staffing across construction, warehousing, hospitality, and events. Metavesco plans to continue expanding Epic Labor’s footprint throughout the Southeast with additional branch locations slated to be opened soon.
