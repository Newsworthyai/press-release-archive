# When the heat rises, so do heart risks: What you need to know

(NewMediaWire) - June 20, 2025 - DALLAS, June 20, 2025 — It’s only the first day of summer and record high temperatures are already being reported across much of the U.S. with a forecasted heatwave that could smash records in the Northeast and Midwest That’s prompted the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, to issue important warnings about taking extra precautions to stay safe in extremely high temperatures.

 According to the U.S. Centers from Disease Control and Prevention, more than 1,200 people die in the U.S. each year as a direct cause of extreme heat. That number is rising substantially – as is the number of people dying from heat related-cardiovascular disease. A study published in the American Heart Association’s flagship, peer-reviewed journal Circulation predicts that cardiovascular disease deaths related to extreme heat may more than double over the next two decades.

 Heat and dehydration cause the heart to work harder, putting it under significant stress. This can be particularly problematic for those with heart conditions and older adults. Certain heart medications, such as beta blockers, ace receptor blockers, ace inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and diuretics (which deplete the body of sodium), can exaggerate the body’s response to heat. The Association suggests those who have been prescribed these medications take extra precautions during heat waves but continue to take their medications unless told otherwise by their health care professional.

 Precautions to take during these hot days of summer:

 * Watch the clock: It’s best to avoid the outdoors in the early afternoon (about noon to 3 p.m.) because the sun is usually at its strongest, putting you at higher risk for heat-related illnesses.
* Dress for the heat: Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing in breathable fabrics such as cotton, or a newer fabric that repels sweat.
* Drink up: Stay hydrated by drinking a few cups of water before, during and after going outside or exercising. Avoid caffeinated or alcoholic beverages.
* Take regular breaks: Find some shade or a cool place, stop for a few minutes, hydrate and start again.

 It’s important to know the signs and symptoms when you may be experiencing too much heat.

 Symptoms of heat exhaustion:

 * Headaches
* Cool, pale and moist skin
* Fast, weak pulse
* Dizziness and light-headedness
* Weakness or muscle cramps
* Nausea and vomiting
* Passing out

 If you experience these symptoms, move to a cooler place, stop exercising and cool down immediately by dousing yourself with cold water and re-hydrating. You may need to seek medical attention.

 Heat stroke is a medical emergency, if you experience these symptoms call 9-1-1 and get medical attention right away.

 Symptoms of heat stroke:

 * High body temperature (103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher)
* Hot, red, dry or damp skin
* Fast, strong pulse
* Headache, dizziness and confusion
* Nausea
* Passing out

 While being heart-smart in the heat, it’s still important to find ways for the whole family to stay active even during the high temperatures of summer. Adjusting your activity time to early morning or later in the evening can help. If being outside is just too much on some days, find indoor locations where you can be active, such as a shopping mall, gym or community recreation center.
