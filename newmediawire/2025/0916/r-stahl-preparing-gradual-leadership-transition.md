 WALDENBURG, Germany - September 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - At its meeting today, the Supervisory Board of R. STAHL AG laid the groundwork for a gradual, structured handover of company management. Effective 1 October 2025, the Supervisory Board will appoint Dr. Claus Bischoff (52) as an additional member of the Executive Board and Deputy CEO. Dr. Mathias Hallmann retains his duties as CEO of the R. STAHL Group until the end of the year and will provide Dr. Bischoff with any support he may need during the transition process.

 In accordance with the contractual agreements reached with the Supervisory Board, Dr. Mathias Hallmann will step down from his position as CEO and leave the company at his own request as of 31 December 2025. The resolution was passed in the course of Dr. Hallmann’s longstanding service contract as Chairman of the Executive Board, which is scheduled to end on 30 September 2026.

 In the course of its strategic succession planning, the Supervisory Board had already identified Dr. Bischoff as a successor at the beginning of next year. The future member of the Executive Board has many years of management experience with international companies in the automotive, electronics, mechatronics and automation technology sectors as well as in the development of global structures and digital business models. He holds a doctorate in engineering and was most recently CTO at automation specialist Lenze SE. He began his career after studying mechatronics and automation at Robert Bosch GmbH, where he gained extensive professional experience. Further career milestones included positions as Managing Director and CTO at mechatronics specialist Marquardt GmbH, where he was responsible for development, sales and business units. Dr. Bischoff has also held senior positions at Continental AG and Magna International AG.

 “The transition is in line with the consistent application of the corporate strategy we have adopted. Dr. Hallmann has worked to reposition R. STAHL in the past eight years. He has successfully guided the Group through a number of different crises and laid the foundation for profitable growth at the company. With Dr. Bischoff, we have found an experienced successor who, as a strong leader with deep expertise in technology, product development and operational transformation, will continue to drive our strategic process forward together with Tobias Popp (CCO), the R. STAHL leadership team, and the entire workforce," says Peter Leischner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, on the upcoming change in management at the Group.
