# Ares Strategic Mining Discovers High-Value Germanium in Addition to Gallium in Its Fluorspar Ore

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Ares Strategic Mining Inc. (CSE: ARS) (OTC: ARSMF) (FRA: N8I1) is pleased to report a promising breakthrough from its ongoing materials analysis program in partnership with Iowa State University (ISU) and Ames National Laboratory. Early laboratory results have confirmed the presence of germanium (Ge), in addition to the previously discovered gallium (Ga) - two highly strategic critical minerals - within Ares’ fluorspar ore samples from its Spor Mountain Project in Utah.

 Germanium (Ge) is vital for semiconductors, fiber optics, infrared optics, and solar cells. It is extremely rare, with global production dominated by China.

 Breakthrough Elemental Discovery

 Under the guidance of Professors at ISU, Ares submitted multiple batches of fluorite material for advanced analytical testing. Seven separate samples were finely ground and washed to remove surface impurities, with Germanium (⁶⁹Ge) detected in two samples at concentrations of 0.15% and 0.05% (1,500 ppm and 500 ppm), with low error margins of ±0.02% and ±0.01% respectively, confirmed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

 James Walker, CEO of Ares Strategic Mining, stated, “The presence of both germanium and gallium - both critical minerals on the U.S. supply risk list - within our fluorspar ores opens an exciting new strategic pathway for Ares. This breakthrough aligns with our broader vision to unlock additional critical mineral value from our deposits, further differentiating Ares as a leader in North America’s mineral independence.”

 Next Steps in Strategic Mineral Development

 With proof-of-concept testing complete, Ares will:

 - Continue advanced laboratory characterization to quantify full germanium and gallium concentrations across additional batches.

 - Investigate commercial pathways to extract and recover these materials alongside fluorspar.

 - Evaluate potential economic co-products and vertical integration opportunities.

 This initiative forms part of Ares’ broader commitment to maximizing the value of its resource and contributing to domestic supply chain resiliency for critical materials in the United States.

 DISCLOSURE AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

 Companies typically rely on comprehensive feasibility reports on mineral reserve estimates to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with a production decision. Historically, situations where the issuer decides to put a mineral project into production without first establishing mineral reserves supported by a technical report and completing a feasibility study have a higher risk of economic or technical failure, though some industrial mineral ventures are relatively simple operations with low levels of investment and risk, where the operating entity has determined that a formal prefeasibility or feasibility study in conformance with NI 43-101 and 43-101 CP is not required for a production decision. Based on historical engineering work, geological reports, historical production data and current engineering work completed or in the process by Ares, the Company intends to move forward with the development of its Utah asset.

 Certain information in this news release may contain forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are often identified by terms such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “anticipate”, “expects” and similar expressions.
