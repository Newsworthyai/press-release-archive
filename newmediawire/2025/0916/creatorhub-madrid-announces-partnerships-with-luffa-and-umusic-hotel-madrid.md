 Luffa Officially Launches Worldwide

 The CreatorHub announcement coincides with the global launch of Luffa, the social operating system for the fan economy. Unlike traditional apps, Luffa isn’t just another place to scroll or stream - it’s a daily destination where creators can own their communities and fans can own their value.

 At its core, Luffa offers a programmable loyalty layer built around meaningful fan actions - chatting with creators, tipping, minting tokens, joining SuperGroups, completing quests, and unlocking exclusive access. Each action is recorded and rewarded, creating a living fan graph that grows richer over time.

 For creators and their teams, Luffa provides a seamless interface to launch campaigns, distribute perks, manage community, and get paid. For fans, it’s a digital passport where loyalty is treated like currency.

 “This is the beginning of a new kind of platform - one that doesn’t just host fan engagement, but powers it,” said Esra Ozturk, Head of Product at Luffa. “Fans want more than feeds and likes. They want connection, recognition, and real participation. Luffa is built to turn those moments into memories that matter - and with CreatorHub and UMusic Hotel Madrid, we’re tapping into an ecosystem at the forefront of music, culture and lifestyle to bring this vision to life.”

 The Connective Tissue Between Physical and Digital Experiences

 Through its partnership with CreatorHub and the UMusic Hotel Madrid, Luffa is helping to build the bridge between in-person and digital fandom. At hotel check-ins, concerts, activations, or even QR codes on merch tables, fans can seamlessly onboard into the Luffa ecosystem in order to receive exclusive rewards, interact with artists, IP and communities that they love.

 With SSN building better attribution and Luffa driving programmable rewards, this composable product ecosystem will serve as a full-stack loyalty and monetization engine for creators, fans, and brands. Together, Luffa, UMusic Hotel Madrid, and SSN are setting the standard for a new kind of fandom - verified, rewarded, and lived across digital and real-world touchpoints.

 Redefining the Future of Cultural Commerce

 By integrating identity, loyalty, and monetization into one seamless experience, Luffa positions itself as the operating system for the fan economy. It isn’t a social app - it’s infrastructure for the next generation of cultural commerce, where memory becomes currency and attention becomes something fans can own.
