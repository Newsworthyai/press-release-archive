# Metavesco Adds Ethereum to Treasury Strategy

CUMMING, GA - July 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, announced today that it has acquired 28 ETH at an average price of $3,595 as part of a tactical expansion of its digital asset strategy.

 While Bitcoin remains the company’s core long-term reserve asset, Ethereum is being added as a high-conviction, opportunistic position based on growing institutional adoption and favorable macro dynamics.

 “I view Bitcoin as our digital gold, a long-term store of value,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “Ethereum is different. I believe it’s emerging as the financial infrastructure layer for a new wave of institutional and traditional finance. As that adoption accelerates, and with ETH’s deflationary model, I see strong upside potential.”

 The move is consistent with Metavesco’s treasury strategy, which prioritizes balance sheet strength, capital flexibility, and non-dilutive value creation for shareholders.

 Tom Lee, Managing Partner at Fundstrat, recently predicted ETH could reach $4,000 in the near term and $10,000–$15,000 by year-end, citing its growing role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized financial assets.“Wall Street is leaning into Ethereum. It’s becoming the backbone of stablecoin-based TradFi,” Lee said (CoinDesk).

 Key Points for Metavesco Co-Owners:

 * Bitcoin is the Foundation. Ethereum is a Strategic Overlay.Bitcoin remains Metavesco’s long-term value anchor. Ethereum provides additional potential for capital appreciation and yield, powered by institutional and macro tailwinds.
* This is Not Trading - and Not a Marriage.Metavesco is not flipping tokens or chasing hype. ETH is a small, deliberate position under active review as part of a broader digital asset strategy.
* Smart Treasury = Business Growth Optionality.BTC and ETH holdings provide Metavesco with non-dilutive capital options, from borrowing to liquidity, that can support core businesses like Epic Labor, Boring Brew, and potential future acquisitions.
