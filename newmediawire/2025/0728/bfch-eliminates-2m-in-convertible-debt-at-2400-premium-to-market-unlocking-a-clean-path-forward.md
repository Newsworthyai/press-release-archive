# BFCH Eliminates $2M in Convertible Debt at 2,400% Premium to Market - Unlocking a Clean Path Forward

CRESTVIEW, FL - July 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTC: BFCH) today announced the full retirement of all outstanding legacy convertible debt obligations, eliminating over $2 million in overhang and setting the stage for a transformative new chapter under the Company’s recently appointed CEO, Dr. Jordan P. Balencic.

 The debt is redeemable to common equity at $0.01 per share, a level that represents a premium of approximately 2,400% above the current market price, and reflects the Company's deliberate restructuring strategy and its focus on restoring shareholder trust through responsible governance.

 Pursuant to the terms of the final settlement:

 * The converting noteholder is subject to a hard cap of 200 million shares of common stock, with no further issuance rights
* All original convertible debt instruments have been fully satisfied and extinguished
* The Company has received a full and irrevocable release of all prior claims and obligations

 “This was the final chapter of the old BFCH,” said Dr. Balencic. “The toxic notes were retired at a premium, with clear limits. This settles the legacy burden that’s inhibited investment and constrained the market’s ability to value us properly. It’s a structural reset.”

 With the capital structure cleaned up, BFCH enters the second half of 2025 with no convertible debt on its balance sheet and total liabilities reduced to under $94,000 - a reduction of more than 95%. The Company anticipates taking steps to further reduce or eliminate these remaining liabilities in the months ahead.

 In the near term, the Company intends to:

 * Submit the necessary documentation to access and update its OTC Markets profile
* Launch a new corporate website, brand identity, and formal communications policy
* Publish a strategic business plan that includes specific uplisting milestones
* Initiate early-stage fundraising discussions to support growth
* Execute a letter of intent (LOI) or memorandum of understanding (MOU) to add at least $1 million in accretive assets to the balance sheet

 Dr. Balencic has also confirmed that he will not take compensation for his role as CEO until key milestones are achieved.
