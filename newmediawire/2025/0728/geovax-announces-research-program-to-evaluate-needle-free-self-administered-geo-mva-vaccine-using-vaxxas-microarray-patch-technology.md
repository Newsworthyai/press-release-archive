# GeoVax Announces Research Program to Evaluate Needle-Free, Self-Administered GEO-MVA Vaccine Using Vaxxas Microarray Patch Technology

Study Aims to Validate Thermostable, Self-Administered MVA-Vaccine Platform for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Immunization

 ATLANTA, GA - July 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigenic vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer, today announced the initiation of a research program to evaluate the immunogenicity and stability of GEO-MVA delivered via Vaxxas’ proprietary high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) platform in preclinical models.

 The proof-of-concept study, conducted at the University of Queensland (UQ) under a research agreement between GeoVax and UniQuest Pty Limited (UQ’s commercialization company), will assess the immune responses, delivery efficiency, and thermostability of GEO-MVA formulated and dried onto HD-MAPs for administration in mice. HD-MAPs offer a needle-free, skin-targeted delivery approach with the potential to enhance immunogenicity and enable distribution without refrigeration.

 “This program represents a potential major step forward in our strategy to expand the versatility of GeoVax’s MVA platform and meet global needs for more accessible, ruggedized, and effective vaccines,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. “Demonstrating that GEO-MVA can be delivered via HD-MAP could lead to more potent immune responses at lower doses, greater thermostability, and eliminate the need for needles - a very compelling profile for both routine immunization and rapid deployment during outbreaks.”

 If successful, the study results will support the development of a thermostable, needle-free GEO-MVA vaccine for pandemic response, biodefense stockpiling, and immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries.

 The HD-MAP platform offers several potential advantages over traditional needle-and-syringe delivery, including:

 * Self-administration in the home, pharmacy, or vaccination hubs;
* Increased patient acceptance, especially among needle-phobic individuals;
* Higher immunogenicity, enabling dose-sparing;
* Thermostability, reducing cold chain reliance;
* Elimination of sharps waste and needle-stick injuries;
* Faster deployment in emergency settings with minimal training requirements.

 The Vaxxas HD-MAP platform has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity in multiple animal model and clinical studies and is being advanced in partnerships with leading pharmaceutical, government entities and foundations. GeoVax recently received favorable scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the development of GEO-MVA. The EMA guidance supports a streamlined regulatory pathway, enabling GeoVax to pursue potential expedited development and approval pathways for GEO-MVA as an additional Mpox vaccine candidate in the EU.

 The current study is supported by GeoVax and conducted by researchers led by A/Prof David Muller and Dr. Chris McMillan at the University of Queensland.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
