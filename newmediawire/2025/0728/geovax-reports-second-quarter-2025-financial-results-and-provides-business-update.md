 ATLANTA, GA - July 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigenic vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, and provided a business update.

 “The second quarter marked a pivotal period for GeoVax, with compelling clinical data and regulatory milestones reinforcing the strength of our pipeline and our focus on accelerating to commercial status,” said David Dodd, GeoVax’s Chairman and CEO. “The favorable European regulatory guidance for GEO-MVA, robust immune responses demonstrated by GEO-CM04S1 in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and the continued progress towards initiation of the Gedeptin® Phase 2 trial highlight our expanding footprint in oncology and global infectious disease preparedness. These achievements reflect our commitment to advancing innovative, vaccines and immunotherapies that address urgent and underserved medical needs.”

 Clinical Trial Progress and Operational Developments

 GEO-MVA

 * Received favorable European Scientific Advice (SA) supporting streamlined development pathway for GEO-MVA based vaccine for the prevention of Mpox and smallpox. The SA supports the suitability of GeoVax’s clinical and nonclinical development strategy. This feedback from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provides clear regulatory alignment and enables an efficient pathway toward potential approval, eliminating multiple development steps commonly required for vaccines. Key highlights below:  EMA confirmed that one Phase 3 immuno-bridging trial, if successful, meets criteria for market authorization in all 27 EU countries, and this guidance coincides with the WHO’s fourth Mpox PHEIC declaration and Clade I outbreaks across multiple continents. GeoVax expects to initiate its Phase 3 trial in 2H 2026.
* GEO-MVA addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $10B+.

 GEO-CM04S1

 * Positive immune response data in CLL patients presented at European Hematology Association (EHA) 2025 Conference. Key findings from the study include:  GEO-CM04S1 demonstrated significantly enhanced T cell responses - specifically IFN-γ secretion and activation-induced markers (AIM+) - compared to a matched cohort receiving an authorized mRNA vaccine. While both vaccines stimulated humoral immune responses, only GEO-CM04S1 elicited statistically significant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N)-specific IgG and T cell responses. The mRNA vaccine failed to meet the pre-defined primary immunogenicity endpoint; as a result, further enrollment is now restricted to the GEO-CM04S1 arm only. Both vaccines were well-tolerated, with no grade ≥3 adverse events reported.
* Highlighted positive findings from studies at Keystone Symposia. This study evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GEO-CM04S1, a clinical-stage multi-antigen MVA-vectored vaccine co-expressing spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in a K18-hACE2 mouse model. Mice were challenged intranasally with either the original B.1 strain or the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant. GEO-CM04S1 conferred full protection against clinical disease, lung injury, and inflammation in both viral challenge models.
* Presented dual protective potential of GEO-CM04S1 at the American Association of Immunology (AAI) 2025 Annual Meeting. The presentation, titled “Immunogenicity of Synthetic MVA-based Vaccine COH04S1 Against SARS-CoV-2 in Post-HCT/CAR-T Patients and Its Cross-Protective Potential Against Mpox” (Abstract Number: 9352), highlighted findings from an the initial segment of an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study in blood cancer patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy that was conducted by investigators at City of Hope Medical Center with the next-generation multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine COH04S1 (licensed by GeoVax as GEO-CM04S1), as well as studies with sera obtained from COH04S1-vaccinated healthy adults and non-human primates demonstrating induction of orthopox-specific and Mpox cross-reactive immune responses.
* Showcased strong clinical results following presentation of multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine at the 25th Annual World Vaccine Congress. The presentation, titled “Phase 2b Study Results That Evaluated and Compared GeoVax’s Multi-Antigen Vaccine Candidate (GEO-CM04S1) to an Approved Vaccine Against COVID-19,” was given by Don J. Diamond, Ph.D. on April 24, 2025. It highlighted results across several Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, including studies involving healthy volunteers as well as immunocompromised patients such as stem cell transplant recipients and those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
* GEO-CM04S1 addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $30B+.

 Gedeptin®

 * Presented clinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The presentation, titled “Viral-Vectored, Gene-Directed Prodrug Therapy (Gedeptin) in Needle-Accessible Solid Tumors,” was delivered by J. Marc Pipas, M.D., Executive Medical Director, Oncology at GeoVax, during the Phase II Clinical Trials 1 Poster Session on April 29, 2025. The session drew significant interest from researchers and clinicians, underscoring the growing recognition of Gedeptin’s therapeutic potential. The corresponding abstract was published in the AACR journal Cancer Research. Key Findings from the Clinical Study include:  Trial Design: Up to five treatment cycles were administered, each consisting of intratumoral (IT) injection of Gedeptin followed by intravenous (IV) administration of fludarabine. Patient Population: Eight heavily pretreated patients (median four prior lines of systemic therapies) were enrolled, including those with squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoepithelial carcinoma. Efficacy & Safety:  Several patients achieved stable disease (SD) despite extensive prior therapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were both 7.0 months. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were minimal, with injection site pain being the most common. Serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in five patients were mostly attributed to the underlying disease.
* Gedeptin addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $15B+.

 Other Corporate Updates

 * Issued a patent covering novel vaccine construct for preventing Malaria infection. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued U.S. Patent No. 12,329,808, from patent application No.18,394,580, titled “Compositions and Methods for Generating an Immune Response to Treat or Prevent Malaria.”
* Issued additional patent claims covering the synergistic combination of Gedeptin therapy with radiation as a targeted approach for solid tumors. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a Notice of Allowance related to U.S. patent application 17/502,101 entitled “Enhanced Therapeutic Usage of a Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase or Nucleoside Hydrolase Prodrug”. The allowed claims further strengthen GeoVax’s intellectual property position in the oncology space.
* Strengthened its leadership team with appointment of Dr. Senthil Ranganathan as Vice President, Technical Development and CMC Operations. Dr. Ranganathan brings over 20 years of experience in biologics development to commercialization across vaccines, cell and gene therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and viral vector products.
