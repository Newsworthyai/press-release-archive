# Sauce Essentials to Activate at Exclusive Summer Haze Event Celebrating SoCal's Cannabis Culture and Community

COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA - July 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sauce Essentials (“Sauce” or “the Company”), one of the fastest growing U.S. premium cannabis brands committed to providing top-quality products at affordable prices, is thrilled to announce its participation in Summer Haze, a one-night-only, invite-only 21+ event taking place Thursday, July 31 at a private estate in Orange County, California.

 Designed as a celebration of Southern California’s vibrant cannabis culture, Summer Haze aims to bring together California’s top budtenders and the industry’s most influential brands for an unforgettable night of music, networking, and hands-on product exploration. The event will focus on the budtenders who fuel the industry’s retail engine by curating experiences and sampling opportunities tailored to their insight, energy and influence.

 At Summer Haze, Sauce Essentials will be featuring an immersive brand activation and exclusive sampling experience, offering attendees a first hand look at what’s made Sauce one of the most recognizable cannabis brands in California. Featuring some of their newest AIO Live Resin and Distillate Vape and Bursts Gummies flavors, Sauce will create a curated space designed for connection, conversation and good times, no matter what your vibe. The team will also be hosting exclusive raffle opportunities at the event for attendees to win some exciting prizes, including a Sauce branded surfboard and skateboard.

 “We’re excited to be part of another Canna Management Group event that puts budtenders at the center of the story,” said Dylan Spencer, Chief Marketing Officer at Sauce Essentials. “Budtenders are that bridge between brands and customers. They’re the ones building trust and answering questions. Events like Summer Haze give us the chance to connect with budtenders directly outside of a typical retail environment and listen to their feedback. Showing up for the people who are on the front lines representing our brand is one of the most important things for us.”

 With curated activations from a select group of cannabis brands, live entertainment and a laid-back Orange County backdrop, Summer Haze promises to be a must-attend event for budtenders shaping the next wave of cannabis culture in California.
