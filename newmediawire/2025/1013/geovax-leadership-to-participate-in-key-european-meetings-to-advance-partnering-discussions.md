# GeoVax Leadership to Participate in Key European Meetings to Advance Partnering Discussions

Executives to Participate at World Vaccine Congress Europe (Amsterdam, Oct 13–16) and BIO-Europe Fall (Vienna, Nov 3–5), and Meet With NGOs, Industry Partners and Academic Collaborators

 ATLANTA, GA - October 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today announced that senior leadership will be in Europe over the coming weeks to advance partnering and collaboration engagement across the Company’s portfolio.

 Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David A. Dodd and John Sharkey, PhD, Vice President, Business Development & Executive Lead for Mpox/Smallpox, together with other members of GeoVax’s senior team, will attend and host meetings at:

 * World Vaccine Congress Europe 2025: October 14-16, 2025 - Amsterdam, Netherlands
* BIO-Europe 2025 Fall: November 3-5, 2025 - Vienna, Austria

 In addition to conference activities, the team will conduct meetings with global NGOs, including WHO, UNICEF, CEPI, Gavi, and the Africa CDC, as well as with established and prospective academic institutional collaborators across Europe.

 “We are focused on solidifying durable relationships that can accelerate development in support of expanded access to critical vaccines and immunotherapies,” said David A. Dodd, Chairman & CEO of GeoVax. “We’re engaging with global health leaders and prospective partners to align on near-term opportunities in mpox/smallpox preparedness, addressing the critically unmet needs of immunocompromised patients relative to COVID-19, expanding the development breadth of Gedeptin® as neoadjuvant cancer therapy, and to explore complementary collaborations across our broader platform.”

 Partnering Focus Areas

 GeoVax will highlight opportunities spanning its pipeline and technology platforms, including (but not limited to):

 * GEO-MVA (Mpox/Smallpox vaccine candidate): U.S.-based MVA program designed to accelerate access to a second-source of the critically needed GEO-MVA vaccine and rapid, scalable MVA manufacturing.
* GEO-CM04S1 (multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine): Designed to elicit robust T-cell and antibody responses; partnering priorities focused on addressing the current unmet needs of an estimated over 400 million immunocompromised patients worldwide.
* Gedeptin® (gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy): A tumor-targeted immuno-oncology approach with potential combination synergies with checkpoint inhibitors, providing a potential new neoadjuvant therapy against solid tumors.
* Broader MVA platform applications: Hemorrhagic fever and Zika programs; continuous cell-line manufacturing and potential technology-transfer collaborations.

 “We continue to receive compelling interest from governments, NGOs, and potential industry collaborators, seeking diversified, resilient vaccine supply and clinically differentiated immunotherapies,” added Dr. John Sharkey. “Our goal is to convert that interest into structured collaborations that accelerate development, manufacturing readiness, and regional availability.”

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
