 HONG KONG - October 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Eco Expo Asia 2025, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd and co-organised by the Environment and Ecology Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), will be held from 28 to 31 October at AsiaWorld-Expo. Exhibitors and buyers can connect via the Click2Match virtual business matching platform from 21 October to 7 November. The last day of the fair, Public Day on 31 October, will be open to the public with complimentary admission.

 HKTDC Deputy Executive Director Jenny Koo said: “President Xi Jinping said in a video address at the United Nations Climate Summit during the annual UN General Assembly meeting that China will, by 2035, reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% from peak levels and will ‘strive to do even better’. This will significantly boost demand for environmental products. Furthermore, the Chief Executive’s 2025 Policy Address has highlighted new directions in green policy, including fostering green and low-carbon living environments, expediting the application of green technologies and promoting the development of the green I&T sector and green and sustainable finance.”

 Ms Koo added: “Marking its 20th edition, this year’s Eco Expo Asia is themed Green Innovations for Carbon Neutrality. As a business platform for ESG and sustainable solutions, the Expo will showcase the latest products and technologies in new energy, green living and environmental protection. This year, Eco Expo Asia will attract over 300 exhibitors from 12 countries and regions, with strong participation from government suppliers from the Chinese Mainland, as well as from ASEAN and Belt and Road countries, helping industries worldwide seize the vast opportunities created by the green economy.”

 Speaking at the press conference, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Department of the HKSAR Government, Dr. Vanessa Au, expressed: “We hope that this year’s Eco Expo Asia will continue its role as a platform for sharing and implementing the latest green technologies and applications. By engaging with visitors from Chinese Mainland and Belt & Road countries, including ASEAN countries, Central Asian countries, South Asian countries and Middle Eastern countries, we seek to collectively address climate change and drive progress towards carbon neutrality. It also aims to foster exchange and co-operation among the government, industry and the community, to work together on exploring ways to promote a green economy and low-carbon living, contributing to Hong Kong’s efforts towards a more sustainable future.”

 Global exhibitors and worldwide pavilions

 This year’s Expo brings together leading international exhibitors. Korea and Italy will stage group participations for the first time, with the Korea pavilion featuring solutions in air purification, deodorisation, water quality management and waste treatment. Norway, the Netherlands and Canada will return following success in previous years. From the Chinese Mainland, participations from Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other Greater Bay Area cities will return, joined by Guangxi, Hunan, Shanghai and Inner Mongolia. The ANSO Environmental Technology Industry Alliance, led by the Alliance of National and International Science Organizations for the Belt and Road Regions (ANSO), together with 11 mainland enterprises, will make its debut, showcasing technologies related to water resources and the atmospheric environment.

 In Hong Kong, a joint government pavilion featuring 11 bureaux and departments, including the Environment and Ecology Bureau, will highlight the latest policies and initiatives.

The Hong Kong Pavilion, supported by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department and coordinated by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, will feature 20 companies, while Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation will lead 10 start-ups to make a joint appearance.

 The Expo is also actively building a platform to support Hong Kong and mainland enterprises to "go global" and explore new opportunities in green trade. Leveraging the HKTDC’s network of 51 offices worldwide, the Expo is actively inviting buyers from the Chinese Mainland and overseas to visit and source at the event. Buyers from across Asia - including Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - as well as from Europe, including Hungary and Poland, will attend.

The zone will also feature various electric vehicles and charging facilities. First-time exhibitor Infore Enviro Technology Group Co., Ltd will display its electric compactor truck.

 The green industry is promoting ESG disclosure and low-carbon transformation and is actively seeking various ESG-related services, as it seeks to foster closer collaboration between industries and financial institutions to accelerate Hong Kong’s development as a green and sustainable finance centre. CECEP (Hong Kong) Investment Co. Ltd. will showcase its innovative tool, EnvAI, which provides businesses with one-stop ESG services, including ESG data collection and analysis, and automated report generation.

 Other exciting activities include the FHKI Q-Mark Low Carbon Restaurant Award 2025 on 28 October, the first day of the Expo. Organised by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Hong Kong Q-Mark Council, the award recognises outstanding commitment to sustainability and low-carbon practices within the restaurant industry, while inspiring positive change and helping shape a sustainable future for dining.

 The 6th Hydrogen Economy Forum will be held on the second day of the Expo, on 29 October. Representatives from Towngas and experts from the Chinese Mainland and overseas - including the China Hydrogen Development and Innovation Alliance for Urban Gas, Veolia and Aerospace Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., Ltd. - will share insights into frontier hydrogen energy technologies and successful case studies, while exploring how cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area can further advance hydrogen applications.

 Moreover, on the second day of the Expo on 29 October, the Experience Sharing Forum on Promoting Environmental Business in Overseas Markets will invite representatives from Belt and Road countries to introduce the latest updates on environmental industry investment policies across different regions. Green technology companies from the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong will also present their latest solutions and share their “go global” experiences to promote regional exchanges and seize new opportunities in green trade.

 To further foster the growth of start-ups in the environmental industry, the Expo has specifically arranged a series of activities to showcase the achievements of Hong Kong’s green start-ups. Among these, the Startup Edge Forum will invite representatives from various environmental fields to share industry developments and future directions.

 Public Day promotes green living

 To encourage the public to participate in environmental initiatives and experience green lifestyles, the last day of the Expo on 31 October will be a Public Day, with complimentary admission for the general public.
