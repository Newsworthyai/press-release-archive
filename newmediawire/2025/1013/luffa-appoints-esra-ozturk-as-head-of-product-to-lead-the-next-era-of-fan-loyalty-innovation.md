# Luffa Appoints Esra Ozturk as Head of Product to Lead the Next Era of Fan Loyalty Innovation

LONDON - October 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Luffa, a decentralized messaging platform built for the fan economy, today announced the appointment of Esra Ozturk as its new Head of Product. Designed with end-to-end encryption and creator-first privacy, Luffa is laying the foundation for a universal loyalty infrastructure that will connect creators, brands, and fans across digital and real-world experiences. Starting on a base level of direct messaging at launch creates the trusted, high-frequency interactions that long-term loyalty is built on. Luffa’s upcoming loyalty features, currently in beta, will expand this foundation into a connected rewards ecosystem for creators and fans. In this role, Ozturk will lead product strategy and execution as the company evolves its secure messaging layer into the next generation of fan-loyalty technology.

 Ozturk brings to Luffa deep experience building global consumer products across social, marketplace, and commerce platforms. At Meta, she helped take Instagram Reels from early experiments to global launch. At Uber, she led safety and quality initiatives that strengthened marketplace integrity, improving driver earnings, reducing cancellations, and building trust across the platform. She later built tools at Zillow that helped agents and loan officers convert more buyers into funded loans, and led machine learning work at Instacart to detect fraud and reduce unnecessary refunds. Her product career began in college, contributing to Snapchat’s story search feature - the foundation for what became Snap Maps. Her career is defined by turning user insight into systems that scale with clarity and impact - the kind of product leadership Luffa needs as it evolves from secure fan communication to a connected loyalty ecosystem.

 “The next generation of loyalty won’t be owned by any single platform,” said Ozturk. “Today, loyalty spans creators, brands, live experiences, and digital communities, but it’s fragmented. At Luffa, we’re starting with secure, decentralized messaging as the backbone, and building toward a portable identity and reward layer that travels wherever fans go. We’re laying the infrastructure that turns engagement into value for creators, brands, and their communities alike.”

 “Esra’s track record of building products people love at global scale, and navigating the complexity of multi-stakeholder platforms, is exactly what we envisioned for this next stage of Luffa’s growth,” said Yu Xiong, founding advisor of Luffa. “As we expand from encrypted messaging into loyalty and rewards, her leadership will help evolve Luffa into the connective infrastructure linking creators, brands, and fans.”

 Luffa recently showcased the power of its platform at CreatorHub Madrid (September 28-30, 2025), an event that united over 50 global creators and local influencers reaching more than five billion monthly impressions. In partnership with UMusic Hotel Madrid, the experience brought together industry leaders, fans, and artists - including Grammy Award–winning artist Joaquina, AI digital artist Tata, and influencers McKenzi Brooke and Adley Kinsman - for a three-day exploration of how technology and culture intersect. The activation marked one of the first public demonstrations of Luffa’s decentralized messaging layer, giving creators a secure channel to connect and collaborate while previewing the company’s upcoming loyalty features.

 Under Ozturk’s leadership, Luffa’s roadmap includes scaling its secure messaging infrastructure, introducing its loyalty and rewards layer, and expanding partnerships across entertainment, hospitality, and live events.
