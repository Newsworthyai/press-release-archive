# Neutra Corp's Subsidiary, Neutra Life Sciences, Adds to Its Site Network With New Joint Venture Partnership in Family Medicine

HOUSTON, TX - October 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neutra Corp (OTC: NTRR) is proud to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Neutra Life Sciences, has expanded its clinical research footprint by securing a new clinical trial site, MediNet Family Care Clinic, which specializes in Internal Medicine/Family Medicine. This strategic move aligns with the company’s ongoing mission to grow its site management organization (SMO) and bring high-quality, community-based research opportunities to diverse patient populations.

 Located in a high-traffic area near the border of Sugar Land and Houston, this Internal Medicine/Family Medicine site is led by an experienced research team with a strong background in conducting clinical trials and delivering consistent, quality data. The site is fully equipped to support a wide range of protocol designs, including Phase II and III studies focused on chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other prevalent therapeutic areas.

 “This new partnership represents another important step in our long-term strategy to grow organically and provide sponsors and CROs with efficient, responsive, and high-performing research sites,” said Sydney Jim, CEO of Neutra Corp. “By expanding into Internal Medicine and Family Medicine, we’re furthering our ability to support diverse protocols while continuing to meet the highest standards of patient care and data integrity.”

 We are pleased to announce that we have engaged a dedicated Investor Relations Firm to strengthen communication and transparency with our shareholders and the broader investment community. This strategic move underscores our commitment to building lasting investor confidence, enhancing market visibility, and providing timely, accurate insights into our company’s growth, performance, and strategic direction. By bringing on an experienced Investor Relations team, we aim to foster stronger partnerships with current and prospective investors as we continue to expand our operations and deliver long-term value.

 Neutra Life Sciences continues to experience steady growth across multiple specialties, with plans to add additional therapeutic areas in the coming quarters. Each new site is carefully selected and supported to ensure optimal performance and alignment with sponsor and CRO expectations.

 With this growth, Neutra Life Sciences is getting ready to launch a new Diabetic Foot Ulcer trial at one of its brand-new sites in Sugar Land, Texas
