# Kamada Expects Third Plasma Collection Site To Support Its Hyper-Immune Plasma Needs And Add Up To $10M In Annual Revenue At Full Capacity

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - From protecting against infections for people who had a solid organ or bone marrow transplant to treating hepatitis B infection, or preventing deadly Rabies disease in individuals who were exposed to a suspected rabid animal, specialty plasma products are used by healthcare providers around the world to save thousands of lives every day. Kamada Ltd. (NASDAQ: KMDA), a global biopharmaceutical company and a leader in the specialty plasma-derived field, is rising up to meet that demand and expanding its specialty hyper-immune plasma collection.

 The company recently announced the opening of its third plasma collection center. The 11,100-square-foot center in San Antonio, Texas, will be operated by the company’s plasma unit and is planned to support as many as 50 donor beds. The facility is projected to collect up to 50,000 liters annually, adding to Kamada’s supply at a time when specialty plasma, particularly hyper-immune plasma, is needed.

 The site requires approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which the company expects within nine to twelve months of submitting applications, which it is targeting during the second half of 2025. The site will be staffed with what Kamada says is a team of skilled and experienced plasma collection specialists.

 Using Human Plasma To Fight Infections, Prevent Disease

 Hyper-immune plasma contains antibodies extracted from a pool of human donors that have high concentrations of specific antibodies. Purified antibodies from hyper-immune plasma, such as anti-rabies and anti-CMV, are used to reduce the risk of infection and the severity of certain diseases.

 “We are extremely pleased to announce the opening of our new state-of-the-art plasma collection center in San Antonio, Texas,” said Amir London, CEO of Kamada. “The opening of this center will expand our collection capacity of specialty plasma, such as Anti-Rabies and Anti-D, for our internal use beyond our existing sites in Beaumont and Houston. The collected specialty plasma will support our increasing demand for hyper-immune plasma and is expected to lower our raw material costs.”

 Mr. London said the new center will also collect normal source plasma to be sold to other companies for the manufacturing of plasma-derived medicines.  Once at full capacity, Kamada expects the center to contribute annual revenues of $8 million to $10 million in sales of normal source plasma.

 Kamada All In With Plasma Therapeutics

 As it stands, to date the FDA has approved six of Kamada's plasma-derived therapeutics, which target rare and underserved conditions such as exposure to potentially rabid animals, lung disease as a result of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), exposure of immune-compromised patients to the Varicella virus and infectious diseases after solid organ transplantation (such as CMV and hepatitis B). By developing its own plasma collection capabilities, Kamada says it reduces some of the dependency on third-party suppliers, expects to improve its cost of goods and can be a supplier for industry peers.

 Last September, Kamada announced the opening of its second plasma collection site in Houston, Texas. Similar to the one opened in San Antonio, the Houston facility is 12,000 square feet, can support over 50 donor beds and has the capacity to collect up to 50,000 liters annually. When announcing that facility, Kamada said it was expected to be one of the largest sites for the collection of specialty plasma in the U.S. Kamada also operates an FDA-licensed plasma collection center in Beaumont, Texas.

 From developing specialty plasma therapeutics to opening plasma collection sites, Kamada is positioning itself to be a leading player in the field of specialty plasma-derived therapeutics.
