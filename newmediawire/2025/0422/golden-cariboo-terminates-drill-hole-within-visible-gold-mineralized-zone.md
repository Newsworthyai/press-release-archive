# Golden Cariboo Terminates Drill Hole Within Visible Gold Mineralized Zone

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE:GCC) (OTC:GCCFF) (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ) announces that the current drill hole QGQ24-21 on the Halo zone, located 5.5 km (3.4 miles) northeast of Hixon, British Columbia on the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property (“the Project”), had to be terminated prematurely within a visible gold (“VG”) bearing mineralized zone for technical reasons at a depth of 310.18 m (1018 ft).

 After drilling 257 m (843 ft) of hanging wall rocks, QGQ24-21 successfully intersected 53 m (174 ft) of continuous strong sericite - iron carbonate altered greenstones hosting an intense stockwork of quartz-carbonate veins with multiple occurrences of VG (April 15, 2025 News Release). The hole was terminated within the mineralized zone due to drill hole instability to prevent the loss of drill equipment. The deepest occurrence of visible gold was found just 1.8 m (5.9 ft) above the end of hole.

 Drill hole QGQ24-21 commenced in December 2024 at an azimuth of 355° and inclination of -45°, but was temporarily halted by mid-December for Christmas break and assessment reporting requirements, and was continued in April 2025. The drill core has been entirely logged and is currently being sampled. Sample shipment to ALS Canada Ltd. for gold and multi-element assays is anticipated within the next few days.

 The next hole is planned to move forward approximately along the trace of QGQ24-21 to intersect the zone up-dip and to the north.

 The technical information in this news release has been reviewed by Jean Pautler, P.Geo., a qualified person with respect to NI 43-101.

It includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 in conjunction with placer mining activities. Hixon Creek, which dissects the old workings, is a placer creek which has seen small-scale placer production since the mid 1860s.
