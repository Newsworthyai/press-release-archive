# Cavitation Technologies, Inc. Announces the Completion of Cavitation Non-Thermal Plasma System to Address the Global Water Crisis

CHATSWORTH, CA - April 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (“CTi” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: CVAT), a leading nano-technology company specializing in innovative flow-through devices and systems for fluid processing applications worldwide, announces a completion of Cavitation Non-Thermal Plasma System. The Company’s disruptive water treatment technology will address the growing global demand for efficient, chemical-free water solutions.

 Water Is the New Gold

 The world is entering an era where clean water is more critical than ever before - not just for agriculture and drinking, but as the backbone of cutting-edge technology. Even the rise of AI (Artificial Intelligence) giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is built on massive water consumption. For example, the researchers estimated that training the GPT-3 language model in Microsoft’s U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater. More critically, the global AI demand is projected to account for 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of half of the United Kingdom.

 In this rapidly shifting landscape, industrial water reuse isn’t just environmentally sustainable - it’s also a smart economic move. CTi’s water treatment systems offers substantial cost savings compared to traditional water remediation processes and disposal methods. As global freshwater scarcity increases and ESG regulations tighten, sustainable technologies developed by CTi are becoming essential.

 Why Plasma Is the Future

 While existing solutions like reverse osmosis (RO), UV disinfection, membrane filtration, and activated carbon adsorption play important roles in water treatment, these technologies come with limitations - from high energy demand and frequent membrane fouling to incomplete PFAS (‘forever chemicals’) removal and chemical dependency.

 Researchers, universities, private companies, and even government agencies like the DoD (Department of Defense) are actively exploring plasma as a next-generation treatment technology (See page 12: Research and Development of New and Emerging Technologies for the Remediation and Disposal of PFAS). Plasma systems offer a chemical-free, low-energy method to break down contaminants that traditional systems struggle with - including PFAS, viruses, and bacteria.

 “I foresee ten years down the line that plasmas will become a bit more mainstream in water treatment, just like UV light is now almost standard in most wastewater plants,” John Foster, professor of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences at the University of Michigan, a leading voice in plasma science.

 Our Technology

 CVAT’s patented Nano Reactor® systems - operating at scalable capacities from 10 to 500 gallons per minute (GPM) - and the company’s newest innovation, the Cavitation Non-Thermal Plasma™ , currently operating at 20 GPM and scalable to a larger flow, are driving disruptive change across the water treatment industry. These advanced systems are designed to eliminate bacteria and viruses, lower TDS levels, and provide a highly promising path for the removal of PFAS - commonly known as “forever chemicals.”Where We’re Creating Change

 CVAT’s technology have active and emerging applications in:

 * Industrial Water & Wastewater – Supporting the reuse of large water volumes by providing efficient, chemical-free treatment systems tailored for industrial operations.
* Agriculture – Plasma-Activated Water (PAW) increases plant growth, reduces pesticide load, and lowers the need for chemical fertilizers.
* Pharmaceuticals – Producing ultra-pure water critical for safe drug development and formulation.
* High-Precision Electronics –Ensuring water purity standards essential for advanced component manufacturing, where even microscopic contaminants can impact performance.
* Desalination – Helping optimize operations by improving system efficiency and longevity while reducing the need for extensive chemical handling.
* PFAS removal – Offering a promising approach to break down and eliminate persistent contaminants that traditional technologies struggle to treat effectively.
* Military – Providing reliable and mobile solutions for water purification and reuse in remote or rapidly changing environments, with minimal logistical needs.

 These industries represent a combined Total Addressable Market (TAM) of over $2.37 trillion, and CTi’s system offers a competitive advantage with low operating costs, minimal chemical use, and scalability.

 Neil Voloshin, CEO, Cavitation Technologies, Inc stated, “The combination of Cavitation with Non-Thermal Plasma is what sets CTi apart - an exceptionally powerful and rare integration in the water treatment space. Over the next several months, we’ll be sharing more about the commercial steps we’re taking to scale up and expand.”
