# KOINFOLD Launches Official Discord Server to Unite and Empower the Crypto Community

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - April 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - KYN Capital Group (OTC: KYNC)

 KOINFOLD has launched an official Discord server designed as a hub for crypto enthusiasts. The KOINFOLD  official Discord community can be accessed here: https://discord.gg/URgYzXeE

 * Interaction with the Core Team: Users can engage directly with other KOINFOLD’s users and KOINFOLD’s team fostering transparency and trust.
* Community Engagement: The platform supports discussions on decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3, and blockchain technology, catering to both beginners and experienced users.
* Events and Updates: The server hosts community-driven initiatives and provides real-time updates on crypto trends, making it a vibrant space for staying informed.
* Security Emphasis: KOINFOLD prioritizes user safety, warning against scams and advising verification of official channels. Admins do not initiate private messages, a critical reminder given the prevalence of phishing in crypto communities.
