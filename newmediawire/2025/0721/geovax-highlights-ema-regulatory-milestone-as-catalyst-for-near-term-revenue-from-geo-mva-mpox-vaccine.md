# GeoVax Highlights EMA Regulatory Milestone as Catalyst for Near-Term Revenue from GEO-MVA Mpox Vaccine

Positive EMA Scientific Advice Positions GeoVax for Expedited European Approval

 ATLANTA, GA - July 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigenic vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer, today reinforced the strategic and commercial significance of the recent positive Scientific Advice (SA) received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its GEO-MVA vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox.

 The EMA’s feedback indicated that a single Phase 3 immuno-bridging trial, bypassing the need for Phase 1 and 2 studies, may be sufficient to support a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under the EU’s centralized procedure. The ability to proceed without Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials substantially reduces development risk and timelines, positioning GeoVax to achieve product commercialization and revenue generation significantly earlier than previously anticipated.

 Immuno-bridging studies allow for vaccine approval by the immune response elicited by a candidate vaccine comparable to that of an already approved vaccine. This approach, when accepted by regulatory authorities, can reduce the need for large-scale efficacy trials, thereby reducing development time while maintaining regulatory standards for safety and immunogenicity.

 “This EMA guidance is more than a regulatory milestone; it represents a potential commercial inflection point,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. “We now have a clear, expedited path to commercialization in one of the world’s largest vaccine markets. With the Phase 3 trial in operational preparation, we are entering a potential revenue acceleration phase supported by growing global demand, regulatory momentum, and our progressing advanced MVA manufacturing platform.”

 Key Investor Highlights:

 * Expedited Approval Path: EMA confirmed that one Phase 3 immuno-bridging trial, if successful, meets criteria for market authorization in all 27 EU countries.
* De-Risked Development: Moving directly to a Phase 3 immuno-bridging trial significantly reduces development timelines, cost, and clinical execution risk.
* Market Timing Advantage: EMA guidance coincides with the WHO’s fourth Mpox PHEIC declaration and Clade I outbreaks across multiple continents.
* First-Mover Opportunity: GEO-MVA would be the only MVA-based Mpox vaccine alternative to Bavarian Nordic’s Imvanex/Imvamune, addressing global supply constraints and monopolistic risk.
* Revenue Visibility: GeoVax expects to initiate its Phase 3 trial in 2H 2026.
* Manufacturing Readiness: Current CEF-based production supports near-term supply; transition to AGE1 cell line to enable scalable, cost-efficient output for global procurement.

 GeoVax is actively engaging with European regulatory bodies, public health stakeholders, and procurement agencies to advance GEO-MVA access and funding partnerships in support of both public health and commercial goals.

 “From an investor perspective, this EMA development potentially shortens our path to revenue generation and significantly enhances our strategic value,” said Dodd. “GeoVax is now on the radar as a viable near-term commercial vaccine company, not just a development-stage biotech.”

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
