 FISHERS, IN - July 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to provide the investment community with updates to the Company’s continued investment into the rare earth and critical mineral industry through a diverse and transformational deployment of capital in companies such as Advanced Magnet Lab, Inc. (AML, www.mitusmagnets.com), NeoRe SpA, ReElement Technologies, and other current portfolio companies of Royalty Management and other pipeline opportunities that are currently under consideration.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “We are building a robust and diverse portfolio of high value investments in the rare earth and critical mineral sectors that are creating the “mine-to-magnet” industry within the United States and allied countries. Royalty Management is doing this through investment in top tier companies and projects that can link together the complete package of rare earth mines and reserves, processing and refining capabilities, and coupling together high value technologies in this sector.”

 Tom continued, “AML is an example of one of our earlier rare earth investments, and since our partnership with this company and its cutting edge intellectual property, AML has made significant strides to reshape how the industry manufacturers and utilizes permanent magnets and rare earth materials to make the next generation of technologies incorporating cost effective magnet designs. They are one of the only players in the United States that has actually made a rare earth magnet domestically, and remarkably, can do so cost effectively for their high-end customers. Recently, AML demonstrated its proprietary PM-360 magnet for use on an axial flux motor for the United States Department of Defense, showcasing the company’s cutting-edge technology and strategic importance to defense, aerospace, and high-end applications.”

 Royalty Management has an investment in AML through both equity derivative securities and through sponsored research with AML that gives the Company a royalty on certain sales of magnets utilizing developed intellectual property at AML.

 NeoRe SpA

 NeoRe’s La Marigen Project consists of five license areas within ionic adsorption clay deposits that contain meaningful amounts of valuable rare earth elements. It also comprises 74 exploration applications and four granted exploration concessions covering over 56,300 acres of mining rights, located 50 miles north of Chile’s second largest city, Concepciòn, a major industrial city with multiple ship loading terminals. The management and operational team at NeoRe has over a decade of experience with the successful evaluation, definition and development of ionic adsorption clay deposits with strong in-country technical relationships and have been conducting surface exploration and test work across the La Marigen region for the past three years. While currently under permitting and development, NeoRe is looking to accelerate the commercialization of La Marigen Project through a combination of private sector investment, such as that from Royalty Management, and governmental support. NeoRe has also recently signed a letter of intent with ReElement Technologies Corporation to incorporate localized processing and refining into La Marigen project, thereby providing unique commercialization opportunities and enhanced viability for the project as compared to other regional deposits of similar nature.

 Royalty Management holds a structured investment warrant that allows the Company to participate in the upside equity value of NeoRe as the company mines various rare earth elements.

 ReElement Technologies Corp.

 A partially owned portfolio company of American Resources Corporation, is a leading provider of high-performance refining capacity for rare earth and critical battery elements. Its multi-mineral, multi-feedstock platform technology focuses on the refining of recycled material from rare earth permanent magnets and lithium-ion batteries, concentrated ores and brines, as well as coal-based waste streams and byproducts to create a cost effective and environmentally-safe, circular supply chain. ReElement (www.reelementtech.com) has developed its innovative and scalable “Powered by ReElement” process which collaboratively utilizes its exclusively licensed intellectual property within its partners’ material processing flow sheets to more efficiently support the global supply chain’s growing demand for magnet and battery-grade products.

 Royalty Management holds an investment in sponsored research to yield intellectual property utilizing chromatography to concentrate and purify ores and recycled materials containing the platinum group metals, gold, and silver, more cost-effectively, more efficiently, and with less environmental impact than current refining methods
