# Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter Financial Results

BEDMINSTER, NJ - July 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select Market: PGC) (the "Company") announces its second quarter 2025 financial results.

 This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Q2 2025 Investor Update, a copy of which is available on our website at www.peapackprivate.com and via a Current Report on Form 8-K on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.

 Deposits grew to $6.4 billion as of June 30, 2025, which represents an increase of $707 million, or 12%, over the last twelve months. During the second quarter of 2025, there were newly funded accounts of $282 million at an average weighted cost of 1.88%. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $53 million during the current period and have grown by 30% over the last year.

 The Company recorded net income of $7.9 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.45 for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to net income of $7.6 million and diluted EPS of $0.43 for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

 Net interest income increased $2.8 million, or 6%, on a linked quarter basis to $48.3 million for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $45.5 million for the first quarter of 2025. The growth in net interest income was driven by improvement in the yield on average interest earning assets, as well as continued improvement in the net interest margin. The net interest margin increased to 2.77% for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to 2.68% for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 and 2.25% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

 Douglas L. Kennedy, President and CEO, said, “Our Metro New York expansion continues to deliver strong results. We’ve had great success driving deposit growth at a favorable mix. In less than the two years since the initial hiring of experienced private banking teams in New York City, we have successfully on-boarded over 700 new relationships with more than $1.3 billion in new core relationship deposit balances and $464 million in loan balances. This expansion initiative has resulted in an increase of over 30% in our employee headcount. However, we have managed to deliver a third consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.”

 Mr. Kennedy also noted, “In line with our expansion strategy, we have added five production teams in Long Island during the second quarter. The addition of these new teams combined with our re-branding to Peapack Private Bank & Trust earlier this year demonstrates the evolution of our Company to become the premier boutique private bank in Metro New York.”

 The following are select highlights for the period ended June 30, 2025:

 Wealth Management:

 * AUM/AUA in our Wealth Management Division totaled $12.3 billion at June 30, 2025 compared to $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024.

 * Total loans increased $304 million to $5.8 billion at June 30, 2025 from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2024.

* Fee income on unused commercial lines of credit totaled $869,000 for Q2 2025.
* The net interest margin ("NIM") was 2.77% for Q2 2025, an increase of 9 basis points compared to 2.68% for Q1 2025.

 Capital Management:

 * Tangible book value per share increased 4% to $33.19 per share at June 30, 2025 compared to $31.89 at December 31, 2024. Book value per share increased 4% to $35.71 per share at June 30, 2025 compared to $34.45 at December 31, 2024. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the reconciliation tables included in this release for further detail.
* At June 30, 2025, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio stood at 9.99% for Peapack Private Bank & Trust (the "Bank") and 8.94% for the Company. The Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio was 12.29% for the Bank and 10.99% for the Company at June 30, 2025. These ratios remain significantly above well capitalized standards, as capital continues to benefit from net income generation.

 SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY DETAILS:

 Wealth Management

 AUM/AUA in the Bank’s Wealth Management Division increased to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2025 compared to $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024. For the June 2025 quarter, the Wealth Management Team generated $15.9 million in fee income, compared to $15.4 million for the March 31, 2025 quarter and $16.4 million for the June 2024 quarter.

 John Babcock, President of the Bank's Wealth Management Division, noted, “Q2 2025 saw continued strong client inflows driven by new accounts and client additions of $193 million. Our new business pipeline is healthy, and we continue to remain focused on delivering excellent service and advice to our clients. Our highly skilled wealth management professionals, our fiduciary powers and expertise, and our financial planning capabilities combined with our high-touch client service model distinguishes us in our market and continues to drive our growth and success.”

 Loans / Commercial Banking

 Total loans increased $304 million, or 5%, to $5.8 billion at June 30, 2025, compared to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2024, primarily driven by multifamily and commercial and industrial loan originations during the quarter. The increase in multifamily lending was supported by stronger demand as rates have become more attractive, while C&I growth was driven by business expansion and capital investment. Total C&I loans and leases at June 30, 2025 were $2.5 billion or 44% of the total loan portfolio.

 Mr. Kennedy noted, “We are proud to have built a leading middle-market commercial banking franchise, as evidenced by our C&I loan portfolio and complimented by Treasury Management services, Corporate Advisory and SBA businesses. These business lines fit perfectly with our private banking business model and will continue to generate solid production going forward. During the current year, we have originated loans that carried an average spread of more than 450 basis points above our current cost of funds.”

 Net Interest Income (NII)/Net Interest Margin (NIM)

 The Company’s NII of $48.3 million and NIM of 2.77% for Q2 2025 increased $2.8 million and 9 basis points from NII of $45.5 million and NIM of 2.68% for the linked quarter (Q1 2025) and increased $13.2 million and 52 basis points from NII of $35.0 million and NIM of 2.25% compared to the prior year period (Q2 2024). Our single point of contact private banking strategy and New York City expansion continues to deliver lower-cost core deposit relationships resulting in consistent improvement in our net interest margin.

 Funding / Liquidity / Interest Rate Risk Management

 Total deposits increased $234 million to $6.4 billion at June 30, 2025 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2024. The overall growth in deposits has strengthened balance sheet liquidity and reduced reliance on outside borrowings and other non-core funding sources. There were no outstanding overnight borrowings at June 30, 2025.

 At June 30, 2025, the Company’s balance sheet liquidity (investments available for sale, interest-earning deposits and cash) totaled $1.1 billion, or 15% of total assets. The Company maintains additional liquidity resources of approximately $3.5 billion through secured available borrowing facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The available funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve are secured by the Company’s loan and investment portfolios. The Company's total on and off-balance sheet liquidity totaled $4.6 billion at June 30, 2025, which amounts to 277% of the total uninsured/uncollateralized deposits currently on the Company’s balance sheet.

 Income from Capital Markets Activities

 Noninterest income from Capital Markets activities (detailed below) totaled $799,000 for the June 2025 quarter compared to $455,000 for the March 2025 quarter and $586,000 for the June 2024 quarter.

 Other Noninterest Income (other than Wealth Management Fee Income and Income from Capital Markets Activities)

 Other noninterest income was $4.7 million for Q2 2025 compared to $3.0 million for Q1 2025 and $4.6 million for Q2 2024. Q2 2025 included a gain of $875,000 related to an early lease termination for a branch location. Prior quarters included a loss of $415,000 in Q1 2025 and income of $1.6 million in Q2 2024 recorded by the Equipment Finance Division related to equipment transfers to lessees upon the termination of leases. Additionally, Q2 2025 included $869,000 of unused line fees compared to $932,000 for Q1 2025 and $786,000 for Q2 2024.

 Operating Expenses

 Total operating expenses were $51.9 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $49.4 million for the first quarter of 2025 and $43.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase during the second quarter was primarily driven by expenses associated with the Company’s ongoing expansion into New York City, increased health insurance costs, and annual merit increases. The addition of production teams in Long Island also contributed to the growth in operating expenses.

 Mr. Kennedy noted, “We continue to make investments related to our strategic decision to expand into Metro New York City and are confident that these investments will position us for future growth and profitability, which will ultimately translate to increased shareholder value. We continue to look for opportunities to create efficiencies and manage expenses throughout the Company while investing in enhancements to the client experience."

 Income Taxes

 The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was 29.5%, as compared to 27.3% for the March 2025 quarter and 21.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The June 2024 quarter included a benefit related to the Company's deferred tax assets associated with a surtax imposed by the State of New Jersey in June 2024. Excluding such a benefit, the effective tax rate for the June 2024 quarter would have been approximately 29.0%.

 Asset Quality / Provision for Credit Losses

 Nonperforming assets increased to $115.0 million, or 1.60% of total assets, at June 30, 2025, as compared to $97.2 million, or 1.36% of total assets, at March 31, 2025. The increase in nonperforming assets during the second quarter was driven by the addition of two commercial and industrial relationships totaling $14.5 million and one multifamily loan totaling $4.8 million. Multifamily loans represent approximately 49% of nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2025. Loans past due 30 to 89 days and still accruing decreased to $15.5 million, or 0.27% of total loans, at June 30, 2025 compared to $28.3 million, or 0.49% of total loans, at March 31, 2025. Criticized and classified loans increased to $232.7 million at June 30, 2025, reflecting an increase of $15.2 million as compared to $217.5 million at March 31, 2025. The Company currently has no loans or leases on deferral and still accruing.

 For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the provision for credit losses was $6.6 million compared to $4.5 million for the March 2025 quarter and $3.9 for the June 2024 quarter. The provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2025 was driven by deterioration in key economic model drivers and an increase in specific reserves for one equipment financing relationship of $5.8 million.

 At June 30, 2025, the allowance for credit losses was $81.8 million (1.40% of total loans), compared to $75.2 million (1.31% of total loans) at March 31, 2025, and $68.0 million (1.29% of total loans) at June 30, 2024.

 Mr. Kennedy noted, “We continue to closely monitor asset quality metrics. We believe that most of our credit issues in the multifamily loan portfolio are isolated to a small number of specific borrowers and sponsors. We continue to work through each credit individually, while building appropriate reserve coverage. All of the multifamily loans that repriced in 2024 have continued to make their scheduled payments despite the higher rate environment."

 Capital

 The Company’s capital position increased during the second quarter of 2025 due to net income of $7.9 million and positive movement in accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.1 million related to the fair value of the Company’s investment securities portfolio due to the interest rate environment, which was partially offset by the repurchase of 100,000 shares through the Company's repurchase program at a total cost of $2.8 million.

 Tangible book value per share increased 4% to $33.19 per share at June 30, 2025 from $31.89 at December 31, 2024. (Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the reconciliation tables included in this release for further detail.) Book value per share increased 4% to $35.71 per share at June 30, 2025 compared to $34.45 at December 31, 2024. The Company’s and Bank’s regulatory capital ratios as of June 30, 2025 remain strong. Where applicable, such ratios remain well above regulatory well capitalized standards.

 The Company employs quarterly capital stress testing modeling of an adverse case and severely adverse case. In the most recently completed stress test (as of March 31, 2025), the Bank remains well capitalized over a two-year stress period.

 On June 26, 2025, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on August 21, 2025 to shareholders of record on August 7, 2025.

 PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION

 Tangible book value per share and tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which we calculate by dividing shareholders’ equity by common shares outstanding at period end. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.

 The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to recurring revenue. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses, excluding other real estate owned provision, as determined under GAAP, by net interest income and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains/(losses) on loans held for sale at lower of cost or fair value and excluding net gains on securities from this calculation, which we refer to below as recurring revenue. We believe that this provides a reasonable measure of core expenses relative to core revenue.

 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios because our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titles measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible common equity, tangible book value per share and efficiency ratio to the underlying GAAP numbers is set forth below.
