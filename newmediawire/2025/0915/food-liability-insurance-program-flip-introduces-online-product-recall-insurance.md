# Food Liability Insurance Program (FLIP) Introduces Online Product Recall Insurance

Food and beverage entrepreneurs can now protect their businesses from the financial impact of product recalls with easy online coverage.

 PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH - September 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Food Liability Insurance Program (FLIP) is thrilled to announce it is adding product recall insurance to its host of coverage options. This essential coverage is available to purchase online, eliminating the need for food and beverage business owners to go through an agent.

 Customers can add product recall coverage to any FLIP general liability policy for as little as $109 per year. This budget-friendly coverage is the only 100% online product recall policy for food and beverage businesses on the market, making it easier and more affordable for entrepreneurs to get the protection they need.

 FLIP’s Product Recall coverage highlights:

 * 100% online purchase process for a convenient, hassle-free experience
* Coverage tailored for small to mid-sized food and beverage businesses
* Covers expenses related to voluntary and involuntary recalls
* Two coverage limits for business owners to choose from ($10,000 aggregate or $25,000 aggregate)

 The number of food recalls rose 15% between 2020 and 2024, continuing an upward trend in recent years. Roughly 300 food recalls took place in 2024, leading to nearly 1,400 reported illnesses, 487 hospitalizations, and 19 deaths. Undeclared allergens, Listeria, and Salmonella topped the list of leading causes. These statistics are a major concern for food and beverage business owners who face catastrophic expenses while handling a recall.

 “Adding product recall insurance demonstrates FLIP’s commitment to supporting food and beverage entrepreneurs through every stage of their business,” said Daryle Stafford, President and CEO of FLIP. “Product recalls place a serious financial burden on small businesses, potentially forcing them to shut down. We’ve made it easier than ever for these entrepreneurs to protect themselves from the increasing threat of recalls with a budget-friendly option they can purchase online, saving them time and money.”

 FLIP streamlines insurance for food and beverage entrepreneurs by allowing them to bundle several types of liability coverages with one trusted provider. To purchase product recall coverage, business owners must have an active general liability policy or bundle one with their recall insurance during checkout.
