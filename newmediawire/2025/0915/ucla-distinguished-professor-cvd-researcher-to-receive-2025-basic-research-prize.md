# UCLA Distinguished Professor, CVD Researcher to Receive 2025 Basic Research Prize

DALLAS, TEXAS - September 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Peter Tontonoz, M.D., Ph.D., the Frances and Albert Piansky Endowed Chair and distinguished professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and of biological chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), David Geffen School of Medicine and UCLA Health, will receive the Basic Research Prize from the American Heart Association during its Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, to be held Nov. 7-10, 2025, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Dr. Tontonoz will be recognized with the award during the Presidential Session on Sunday, Nov. 9.

 A former Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a member of the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Medicine, Dr. Tontonoz has made important contributions to the understanding of cholesterol, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism in the body. His laboratory work has helped uncover how the body keeps fat levels in balance, from individual cells to entire organ systems, helping scientists and doctors develop better treatments for heart disease, diabetes and other conditions.

 “Dr. Tontonoz’s research has transformed the scientific understanding of lipid metabolism and its role in cardiometabolic disease. His scientific contributions to this important heart health factor impact every individual,” said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association’s 2025-2026 volunteer president, executive director for Northwell’s Katz Institute for Women’s Health, senior vice president of Women’s Health at Northwell, the Partners Council Professor of Women’s Health and professor of cardiology at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. “He is widely regarded as a brilliant, innovative and respected leader in cardiovascular research and well deserving of this year’s American Heart Association Scientific Sessions Basic Research Award.”

 Dr. Tontonoz’s foundational discoveries in cholesterol and lipid metabolism are transforming how heart disease and metabolic disorders are understood and treated. Among his most impactful contributions is the identification of an E3 ligase that targets and degrades the LDL receptor, which opened new avenues for cholesterol-lowering therapies beyond statins. In addition, his work on the nuclear receptor Liver X Receptor (LXR) demonstrated the intersection between immunology and metabolism, helping to establish the field of immunometabolism. He also discovered important membrane phospholipid remodeling enzymes that affect intestinal and liver physiology, and most recently, characterized a novel cholesterol transfer protein, Aster, which moves cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum and is a key factor in lipid uptake from the diet. Together, these insights have deepened the understanding of cardiovascular and metabolic disease, paving the way for more precise and effective treatments that can help improve outcomes for millions of patients.

 “It’s a privilege to be recognized by the Association, a vital partner in advancing cardiovascular science,” said Dr. Tontonoz. “Lipids such as cholesterol are critical determinants of cardiovascular disease, but there is still much to learn about how they affect the body. The mission of my work is to illuminate the intricate ways fat-related processes influence both normal tissue function and disease pathology in hopes of finding new ways to prevent or treat cardiovascular conditions.”

 Beyond his many laboratory achievements, Dr. Tontonoz has mentored multiple scientists who now lead successful research groups throughout the scientific community. He also serves on several National Institutes of Health (NIH) study sections and on the editorial boards for several peer-review scientific journals, including the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Genes & Development.

 Dr. Tontonoz earned his medical degree and Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School, and his bachelor’s degree from Wesleyan University. He showed remarkable promise very early in his scientific journey. As a graduate student, he published 12 scientific papers, including one that identified a protein called PPAR-gamma as the master regulator of adipose tissue development. He also identified another protein, now called SREBP1c, which controls fat production in the body. Since then, he has been cited in more than 220 peer-reviewed articles. He is a member the American Society of Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians.
