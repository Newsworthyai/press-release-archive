# GeoVax Showcases Positive Phase 2 Data for GEO-CM04S1 in CLL Patients at the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Conference

Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Outperforms mRNA Comparator; Enrollment Now Limited to GEO-CM04S1 Arm

 ATLANTA, GA - September 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today showcased positive interim results for its lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, GEO-CM04S1 at the XXI International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL 2025) in Krakow, Poland.

 The presentation by Alexey V. Danilov, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Hematology and Transplantation at City of Hope, detailed data from an ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial (NCT05672355) comparing GEO-CM04S1 to a standard-of-care mRNA vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

 Key Takeaways

 * Differentiated Performance: The proportion of CLL patients receiving GEO-CM04S1 that achieved the study’s primary immune endpoint met the statistical requirement to continue enrollment, while those in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine arm did not.
* Enrollment Shifted to GEO-CM04S1: Following interim analysis and following the recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board, further enrollment is proceeding exclusively in the GEO-CM04S1 arm.
* Durable Market Potential: CLL patients represent a high-need, underserved market where first-generation COVID-19 vaccines are often inadequate.
* Favorable Safety Profile: Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse events reported.

 “These data reinforce the value proposition of our multi-antigen MVA platform,” said David Dodd, Chairman & CEO of GeoVax. “Immunocompromised patients, including those with CLL, have not been adequately protected by current vaccines. GEO-CM04S1 is demonstrating the ability to overcome this gap, representing not only a clinical breakthrough but also a compelling commercial opportunity.”

 About GEO-CM04S1

 GEO-CM04S1 is a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine built on a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector. Unlike first-generation vaccines, GEO-CM04S1 encodes both the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to drive broad, cross-variant, and durable immune protection. The vaccine is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials:

 1. As a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients with blood cancers or post-transplant status,
2. As a booster in CLL patients, and
3. As a more robust COVID-19 booster in previously mRNA-vaccinated healthy adults.

 Strategic Opportunity

 With millions of immunocompromised patients worldwide, including those with CLL and other hematologic malignancies, GEO-CM04S1 addresses a significant unmet medical and commercial need. The vaccine’s ability to induce nucleocapsid-specific responses sets it apart from existing single-antigen mRNA products, positioning GeoVax to lead in a multi-billion-dollar market segment where durable protection remains elusive.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
