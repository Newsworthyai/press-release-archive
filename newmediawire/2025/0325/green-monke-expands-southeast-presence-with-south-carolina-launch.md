# Green Monke Expands Southeast Presence With South Carolina Launch

With This Launch, Green Monke's Portfolio of Premium Hemp Beverages are now Available to a Growing Number of Consumers Across 9 States

 CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA - March 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Green Monke USA (“Green Monke”), an award-winning hemp-D9 beverage brand, has entered into a distribution agreement with Southern Horizon Logistics in partnership with Southern Crown Partners, the premier beer distributor in South Carolina. Green Monke has now fulfilled the first purchase orders, delivering the brand’s full portfolio of 8 SKUs - including its flagship, Green Monke Happy Soda line, and the Cookies by Green Monke collaboration.

 “With Southern Crown, we’re not just expanding access to premium hemp-derived beverages - we’re leading the charge. Our Happy Soda line offers a refreshing, social, alcohol alternative, while Cookies by Green Monke is a bold tribute to THC enthusiasts, delivering cultivar-inspired flavors that set a new standard for THC beverages,” said Pat Gleeson, CEO of Green Monke. “Partnering with Cookies - the most recognized cannabis brand worldwide -gives us unmatched cultural credibility. This collaboration bridges legacy connoisseurs and curious newcomers, ensuring Southern Crown stays ahead in curating the best THC beverage portfolio on the market.”

 This launch builds upon Green Monke’s successful introduction in Georgia last fall, further establishing its presence in the Southeast and comes at a pivotal time as South Carolina implements new regulations clarifying the legality of hemp-derived THC products. In a recent opinion, State Solicitor General Robert Cook confirmed that beverages compliant with the 2018 Farm Bill, including those adhering to delta-9 THC limits, are fully legal. This regulatory clarity has created a stable framework for businesses like Green Monke to confidently expand within the state, offering retailers and consumers new, popular, and innovative products.

 Green Monke’s Expanding National Footprint

 Green Monke’s rapid expansion continues as the brand reaches new markets, where it is available in over nine states, including Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Minnesota, Wisconsin and, now, South Carolina, among others. With this latest launch, Green Monke’s innovative hemp-derived THC beverages are now accessible to a combined population of more than 80 million consumers, reinforcing the brand’s commitment to bring its high-quality and award-winning alcohol alternatives to an ever-growing audience.

 This milestone underscores Green Monke’s mission to lead the THC beverage category, offering an inclusive and enjoyable experience for both seasoned consumers and newcomers alike. As the brand extends its footprint across the country, its presence can now be felt in a diverse range of locations - from liquor stores and major retailers to bars, restaurants, and event venues like Enmarket Arena and The Pabst Theater Group properties.

 By building strong distribution partnerships and securing placements in these high-traffic environments, Green Monke ensures that its expanding portfolio - including the signature Happy Soda line and the exclusive Cookies by Green Monke collaboration - continues to set the standard for quality, taste, and cultural relevance in the hemp beverage market.
