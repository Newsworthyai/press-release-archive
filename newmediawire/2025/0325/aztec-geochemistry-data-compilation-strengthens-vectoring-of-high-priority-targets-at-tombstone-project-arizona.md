# Aztec Geochemistry Data Compilation Strengthens Vectoring of High Priority Targets at Tombstone Project, Arizona

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Aztec Minerals Corp. (AZT: TSX-V, OTCQB: AZZTF) (“Aztec” or the “Company”) announces the results of recent data compilation and analysis of RC drilling, surface channel sampling, and 3D data modelling at the Tombstone Property in Southeastern Arizona, USA.  The data analysis has enhanced the understanding of the Multi-Element (“ME”) geochemical relationships with the quartz-rich intrusive dikes and gold-silver mineralization in the main exploration areas, with implications for potential CRD mineralization below the near-surface gold-silver oxide mineralization.  Aztec has now integrated the combined 2020-2024 drilling and surface ME and 3D modelling exploration data producing several distinct geochemical relationships and has provided vectors for high priority, shallow, oxide gold-silver mineralization and CRD targeting at the property.

 The compilation of the data for the shallow, <250m depths of the project positions the Quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP) dikes in relation with the Gold, Silver and ME mineralization in distinct patterns.  For gold, the relationship is strongest in the Contention Pit and its QFP dike swarm whereas silver is strong throughout the property where drilled, suggesting two separate phases of mineralization (Figure 1).

 Figure 1: Gold vs Silver Average Drillhole Grades

 Copper and molybdenum distributions are interpreted to be related to two stages of metallization, with the Contention QFP dike swarm remobilizing an older base metal copper-molybdenum stage (potential CRD) within its area of influence, strongly depleting molybdenum (Figure 2).

 Figure 2: Copper vs Molybdenum Average Drillhole Grades

 Lead and zinc are frequently in close proximity, and zinc appears to be partly remobilized by the Contention QFP dike swarm; however, lead appears to be steady or even enriched by the later metallization stage (Figure 3).

 Figure 3: Lead vs Zinc Average Drillhole Grades

 Manganese is a very strong distal indicator and vector for CRD mineralization, while antimony is a strong indicator for gold mineralization in various environments from epithermal down to orogenic/catothermal.  There is again evidence of duality of stages for the mineralization values at the Contention QFP dike swarm, with manganese depleted/remobilized relative to the rest of the property with antimony appearing to be enriched, potentially pairing it with gold and possibly lead (Figure 4).Figure 4: Manganese and Antimony Average Drillhole Grades

 There is strong evidence of two stages of metallization which is supported by field and logging observations of a later stage of dark, chalcedonic quartz cutting the white, subhedral to euhedral, crystalline quartz veining that predominates in the property.  The Westside Area appears to have a different tenor in its silver and base metals then the Contention Main Area, and the discovery drillhole TR24-13 demonstrates the Westside Area carries significant exploration potential.

 Future exploration is expected to incorporate a thorough structural study of the dikes, fissures and anticlines present at the property.  Noting it has been demonstrated by Aztec that the QFP dikes and their often adjoining hydrothermal breccias (HBX) do have pinches and swellings with plunges.  It is planned to develop a model for the plunge of the main body of the QFP dike swarm with the HBX for exploring to depth, >300 m.

 The 2024 exploration program developed a stronger understanding of the district’s shallow gold-silver mineralization and has substantiated the 3D modeling generated to date.  The program also helped substantiate the 2020 geophysical AMT survey identification of anomalous conductivity as possible mineralization at depth in the southern and central portion of the project.  Geologic modeling for the Westside zone was successful with blind targeting and confirmed the historic reporting of underground mine workings in addition to Aztec’s modeling.  The Westside zone’s first pass exploration drilling program encountered oxide silver-gold mineralization in every drillhole to date, nearly doubling the area of drill demonstrated exploration potential from the Contention zone alone.

 The construction of the Tombstone 3D model of the mine workings and geology of the principal portion of the Tombstone district consists of the digitization of the historic maps and sections of the underground workings, stopes, drill holes and geology, geolocating them to the current surface and geology and geochemistry, and then interpreting/analyzing the results and developing both shallow and deep targeting.  It was a successful tool in the targeting of the 2024 RC drilling program, such as the discovery hole TR24-13 on the Westside Anticline where an old mine working was intercepted within less than a meter of projected intercept.

 Tombstone Project Overview

 Aztec holds a 77.7% interest in the Tombstone Property Joint Venture, which includes most of the original patented mining claims in the main district as well as some recently acquired properties.

 The main target of the 2024 drill program was to continue testing the shallow, bulk tonnage, potentially heap leachable, mesothermal gold-silver oxide mineralization adjacent and below the previously mined Contention pit by step-out drilling.  Future drilling is expected to focus on strike and dip extensions of the shallow oxide mineralization, and move deeper to test for larger, deeper “Taylor-type” lead-zinc-silver CRD targets along and adjacent to the Contention structure.

 The Tombstone project is located 100 kilometers (km) southeast of Tucson, Arizona and covers much of the historic Tombstone silver district.  Tombstone is renowned for its high grade, oxidized, silver-gold mesothermal stringer lode veins, hydrothermal breccias and manto CRD orebodies that were mined in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.  The historic silver production in the Tombstone district from 1878 to 1939 was estimated at 32 million ounces and 250,000 ounces of gold(2).

 The district geology consists of a mix of shallow-level, oxidized Au-Ag and base metal deposits related to CRD and skarns hosted in folded and thrusted sediments, intrusive dikes, and lode veins, and as well the under explored, sulfide versions located below the water table.

 Host rocks to the mineralization are primarily the clastic sediments of the lowest portion of the Cretaceous Bisbee Formation.  Between 50 and 300 meters (m) in depth, the Bisbee is underlain by approximately two kms thick of the same Paleozoic carbonate formations that host the 110 MT Hermosa-Taylor zinc-lead-silver deposit of South32 located 60 km southwest of Tombstone(3).**

 Aztec believes that the historic silver mines at Tombstone could be related to a much larger mesothermal system with CRD mineralization below the old mines.  Since 2017, Aztec has completed geological mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveying to identify the most prospective areas for Au-Ag mineralization around and below the Contention open pit, and CRD zinc-lead-copper-silver-gold mineralization below the entire district.  Aztec management views the district as highly prospective for the discovery of mesothermal and CRD mineralization.

 Note: Gold equivalents are calculated using a 80:1 silver:gold ratio in 2020, 2023 and 2024, and a 70:1 silver:gold ratio in 2021.  Reported lengths are apparent widths, not true widths.  The Contention Au-Ag mineralization zones are generally west dipping at around 60-80 degrees, associated with the quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes and hydrothermal breccias.  However, these dikes also extend as sills in shallow angles out from the Contention fault along fold noses in the Bisbee clastic sediments so the full range of mineralization dips vary from 20 to 80 degrees.  True widths for the apparent mineralization intersection widths of the drill holes approximately range from 50 to 100% of the apparent widths, with the norm for the mineralized true widths being 60 to 90% of the apparent widths. Please see summary news releases dated: July 5, 2023, December 7, 2021, and January 12, 2021.  Assumed economic cutoffs for reporting of 0.1 gpt Au and 8 gpt Silver.

 The company uses quality assurance-quality control as part of its sampling-assaying-assessments in conjunction with its exploration sampling programs.  Samples and their collection are controlled by an industry standard conforming QAQC program including insertions of certified standards, blanks and sample duplicates.  The samples are being regularly shipped to and received by the Bureau Veritas Minerals laboratory in Hermosillo, Mexico for geochemical analysis.

 Core and RC drilling samples are continuously collected over 5-foot (1.52m) sample intervals from all drill holes. For core the samples are cut with one half submitted for assay. The samples were analyzed for gold with a 30-gram sample size using the fire assay method FA430 followed by multi-element MA300, including silver. Over limits, when present, are analyzed by MA370 or FA530.  All holes contain certified blanks, standards, and duplicates as part of the quality control program.

 *Aztec has not verified these historic drill results and is not relying on them.  Aztec has in its possession the historic drill logs, maps and reports but does not have any information on the quality assurance or quality control measures taken in connection with these historical exploration results.

 **Aztec does not represent that the neighboring deposits signifies there are present such deposits on the Tombstone Project in size or scale.
