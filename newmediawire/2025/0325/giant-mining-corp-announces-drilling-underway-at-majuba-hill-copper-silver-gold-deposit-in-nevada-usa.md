# Giant Mining Corp. Announces Drilling Underway at Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit in Nevada, USA

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that core drilling is underway at its flagship Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper Project (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada. The first drill hole, MHB-32, has commenced with the primary objective of expanding known zones of copper mineralization and advancing toward a new Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 The 2025 Core Program has been designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings.

 David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, commented: "We are excited to begin drilling at Majuba Hill as we advance the project toward an updated resource estimate. The scale and potential of this system continue to impress, and this phase of drilling is critical in unlocking further value for our shareholders. It’s also worth noting that copper is currently trading at approximately $5.12 per pound, significantly higher than during our last drill program when prices were under $4.00. This increase enhances the in-situ value of our mineralized rock year over year and reinforces the importance of advancing exploration at Majuba Hill at this pivotal time."

 The planned drill program includes up to 4 holes totaling 4,400 feet (1,340 meters) within the current exploration target area at Majuba Hill. A minimum of 2,600 feet (792 meters) will be drilled under the existing contract, with no maximum limit, allowing for flexibility based on results. Each hole is initially planned to a depth of 1,100 feet (335 meters), with the potential to extend to 1,600 feet (487 meters) if mineralization continues at depth.

 As previously reported in the March 17, 2025  News release,  the drill hole targets were developed through a collaborative effort between Giant Mining and Exploration Technologies (“ExploreTech”). ExploreTech was engaged to apply its proprietary Engine AI artificial intelligence and cloud computing platform to analyze the planned core drilling program. The platform focused on identifying breccia zones and large low-resistivity anomalies. This collaboration leveraged Giant’s extensive geophysical and drilling database to generate high-priority targets with greater precision.

 E.L. “Buster” Hunsaker, Senior Consulting Geologist, added: "We’re drilling MHB-32 into the heart of the porphyry system. Based on previous data and alteration patterns—particularly the breccias observed in 2024 core holes MHB-30 and MHB-31—we believe this hole will further define the mineralized zone and potentially confirm deeper extensions of the copper system at Majuba Hill."

 The Company will provide regular updates as the drill program progresses, including assay results, geological observations, and any significant developments encountered during drilling. These updates will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed on the advancement of the Majuba Hill project and its potential to support a future resource estimate.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada – The #1 mining jurisdiction on the planet according to the Fraser Institute

 Project Size:

9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects

 History:

Historical Producer

 Drilling:

83,930 feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:

Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign

 About Giant Mining Corp.

 Giant Mining Corp. is focused on identifying, acquiring, and advancing late-stage copper and copper/silver/gold projects to meet the growing global demand for critical metals. This demand is driven by initiatives like the Green New Deal in the United States and similar climate-focused programs worldwide, which require substantial amounts of copper, silver, and gold for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and the modernization of clean and affordable energy systems.

 The Company’s flagship asset is the Majuba Hill Copper, Silver, and Gold District, located 156 miles (251 km) from Reno, Nevada. Majuba Hill is situated in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations and has the potential to become one of the next major copper deposits, critical for meeting the increasing need for this red metal.
