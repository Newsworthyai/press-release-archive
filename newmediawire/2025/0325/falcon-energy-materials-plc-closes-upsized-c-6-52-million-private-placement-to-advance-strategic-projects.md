# Falcon Energy Materials PLC Closes Upsized C$6.52 Million Private Placement to Advance Strategic Projects

ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - March 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Falcon Energy Materials plc (TSX-V: FLCN) (“Falcon” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the upsize of its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the “Private Placement”) from 10,000,000 units (the “Units”) of Falcon, at a price of C$0.60 per Unit, to 10,874,832 Units for gross proceeds of C$6,524,900 and the closing thereof on March 24, 2025.

 Each Unit is comprised of one ordinary share of the Company (a “Share”) and one non-transferable share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant grants the holder the right to purchase one additional Share (a “Warrant Share”) at a price of C$0.75 per Warrant Share for a period of 36 months from the date of closing.

 “We are extremely pleased with the strong investor confidence demonstrated by the successful closing of this Private Placement,” said Matthieu Bos, Chief Executive Officer of Falcon. “We extend our sincere gratitude to our existing shareholders for their continued support and are excited to welcome many new shareholders today. The significant backing from the La Mancha Fund, the Commodity Discovery Fund, and our technical partner underscores the strength of our strategy and validates our development plans for 2025.”

 The proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to advance the development of the Company’s strategic projects in Morocco and Guinea, as well as for general working capital requirements. All securities issued under the Private Placement will be subject to a statutory four-month hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws until July 25, 2025. Notably, no commissions were paid in connection with the Private Placement.

 The participation of La Mancha Fund SCSp (acting via its wholly owned subsidiary, “La Mancha”) in the Private Placement is irrevocable and has been closed in escrow, subject only to the approval of the disinterested Company shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Approval”) at the Company’s next annual general meeting of shareholders (the “AGM”) of: (i) the sale of Units to La Mancha, and (ii) La Mancha being a control person of the Company (as such term is defined in Policy 1.1 – Interpretation of the TSX Venture Exchange). The AGM will be held on or before June 9, 2025. If the Shareholders’ Approval is obtained, the aggregate subscription price for the Units subscribed by La Mancha will be released and wired to the Company, and the Units will be issued and delivered to La Mancha. If the Shareholders’ Approval is not obtained, La Mancha’s subscription will be cancelled.

 Neither the Units, the Shares, the Warrants, nor the Warrant Shares have been, and will be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or any U.S. state security laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration under the U.S. Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws or compliance with requirements of an applicable exemption therefrom. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

 The issuances of Units to insiders of the Company, including La Mancha, in connection with the Private Placement are considered related party transactions within the meaning of Policy 5.9 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions of the TSX Venture Exchange and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions. The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements, as neither the fair market value of the securities being issued to insiders, nor the consideration being paid by such insiders, exceeds 25% of the Company’s current market capitalization.

 The Private Placement remains subject to receipt of the final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange.
