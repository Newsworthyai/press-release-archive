# Visionstate Provides Strategic, Technology Update, Including New AI Model

EDMONTON, ALBERTA - March 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Visionstate Corp. (TSXV: VIS) is pleased to provide an update on the technological advancements and strategic initiatives concerning its WANDA product, an application designed to enhance operational efficiencies in facility management.

 Launch of Standalone Inspections Application

 In early Q3 of the current fiscal year, Visionstate will introduce a new inspections application aimed at streamlining the auditing process for facility managers assessing cleaning quality. This standalone application seamlessly integrates with WANDA, offering a comprehensive end-to-end solution. By digitizing existing processes, it facilitates enterprise-scale reporting and analytics, representing a new revenue stream for the company.

 Advancements in Artificial Intelligence

 Visionstate continues its collaboration with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) to develop an AI model that intelligently designs cleaning schedules and optimizes routing. This innovation addresses the complexity and time-consuming nature of facility operations, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency. The company anticipates completing the model in Q4 2025, introducing another standalone product and revenue stream.

 The prestige of Amii is underscored by the recent accolade awarded to one of its scientific advisors, Richard Sutton, who received the 2024 A.M. Turing Award—often referred to as the "Nobel Prize in computing" - for his foundational work in reinforcement learning.

 Shannon Moore, President of Visionstate, commented on the AI initiative: "This development is transformational for facility management. By harnessing the power of AI, we're turning complex tasks into optimized processes, setting a new standard in the industry."

 Compliance with Ontario's Cleaning Verification Legislation

 In response to Ontario's new legislation, O. Reg. 480/24, under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which mandates the recording of washroom cleaning activities effective January 1, 2026, Visionstate has proactively updated the WANDA software to meet these specific requirements. The regulation requires employers and constructors to maintain and post records of washroom cleanings, including the date and time of the two most recent cleanings, either physically near the facility or electronically accessible to workers.

 Visionstate's objective is to ensure easy deployment to the thousands of potential customers affected by this legislation. The company will focus on onboarding these customers in Q3 and Q4, ahead of the January 1, 2026, implementation date.
