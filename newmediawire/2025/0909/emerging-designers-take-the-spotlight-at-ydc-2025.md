# Emerging Designers Take the Spotlight at YDC 2025

Young Local Winners Showcase Creativity and Craftsmanship

 HONG KONG - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and sponsored by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA)*, Asia’s annual fashion extravaganza CENTRESTAGE concluded successfully on Saturday, 6 September. The highlight of the closing evening was the grand finale of the Hong Kong Young Fashion Designers’ Contest 2025 (YDC), where 10 up-and-coming local fashion designers presented their highly original collections.

 Featuring a diverse range of styles, this year’s YDC finalists combined boundary-pushing creativity with refined traditional craftsmanship, perfectly echoing the contest’s theme, “How ‘Bout You'”. Contestants were encouraged to boldly express their personal visions and dreams through fashion, unleashing creativity while courageously pursuing their goals. The evening welcomed a legion of celebrities and artists including Marf@COLLAR, Tiger@MIRROR, Janet Ma, Kayla Wong, Irisa Wong, Lagchun, Bruce Tong, Ka Lai, Madboii, Zelos Wong, Brian Chan, Saito Chong and Ocean On, adding glamour and excitement to the competition as they watched the runway show and cheered on the 10 finalists.

 After careful deliberation, a panel of professional judges selected four major award winners from the finalists’ collections. Chung Ka-ching, Tiger emerged as Champion, receiving a cash prize of HK$60,000, an overseas study trip sponsored by Fang Brothers Knitting Ltd and a HK$3,000 CASETiFY gift voucher. In addition, Lau Hei-nga received the Excellence Award and Best Art Direction Award, securing a cash prize of HK$40,000, an overseas study trip sponsored by MINI HK and a HK$2,000 CASETiFY gift voucher for the former, and collecting a five-day course at VOGUE College of Fashion in London and an overseas study trip sponsored by VOGUE Hong Kong, with a total value of HK$30,000, plus a HK$1,000 CASETiFY gift voucher, for the latter. The “My Favourite Collection” Award, decided by public voting, went to Yip Wai-lam, Mook, who was awarded a HK$20,000 Lee Gardens Area e-Gift Certificate sponsored by Hysan Development and a HK$1,000 CASETiFY gift voucher.

 The full list of winners from YDC 2025 is as follows:

 Champion: Chung Ka-ching, Tiger; Design: “Bior”

 Excellence Award: Lau Hei-nga; Design: “In Pain”

 Best Art Direction Award: Lau Hei-nga; Design: “In Pain”

 My Favourite Collection Award: Yip Wai-lam, Mook; Design: “Modern Animals”

 Chung Ka-ching, Tiger, winner of the Champion title, presented a collection titled “Bior”, which is a pun on a classic fashion brand. She uses bootleg design techniques to cleverly fuse the rugged elements of grassroots street life with the refined silhouettes of high fashion. This subverts traditional fashion narratives and prompts viewers to reflect on class and aesthetics. Her “Bior” collection is not only a playful take on a luxury brand but also symbolises a challenge to the boundaries of mainstream fashion. Receiving the award, Ms Chung remarked: “I am truly overwhelmed by winning - a mix of surprise and excitement. I believe the YDC is absolutely an important platform for local fashion designers to step onto the international stage. It is the largest stage for emerging talent in Hong Kong and a crucial springboard for designers. Not only does it give the new generation greater exposure, but it also enables us to further develop and amplify our brands and creative visions.”

 Excellence Award and Best Art Direction winner Lau Hei-nga presented the collection “In Pain”, which reveals the blurred boundaries between agony and ecstasy. This sensory experience is deeply connected to her lifelong battle with eczema – the fleeting pleasure of scratching, followed by blood, wounds and scars, with the physical and emotional tug-of-war forming the core inspiration for her creations. Receiving the award, Ms Lau shared: “I am truly thrilled to receive this award, especially after investing so much time in preparing my collection. At the same time, I have gained immensely from the YDC. With its diverse and far-reaching audience, the contest has allowed many more people to discover my brand and my work.”

 The “My Favourite Collection” Award, decided by public voting, was won by Yip Wai-lam, Mook for the collection “Modern Animals”, which fuses human and animal characteristics to create a monstrous aesthetic that depicts the workplace as an urban jungle. Upon being presented with the award, Mr Yip said: “My biggest takeaway from participating in the YDC this year has been learning to embrace both success and failure with peace of mind. At the same time, the competition is more than just a platform for recognition - it is a significant stage where fashion designers at different stages in their careers can discover themselves and grow to their full potential. For every new-generation designer, the YDC is a platform that encourages us to shine.”
