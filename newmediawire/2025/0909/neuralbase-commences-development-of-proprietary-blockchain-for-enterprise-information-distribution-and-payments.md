# NeuralBase Commences Development of Proprietary Blockchain for Enterprise Information Distribution and Payments

LAS VEGAS, NV - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and recognized as a fast-growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced the commencement of the development of its proprietary blockchain infrastructure. This initiative represents a major advancement in the Company’s strategy to integrate artificial intelligence and blockchain to deliver secure, transparent, and efficient solutions for enterprise operations.

 The new blockchain project is expected to initially focus on secure information distribution across industries, with pilot testing scheduled for selected enterprise partners. Future phases are anticipated to introduce a stablecoin-powered payment system, enabling enterprises to conduct instant, cost-effective, and auditable internal transactions on the same blockchain infrastructure.

 “This is one of the biggest steps forward for our company and for the enterprises that trust us,” stated Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of NeuralBase AI. “The creation of our own blockchain is not just about data distribution, it is about building the backbone for future enterprise economies. Imagine a world where an organization’s entire information flow and internal payments are secured, seamless, and automated within its own ledger system. That’s the scale of what we want to build, making it transformative.”

 This initiative sets the stage for NeuralBase AI to be at the forefront of a new era where AI-driven insights and blockchain-powered systems converge, unlocking new levels of trust, efficiency, and growth for businesses worldwide.

 In addition, we are progressing with the name change process with FINRA and expect that it will be approved in short order, thereby effecting the pending name change to BMP AI Technologies Limited.
