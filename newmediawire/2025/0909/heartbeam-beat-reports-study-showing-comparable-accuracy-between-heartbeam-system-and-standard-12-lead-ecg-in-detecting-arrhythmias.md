# HeartBeam (BEAT) Reports Study Showing Comparable Accuracy Between HeartBeam System and Standard 12-Lead ECG in Detecting Arrhythmias

LOS ANGELES, CA - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT), a medical technology company focused on transforming cardiac care with personalized insights, announced study results showing no significant differences in detecting atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and sinus rhythm when its deep learning algorithms were applied to the HeartBeam System versus standard 12-lead ECGs. Data from 201 patients, presented at HRX Live 2025 in Atlanta by Dr. Joshua Lampert of Mount Sinai Heart, demonstrated high accuracy rates in both groups (94.5% HeartBeam vs. 95.5% standard 12-lead). CEO Rob Eno said the findings highlight the potential of HeartBeam’s compact, 3D device to expand advanced cardiac monitoring to settings where full 12-lead ECGs may be impractical. The company plans to use these results to support future FDA submissions.

 About HeartBeam, Inc.

 HeartBeam, Inc. is a medical technology company dedicated to transforming the detection and monitoring of critical cardiac conditions. The Company is creating the first-ever cable-free device capable of collecting ECG signals in 3D, from three non-coplanar directions, and synthesizing the signals into a 12-lead ECG. This platform technology is designed for portable devices that can be used wherever the patient is to deliver actionable heart intelligence. Physicians will be able to identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions and direct patients to the appropriate care – all outside of a medical facility, thus redefining the future of cardiac health management. HeartBeam’s 3D ECG technology received FDA clearance for arrhythmia assessment in December 2024. The 12-Lead ECG synthesis software is under FDA review. The Company holds over 20 issued patents related to technology enablement.
