# Integrated Cyber Solutions Initiates Patent Process for Quantum-Resilient AI Deployment &amp; Data Securitization Technology

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Integrated Cyber Solutions Inc. (“ICS” or the “Company”) (CSE: ICS) (OTCQB: IGCRF) (FRA: Y4G), a provider of AI-powered cybersecurity and human-layer defense solutions, today announced it has engaged intellectual property counsel to pursue a patent application covering novel security methods focused in ML/AI deployment pipelines and data securitization, including quantum-resilient capabilities not currently available in the industry.

 This initiative marks a strategic inflection point for ICS, as the Company positions this innovation as the core technology underpinning its platform, providing a foundation for all current and future cybersecurity solutions. By embedding secure, compliant, and quantum-resilient AI deployment at the center of its technology roadmap, ICS is enabling a unified, scalable, and resilient approach to protecting ML/AI models and the sensitive enterprise data they consume.

 “AI is proving to be highly intelligent, but enterprise deployment has not been,” said Alan Guibord, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of ICS. “Our approach changes that reality. By making secure, quantum-resilient AI deployment our core technology, we are creating a foundation that enables scalability, compliance, and resilience across all of our solutions. This patent initiative is both a technology breakthrough and a roadmap reset for ICS.”

 Without disclosing claim details, the patent will focus on methods that address the greatest barriers enterprises face today, including:

 - Secure, regulation-compliant global deployments of ML/AI models to protect sensitive data against breaches and attacks, including emerging quantum threats

 - Data securitization techniques ensure secured, encrypted, scalable AI training and inference pipelines that comply with all major regulatory requirements, including GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, ASA, HIPAA, and more.

 - Protect ML/AI pipelines without hindering model visibility, monitoring & drift detection for model integrity and compliance

 - Zero-trust protections for AI pipelines against adversarial and supply chain attacks

 - Audit-ready transparency enabling regulated industries to adopt AI with confidence

 “Enterprises want the power of AI solutions without the added complexity of figuring out compliance, security, scalability, and future proofing against emerging quantum risks,” said Jeremy Samuelson, Advisor to ICS and member of the Company’s Cyber Future Advisory Board. “Our ML/AI deployment architectures ensure sensitive data and the models that use them are kept safe, while simultaneously allowing AI models to be orchestrated securely at scale and within the bounds of all relevant regulatory requirements. That is what makes this technology central to ICS’s future.”

 By formalizing its intellectual property protection strategy, ICS is strengthening the defensibility of its platform and creating a moat that enhances both customer adoption and shareholder value.
