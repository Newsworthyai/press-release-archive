# Golden Cariboo Confirms New Discovery of the KM Uno Zone, a Parallel Zone at the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine Property and Project Update

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE: GCC) (OTC: GCCFF) (WKN: A402CQ) (FSE: 3TZ) announces the discovery of the Km Uno zone, a mineralized structure parallel to the Company’s significant gold-silver bearing Halo zone discovery in 2024 at its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property (the “Property”). In addition, the Company provides an update on exploration activities on the Property which is located 4 km (2.5 miles) from Hixon, British Columbia.

 The KM Uno zone discovery is a significant parallel mineralized trend located approximately 2 km southeast of the 2024 Halo zone discovery, with the Sunset trend positioned 1.4 km to the west, effectively flanking the Halo zone in the middle. This configuration of parallel structures, KM Uno, Halo, and Sunset, aligns with historical soil anomalies, resistivity highs, and geochemical indicators, suggesting a cohesive, district-scale gold system (see map enclosure or visit the company’s website at www.goldencariboo.com). Notably, these trends correlate strongly with the argillite-greenstone lithological contact visible in the property's geological mapping, a key feature that controls mineralization and is suggestive of the geological controls seen in major gold-producing districts across the Abitibi Greenstone Belt from Val d'Or to Timmins, where such contacts have been pivotal in defining extensive, high-grade deposits.

 The KM Uno zone, identified through targeted bedrock mapping and sampling, has yielded initial results of up to 1.1 g/t gold and 8.0 g/t silver from mineralized volcanic subcrop, correlating with strong gold-silver-arsenic soil anomalies and geophysical features visible on the property's 2024 gold MMI soil map. Similarly, the Sunset trend shows promising signs of mineralization, including potential extensions toward historical producers like the Hixon Creek Placer. With the Halo zone already demonstrating a 390-metre drilled strike length open for expansion, these parallel zones, enhanced by their association with the greenstone contact, underscore the property's potential for multiple interconnected gold-bearing structures.

 Highlights of the parallel zones includes:

 - Km Uno Zone Discovery: 2 km (1.2 miles) southeast of the Halo zone, where initial samples from mineralized volcanic subcrop or angular float yielded 1.1 g/t gold with 8.0 g/t silver and 0.57 g/t gold with 3.3 g/t silver. These results align with airborne resistivity, ground conductivity anomalies, and a strong gold-silver-arsenic soil anomaly.

 - Halo Zone: Drilling and surface sampling confirm near-surface gold mineralization. Key drill holes include:

 - Discovery hole QGQ24-13: Intersected 1.77 g/t gold over 136.51 meters (448 feet), as reported on October 1, 2024.

 - Hole QGQ24-20: Reanalysis using PhotonAssay™ technology verified and increased gold grades by 5.9% compared to fire assay, returning 0.56 g/t gold over 475.4 meters (1,560 feet) from 7.97 meters (26 feet) depth, including 236.88 meters (777 feet) of 1.06 g/t gold (announced August 12, 2025).

 - Sunset Trend: Located 1.4 km (0.9 miles) west of the Halo zone, showing signs of mineralization.

 - Buckley Creek: 1 km (0.6 miles) north-northwest of the Discovery hole and 2 km (1.2 miles) north of the Main zone shaft at Hixon Creek, where exploration aims to extend the Halo zone northward.

 “The assay results from the Km Uno zone, a structure parallel to our 2024 Halo zone discovery, mark a major milestone for the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property,” said Golden Cariboo President Frank Callaghan. “These findings confirm our geological model and highlight the potential for multiple mineralized zones across the Property. With the confirmed gold-silver discovery at Km Uno and the Halo zone’s 390 metre strike length open for expansion, we’re excited to continue exploring these promising gold systems."

 The Spring drill program saw the completion of four surface diamond drill holes, QGQ25-21 to 24, totalling 638.59m (2,095 ft), targeting strong quartz-carbonate vein stockwork along the argillite to greenstone contact and testing the northwestern continuity of gold-silver mineralization at the Halo zone. ALS Canada is nearing completion of PhotonAssay™ for gold and multi-element analysis. Results are pending and will be released when finalized.

 Additional work completed during the summer exploration season includes reclamation, equipment maintenance, safety assessments and continued compilation of data from the large claim package staked in September 2024.

 Delays in assay results were encountered due to a “lost” shipment of drill core and surface exploration samples by the freight carrier. The shipment was successfully recovered after an extended search period of one month. Further delays have been encountered due to the switch-over to PhotonAssay™ analysis, a much more effective method in assaying coarse gold-bearing samples. Golden Cariboo appreciates the efforts made to resolve the matters and the Company has been assured steps have been taken to ensure continued quality service and consistent tracking of future shipments. ALS Canada is nearing completion of PhotonAssay™ for gold and multi-element analysis. Results are pending and will be released when finalized.

 About Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd.

 Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. is rediscovering the Cariboo Gold Rush by proceeding with highly targeted drilling and trenching programs on its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property which is bordered by Osisko Development, partly intertwined with them at the north end of the Cariboo Gold Project, and located along a favourable corridor adjacent to the Spanish and Eureka thrust faults over a 94,899 hectare (234,501 acre) area. Historically, over 101 placer gold creeks on the 90-kilometer (56 mile) trend, from the Cariboo Hudson mine north to the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property, have recorded production with successful placer mining continuing to this day.

 Golden Cariboo’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of, and road accessible from, Hixon in central British Columbia. The Property includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 and developed over a footprint of about 150m x 150m (< 6 acres) at the Main zone straddling Hixon Creek. Overall, the geological setting of the gold mineralization at the Company’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property shows strong similarities with the Spanish Mountain gold deposit, situated 120 km (75 miles) towards the southeast along the same geological trend. As a sediment-hosted vein (SHV) deposit, the Spanish Mountain deposit is considered to belong to the epizonal orogenic subclass of gold deposits which include some of the world’s largest deposits such as Muruntau, Uzbekistan and Bendigo, Australia.
