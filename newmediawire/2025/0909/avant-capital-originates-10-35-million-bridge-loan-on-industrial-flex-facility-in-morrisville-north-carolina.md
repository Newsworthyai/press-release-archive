# Avant Capital Originates $10.35-Million Bridge Loan on Industrial Flex Facility in Morrisville, North Carolina

NEW CANAAN, CT - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Avant Capital (“Avant”), a leading Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, today announced it has originated a $10,350,000 bridge loan, secured by a 70,481-square-foot industrial flex property located at 3200 Gateway Centre Boulevard in Morrisville, NC. The property was originally constructed in 1998 and was most recently used as a call center.

 The industrial and flex market in the Raleigh-Durham region continues to benefit from strong demand driven by population growth, limited supply, and expanding e-commerce and logistics needs. The sponsorship group is an affiliate of Capstone Equities, an experienced real estate investor with a national track record and a specialized co-warehousing platform, Portal Warehousing.

 Loan proceeds will be used to finance the acquisition of the property, fund a planned renovation program, and provide time for the borrower to reposition the building into small industrial suites under the Portal Warehousing brand.

 Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant, said, “This transaction showcases Avant’s ability to deliver flexible capital solutions to experienced sponsors with innovative strategies. We look forward to supporting Capstone and Portal as they bring their successful co-warehousing model to the Raleigh-Durham market.”

 In 2025, Avant is targeting similar projects ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide, with a focus on Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Tennessee and other high-growth markets. The company offers bridge loans and acquires non-performing loans secured by all commercial property types, with a particular focus on apartments and industrial properties.
