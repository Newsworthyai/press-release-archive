# Navigating the Data Deluge: How Beamr is Addressing Autonomous Vehicles' Video Challenge

by Beamr

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - In the race to build autonomous vehicles, one of the biggest roadblocks is data economics. The autonomous vehicles (AV) industry is facing a massive data deluge of unprecedented scale that's reshaping infrastructure budgets and development timelines. The numbers are staggering: A single autonomous vehicle produces terabytes of video data daily, while training a single autonomous driving model may require hundreds of petabytes of video content. This data explosion puts immense strain on the extensive machine learning pipelines required for training autonomous vehicles.

 Beamr (NASDAQ: BMR) is addressing these critical challenges for the fast-growing AV and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) industry, with over 80 AV companies with test vehicles on the road. Beamr demonstrates 20%-50% storage and networking savings over existing ML workflows without compromising model accuracy. "We are encouraged by the progress that we have made so far with our AV offering. We believe that this indicates the use of Beamr technology is indeed applicable to such fast growing markets, like the AV market," said Sharon Carmel, founder and CEO of Beamr.

 Adapting Trusted Technology for Urgent Autonomous Driving Needs

 Beamr leverages its Emmy® Award-winning Content-Adaptive Bitrate (CABR) technology - backed by 53 patents and trusted by leading media and technology companies - to address the urgent need for efficient video data operations in AV and machine learning (ML) workflows.

 CABR optimizes video compression on a frame-by-frame basis, based on perceptual relevance. Originally developed to align with human visual perception, the technology is now adapted to support ML perception, helping ensure that critical visual cues, such as lane markings, traffic signs, and road textures, are preserved during compression.

 Beamr’s team of video and AI experts partners with companies facing large-scale video data challenges in the AV sector and beyond. Through tailored solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing ML workflows, Beamr delivers operational efficiency and acceleration, enabling customers to achieve their performance and investment goals while maintaining the visual fidelity essential for machine learning safety.
