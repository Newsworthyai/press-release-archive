# NFL Alumni amplify 8 plays for heart health during Men s Health Week

(NewMediaWire) - June 09, 2025 - DALLAS — To empower men to take control of their heart health during Men’s Health Week, June 9-15, the American Heart Association and NFL (National Football League) Alumni are spotlighting Life’s Essential 8™ — eight key components to prevent heart disease and stroke, leading causes of death and disability among U.S. men according to the American Heart Association 2025 Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics report. Life's Essential 8 are defined by the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, as managing weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose/sugar, eating a healthy diet, getting physical activity, avoiding smoking/nicotine exposure and getting adequate, quality sleep.

 “At the American Heart Association, our future is about improving yours. As the nation’s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke for more than 100 years, we’re helping people reach their maximum potential to live longer, healthier lives,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer at the American Heart Association. “With the support of the NFL Alumni Association together we are meeting people where they are to inspire them to champion their health.”

 The series of public service announcement videos will be shared via social media to educate and inspire men to take proactive steps toward better heart health. Chaired by Ken Coffey, former NFL safety and senior vice president and chief operating officer of the NFL Alumni Association, the campaign features eight former NFL players and members of the NFL Alumni Association. Each former player highlights a pillar of Life’s Essential 8 to help both retired NFL players and the general public understand both the health risk factors as well as the opportunities for improvement. The measures are divided into two categories- addressing health behaviors and health factors. Research shows that following these guidelines can lead to a longer, healthier life free of chronic disease.

 The Life’s Essential 8 are represented by:

 * Manage Weight: Ken Coffey, former NFL safety for the Washington Commanders and senior vice president and chief operating officer of the NFL Alumni Association,
* Control Cholesterol: Brad Edwards, former NFL safety for the Washington Commanders and chief executive officer at the NFL Alumni Association
* Be More Active: Brad Hopkins, former NFL offensive tackle for the Tennessee Titans and Houston Oilers and NFL Alumni ambassador
* Manage Blood Pressure: Perry Kemp, former NFL wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers and president of the NFL Alumni Georgia chapter

* Get Healthy Sleep: Johnny Walker, former NFL running back for the St. Louis Cardinals and president of the NFL Alumni Austin chapter
* Quit Tobacco: Byron Williams, former NFL wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants and president of the NFL Alumni Dallas chapter.

 “As former athletes, we understand the importance of being proactive about our health,” said Brad Edwards, former NFL All-Pro safety and chief executive officer of NFL Alumni. “In collaboration with the American Heart Association we will are highlighting each of the Life’s Essential 8 measures to share simple, steps that can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular issues.”
