 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Management, commented, “The world of finance and investing is continually evolving, and we are excited to be on the forefront of this evolution of the tokenization of hard assets, which fits squarely within our focus of innovation around mining, manufacturing, and resources. We are excited about the progress at Ferrox and their use of non-dilutive financing to ramp up production and create value for shareholders. Tokenization is a rapidly growing form of financing for operations and assets that can link non-traditional sources of capital for growth initiatives alongside monetization opportunities. We look forward to Ferrox’s success with this offering and are actively looking to use similar tokenization structures with our other portfolio holdings and investments in order to pursue maximum potential returns for our shareholders.”

 Titanium's high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility make it valuable in various applications, including aerospace, medical devices, and consumer goods. It's also used as a pigment in paints and other materials. Titanium uses:

 * Aerospace and Military: Titanium alloys are crucial in aircraft engines, airframes, and spacecraft due to their ability to withstand high temperatures and stress.
* Medical Devices: Titanium's biocompatibility makes it ideal for implants, joint replacements, dental implants, and various medical equipment.
* Consumer Goods: Titanium is used in golf clubs, jewelry, eyewear, watch cases, and other items where its strength and lightness are desired.
* Industrial Applications: Titanium is used in chemical processing, power generation, marine hardware, and other industrial applications due to its resistance to corrosion.
