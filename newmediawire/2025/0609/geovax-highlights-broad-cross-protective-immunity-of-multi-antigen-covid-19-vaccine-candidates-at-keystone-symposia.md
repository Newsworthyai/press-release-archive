# GeoVax Highlights Broad Cross-Protective Immunity of Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates at Keystone Symposia

Preclinical Studies Demonstrate Durable Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants, Including Omicron XBB.1.5, Driven by T-Cell Responses

 ATLANTA, GA - June 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and multi-antigen vaccines against infectious diseases and solid tumors, today recapped two scientific poster presentations delivered at the Keystone Symposia on Vaccinology: Horizons Across Disease, Demography and Technology, held June 4–7, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

 The presentations, titled MVA-Vectored Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccines Induce Protective Immunity Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants Spanning Alpha to Omicron in Preclinical Animal Models, and GEO-CM04S1 Vaccine Candidate Maintains Potent Cross-Reactivity Against Original SARS-CoV-2 B.1 and Omicron Subvariant XBB.1.5, were delivered by Drs. Pratima Kumari and Amany Elsharkawy, respectively, members of GeoVax’s scientific team and its collaborators, during the June 5 and June 6 poster sessions. The presentations spotlight the Company’s Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates, GEO-CM04S1 and GEO-CM02, and their ability to induce durable, cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants in preclinical animal models. These studies underscore the immunologic breadth, durability, and cross-variant protection of GeoVax’s multi-antigen design strategy, especially important for addressing variant evasion and suboptimal immune response in vulnerable patient populations.

 Key Findings from Studies

 GEO-CM02 Study – Poster #1050 - Presenter: Dr. Pratima Kumari, GeoVax Scientist

 This presentation detailed findings for GEO-CM02, a multi-antigen MVA-based vaccine expressing the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins.

 * In hACE2 mouse models, a single dose provided complete protection against both the original Wuhan strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant.
* Two-dose regimens generated high neutralizing antibody levels, reduced viral loads in lung and brain tissues, and lowered inflammatory markers- indicating enhanced immune memory.
* Notably, early protection was achieved prior to detectable neutralizing antibodies, further supporting the role of innate and cellular immune responses in viral control. This underscores the value of the multi-antigen MVA-based vaccine platform, particularly as the virus continues to mutate.

 GEO-CM04S1 Study – Poster #2047 - Presenter: Dr. Amany Elsharkawy, Georgia State University Scientist

 This study evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GEO-CM04S1, an MVA-vectored vaccine co-expressing spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in a K18-hACE2 mouse model. Mice were challenged intranasally with either the original B.1 strain or the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant.

 * GEO-CM04S1 conferred full protection against clinical disease, lung injury, and inflammation in both viral challenge models.
* Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, vaccinated animals were fully protected, suggesting antibody-independent protection.
* Immune cell depletion studies revealed that CD4+ T cells, not B cells or CD8+ T cells, were critical for protection, highlighting the vaccine’s ability to drive T cell–mediated immunity across variants.

 “These experimental findings document the value of inducing broadly specific immune responses to protect against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants,” said Mark Newman, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of GeoVax. “We believe the use of multi-antigen vaccines could provide significant benefit by limiting the need to continually update COVID vaccines and by limiting the need for yearly booster doses.”

 GeoVax’s MVA vaccine platform is designed to address gaps in pandemic preparedness and public health resilience, with lead vaccine candidate GEO-CM04S1 currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for COVID-19.

 About GEO-CM04S1

 GEO-CM04S1 is a synthetic next-generation, multi-antigen MVA-vectored COVID-19 vaccine co-expressing spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens, designed to induce both broad antibody and T-cell responses. It is being evaluated in three ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials:

 1. A primary vaccine for immunocompromised individuals (e.g., post-transplant, CAR-T, or hematologic cancers)
2. A booster for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
3. A booster for healthy adults previously immunized with mRNA vaccines

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The Company is also developing GEO-MVA, a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
