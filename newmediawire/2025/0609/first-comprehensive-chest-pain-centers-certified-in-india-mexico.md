# First Comprehensive Chest Pain Centers certified in India, Mexico

DALLAS, Texas- (NewMediaWire) - June 09, 2025 — Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are the No. 1 cause of death worldwide, accounting for 32% of all global deaths.[1] The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is recognizing hospitals across the world that share a commitment to improving health outcomes for people experiencing acute cardiac conditions.

 Newly certified Comprehensive Chest Pain Centers in India and Mexico are the most recent to join the global group recognized by the American Heart Association for excellence in cardiac emergency care. Since 2023, more than a dozen hospitals have been certified as international Chest Pain Centers in five countries outside the U.S. This designation reflects these institutions' commitment to delivering evidence-based care that reduces treatment times and improves outcomes for people experiencing chest pain or related cardiac emergencies.

 “These certifications represent an important step forward in the American Heart Association’s global efforts to improve cardiovascular care,” said DP Suresh, M.D., incoming volunteer co-chair of the American Heart Association’s International Committee and executive medical director of the Florence Wormald Heart and Vascular Institute at St. Elizabeth Healthcare in Cincinnati. “These certifications are critical elements to create a regional system of care that seeks to save lives by closing the gaps that delay people experiencing chest pain and heart attacks from timely access to appropriate treatments. Recognizing hospitals dedicated to evidence-based treatment allows the Heart Association to advance care quality and support healthier communities worldwide.”

 The American Heart Association developed its international Chest Pain Center Certification to ensure hospitals support improved health outcomes by implementing coordinated systems of care that reduce time to treatment and improve long-term cardiovascular health. Certified facilities must meet rigorous criteria and demonstrate their ability to quickly identify, diagnose and treat people experiencing chest pain.

 India Chest Pain Centers

 Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in India, accounting for approximately 36% of all deaths nationwide in people ages 30 to 69.[2] Further there was a 12.5% increase in heart attack deaths year-over-year in that country, according to the most recent data available.[3]

 To address this trend, there is evidence-based guidance on the time-sensitive care needed to improve survival outcomes for people experiencing cardiac emergencies like heart attacks. The hospital certification program evaluates facilities based on the adherence to these guidelines. These three hospitals are the first to become certified in India by the American Heart Association as Comprehensive Chest Pain Centers:

 * Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences Ltd (Aster MIMS) in Calicut
* Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad
* MGM Medical College Hospital in Navi Mumbai

 Mexico Chest Pain Center

 Similarly, cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are responsible for nearly a quarter of all deaths in Mexico.[4] In response to this critical health challenge, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad Hospital de Cardiología Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI in Mexico City has become the first hospital in that country to be certified by the American Heart Association as a Comprehensive Chest Pain Center.

 The Comprehensive Chest Pain Center Certification is the highest level of Chest Pain Center certification and recognizes health care facilities that meet or exceed quality of care measures for treating people experiencing the most severe type of heart attack, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). STEMI occurs when blood flow is completely blocked to a portion of the heart. These centers have the equipment, expertise and facilities to administer percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a mechanical means of clearing blockages in the heart, with the goal of treatment occurring within the times specified in the latest chest pain guidelines. Certified facilities must meet rigorous criteria and demonstrate their ability to quickly and appropriately identify, diagnose and treat people experiencing chest pain.

 With its international Chest Pain Center Certification, the American Heart Association supports hospitals in providing high-quality acute health care services to their communities. The goal is to significantly reduce cardiac death in people by teaching the public to recognize and react to early symptoms of a heart attack, reduce the time it takes to receive life-saving treatment and increase the accuracy and effectiveness of treatment.
