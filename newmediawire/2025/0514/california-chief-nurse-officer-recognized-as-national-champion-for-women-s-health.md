# California chief nurse officer recognized as national champion for women s health

(NewMediaWire) - May 14, 2025 - DALLAS — Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the No. 1 killer of women and nearly 45% of women over age 20 are living with some form of cardiovascular disease, according to the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all. Katrina (Kat) Ascencio-Holmes, the Heart Association’s 2025 National Woman of Impact™ Winner, from Sacramento, California, is working to change that. She’s shining a spotlight on women’s health while raising funds to fuel the lifesaving mission of the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of all health, through the Go Red for Women® movement.

 As a chief nurse officer at Sutter Health and a heart-health advocate from Sacramento, California, Ascencio-Holmes brings both personal experience and professional passion to her mission to save more women’s lives and inspire them to take control of their health. For her, the mission is personal. While Ascencio-Holmes worked as an open-heart surgical nurse early in her professional career, her connection to heart disease became more poignant when her sister-in-law tragically passed away from a massive heart attack at just 40 years old. That loss emphasized, for her, the critical need for awareness around cardiovascular disease in women.

 “Saying 'yes' to the Woman of Impact nomination was not just an opportunity—it was a way to honor my loved ones and contribute to a mission that can save lives,” Ascencio-Holmes said. “By encouraging open discussions about cardiovascular disease and stroke awareness, we can create an environment where women feel supported in prioritizing their health.”

 The Woman of Impact campaign launched on National Wear Red Day®, Feb. 7, and culminated on April 10. Peer volunteers in 96 communities across the country nominated 507 participants to join a nine-week initiative to raise awareness for women’s heart health, drive action to improve the health of women in their communities and ultimately help fund the lifesaving mission of the Heart Association.

 “The Woman of Impact campaign is a way for us to recognize the incredible changemakers in our communities who are fighting for heart health,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and retired financial executive for The PNC Financial Services Group. “At the American Heart Association, our future is about improving yours. Katrina and the other nominees are enabling more women to live longer and healthier lives.”

 As the National Winner, Ascencio-Holmes will continue to advocate for the work being done through the Go Red for Women movement.
