HKTDC has invited buyers from around the world to visit the fair, including from emerging markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam in ASEAN; Egypt and the UAE in the Middle East; and Brazil and Uruguay in South America; as well as from traditional markets like Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, creating substantial business opportunities for exhibitors."

 Themed “Bright Eyes - New Horizons”, the Optical Fair brings a wealth of innovative products which integrate scientific research, design excellence and sustainability concepts. The fair features ten group pavilions, including the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association (HKOMA), the Chinese Mainland (with delegations from Danyang, Zhejiang and Yingtan), Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and the new ASEAN pavilion, as well as “Visionaries of Style” which showcases creative and trendy designs. Highlighted examples include:

 * Japan Pavilion exhibitor Sasaki Celluloid (Booth: GH-C05) showcases eyewear crafted from rare celluloid material. Featuring a curved shape with coreless celluloid temples, the eyewear is designed for comfort. A timeless design with detailed cutting which combines expert Japanese technique and beauty in one ideal piece.
* Taiwan Pavilion exhibitor Greatland Enterprise (Booth: 1C-F09) presents sunglasses equipped with NIRTECH® lens technology for cooling. It effectively blocks Near Infrared Radiation (NIR) to reduce eye heat and fatigue, keeping eyes cool and comfortable even in strong sunlight.

Notable brands include MINIMA from France, STEPPER from Germany, United Colors of Benetton from Italy, Masunaga since 1905 from Japan, nimome from Korea, Nano Vista from Spain, Collections Marcus Marienfeld from Switzerland, Ted Baker from the United Kingdom, and THRASHER from the USA.

This breakthrough overcomes the limitations of traditional progressive lens design and fitting, creating bespoke lenses for individuals and redefining the progressive lens fitting paradigm.

 Three thematic labels ensure market demands and needs are precisely matched

 To facilitate buyer procurement, three special labels were introduced last year: “Smart Ageing Products”, “Green Solutions Suppliers” and “Smart Eyewear”, which were well-received by the industry. These three labels appear again this year to enhance procurement efficiency and highlight exhibitor innovations in the silver economy, sustainability, and smart technology. Selected highlighted products under these labels include:

 Smart Ageing Products

 * Chinese Mainland brand MUEDO (Booth: 1D-G05) presents its U10 Dual-Mode Smart Reading Glasses, featuring auto-focusing lenses and hi-fi stereo sound quality. This design addresses a common issue where presbyopic individuals excessively increase volume levels while watching videos or during calls.
* Japanese exhibitor Sasamata (Booth: GH-C11) presents its ultra-lightweight eye-bow eyewear frame, featuring a stage-controlled flip-up mechanism inspired by scissor-type hinges — perfect for users who constantly put on and take off their reading glasses.

 Green Solutions Supplies

 * Founded by a Hong Kong eyewear designer, JLX STUDIO MADE (Booth: GH-C25) focuses on 3D-printed eyewear. The brand blends traditional craftsmanship with digital technology, using eco-friendly 3D-printing to reduce production waste and showcase a sustainable, customised vision for the future of eyewear.

 Smart Eyewear

 * Chinese Mainland’s smart eyewear brand LAWAKEN (Booth: 1D-F06) presents its all-in-one AR glasses, LAWK ONE. Equipped with fitness tracking, AR navigation, music and call functionality, it supports first-person perspective 4K ultra HD recording, offering outdoor enthusiasts a hands-free experience and reducing reliance on smartphones.

 This year, the Green Booth Design Competition encourages exhibitors to incorporate sustainable concepts into their booth designs. Wenzhou Ouhai Glasses Co Ltd (Booth 1B-D18) won the Gold Award, while Micron Eyewear Manufactory Company Limited (Booth 1E-B18) and Jiangsu Xuzhi Optical Glasses Co., Ltd. (Booth 1C-D02) secured the Silver and Bronze Awards respectively. All three winners centered their designs around eco-friendly materials and waste reduction, demonstrating their brands' commitment to sustainable development.

 Expert symposium and design competition foster industry exchange and innovation

 A series of events and eyewear parades are held at the fair. Tomorrow (6 November), The 23rd Hong Kong International Optometric Symposium, organised by the HKTDC and co-organised by The Hong Kong Optometric Association and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, will take place with the theme “Age Well, See Well: Redefining Eye Care for the Golden Age”. This event drives vision care for the ageing community toward new milestones. The opening ceremony will feature an address by Dr. Pang Fei-chau, Commissioner for Primary Healthcare, Health Bureau, and six experts and academics from Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom will share insights on topics such as age-related visual challenges, diabetic retinopathy, and optometric care for patients with cognitive impairment, offering more personalised and effective health solutions for the silver market. The symposium is accredited by the Optometrists Board of Hong Kong, and participants attending the full-day conference may be eligible for up to six Continuing Professional Development (CPD) hours.

 The HKTDC always encourages the nurturing of new talent to energise the industry. The 25th Hong Kong Eyewear Design Competition, co-organised by HKTDC and the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association, was held under the theme “Blending Tradition and Technology” and encourages designers to fuse craftsmanship aesthetics with innovative technology to create eyewear that is both functional and fashionable. The competition featured an Open Group and a Student Group. The award presentation was held this afternoon. The award-winning and shortlisted designs are displayed at BNG Rendezvous, Grand Hall during the fair. For competition results, please visit: OPT2025_eFairCat_DesignCompetition.indd
