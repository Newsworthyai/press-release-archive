# Jupiter Neurosciences Brings Its Brain Health Expertise To The Masses With Nugevia - And A Range Of Celebs From Athletes To Scientists Are Customers

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - When it comes to brain health, Jupiter Neurosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS) knows a thing or two about it. After all, the clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing JOTROL™, an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, has developed Nugevia™, a direct-to-consumer longevity product line, aimed at improving mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within."

 At the center of this consumer push into supplements, and what is expected to account for about 60% of the company’s sales by volume, is cognitive health – with the key driver being the company’s Nugevia MND offering, a scientifically formulated supplement designed to protect and enhance cognitive function and support overall brain health.

 “Brain health is central to Jupiter’s DNA as a neuroscience company, and consumer awareness in this area is accelerating rapidly,” said a Jupiter Neurosciences spokesperson. “Our Nugevia MND formulation directly builds on our pharmaceutical expertise in neuroinflammation and CNS function, making it the most natural bridge between our clinical work and consumer wellness line. MND reflects the growing demand for cognitive support driven by aging populations and proactive consumers seeking mental clarity, focus and resilience.”

 Brain Health On Everyone's Mind

 There is a growing demand for cognitive support among aging populations around the globe. As the population ages and people live longer, there is an increasing demand to improve mental clarity, concentration and overall brain health. People are increasingly aware that living longer also involves efforts to stay mentally sharp and emotionally engaged. The brain drives every aspect of performance, from focus and memory to motivation and resilience, so maintaining cognitive vitality is fundamental to quality of life.

 That’s where Jupiter Neurosciences says its MND formulation comes in. It builds on its own clinical research, addressing neuroinflammation, mitochondrial health and cellular protection, the same biological pathways that define both aging and cognition. It’s no wonder the global brain health supplement market is expected to reach about $23 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of around 13% between now and then.

 Jupiter Neurosciences has a deep history in diseases of the brain, thanks to its work developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation, with a current focus on central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and rare diseases. Its supplement business is the next evolution of its expertise, and is comprised of Nugevia MND, Nugevia GLO and Nugevia PWR.

 JOTROL At The Center Of IT ALL

 All of it is derived from JOTROL, which is designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. While resveratrol has been around forever, Jupiter Neurosciences said it had fallen out of favor in recent years because it lacked a delivery system that could make it beneficial. The company overcame that, delivering about nine times higher absorption and proven CNS penetration. That scientific breakthrough gives the company the credibility to reintroduce resveratrol with clinically validated science. In addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, resveratrol activates PARP-1 – an important protein in DNA repair and stress response – improves cardiovascular health, enhances cognitive function, and is antibacterial and antiviral against food-borne pathogens.

 JOTROL is what the company says is a first-in-class oral therapeutic that reaches effective levels in the brain and increases energy metabolism, induces mitochondrial biogenesis and reduces inflammation. A phase one trial of JOTROL determined the drug was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels administered and demonstrated blood plasma levels 8-10-fold higher than naïve resveratrol administered in historical clinical trials, meeting performance objectives, reported the company. The phase two trial is focused on treating Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and a broad spectrum of CNS and rare diseases. JOTROL has patents in the U.S., Europe, China, Hong Kong and Japan and is protected through 2036.

 Setting It Apart From Rivals

 As for the three supplements, Jupiter Neurosciences says what sets it apart from single-ingredient supplements is that Nugevia features precision-engineered "intelligent stacking" of synergistic compounds designed to enhance cellular resilience, support blood-brain barrier delivery and promote system-wide optimization. It also has the clinical data to back up its claims and the support of well-known people who are using the company’s supplements.

 To get the word out, the company has tapped multiple scientists and brand ambassadors – including former tennis great Annika Sörenstam, NBA legend Chris Webber, scientist Charbel Moussa and biohacker Jean Fallacar – who are telling the world how they are using Nugevia in their everyday lives. Each represents a different audience, from elite athletes to entrepreneurs, demonstrating that the company’s products deliver measurable results across lifestyles, reports Jupiter Neurosciences.

 “Jupiter Neurosciences is first and foremost a clinical-stage biotech company that has spent the past decade developing therapies for complex central nervous system (CNS) disorders. What makes our entry into the supplement space so unique is that we’re coming into it from the clinic, not the other way around,” a company spokesperson said. “It’s a natural evolution of our dual-path strategy: advancing prescription therapies for patients while empowering everyday consumers with credible, evidence-based solutions for healthy aging.”
