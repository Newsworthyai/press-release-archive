# Investors Have Waited Years For This Silver Breakout

By Johnny Rice, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Silver hit multiple all-time highs this year, surpassing highs seen in 2011. For investors who watched silver lag behind gold as it climbed to new all-time highs earlier, this has been the moment they’ve been waiting for.

 This isn’t new. History shows us that in precious metals bull markets, silver often lags gold, rising to new heights months after gold has done so. Why is silver so important? While it’s one of the world’s oldest and most trusted forms of currency, it’s also crucial for the operation of the modern world; nearly 60% of all silver demand comes from its industrial applications.

 For those looking to capitalize on this potential unique opportunity, the Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF (NASDAQ: SLVR) offers a pure-play solution. It is the only ETF focused on both silver miners and physical silver, providing comprehensive exposure to the entire sector. With the Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF, you have the opportunity to invest in one of the world’s oldest currencies

 Silver and other precious metals may be referred to as a “store of value,” “safe haven,” “safe asset” and a variety of synonymous terms and phrases. These terms of art commonly used in precious metals investing do not guarantee, explicitly or implicitly, any form of investment safety. While “safe” assets like silver and gold, Treasuries, money market funds, and cash, relative to others, typically do not carry a high risk of loss across all types of market cycles, there is no safety in any investment class and any asset class may lose value, including the possible loss of invested principal.

 A bull market is a period when the prices of stocks, or the overall market, are rising or expected to rise. It’s often marked by strong investor confidence, optimism about the economy, and increased buying activity.

 The Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF is new and has limited operating history. Investors in the Fund should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the Fund’s shares and the possibility of significant losses. The Fund will be concentrated in the silver mining industry. As a result, the Fund will be sensitive to changes in, and its performance will depend to a greater extent on, the overall condition of the silver mining industry, highly dependent on the price of silver bullion. The silver and precious metals industry can be significantly affected by competitive pressures, central bank operations, events relating to international political developments, the success of exploration projects, commodity prices, adverse environmental developments and tax and government regulations. An investment in the Fund involves a substantial degree of risk. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is considered non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund.

 Shares are not individually redeemable. Investors buy and sell shares of the Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF on a secondary market. Only authorized participants may trade directly with the Fund, typically in blocks of 10,000 shares.

 Funds that emphasize investments in small/mid-cap companies will generally experience greater price volatility. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of investment losses. ETFs are considered to have continuous liquidity because they allow an individual to trade throughout the day. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses, affect the Fund’s performance.
