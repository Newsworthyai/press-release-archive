 HONG KONG - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair (Wine & Spirits Fair) opens today and runs for three days (6–8 November) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. This year’s Wine & Spirits Fair features over 620 exhibitors from 23 countries and regions, including Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and exhibitors from the Americas, Asia, and Europe. With 18 pavilions, the Wine & Spirits Fair reinforces Hong Kong’s role as a regional hub for the wine and spirits trade.

 As the spirits market diversifies together with the Chief Executive’s announcement of reduced liquor duty in last year’s Policy Address, this year’s Wine & Spirits Fair introduces the “World of Spirits” zone, featuring spirits from 14 countries and regions. Visitors can explore spirits culture and flavours from around the world all in one place, featuring a strong presence of Chinese baijiu and local Hong Kong brands. Six of the “Top 10 Chinese Baijiu Brands” are exhibiting, including Kweichow Moutai, Jiangsu Yanghe, Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao, Jiannanchun and Langjiu from Sichuan. Also featured are Hongjiaban Baijiu, founded by Hong Kong actor Timmy Hung, and Kowloon Distillery, Hong Kong’s first local whiskey brand.

 This year, Xing Wei, Asia’s youngest Master of Wine, joins award-winning sommeliers Carlito Chiu and Calvin Choi in a blind tasting event to select their favourite red wines, white wines, Chinese baijiu, sake/rice wine, whisky, and other liquors, to serve as a reference for industry professionals and the public.
