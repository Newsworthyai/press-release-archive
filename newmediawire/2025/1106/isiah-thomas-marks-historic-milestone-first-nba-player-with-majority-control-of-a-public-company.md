# Isiah Thomas Marks Historic Milestone: First NBA Player With Majority Control of a Public Company

Positioning Isiah Enterprises for a Targeted Turnaround by December 2025 Through Operational Discipline and Expanded Manufacturing in Michigan

 DETROIT, MI - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hall of Famer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and visionary industrialist Isiah Thomas has once again entered uncharted territory, becoming the first NBA player in history to acquire and own majority control of a publicly traded company. Through his acquisition of One World Products (OTCQB: OWPC) - now transitioning into Isiah Enterprises - Thomas is leading a significant industrial turnaround, and the company is on track to reach break-even profitability by December 2025.

 “This is not just another business story, it’s an industrial comeback and a cultural milestone,” said Isiah Thomas, Chairman & CEO. “We’re proving that innovation, inclusion, and execution can coexist and that the American manufacturing story still belongs to those willing to build it.”

 The foundation of Isiah Enterprises was built on Thomas’s acquisition of Eco Bio Plastics Midland, a U.S. satellite of a Japanese R&D company located in Midland, Michigan. Once on the verge of bankruptcy, the newly acquired Eco Bio Plastics Midland facility became Thomas’s latest turnaround victory. Applying his trademark model to identify undervalued assets, infuse innovation, and scale sustainably, Thomas redirected Eco Bio toward the future of materials science. Under his leadership, the company’s focus expanded to renewable feedstocks derived from rice, corn, industrial hemp, soy, paper cellulose, and rubber, laying the groundwork for new product lines across automotive and food-service packaging.

 At the center of the company’s growth strategy is a patented process for pulverizing, micronizing, and pelletizing industrial hemp fibers, a proprietary technology that transforms raw hemp into lightweight, high-performance composites. This breakthrough process increases tensile strength and heat resistance for automotive components, replaces petroleum-based plastics in packaging and reusable containers, and cuts material weight and production emissions. The patent supports a differentiated competitive advantage as global industries pivot toward renewable materials.

 Isiah Enterprises has executed a staged buildout to scale, beginning with the acquisition and revitalization of Eco Bio Plastics Midland to establish a U.S. manufacturing hub. The company then expanded through One World Products to integrate global feedstocks and supply, and is now consolidating as Isiah Enterprises, a publicly traded, vertically integrated clean-tech leader. Today, Isiah Enterprises supplies industrial hemp-based bio-composites and reusable containers through partnerships with Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS Corporation, and West Michigan Compounding, delivering production-ready solutions to the automotive and packaging sectors.

 Automotive sustainability is accelerating as automakers face new mandates to reduce petroleum content. Bio-composites and lightweight materials represent a market projected to reach approximately 150 billion dollars by 2030, and Isiah Enterprises is already in production. Sustainable food and consumer packaging is projected to exceed 450 billion dollars by 2030, driven by regulation and consumer demand. Together, these sectors create nearly 1 trillion dollars in addressable market potential where Isiah Enterprises holds technical and geographic advantages.

 “Eco Bio gave us the science. One World gave us the platform. Isiah Enterprises gives us the scale,” Thomas said. “We expect a complete turnaround by year-end - break-even in December and momentum heading into 2026.”

 Isiah Thomas’s leadership record includes measurable achievement, innovation, and sustained leadership across multiple industries. He is the first NBA player to acquire majority control of a publicly traded company and serves as active Chairman & CEO guiding the public turnaround while evaluating pathways to a future national exchange listing.

 His turnaround track record includes returning American Speedy Printing to profitability and rebuilding Eco Bio Plastics Midland into a green-tech operation serving OEM partners. He oversees a patented bio-manufacturing platform for hemp fiber that pulverizes, micronizes, and pelletizes material at scale. He co-founded the Toronto Raptors, owns Cheurlin Champagne, and founded Isiah International LLC in 1990. He holds a Master’s in Education from UC Berkeley and serves on the boards of Sphere Entertainment / Madison Square Garden Sports and United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corp.

 “There’s no playbook for what we’re doing,” Thomas said. “I’ve built teams, brands, and industries. Now we’re building a legacy of ownership and sustainability that creates value for shareholders and communities alike.”

 Isiah Enterprises is exploring options for a potential future uplisting, expanding manufacturing in Michigan, and integrating AI-driven production analytics to optimize cost, quality, and throughput. The company projects break-even by December 2025, establishing itself as a model for sustainable profitability in U.S. manufacturing.
