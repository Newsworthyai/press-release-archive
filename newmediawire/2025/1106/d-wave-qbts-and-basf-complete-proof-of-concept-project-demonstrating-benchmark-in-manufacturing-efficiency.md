# D-Wave (QBTS) and BASF Complete Proof-of-Concept Project, Demonstrating Benchmark in Manufacturing Efficiency

LOS ANGELES, CA - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software, and services, and BASF, one of the world’s leading chemical companies, have completed a joint proof-of-concept project that used a hybrid-quantum application to optimize manufacturing workflows in a BASF liquid-filling facility. D-Wave’s hybrid-quantum technology set a new benchmark for manufacturing efficiency, allowing reduction of production scheduling time from 10 hours to just seconds, reducing lateness by 14% and setup times by 9%, and shortening tank unloading durations by up to 18%.

 “This project showcases how hybrid-quantum computing can help address manufacturing and supply-chain operational bottlenecks and begin delivering measurable value where classical computing falls short,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “We are thrilled to work with BASF and see these impressive, industry-defining results.”

 “D-Wave’s hybrid quantum technology demonstrated in this proof-of-concept that it has the potential to significantly improve optimization tasks, delivering faster decisions and better outcomes than classical-only solutions,” said Ionel Rusu, quantum computing innovation management, BASF.
