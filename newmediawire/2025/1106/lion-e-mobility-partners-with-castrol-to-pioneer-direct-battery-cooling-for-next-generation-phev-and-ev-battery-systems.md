# LION E-Mobility Partners With Castrol to Pioneer Direct Battery Cooling for Next Generation PHEV and EV Battery Systems

ZUG, Switzerland - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - LION E-Mobility AG (LION; ISIN: CH0560888270), a leading manufacturer of battery packs for electric mobility and energy storage solutions, announces that its subsidiary LION Smart Production GmbH has partnered with Castrol to facilitate the development of a new cutting-edge battery module for high-performance EV applications, combining LION Smart’s direct battery‑cooling innovation with Castrol’s advanced thermal fluids and battery thermal management expertise.The partnership aims to improve significantly battery thermal management for passenger cars, trucks and battery energy storage systems (BESS) worldwide, through direct battery cooling, a cutting‑edge approach that facilitates fast charging and discharging of battery cells that are submerged in a lightweight dielectric fluid. Castrol ON EV Thermal Fluids will be used to enable superior heat dissipation, enhance power density and improve battery lifespan and safety*.This new battery module has been engineered to deliver advanced cooling. It features a modular design for homogeneous temperature distribution and minimal temperature gradient within the cell. The structure is configured to help maximise the active cooled contact surface, while a ‘single cell fuse’ reduces potential propagation from internal short circuit.As a result of the innovations of this battery module, LION Smart has been able to significantly advance battery temperature management*. One consequence is that the battery module is able to improve the efficiency of plug‑in hybrids (PHEVs) due to higher levels of energy recuperation, greater power at a lower system cost and increased operational safety*.The alliance with LION Smart is part of Castrol’s strategic focus on direct battery cooling technologies and battery fluid innovation. The collaboration was highlighted at the recent Battery Show Europe, where experts from Castrol and LION Smart demonstrated the technology in action, showcasing its potential to significantly enhance the performance of PHEV applications through more efficient cooling and superior thermal balance*.Matthias Donner, VP Advanced Mobility and Industrial products at Castrol, commented: “Direct battery cooling is a transformative technology for EV performance and safety, and this collaboration is a significant step towards real-world deployment. Partnering with LION Smart allows us to demonstrate the full potential of Castrol ON EV Thermal Fluids in advanced battery systems. Together, we’re shaping a future where electric vehicles can charge faster and last longer** whilst operating more efficiently, even under extreme conditions."Michael Geppert, Head of Engineering at LION Smart, added: “Our battery system architecture is designed to push the boundaries of electrical performance in high-power applications, and Castrol’s direct battery cooling expertise is a perfect match. This partnership reinforces our commitment to delivering next-generation solutions that meet the growing demands of the electric mobility sector.”Notes:*based on internal testing, compared to conventional indirect battery cooling systems**Castrol ON EV Fluids benefits are demonstrated in bespoke testing of a direct cooled system in a broad range of environmental conditions vs a typical indirect cooled systemAbout Castrol:Castrol, one of the world’s leading lubricant brands, has a proud heritage of innovation and fuelling the dreams of pioneers.
