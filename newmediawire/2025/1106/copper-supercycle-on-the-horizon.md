# Copper Supercycle On The Horizon?

By Johnny Rice, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Imagine a material so critical that nearly every aspect of modern technology depends on it.

 That material is copper, and the critical metal is witnessing unprecedented demand. And while demand skyrockets, supply struggles to keep up. This supply-demand imbalance potentially creates a significant opportunity for investors. Historically, copper mining stocks have outperformed the metal itself during bull markets, providing investors with leveraged exposure to copper price increases.

 For those looking to capitalize on this unique potential opportunity, the Sprott Copper Miners ETF (NASDAQ: COPP) is the only pure-play copper ETF focused on copper miners and physical copper. With the Sprott Copper Miners ETF, you have the opportunity to invest in one of the world’s most critical materials facing rising demand.

 An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a Sprott Copper Miners ETF Statutory Prospectus, which contains this and other information, visit https://sprottetfs.com/copp/prospectus, contact your financial professional or call 888.622.1813. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.

 Investors in the Fund should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the Fund’s shares and the possibility of significant losses. An investment in the Fund involves a substantial degree of risk. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is considered non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund.

 A bull market is a period when the prices of stocks, or the overall market, are rising or expected to rise. It’s often marked by strong investor confidence, optimism about the economy, and increased buying activity.

 Shares are not individually redeemable. Investors buy and sell shares of the Sprott Copper Miners ETF on a secondary market. Only “authorized participants” may trade directly with the Fund, typically in blocks of 10,000 shares.

 Funds that emphasize investments in small/mid-cap companies will generally experience greater price volatility. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of investment losses. ETFs are considered to have continuous liquidity because they allow an individual to trade throughout the day. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses, affect the Fund’s performance.
