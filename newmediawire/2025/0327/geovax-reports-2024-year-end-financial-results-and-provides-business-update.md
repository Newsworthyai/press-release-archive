 ATLANTA, GA - March 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, today announced its financial results and key operational accomplishments for the year ended December 31, 2024.

 “We are entering 2025 from a position of strength following a pivotal year for GeoVax,” stated David Dodd, GeoVax’s Chairman and CEO. “In June 2024, we received BARDA’s Project NextGen award of nearly $400 million to advance GEO-CM04S1 in a Phase 2b clinical trial. Throughout the remainder of 2024, we were able to secure a high quality CRO partner and lay the foundation for our 10,000-patient study, progressing to producing the vaccine material for use in the clinical trial.”

 “We continue to build on our growing body of clinical evidence in support of GEO-CM04S1. In April 2024, we presented data at the 24th Annual World Vaccine Congress, highlighting data demonstrating vaccine induced immunity protects against infections, serious disease symptoms and death. GeoVax also reported positive initial safety and immune response data from the Phase 2 clinical trial of GeoVax as a booster in healthy adults who had previously received the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine and observed statistically significant increases in neutralizing antibody responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We continue to strive toward a solution for the critically underserved immunocompromised patient population, where the current mRNA vaccines do not provide adequate protection,” Dodd continued.

 “In parallel, we are advancing our manufacturing capabilities to address emerging threats to public health and U.S. national security. The need for these measures is critical and urgent, as evidenced by the recent Mpox public health emergency declaration by the World Health Organization. GeoVax remains committed to bolstering global preparedness through GEO-MVA, our vaccine candidate in development for protection against Mpox and smallpox, and through our efforts to establish an advanced MVA manufacturing processes domestically to combat this ongoing public health crisis. We are enthusiastic about the potential of our therapies to address meaningful market opportunities and look forward to a catalyst-rich 2025,” Dodd concluded.

 Clinical Trial Progress and Operational Developments

 GEO-CM04S1

 * Completed interim data review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of GEO-CM04S1, GeoVax’s dual-antigen next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, as a booster vaccine for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Based on the interim analysis of immune responses from the patients enrolled to date, the DSMB determined that, while the mRNA control arm of the study failed to meet the predetermined primary endpoint, the study should continue enrollment of the experimental arm utilizing GeoVax’s Next-Generation GEO-CM04S1 vaccine.  The Phase 2 trial is examining the use of two injections of GEO-CM04S1, three months apart, to assess immune responses in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, with an mRNA vaccine as the control arm. Thus far, participants have been randomized 1:1 to receive two boosters with either the GEO-CM04S1 or the mRNA control vaccine and the Company expects to complete the trial this year.
* Confirmed target sites of BARDA Project NextGen trial, and activities are underway in support of initiating the 10,000-participant, randomized, Phase 2b double-blinded study to compare the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GEO-CM04S1 with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
* Announced planned site expansion for the Phase 2 Immunocompromised/Stem Cell Transplant patient trial. GeoVax continues to advance its Phase 2 clinical trial of GEO-CM04S1 as a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. This study addresses a critical need for effective vaccination strategies in populations that may not respond adequately to existing vaccines.
* Completed enrollment in booster vaccine study for healthy adult volunteers. GeoVax has successfully completed enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating GEO-CM04S1 as a booster vaccine in healthy adults who previously received COVID-19 vaccines. This study aims to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity at two different dose levels, with data readouts anticipated in the first half of 2025.
* GEO-CMO4S1 addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $30B+.

 Gedeptin®

 * Advancing Gedeptin into Phase 2 clinical study evaluating neoadjuvant Gedeptin therapy in combination with an approved immune check point inhibitor (ICI) in 1st recurrent Head & Neck (H&N) cancer following an encouraging review of the data from the completed Phase 1 single-cycle and Phase 1/2 multi-cycle Gedeptin trials among patients with advanced H&N tumors.  This trial is anticipated to be a single-cycle trial in approximately 36 patients with a pathologic response rate as the primary endpoint, and key endpoints will include pathologic response rates and overall treatment outcomes. Planning is underway with leading academic oncology centers, while clinical trial material is being produced. As an FDA-designated Orphan Drug for anatomically accessible oral and pharyngeal cancers, Gedeptin is strategically positioned to address not only head and neck cancers but also other solid tumor indications, such as triple-negative breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma, and represents a significant market opportunity.
* Gedeptin addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $15B+.

 Mpox and Smallpox Vaccine Platform

 * Initiation on track for clinical evaluations of GEO-MVA while continuing discussions with various stakeholders regarding the opportunity to utilize GEO-MVA among underserved populations in regions including Africa. GEO-MVA is GeoVax’s vaccine candidate in development for protection against Mpox and Smallpox which was developed on the proven Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform. Clinical evaluation of the vaccine is expected to begin in late 2025.
* Successfully manufactured clinical batch of GEO-MVA in 2024 under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production. The Company's innovative advanced MVA manufacturing process is anticipated to provide scalable, flexible and cost-effective vaccine production, reducing reliance on foreign vaccine manufacturers and reinforcing domestic biosecurity.
* Actively pursuing strategic partnerships with governments, NGOs, and private-sector stakeholders to maximize the impact and reach of its GEO-MVA platform.
* GEO-MVA addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $10B+.

 Corporate and Intellectual Property Developments

 * Announced plan to establish strategic presence in the United Kingdom to advance manufacturing partnerships, European collaborations with service providers and academic partners, technology licensing opportunities and scientific expertise.
* Intellectual property assets further strengthened by multiple actions throughout 2024 by global patent offices. GeoVax currently has over 130 granted or pending patents across 23 different families.
