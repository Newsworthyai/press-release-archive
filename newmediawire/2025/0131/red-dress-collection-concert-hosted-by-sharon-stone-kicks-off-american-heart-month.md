# Red Dress Collection Concert hosted by Sharon Stone kicks off American Heart Month

(NewMediaWire) - January 31, 2025 - DALLAS — Academy Award-nominated actress and host Sharon Stone, alongside musical guests Sara Bareilles and Suki Waterhouse, headlined a roster of powerful players in music, entertainment, fashion and philanthropy to officially mark the start of American Heart Month at the Red Dress Collection® Concert on Thursday, January 30. The fashion-forward, musical celebration in New York City serves as the national marquee event for the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women® movement, celebrating progress made while calling for a renewed commitment to the fight against cardiovascular disease, the number one killer of women.

 The American Heart Association, the world’s leading nonprofit organization focused on changing the future of health for all, hosted the concert in the Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City. Each year, the event builds on the iconic tradition of the Red Dress Collection fashion show founded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s The Heart Truth® program two decades ago, adding musical performances and personal stories of those affected by heart disease and stroke. According to the American Heart Association’s just released 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update, cardiovascular diseases continue to claim more lives in the U.S. than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths – the #2 and #3 causes of death – combined.

 Stroke survivor and event host Sharon Stone wore Nicolas Jebran on the red carpet and SOLANGEL on stage. The internationally recognized actress, producer, humanitarian and New York Times bestselling author kicked off the evening by sharing her own connection to cardiovascular disease. Stone then shared her family history and personal experience with stroke. She spotlighted the survivors and women’s health champions in attendance before introducing the evening’s opening entertainment - singer, songwriter and actress Suki Waterhouse.

 Waterhouse wore Taller Marmo on the red carpet. Wearing Calcaterra for her performance, she opened with “Moves,” transitioning to “Wild Side” and “Don’t Look Back in Anger.” She concluded her set with “Good Looking.”

 This year’s concert was headlined by Grammy Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated singer and songwriter Sara Bareilles, who wore a Rochas ensemble. The set included “Orpheus,” “Uncharted,” “Love Song,” “Gravity,” “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,” “She Used to be Mine” and “Brave.”
