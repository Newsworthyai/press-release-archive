# National retailers support American Heart Month through Life is Why  campaigns

(NewMediaWire) - January 31, 2025 - DALLAS — More than 6 in 10 U.S. adults (61%) will develop some type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within the next 30 years, according to the latest research undertaken by teams from the American Heart Association. That is why this February, during American Heart Month, the Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, is collaborating with retailers from coast to coast to give consumers a chance to be part of the progress to overcome today’s biggest health challenges. Through the Association’s Life Is Why™ campaign, consumers can support the fight against cardiovascular disease by donating at checkout, in-store and online, while celebrating their personal reasons for living longer, healthier lives. Retailers and brands are stepping up to help make this life-saving campaign possible.

 “The work we do at the American Heart Association to promote cardiovascular and brain health, prevent heart disease and stroke, support research and provide resources to help people live longer, healthier lives—no matter where they live—is possible because of the support of contributors to Life is Why,” said Marsha Jones, 2023-2025 volunteer chairperson of the Board of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate American Heart Month and more than 100 years of lifesaving work, we acknowledge that there is still work to be done. To overcome today’s biggest health challenges and accelerate that future, each of us needs to be part of the progress. By driving breakthroughs in science, policy and care, together, we can continue to advance health and transform lives every day.”

 In February, through Life is Why, companies—including AT&T, Babiators, CVS Health, Daily Harvest, Harland Clarke, Kroger Health, MantraBand, Orangetheory Fitness, Pilot Travel Centers, The Container Store, Torrid, Warmies and White + Warren—invite their customers to support the American Heart Association in-store and online through a variety of ways such as donating at the point of sale. The American Heart Association welcomes inaugural campaign supporters Chinese Laundry, Crayola Flowers, Reebok and QVC to the companies supporting our mission this year. Life is Why will be celebrated by retailers with in-store signage and online banner ads sharing personal stories of survival and strength, the mission of the American Heart Association and inspiring healthy habits.

 Donations made through Life is Why participating retailers—no matter the amount— allow the Association to support the organization’s 2028 Impact Goal which will drive breakthroughs and implement proven solutions in science, policy and care for healthier people and communities. Those interested in supporting the American Heart Association’s Life is Why campaign can look for the Life is Why logo where they buy groceries, get their gas, exercise and shop in participating locations and online beginning in February and during select times throughout the year.
