# The Chlorine Institute Recognizes 39 North American and International Facilities for Diamond Level Safety and Environmental Performance for 2024

ARLINGTON, VA - April 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - A select group of 39 North American and International chlor-alkali producer, packager, bleach manufacturer, and chlorine end user facilities earned The Chlorine Institute’s (CI) “Diamond Level” status, the highest level of safety and environmental recognition at the Institute’s 2025 Annual Meeting. Chlorine is an essential chemical that, while widely known for its role in disinfecting drinking water, has a myriad of other important uses, including the production of plastics like PVC, the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and metal refining and extraction.

 “CI’s Safety and Environmental Recognition Program highlights our industry’s unwavering commitment to protecting people, communities, and the environment,” said CI President Frank Reiner. “Our members embrace the ‘Aim for Zero’ philosophy - zero injuries, zero incidents, and zero releases. This year’s Diamond Level facilities didn’t just aim for zero - they achieved it. Their outstanding performance sets the benchmark for excellence across the industry.”

 Diamond Level recognition is based on 2024 safety and environmental data and represents the highest honor in CI’s program. Facilities earning this elite designation maintained zero recordable injuries, zero reportable quantity (RQ) incidents, and zero Risk Management Plan (RMP) reportable accidents within their chlor-alkali operations over a consecutive five-year period.

 “Diamond Level recognition is the ‘Triple Crown’ of safety and environmental achievement,” Reiner added. “By honoring those who successfully ‘Aim for Zero,’ CI inspires all facilities to pursue the highest standards of performance, while fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This recognition program reinforces the core of CI’s Member Safety and Security Commitment and highlights the value of the Institute’s comprehensive resources - including training, guidance materials, videos, and best practices - that support the safety of our members, their customers, and the broader value chain.”

 The Chlorine Institute exists to support the chlor-alkali industry in advancing safe, secure, environmentally compatible and sustainable production, distribution and use of its mission chemicals: chlorine, sodium and potassium hydroxides, sodium hypochlorite, the distribution of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and the distribution and use of hydrogen chloride.  Visit us online at: www.chlorineinstitute.org.
