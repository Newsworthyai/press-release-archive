# Dr. Doug Milburn of Protocase and ProtoSpace Mfg. to Speak at Canadian Space Launch Conference

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - April 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Protocase and ProtoSpace Mfg. proudly announce that Dr. Doug Milburn, Co-Founder and Chairman, will be a featured speaker at the inaugural Canadian Space Launch Conference (CSLC) on April 29, 2025, in Ottawa - a pivotal gathering aimed at securing Canada's long-overdue sovereign access to space.

 Dr. Milburn will deliver a lightning talk titled "Canada's Aerospace Manufacturing Advantage - Making the Impossible, Possible" at 2:00 PM, highlighting how Canada’s world-class manufacturing sector must serve as the backbone for a thriving, independent space launch capability.

 For too long, Canada has remained the only G7 and Five Eyes nation without its own launch abilities. Our vulnerability is growing - and so is the global space economy, projected to top $1 trillion by 2040. Without immediate, coordinated action, Canada risks becoming a permanent bystander in the next great era of human achievement.

 The Canadian Space Launch Conference, organized by NordSpace, is an unprecedented summit bringing together leaders across government, military, industry, academia, and not-for-profit sectors to chart a path forward. This is not a conference for talk - it’s a working meeting for action.

 "A sovereign, globally competitive, spacefaring Canada doesn’t have to be a dream anymore if we take the right actions now," said Dr. Milburn. "We either build the capabilities to access it ourselves, or we become dependent forever. Sovereign launch is our opportunity to lead, to inspire a new generation of innovators, and to safeguard Canada’s place in the world. This window won’t be open forever, and I’m excited to be part of a dynamic group of those taking action.”

 Conference highlights include:

 * Opening Keynote by Brigadier-General Christopher Horner, Commander of 3 Canadian Space Division
* Closing Keynote by Brian Gallant, CEO of Space Canada
* Panels on Defence, Security, Sovereignty, Policy and Vision, Commercial Space Development, Regulatory Readiness, Economics and Industry Growth, and Student Rocketry
* Lightning Talks from key innovators including Dr. Doug Milburn
* Strategic updates on launch vehicle development, spaceport infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks

 The inaugural CSLC is sponsored by leaders committed to advancing Canadian space sovereignty, including: ProtoSpace Mfg., Galaxia, Spaceport Canada, Calian, AON, Galileo Space, GHGSat, and Kepler Communications, among others.

 Canada’s window of opportunity is open - but it will not stay open indefinitely. Achieving sovereign launch will bring sweeping benefits: from national security, job creation, and technological independence to environmental protection and economic development. This is a once-in-a-century moment to ensure that Canada is not just a participant in the new space economy - but a leader.
