# Golden Matrix Group Repays and Retires Lind Global Convertible Note, Eliminating $7.2 Million in Debt

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - April 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) (“GMGI” or “the Company”) today announced that it has prepaid in full, the total remaining principal of Lind Global Asset Management VIII LLC’s (“Lind Global’s”) Senior Secured Promissory Note in the amount of $7.2 million. The repayment of the debt was funded entirely by the Company’s cash on hand and no shares were issued ensuring that shareholders were not diluted.

 The settlement of this Note is a significant step in the Company’s strategic evolution and is expected to provide enhanced financial flexibility as GMGI implements its global growth strategy, executes on key initiatives and continues to build on its strong performance to date.

 The decision to repay Lind Global, in conjunction with the recent conversion of an aggregate of $9,570,460 by Meridian founders in acquisition-related debt into equity, improves the Net Debt Ratio of the Company.

 "This move sends a strong message to both the market and to our shareholders," said Brian Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix Group, who continued, "The settlement of the Lind Global Note reflects our commitment to supporting our shareholders and building long-term value. It also clearly demonstrates the strong underlying performance of the Company and its expected growth trajectory. In addition to strengthening GMGI’s financial position, this conversion improves the Company’s financial flexibility and reinforces the positive momentum we have achieved so far.”

 GMGI remains focused on creating long-term value for shareholders while maintaining strong partnerships with key stakeholders across its growing international footprint.

 Additional information about the transaction can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
