# Perfect Moment May Be The Trending Skiwear Brand To Watch

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - June 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Forget Canada Goose or Moncler, it appears that when it comes to trending brands, Perfect Moment Ltd. (NYSE: PMNT) may be the one to watch. The luxury ski apparel company, which has been outfitting skiers and swimmers for decades, has been making a name for itself among celebrities, influencers and sports enthusiasts - with a focus on making its mark among the top echelons of high-end skiwear and lifestyle apparel.

 It’s not by accident. Perfect Moment, which has a storied history that dates back to the early 80s, melds high-performance garments and statement designs to create ski, swim and lifestyle outerwear and apparel that appeals to the masses. The company says its retro-inspired vivid and bold color palettes complement technical fabrics to deliver fashion, form, function and fun for women, men and children. While the luxury line appeals to well-heeled customers, it’s meant to be affordable enough for everyone. That hasn’t been lost on the millions of consumers who follow and engage with the brand on Social Media, enabling Perfect Moment to garner record brand coverage during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

 "Our highest-ever numbers demonstrate our brand’s rising cultural relevance, deepening consumer appeal and strong growth momentum as we enter our next phase of growth and evolution," says Jane Gottschalk, Perfect Moment president and chief creative officer. "We couldn’t be more excited about what we have achieved and the phenomenal opportunities ahead.”

 Record-Setting Year

 For the fiscal year 2025, Perfect Moment set a record in total number of unique visitors per month across digital platforms, hitting 16.6 billion globally and marking a 108% increase year-over-year. The brand also reached a record 934 million in total social audience based on content posted by global key opinion leaders about the brand - including celebrities, influencers, models, media publications and fashion industry notables - who the company reports organically posted about Perfect Moment during the year. During the ski season, Perfect Moment’s key opinion leaders reached 597.1 million people on social media.

 The company’s own followers currently exceed 440,000 across its social media platforms – Instagram, Facebook and TikTok - up about 15.2% year-over-year. That, says the company, places Perfect Moment among the world’s most followed luxury brands.

 "The tremendous global reach and influencer engagement we’ve achieved over the past year has elevated our brand awareness to levels rivalling our closest peers, including Moncler and Canada Goose," noted Gottschalk.

 A Following Among Celebrities

 It’s not surprising that Perfect Moment is creating such a buzz. In addition to being a fixture on the slopes with its high-performance skiwear, the company has expanded into new categories, including a line of apparel and accessories designed for customers off the slopes. Its lifestyle brand includes sweaters, pants and jackets while its accessories include hats, gloves, scarfs, bags and ski goggles. That has resulted in a following among well-known celebrities and influencers that Perfect Moment is capitalizing on by teaming up with its celebrity and influencer fans.

 During the fourth quarter alone, the company got a lot of attention on social, with numerous Instagram posts by high-profile celebrities and influencers. The company reports that these include Priyanka Chopra Jonas, the award-winning global film and fashion icon who has 92.5 million followers, Anitta, a Brazilian singer, songwriter, actress and businesswoman with 64.2 million followers, Miranda Kerr, Australian model and founder of Kora Organics with 14.4 million followers and Sara Sampaio, a Portuguese model and movie actress with 8.5 million followers. Other influencers to talk up the brand include Victoria Brito, a Brazilian model, dancer and designer with 2.4 million followers, Rachel Brosnahan, an American-British actress and comedian with 1.1 million followers and  Xandra Pohl, a professional DJ and 2024 Sports Illustrated swimsuit model with 551,000 followers.

 Perfect Moment is also building brand awareness through new partnerships, including its recent collaboration with Johnnie Walker, the scotch whiskey distiller. The two teamed up to launch a limited-edition Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ice Chalet. Unveiled by Johnnie Walker Blue Label ambassador and Perfect Moment shareholder actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas, the new blend comes with a bottle and bag designed by Perfect Moment and inspired by what’s referred to as the “Blue Hour,” when skiing is done and socializing commences. Perfect Moment also launched a capsule ski wear collection for both women and men, featuring coordinating designs, which have been inspired by the Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ice Chalet design. The launch was supported by several curated brand experiences, exclusive press coverage and organic influencer engagement, further underscoring Perfect Moment’s trajectory as a leading brand in performance luxury. The launch received coverage in InStyle, which boasts 4.3 million followers, Refinery29, which has 3.4 million followers and L’Officiel Brazil with 543,000 followers, noted Perfect Moment.

 The Momentum Continues

 All of that branding could pay off nicely for a company going after the global luxury ski apparel market that is forecasted to reach $2.9 billion by 2033, and the luxury outerwear market, which is expected to reach $32.15 billion by 2033. It has already booked a record number of wholesale pre-orders for its Upcoming Autumn/Winter collection, with the orders already exceeding the company’s wholesale orders for last year’s Autumn/Winter collection by 30%, reports Perfect Moment. Excluding collaborations, Perfect Moment says this marks the largest wholesale book in the company’s history and serves as a testament to its wide array of celebrity and influencer backers. The orders come from new and existing customers, with the latter increasing their year-ago levels of orders.

 From the slopes to the streets, Perfect Moment is outfitting women, men and children and seems to be garnering a lot of attention along the way. With a large social media presence, the company may be pushing out some of the endearing luxury brands, making a name for itself that could resonate for months and years to come.
