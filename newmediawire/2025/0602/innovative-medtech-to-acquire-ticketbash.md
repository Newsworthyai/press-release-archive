# Innovative MedTech to Acquire Ticketbash

Innovative MedTech Makes Strategic Shift in Business Direction to the AI Sports and Entertainment Industry

 BLUE ISLAND, IL - June 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative MedTech, Inc. (the "Company") (OTC: IMTH), a provider of health and wellness services, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of Ticketbash, a ticket servicing company for live events. Ticketbash had 2024 revenues of approximately $7.6 Million Dollars (unaudited) and has recently developed proprietary AI software that is expected to bring much-needed transparency and cost efficiency to the ticket industry.

 “This asset acquisition is very exciting for the Company, as it marks a bold and strategic move into the flourishing sports, entertainment and media sectors. In connection with this asset acquisition, we are reviewing several attractive options for our healthcare businesses, including a sale of our SarahCare subsidiaries and a potential spin-off of our Oral Thrush product.  Although we strongly believe in these businesses, they do not fit with our strategic shift into the AI sports and entertainment platforms and the amazing growth opportunities we are targeting therein,” said Michael Friedman, CEO of Innovative MedTech.

 He continued, “Acquiring Ticketbash should open a whole host of new possibilities for us, as we gain traction with Ticketbash’s proprietary AI platform - a scalable technology already transforming ticketing operations. The move should position the Company at the forefront of applying advanced AI to build new business models and reach new markets faster than ever before. We, with Ticketbash, are already negotiating service deals with some of the up-and-coming giants in the sports industry and are also actively looking into several significant acquisition and joint venture opportunities.”

 Integration efforts are already underway to expand the AI platform’s applications into both existing and new verticals. Additionally, the Company intends to file for a name and symbol change to reflect the new business.
