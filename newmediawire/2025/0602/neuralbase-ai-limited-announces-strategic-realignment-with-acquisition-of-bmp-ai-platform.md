# Neuralbase AI Limited Announces Strategic Realignment with Acquisition of BMP AI Platform

LAS VEGAS, NV - June 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neuralbase AI Limited (OTC: NBBI), a leader in artificial intelligence solutions, is pleased to announce a strategic realignment centered on the acquisition of the BMP AI platform, a next-generation enterprise-grade artificial intelligence software solution. This acquisition marks a significant milestone in Neuralbase AI's mission to deliver secure, compliant, and intelligent document processing solutions tailored for regulated industries.

 On May 19, 2025, Neuralbase AI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vighnesh Dobale, acquiring all rights, title, and interest in the BMP AI business, including its intellectual property, software, code, and technology. As consideration, Neuralbase AI issued 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Dobale.

 The BMP AI platform, expected to fully launch in the near future, is being engineered to empower organizations to deploy intelligent assistants that generate answers, automate workflows, and deliver insights based exclusively on verified internal documents, data, and knowledge bases. Unlike general-purpose AI models trained on public internet data, BMP AI is specifically designed to support mission-critical use cases in regulated sectors such as healthcare, financial services, legal operations, and enterprise compliance.

 At Neuralbase AI, our mission is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to transform the way organizations interact with their documents. Through the development and integration of BMP AI, we are committed to delivering innovative, reliable, and scalable AI solutions that empower businesses to unlock the full potential of their data while adhering to the highest standards of compliance and security.

 The BMP AI platform is expected to include the following features:

 • Document Ingestion: Secure uploading and parsing of content (PDFs, Word documents, HTML, etc.)

 • Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search: AI-powered document matching and relevance scoring

 • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Contextual response generation based only on internal content

 • Compliance and Privacy Layer: End-to-end encryption, access control, audit logging, and localization features

 • Output Interfaces: Integration with chatbots, dashboards, APIs, and enterprise platforms

 Neuralbase AI is positioning BMP AI to serve as a core platform for a range of next-generation AI applications, including:

 • AI-assisted compliance and auditing

 • Predictive analytics and data intelligence

 • Conversational AI for enterprise workflows

 • Legal document interpretation and financial reporting

 • Secure AI co-pilots in healthcare and government sectors

 The Company’s R&D focus includes industry-specific customization, explainable AI (XAI) tools, multilingual expansion, and GDPR/HIPAA-compliant architecture. Commercially, Neuralbase AI will focus on B2B enterprise sales, strategic technology partnerships, and self-service SaaS deployments for SMEs.
