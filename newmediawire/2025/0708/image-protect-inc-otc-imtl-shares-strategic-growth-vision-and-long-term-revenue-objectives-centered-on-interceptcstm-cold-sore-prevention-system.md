# Image Protect, Inc. (OTC: IMTL) Shares Strategic Growth Vision and Long-Term Revenue Objectives Centered on InterceptCS™ Cold Sore Prevention System

TAMPA, FL - July 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Image Protect, Inc. (OTC:IMTL) (ImageProtectCorporation.com) (“Image Protect” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update to shareholders regarding the initial progress made since the March 13, 2025, launch of its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Wellness Products, and the official introduction of its flagship innovation: the InterceptCS™ Cold Sore Prevention System. While still in the early stages of commercialization and brand development, the Company believes it is important to keep shareholders informed of management’s long-term strategic vision and operational roadmap. Today’s update outlines the foundational efforts underway, the targeted growth trajectory, and the guiding principles behind the Company’s entry into the wellness technology space.

 InterceptCS™: A New Approach to Cold Sore PreventionInterceptCS™ represents an innovative entry into the personal wellness space. It is classified as a Class II Medical Device by Health Canada for the prevention of cold sores. The Company is not aware of any other thermal therapy devices currently approved for this specific use - namely, the prevention of cold sores when used during the prodrome stage (the initial sensation before an outbreak). This designation reinforces InterceptCS™ as a non-drug, clinically tested device intended to support early-stage cold sore care. In the United States, it is sold with appropriate FDA disclaimers.

 Cold Sore Market Opportunity Cold sores remain a widespread condition globally, with substantial demand for preventative solutions:

 * United States: Estimated market size of approximately $1.2 billion annually*
* Canada: Estimated at roughly $150 million annually*
* Global: Estimated market size exceeds $3.5 billion annually*

 These figures reflect the opportunity for wellness-oriented solutions like InterceptCS™ to address consumer needs. (*Based on internal estimates and publicly available industry reports.)

 Sales Channels and Expansion Plans The Company is working to make InterceptCS™ accessible through both direct-to-consumer and third-party sales channels. While the product is not yet live on Amazon, preparations are in progress across several regions:

 * Canada: Available at GlobalWellnessProducts.com; Amazon.ca listing in development
* United States: Available via direct ecommerce; Amazon.com onboarding underway
* International: The Company is evaluating key markets including the UK, Australia, and the EU, where Amazon will serve as a key platform for visibility and logistics

 In addition to Amazon and direct ecommerce, the Company is exploring other online marketplaces such as Walmart.com, eBay, and select health-focused platforms to broaden access and accelerate consumer adoption of InterceptCS™.

 This multi-channel strategy aims to improve accessibility while leveraging established fulfillment infrastructure.

 Business Model and Long-Term Revenue Goals The Company believes InterceptCS™ has the potential to become a recognized wellness brand. Based on internal models, Image Protect has outlined a long-term objective of reaching up to $100 million in annual revenue within the next five years, driven by device sales and recurring thermal activator purchases.

 Management estimates that each user may generate approximately $200 in annual revenue. Under this model:

 * 500,000 active customers x $200/year = $100 million/year (target only)

 While these figures are estimates and not guarantees of future performance, they reflect the Company’s long-term strategic objectives and focus on recurring revenue. These projections are management goals and do not represent guaranteed outcomes.

 Marketing Strategy Global Wellness Products is executing a diverse marketing plan to support brand awareness and customer acquisition:

 * Social Media Campaigns (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X)
* Paid Advertising (Facebook Ads, Taboola, Outbrain)
* Search Engine Marketing (Google Search, Shopping)
* Organic SEO and Educational Content
* Affiliate Programs via Awin and related platforms
* Influencer and Brand Ambassador outreach
* Connected TV (CTV) and Streaming Advertising
* Walmart Marketplace placement
* Target Marketplace placement
* Ebay Branded InterceptCS™ Store

 These efforts are designed to build visibility and drive scalable, long-term growth.

 CEO Commentary “We are encouraged by the early response to InterceptCS™ and believe we are well-positioned to address a large, underserved consumer need,” said Frank Casella, CEO of Global Wellness Products. “While we remain in the early stages, our strategic planning is focused on sustainable growth across multiple channels. Internal studies suggest there may be as many as 49 million cold sore sufferers in North America, which represents a significant addressable market. In addition, we focused on building a strong recurring revenue model through the sale of thermal activators, which are required for each session. Much like razor blades to a handle, the long-term value lies in ongoing use. Our engineering team is currently developing a new multi-use thermal activator designed to offer more treatments at a lower cost to the consumer - while also improving profit margins. With our initial 20,000-unit inventory in hand, we’re actively fulfilling orders not only to new customers, but are also marketing to the thousands of Canadian consumers who previously purchased InterceptCS™ at the retail level. We believe our marketing strategy mirrors successful growth models used by other wellness products - many of which treat symptoms after an outbreak, whereas InterceptCS™ is approved to help prevent cold sores before they appear. I want to congratulate our entire team. At this stage, we are well-equipped to meet our interim goals and are laying the foundation for the next phase of growth.”
