# NeuralBase Provides Update on BMP AI Platform Development and Targeted Q4 2025 Feature Releases

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neuralbase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and a growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today provided a product development update outlining recent progress on its BMP AI platform and key features targeted for release in Q4 2025.

 The BMP AI platform is Neuralbase AI’s proprietary document-grounded enterprise AI system designed for deployment across highly regulated industries, including healthcare, financial services, legal services, government, and enterprise knowledge management sectors. BMP AI leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, explainability tooling, and enterprise-grade governance features to deliver secure, compliant AI assistants capable of automating document workflows while preserving auditability and regulatory oversight.

 The Company is actively advancing development of several new platform modules, including:

 * Explainability Overlay Module: Allows end users and auditors to view source-linked responses with document citations, confidence scoring, and traceable reasoning paths.
* Multi-Chatbot Orchestration Framework: Enables enterprise customers to configure multiple domain-specific AI agents with separate knowledge bases, security permissions, and operational scopes.
* Advanced Vector Search Optimization: Enhances hybrid semantic and keyword-based retrieval pipelines to improve search accuracy across large unstructured document repositories.
* Compliance Pack Deployment Options: Adds configuration templates for HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, and other vertical-specific compliance standards to streamline AI deployment readiness for enterprise clients.
* Enterprise Admin Portal: Expands administrative capabilities for role-based access control, audit logging, model version control, and reporting dashboards.

 "We are building BMP AI not simply as an AI engine, but as a fully governed enterprise platform designed from the ground up to address the unique challenges facing regulated organizations adopting AI," said Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of Neuralbase AI Ltd. "These targeted feature releases reflect our continued execution toward scalable enterprise deployment while maintaining our core focus on compliance, explainability, and document-grounded intelligence."

 The Company expects to begin phased availability of these features in Q4 2025 as part of its ongoing product development roadmap. Neuralbase AI is also continuing to engage in global AI industry forums as part of its broader market development program, including participation in the upcoming Global AI Show Abu Dhabi in December 2025.
