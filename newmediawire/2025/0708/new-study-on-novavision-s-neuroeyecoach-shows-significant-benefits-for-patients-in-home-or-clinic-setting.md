# New Study on NovaVision's NeuroEyeCoach Shows Significant Benefits for Patients in Home or Clinic Setting

BOCA RATON, FL - July 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vycor Medical, Inc. (“Vycor” or the “Company”) (OTCQB:VYCO), today announced that the publication of a new peer reviewed clinical paper on its NovaVision division’s NeuroEyeCoach training program. This important study provides further clinical data supporting its NeuroEyeCoach as a standard of care in saccadic training, resulting in significant improvement in visual search performance and a reduction in visual disability, and in particular its relevance to the growing global trend towards at-home digital health.

 The Company operates through two business units: Vycor Medical, which produces the ViewSite™ Brain Access System (VBAS) for neurosurgery; and NovaVision®, a business in development which offers therapy programs to help patients recover from visual disorders after stroke or brain injury.

 NeuroEyeCoach was validated in a 296 patient peer-reviewed clinical study published in Cortex, which demonstrated significant improvements in visual search. This study remains the largest published eye movement training study, with clinical results evidencing strong efficacy of NeuroEyeCoach, with 87% improvements in search time and 80% of patients making fewer errors. The study was led by University of Aberdeen, UK, and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, USA.

 This new study, which follows on from the Cortex study, has been published by Springer May 2025 Experimental Brain Research. This study was done as a collaboration between the Neurorehabilitation unit of the Neuromotor and Cognitive Rehabilitation Research Centre, University of Verona, Italy, and NovaVision. Ethical approval was granted by the Psychology Ethics Committee, University of Aberdeen, UK. The study compared two patient groups who used NeuroEyeCoach; 95 consecutive patients who accessed the therapy at home and 31 consecutive patients who attended the clinic in Verona.

 NeuroEyeCoach was designed and developed to be able to provide eye movement training for patients in both a clinic setting and in a home setting. Vision rehabilitation provisions vary across Europe and even in various states in the US, ranging from specialist care in clinical settings to home-based training or advice. There has been a significant drive to access digital technologies in home settings in parts of Europe and remotely accessed therapies are promoted in the US. NeuroEyeCoach was designed to provide low-cost delivery to allow wide access. The purpose of the study was to assess if there are meaningful differences in the benefit to and improvement in patients in a clinic setting compared to a home setting.

 Study Conclusions

 The study concluded that the NeuroEyeCoach “compensatory eye movement training is an effective tool for rehabilitation of vision loss when used in clinical settings or accessed remotely from home”.

 NeuroEyeCoach led to improvements for home-based and clinic-based patients in both objective measures of visual function such as reduced visual search times, lower search errors, and faster completion of a cancellation task as well as reduced subjective reports of disability. No significant differences were identified between the effect of training on activities of daily living between the home-based and clinic-based groups.
