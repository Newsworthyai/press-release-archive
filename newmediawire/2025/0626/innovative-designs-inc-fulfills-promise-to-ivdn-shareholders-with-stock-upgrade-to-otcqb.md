# Innovative Designs, Inc. Fulfills Promise to IVDN Shareholders With Stock Upgrade to OTCQB

Company on Track for Best Year Ever With Record Homebuilding Industry Sales Growth Delivering Three Trailing Quarters of Profitability to Date

 PITTSBURGH, PA - June 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative Designs, Inc. (OTCQB: IVDN) is very pleased to announce that as of this date, the Company’s IVDN shares have been upgraded to the OTCQB tier. Notice of this approval was officially received from the OTC Markets Group yesterday. This upgrade comes after months of diligent work to complete all of the required documentation and qualification criteria for the OTCQB listing as well as all necessary fees being paid in full.

 With the OTCQB upgrade now complete and effective as of today, IVDN should be receiving increased coverage by more public stock trading sites and brokerage firms. Company management and representation will directly contact any sites or firms that do not immediately begin recognizing the upgraded status of IVDN to the OTCQB to ensure their proper response for the benefit of all our investors. Wider exposure of IVDN, with all of its recent news announcements and increasingly positive financial filings, is well warranted at this time as the Company is now delivering the strongest performance in its history with profitability achieved on the last three trailing fiscal quarters.

 Steadily increasing demand for Innovative Designs Insultex House Wrap® is being driven by new government building codes requiring continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements. For new construction, our patented and unique evacuated cell Insultex House Wrap®, adds an R-6 moisture barrier membrane that does not need additional insulation boards or other support as with other products from competitors. This makes Insultex House Wrap®, the best overall insulation house wrap choice available on the market today. For full product specifications and details visit: http://www.insultexhousewrap.com.

 Joseph A. Riccelli Jr., CEO of Innovative Designs, commented, “Since I took over as the Company CEO several months ago, it has been one of my high priorities to achieve the upgrading of our IVDN stock from the OTC Pink to the higher and much more recognized OTCQB tier. As I mentioned numerous times in my public comments, this was an important promise made to our shareholders that I was determined to keep so that their investment in our company could be better recognized for the value appreciation it deserves. Going forward, our management and operations team intends to do our very best to maintain all listing requirements, including timely financial reporting, to keep the upgraded status of IVDN shares in good standing. We also look forward to completing the Company’s 2025 fiscal year as the best on record, by far. We encourage everyone to review and follow our IVDN news announcement and filings for all the details.”
