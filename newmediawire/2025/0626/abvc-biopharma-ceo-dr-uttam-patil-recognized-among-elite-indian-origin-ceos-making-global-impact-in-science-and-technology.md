# ABVC BioPharma CEO Dr. Uttam Patil Recognized Among Elite Indian-Origin CEOs Making Global Impact in Science and Technology

SILICON VALLEY, CA - June 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, proudly announces that a podcast with Biotech Orbit (https://youtu.be/TYrNEA0mG-8?si=xnCCjK1ZrRIw8OK7), featured the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Uttam Patil, among their list of the most influential Indian-origin CEOs leading major global organizations.

 On the podcast, Dr. Patil discussed the Company’s flagship antidepressant candidate, ABV-1504, which is preparing to enter Phase III clinical trials. In the interview, Dr. Patil emphasized a critical differentiator found thus far in in-house trials of ABV-1504 – the absence of suicidal ideation, a side effect commonly associated with conventional synthetic antidepressants.

 “We believe ABV-1504 represents the potential for a new generation of safe, plant-derived psychiatric treatments,” said Dr. Patil. He continued, “While the medical community remains cautious toward botanical drugs, we are hopeful that our clinical program will build the confidence needed to drive acceptance and adoption globally.”

 Dr. Patil joins an exclusive group of Indian-origin CEOs leading major global institutions. His inclusion on the list underscores the rising influence of biotech executives with deep R&D roots and global strategic vision.

 Under his leadership, ABVC BioPharma has built a differentiated botanical drug platform supported by rigorous science and clinical evidence. The upcoming Phase III study of ABV-1504 aims to position the drug as the world’s first botanical antidepressant with no suicide-related side effects, which would mark a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

 ABVC BioPharma is strategically positioned in growing markets. The global MDD market is projected to grow from $11.51 billion in 2022 to $14.96 billion by 2032, with a steady CAGR of 2.8%.[1] The global ADHD treatment market is also growing, expected to increase from $15.23 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 7.3% through 2032.[2] Additionally, the global botanical drug market, valued at $163 million in 2021, is forecasted to experience an impressive CAGR of 39% through 2030, reaching $3.2 billion.[3]
