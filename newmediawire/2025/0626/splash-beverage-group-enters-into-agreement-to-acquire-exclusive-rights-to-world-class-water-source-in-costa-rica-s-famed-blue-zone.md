# Splash Beverage Group Enters Into Agreement to Acquire Exclusive Rights to World-Class Water Source in Costa Rica's Famed Blue Zone

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - June 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) ("Splash" or the "Company"), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced that it has entered into an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive water rights to one of the most pristine natural spring sources in the world - an underground network of aquifers located in the cloud rainforests of Costa Rica, within one of only five globally recognized “Blue Zone,” areas famed for human longevity and natural wellness.

 This $20 million asset acquisition will provide Splash with full ownership and control over the source of Blu, a boutique premium water brand already gaining traction among discerning consumers. Independent testing confirms that the naturally alkaline spring water, filtered through volcanic rock and rich biodiversity, exceeds global leaders on various measured purity and mineral indices - including pH, magnesium, calcium, and silica levels. The Company issued $20 million of a new series of convertible preferred stock pursuant to the agreement, and the seller agreed to deliver the assets or $20 million in lieu thereof in exchange for such preferred stock. It’s anticipated that the completion of the mineral rights documents, land deeds and physical assets will fully transfer to the Company on or about August 10th. The seller has until December 31, 2025 to fully transfer the rights if they extend beyond the targeted date in August. To ensure the Company is activating this asset this year, the Asset Purchase Agreement requires a delivery deadline of December 31, 2025. If the seller does not deliver before the end of the calendar year it must pay Splash $20 million or its preferred stock will be cancelled.

 "With year-one orders already exceeding $10 million, this acquisition is not only strategically aligned with global trends in clean hydration and wellness, but also represents a powerful new revenue engine for our portfolio," said William Meissner, President and Chief Marketing Officer of Splash Beverage Group. "It allows us to control a rare and scalable natural asset, giving us both brand and supply-side leverage in the premium water category.”

 The source will anchor an expanded brand platform that begins with Blu and extends into new offerings, including a super-premium glass bottle line and a sustainable canned water line leveraging Splash’s access to Carto-Can, the eco-friendly paper can its Pulpoloco sangria uses. All products will be bottled at the source using sustainable practices, with certification pathways underway for carbon neutrality and rainforest preservation.

 This move reinforces Splash’s strategy of acquiring and scaling unique, high-margin beverage brands. The Company’s leadership team brings a proven track record in building iconic, nationally known beverage brands.

 “The story of this water is unmatched - geology, purity, sustainability, and a wellness narrative that consumers are craving,” added Bill Meissner, Splash President & CMO. “It’s a foundational asset that positions us for accelerated brand growth and long-term value creation.”
