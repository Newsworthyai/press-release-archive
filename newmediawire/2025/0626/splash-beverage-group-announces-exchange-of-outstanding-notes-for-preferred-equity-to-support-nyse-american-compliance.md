# Splash Beverage Group Announces Exchange of Outstanding Notes for Preferred Equity to Support NYSE American Compliance

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - June 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced that it has exchanged approximately $12.67 million of outstanding promissory notes for newly issued preferred equity. The company is undertaking these transactions to convert debt into equity as part of its effort to regain compliance with the shareholder equity requirements of the NYSE American. Splash estimated that it needed to exchange at least $10 million of outstanding indebtedness to meet the exchange’s shareholder equity standards.

 The transaction is a key step in the company’s broader effort to strengthen its capital structure. By converting debt into equity, Splash Beverage Group enhances its balance sheet, reduces interest expense, and improves its shareholder equity position in furtherance of its goal of complying with exchange requirements. The company will also need to make certain filings with the SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, to regain compliance with NYSE American under a separate exchange requirement.

 “We are grateful for the continued support of our investors as we work to position Splash for long-term success,” said Bill Devereux, CFO of Splash Beverage Group. “This exchange reflects investor confidence and allows us to move forward with a healthier capital structure and increased financial flexibility.”

 The newly issued preferred shares offer a 12% cumulative dividend and allow for future conversion to common stock under terms favorable to the holders, subject to certain conditions and limitations including prior shareholder approval and an increase in the company’s authorized common stock. The structure is designed to realign previous note investments with current market conditions and provide long-term value to shareholders.

 The company remains committed to restoring full compliance with NYSE American listing standards and will continue working closely with stakeholders and exchange representatives with a view to completing that process efficiently.
