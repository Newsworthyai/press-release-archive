# TNL Mediagene Reports 35% Revenue Growth In 2024 Fueled By Business Insider Japan And Gizmodo Japan, Targets Growth Through Acquisitions

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - From breaking news to cutting-edge advances in technology, TNL Mediagene (NASDAQ: TNMG) is keeping Asian Millennials and Gen Z informed, on-trend and on-topic – and helping advertisers pitch the right products to them.

 The next-gen media and data analytics company focused on Millennial and Gen Z audiences in Japan and Taiwan leverages its AI-powered data to create relevant online publications and offer its client base of over 850 regional and global advertisers an effective way to reach this large audience.

 TNL Mediagene, the result of a merger between Taiwan's The News Lens Co. and Japan's Mediagene Inc. in May of 2023, publishes major publications including Business Insider Japan, Gizmodo Japan and Digiday Japan, among several others. With that pedigree of publications, it's not surprising that the company boasts about 45 million monthly unique users. That’s more than many established media leaders, including Nikkei Japan, South China Morning Post, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, reports the company. All told, it operates 25 publications across news & business, B2B media, technology, lifestyle & food and sports & entertainment.

 A key issue that the company wants to solve is that of irrelevant media clutter. One of the problems the company identified with the world of media and news today is that increasingly websites and publications are driven by political affiliations, clickbait that isn’t accurate and corporate agendas. Cutting through the noise is increasingly hard in what can be highly polarized media environments, but it’s something younger generations want out of the media they consume.

 TNL Mediagene started the company with the idea that it can provide news and information that is unbiased, unaffiliated and not politically polarizing. The aim, which continues today, is to create clean, newsworthy content that is void of political bias or a corporate agenda. Readers get a variety of opinions and real news, something the company says sets it apart from some of the other digital media companies operating today.

 Leveraging Its Audience And AI

 In addition to publishing premier online publications, TNL Mediagene has a robust marketing and advertising business, leveraging its expertise in AI to offer data-driven solutions for businesses and brands. The company gives advertisers a way to gain valuable and actionable insight about its core group of consumers to help them optimize their marketing strategies and find more potential customers.

 It doesn’t hurt that TNL Mediagene is focused on a group of consumers advertisers are coveting. Unlike their older brethren, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are digitally engaged, big social media users and are willing to spend money. Furthermore, Japanese Gen Z consumers stay connected – a third spend six hours a day or more on their phones. While they can be discerning with how they spend their money and research products and brands before purchasing, Gen Z consumers in Japan are also prone to impulse buying. TNL Mediagene understands the nuances of pitching to this discerning digital native market, which is why the company leverages its publications to help its advertising customers win over this group of consumers.

 After all, the company collects data from over 175 million digital footprints and about 45 million readers, which it says enables it to accurately identify and engage with the right audience. What’s more, its real-time data aggregation enables the company to track advertising outcomes and consumer behavior to conduct analysis around what works and what doesn't. TNL Mediagene feeds all that data into an AI analytics platform to create audience profiles for its advertisers.

 Expansion On The Menu

 The company seems to be in expansion mode across Asia, which means it may be able to provide even more actionable data. Part of TNL Mediagene’s strategy is to complete one to two acquisitions per year focused on media and content brands, technology or data solutions. The idea is to expand into new geographies or strengthen its internal technology with these purchases. Since 2018, the combined company has integrated more than ten acquisitions, reports TNL Mediagene.

 That focus on growth is good news to marketers and advertisers across Asia and a big opportunity for TNL Mediagene. After all, in Japan, the advertising market reached $57.7 billion in 2024, and it is projected to grow to $82.8 billion by 2033. In Taiwan, it’s forecast to reach $6.53 billion in 2025, and by 2029, 74% of the advertising will be digital.

 Proof In The Financials

 TNL Mediagene’s topline growth highlights its broader growth story. For the full year 2024, the company recently reported revenue increased 35% year-over-year (YoY) to $48.5 million, while its Media & Branded Content business unit's YoY revenue growth was 41%. The latter was driven by the company’s popular digital media assets such as Gizmodo Japan and Business Insider Japan. Meanwhile, gross profit of $17.7 million was up 40.2%  from gross profit of $12.7 million for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA at -$0.9 million was an improvement over the previous year’s figure of -$1 million, and the company is confident it will continue its path forward toward profitability.

 "2024 was a milestone year for TNL Mediagene as we completed our public listing on NASDAQ after being a private company for 12 years. 2024 was also one of our strongest years on record in terms of operational performance with regard to total group revenue, revenue growth and cost management,” said Joey Chung, Co-Founder & CEO of TNL Medigene, “Looking ahead we are excited to continue providing industry-leading media & branded content, digital studio and technology advertising solutions to our 850+ clients, allowing them to reach large Asian Millennial and Gen Z audiences with precision both in Asia and abroad. We'll continue to pursue our strategic and disciplined M&A strategy as we look toward continued growth and expansion.”

 Tech-savvy and digital-first Millennials and Gen Z consumers hailing out of Japan and Taiwan are a big market opportunity for advertisers and marketers. TNL Mediagene, with its expanding catalog of publications and its AI and tech-focused approach to advertising, is helping more than 850 brands reach this coveted audience. With expansion and M&A on TNL Medigene’s agenda, stay tuned for more breaking news from this media and data analytics company.
