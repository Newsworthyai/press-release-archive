# Metavesco's Epic Labor Launches Baltimore Branch, Extending High-Velocity Staffing Network Into Mid-Atlantic Growth Corridor

Expansion Marks Fourth Location, Reinforces Metavesco’s Aggressive Road-map Toward 98 Epic Labor Branches by 2029

 CUMMING, GA - May 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC PINK: MVCO) ("Metavesco" or the "Company"), a trailblazing holding company, today announced the grand opening of its newest Epic Labor branch in Baltimore, Maryland. The launch positions Epic Labor, a wholly owned subsidiary, at the heart of a booming construction, logistics, and hospitality market, while advancing the company’s 2025 objective of operating six revenue-producing branches ahead of schedule.

 “Baltimore gives Epic Labor a strategic beachhead in the Mid-Atlantic, a region rich with infrastructure projects, bustling ports, and year-round events,” said Ryan Schadel, President & CEO of Metavesco. “This branch immediately widens our footprint beyond the Southeast and accelerates the domino effect we outlined in our five-year expansion roadmap. Each new location compounds shareholder value through scalable systems, rising margins, and powerful cross-selling opportunities.”

 Baltimore Branch Highlights

 * Full-Service Coverage: Construction, warehousing, hospitality, manufacturing, and event staffing. Available 24/7 with Epic Labor’s trademark “2-Hour Guarantee.”
* Rapid Ramp Model: Targeting a $1.2 million annual run-rate within six months and $1.5 million by month 24—consistent with every Epic Labor launch.
* Pipeline Impact: The Baltimore office immediately feeds national-account prospects in the I-95 corridor and will reduce customer acquisition costs across future neighboring branches.

 “Every branch we open compresses time between top-line growth and EBITDA contribution. While many competitors are facing cutbacks, Epic Labor is pushing forward and taking market share,” Mr. Schadel continued.
