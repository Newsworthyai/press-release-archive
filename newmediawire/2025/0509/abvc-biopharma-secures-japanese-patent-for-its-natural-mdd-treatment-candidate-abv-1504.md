 This comprehensive patent coverage reinforces ABVC’s international strategy to ultimately commercialize its botanical CNS pipeline in the most strategically important pharmaceutical markets.

 Botanical Science Meets Global Market Demand

 With MDD affecting over 280 million people worldwide and the global antidepressant market projected to reach $20 billion by 2030[1], ABV-1504 offers a differentiated, botanical-based alternative to traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Derived from Polygala tenuifolia, the compound acts as a Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) inhibitor and has demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy in Phase II clinical studies[2]. ABV-1504 aims to provide a safer, non-addictive, and better-tolerated long-term treatment for individuals suffering from depression.

 $667M Global Licensing Agreement with AiBtl BioPharma

 In November 2023, ABVC and its subsidiary entered definitive global licensing agreement with AiBtl BioPharma Inc. for both ABV-1504 (MDD) and ABV-1505 (ADHD). Under the terms of the agreement:

 ABVC and its subsidiary received 46 million AiBtl shares as initial consideration and each are eligible for up to $7 million in milestone-based cash payments. Upon commercialization, ABVC and its subsidiary will each receive 5% royalties on net sales, up to $200 million. The transaction was independently valued at $667 million, of which approximately $475.6 million is attributed to ABV-1504, based on its clinical readiness, global IP strength, and commercial opportunity. We believe the transaction positions ABVC to unlock global value while advancing non-dilutive growth strategies for long-term shareholder return. The deal represents a core milestone in ABVC’s licensing and value realization strategy; it further reflects the commercial potential of ABVC’s botanical CNS pipeline.

 Additional IP Protection Strengthens Commercial Foundation

 With the approval of the Japanese patent, ABVC now holds IP protection for ABV-1504 in four key territories: the U.S., Australia, Japan, and Taiwan - laying a strong foundation for worldwide licensing and commercialization efforts.

 Japan is one of the most mature and receptive pharmaceutical markets globally, with more than 5 million individuals affected by depression. The country’s antidepressant market is expected to reach $1.25 billion by 2025, representing approximately 5.7% of the global market.[3] Japan’s healthcare system has a long-standing history of integrating botanical-based medicines such as Kampo, which are widely prescribed by physicians and reimbursed under the national insurance system.[4] This cultural and regulatory framework creates a favorable environment for the introduction of scientifically validated, plant-derived therapies like ABV-1504.

 Through the new patent and its strategic presence in Japan via BioLite Japan K.K., ABVC’s joint venture, which is run by a former Asian Pacific Executive of Pfizer, ABVC is now securing its intellectual property protection and actively engaging in local commercialization planning. BioLite Japan serves as the Company’s operational bridge for Japanese market expansion, fostering relationships with regulatory bodies, academic institutions, and industry partners. The team has previously participated in key biopharmaceutical events such as BioJapan, helping build brand awareness and initiate commercial dialogues within Japan’s robust healthcare ecosystem.

 “Securing patent protection in Japan - one of the world’s most advanced pharmaceutical markets - further validates the innovation behind our botanical drug platform,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC Chief Executive Officer. “With strong IP protection in the U.S., Australia, Japan, and Taiwan, and a global licensing deal in place, we believe that ABV-1504 is well-positioned to compete internationally and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.”
