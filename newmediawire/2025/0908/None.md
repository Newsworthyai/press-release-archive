# Metavesco Launches CEO Option Plan With 12 Growth Milestones

CUMMING, GA - September 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced a new stock option award for CEO Ryan Schadel designed to directly link leadership rewards with the Company’s growth and shareholder value creation.

 Under the plan, Mr. Schadel will only earn options when specific business achievements are met and the Company’s market capitalization holds steady at the next milestone level.

 The Roadmap: 12 Clear Milestones

 Each milestone unlocks roughly 41.7 million options at an exercise price of $0.0011 per share. To vest, two things must happen:

 1. The Company hits a growth goal, and
2. Market cap sustains the matching level for 30 trading days.

 Here’s the progression:

 1. $10M Annual Revenue + $10M Market Cap
2. $15M Revenue + $15M Market Cap
3. $20M Revenue + $20M Market Cap
4. $30M Revenue + $30M Market Cap
5. $40M Revenue + $40M Market Cap
6. $50M Revenue + $50M Market Cap
7. Positive EBITDA for 4 consecutive quarters + $60M Market Cap
8. 1,000 BTC/ETH held in treasury + $80M Market Cap
9. 3 Strategic Acquisitions completed + $90M Market Cap
10. 25 Epic Labor branches operating + $100M Market Cap
11. 50 Epic Labor branches operating + $110M Market Cap
12. 100 Epic Labor branches operating + $120M Market Cap

 “This plan makes it simple: I only win when shareholders win,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “My options are tied to concrete achievements; revenue growth, profitability, crypto treasury accumulation, acquisitions, and Epic Labor expansion. If we hit these targets and the market recognizes our progress, it creates durable value for everyone involved.”
