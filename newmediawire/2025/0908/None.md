# ProtoSpace Mfg. Unveils ProtoSpace Designer: Game-Changing Software for Aerospace Engineers

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - September 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ProtoSpace Mfg., the world’s fastest aerospace supplier, today announced the launch of ProtoSpace Designer, a breakthrough online software tool that enables engineers to design and order custom machined parts with unprecedented speed and simplicity.

 Developed for mechanical engineers in aerospace, defense, and other advanced industries, ProtoSpace Designer integrates directly with ProtoSpace Mfg.’s rapid machining processes. By embedding manufacturability constraints into the design environment, the software eliminates traditional barriers between design and production.

 With ProtoSpace Designer, users can:

 * Design parts with built-in manufacturability checks.
* Get instant, accurate price quotes.
* Place orders seamlessly online.
* Receive finished parts in as little as 2-3 days.

 “Traditional CAD platforms like SolidWorks give engineers total freedom, but that flexibility often introduces friction - designing from scratch, waiting on quotes, and discovering manufacturability issues late in the process,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President of ProtoSpace Mfg. “ProtoSpace Designer removes those bottlenecks. It’s built to keep innovation flowing, from idea to iteration, without wasted time.”

 Accessible Worldwide, Manufactured in North AmericaProtoSpace Designer is available immediately at protospacedesigner.com, accessible to engineers worldwide. Parts designed through the platform are manufactured at ProtoSpace Mfg.’s state-of-the-art facilities in Nova Scotia, Canada, and North Carolina, USA.

 Accelerating Aerospace InnovationBy providing instant pricing, manufacturability assurance, and rapid turnaround, ProtoSpace Designer allows engineers to innovate faster with confidence that their parts are production-ready. The result: accelerated technology development cycles, reduced downtime, and fewer costly redesigns.

 A Unified Platform for Rapid DesignProtoSpace Designer shares the same underlying technology as Protocase Designer, which also supports machined part design. The only difference lies in the naming conventions tailored for aerospace engineers, ensuring clarity and ease-of-use in aerospace-specific workflows.
