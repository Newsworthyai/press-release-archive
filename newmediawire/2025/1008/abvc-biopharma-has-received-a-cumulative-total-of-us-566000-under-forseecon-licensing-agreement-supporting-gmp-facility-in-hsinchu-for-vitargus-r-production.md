# ABVC BioPharma Has Received a Cumulative Total of US$566,000 Under ForSeeCon Licensing Agreement Supporting GMP Facility in Hsinchu for Vitargus® Production

SILICON VALLEY, CA - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) (“ABVC” or the “Company”) today announced that it has received a US$70,000 licensing payment from its partner, ForSeeCon Eye Corporation (“ForSeeCon”), under their global licensing agreement for Vitargus®, the world’s first biodegradable vitreous substitute. With this latest payment, ForSeeCon has now paid a cumulative total of US$566,000 to ABVC under the agreement, which carries a potential value of up to US$30 million in equity consideration[1], US$3.5 million in cash licensing payments, plus up to US$60 million in future royalties - representing a total potential value of up to US$93.5 million.

 Strong Financial Impact

 Since the start of fiscal 2025, ABVC has received a total of US$1,345,950 in licensing revenues across all current partnerships. These licensing revenues come with minimal incremental costs, as development expenses were largely incurred in prior years. Thus far, this structure has enabled ABVC to capture high-margin revenues, directly enhancing its financial position while supporting strategic reinvestments; management expects that to continue.

 Strategic Use of Proceeds

 ABVC will allocate this new licensing income to its Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) pharmaceutical facility in Hsinchu, Taiwan, with the specific goal of preparing for the GMP-compliant production of Vitargus®. This facility represents a critical milestone in moving Vitargus® from development into scalable, regulatory-compliant manufacturing, which is necessary for future commercialization.

 About ForSeeCon Eye Corporation

 ForSeeCon Eye Corporation is a strategic partner of ABVC, focused on ophthalmic innovation and commercialization. Under the licensing agreement, ForSeeCon obtained rights to develop and commercialize Vitargus®, a novel vitreous substitute designed to improve retinal surgery outcomes by eliminating the need for face-down positioning during recovery. Independent market research estimates the global vitreous substitute market at US$2.5 billion in 2024, projected to grow to US$4.1 billion by 2033.[2]

 Management Commentary

 Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, stated:“We are pleased to receive this additional US$70,000 licensing payment from ForSeeCon, bringing their cumulative payments under the agreement to more than half a million dollars . In 2025 alone, ABVC has already secured US$1.35 million in licensing revenues across multiple partnerships. These high-margin revenues enable us to reinvest directly into our GMP pharmaceutical facility in Hsinchu, where we are laying the groundwork for Vitargus® GMP-compliant production. This is a critical step toward moving Vitargus® to commercialization and helping to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.”

 Forward-Looking Outlook

 ABVC’s licensing framework with multiple licensing partners, including AiBtl, ForSeeCon, and OncoX, and the potential to receive more than US$12 million in future receivables, we believe that ABVC remains well positioned to capture both near-term liquidity and long-term growth opportunities in CNS, oncology, and ophthalmology.
