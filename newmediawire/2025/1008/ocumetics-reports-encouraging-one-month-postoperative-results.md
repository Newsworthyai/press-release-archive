# Ocumetics Reports Encouraging One-Month Postoperative Results

CALGARY, ALBERTA - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Ocumetics Technology Corp. (“Ocumetics” or the “Company”) (TSXV: OTC) (OTCQB: OTCFF) (FRA: 2QBO), a leader in advanced ophthalmic technology, is pleased to report encouraging one-month safety and vision performance results for the first Group 1 patients that received the Ocumetics Accommodating Intraocular Lens (the “Ocumetics Lens”).

 “This again is a historic milestone for Ocumetics and for ophthalmology as a whole,” said Dean Burns, President and CEO of Ocumetics Technology Corp. “The safety profile and visual outcomes we’re seeing at this early stage are what we hoped for, and we are excited to continue building momentum as the clinical trial progresses. These early outcomes highlight the transformative potential of the Ocumetics Lens and provide a strong foundation for continued clinical progress.”

 “The early results are very exciting,” said Dr. Doyle Stulting, Chief Medical Officer of Ocumetics. “After one month, initial patients are already achieving functional distance vision of 20/40 or better without glasses and are showing encouraging signs of near vision performance with no complications. These results give us confidence the outcomes will continue to improve in the months ahead.”

 “This moment is the culmination of decades of research and innovation,” added Dr. Garth Webb, Chief Scientist and Founder of Ocumetics. “Our vision has always been to restore natural, seamless vision across all distances. Seeing these early clinical results come to life is incredibly inspiring, and I believe we are only beginning to see the true potential of the Ocumetics Accommodating Intraocular Lens.”

 Ocumetics emphasizes that while these early results are already promising, continued improvement is expected over the coming months as patients adapt and the clinical program advances. The Company remains committed to its mission of offering patients clear, continuous vision without dependence on glasses or contact lenses.

 The Company’s first-in-human clinical protocol was strategically designed to enroll three patient groups. The outcomes for the one-month evaluation in each group are focused on the following key areas:

 * Safety - determining the frequency of intraocular lens and surgery related adverse outcomes
* Surgical technique - evaluating the surgical methods to easily implant the Ocumetics Lens into the eye
* Distance vision correction - assessing the Ocumetics Lens’s ability to restore far vision
