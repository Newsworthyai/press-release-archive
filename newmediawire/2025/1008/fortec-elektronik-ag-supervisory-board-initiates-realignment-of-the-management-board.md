# FORTEC Elektronik AG: Supervisory Board Initiates Realignment of the Management Board

GERMERING, Germany - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Supervisory Board of FORTEC Elektronik AG has resolved to realign the Company's Executive Management. This measure aims to strategically and technologically position FORTEC to sustainably secure its competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic market environment.

 This is in reference to the ad hoc announcement published on 6 October 2025, which informed about personnel changes in the Management Board. The Supervisory Board will conduct a structured process to identify suitable candidates who will further develop the FORTEC Group in a market-oriented manner, setting a clear strategy for the future and a long-term perspective for the coming years.

 The Supervisory Board would like to thank Ms. Sandra Maile for her many years of service to FORTEC Elektronik AG and wishes her all the best for her professional and personal future.

 “FORTEC Elektronik AG has a solid financial foundation with an equity ratio of approximately 72% and net financial assets of just under EUR 20 million as of 31 March 2025,” explains Christoph Schubert, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of FORTEC Elektronik AG. “At the same time, however, the Company operates in a challenging market environment and has recently had to adjust its forecasts several times. Our goal now is to appoint a new Management Board so that FORTEC regains a clear strategic direction, repositions itself in line with market requirements, and thus lays the foundation for sustainable growth.”

 Until the new members of the Management Board take office, Mr. Ulrich Ermel will manage the Company's day-to-day operations. To ensure the stability and operational capability of the FORTEC Group during this transition phase, the Supervisory Board will provide him with experienced interim support for the areas previously overseen by Ms. Maile.
