 As a leading advocate for open-source innovation, 45Drives will showcase its latest high-performance server technologies, including the NVMe Stornado F16, the Storinator Hybrid, and its latest Ceph gateway server hardware - all designed to optimize performance, scalability, and flexibility for enterprise Ceph deployments.

 In addition to its sponsorship and booth presence, Brett Kelly, Technical Director at 45Drives and a Ceph Foundation Board member, will deliver a keynote address that underscores the future direction of Ceph in an era defined by unprecedented advances in hardware capabilities.

 Brett Kelly’s Keynote: Building and Sustaining Momentum in Open-Source Storage

 In his keynote, titled “Ceph Momentum: Adapting Open-Source Storage for a High-Performance Future,” Kelly will explore the critical importance of sustaining growth and innovation within open-source projects like Ceph. He will discuss the dual challenge and opportunity posed by competing technologies such as OpenZFS and emerging parallel file systems that are rapidly evolving with greater scalability and performance.

 Kelly will emphasize that while Ceph remains a resilient and industry-leading platform, its continued dominance depends on fully embracing the latest advancements in storage hardware. With innovations such as Seagate’s HAMR 30TB HDDs and next-generation NVMe architectures like 45Drives’ Stornado F16, storage infrastructure is entering a new age of ultra-high capacity, low latency, and extreme throughput.

 “Ceph’s greatest strength has always been its adaptability and the passionate community that drives it forward,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President and Co-Founder of 45Drives. “As the industry enters a new era of high-performance storage, we believe Ceph can lead the way by evolving to harness the latest in NVMe, HAMR, and hybrid technologies. At 45Drives, we’re proud to play our part in helping Ceph scale to the future of data.”

 45Drives’ presence at Cephalocon 2025 underscores the company’s deep commitment to open-source collaboration and its role as a driving force behind accessible, high-performance storage infrastructure.
