 LEIPZIG, Germany - October 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SBF AG (ISIN: DE000A2AAE22; WKN: A2AAE2, “SBF” for short), a publicly traded company specializing in innovative solutions for rolling stock, lighting, electromechanics, and sensor technology, published its 2025 half-year report today. The company held its own in an extremely challenging market environment and drove forward important projects. With its forward-looking investments, SBF is laying the foundation for further growth in the coming years.Group revenue reached EUR 21.9 million (H1-2024: EUR 22.9 million). The slight decline is primarily attributable to short-term delays in call-off orders from customers, which will also have an impact in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, SBF significantly increased its EBITDA to EUR 0.5 million (H1-2024: EUR 0.1 million) thanks to the beginning of the positive effects of the restructuring measures. Adjusted for a precautionary entry related to a customer insolvency, EBITDA amounted to EUR 0.9 million.“We are operating in an extremely challenging market environment. Consumer reluctance, supply chain problems, and structural adjustments are shaping the business. In this demanding phase, we have once again demonstrated our resilience. We are well on track to achieve our annual targets. For the coming years, we see new opportunities arising from extensive investments in infrastructure, mobility and defense. We intend to actively pursue these opportunities,” explains Robert Stöcklinger, member of the Management Board of SBF AG.In the “Rolling Stock” segment, SBF generated sales of EUR 11 million in the first half of the year (H1 2024: EUR 9 million). This corresponds to an increase of 19%. Significant short-term postponements by customers will have a particularly noticeable impact in the second half of the year. However, thanks to the company’s strong position in the rail market, the order backlog in this segment is exceptionally high. Due to the contractually secured project durations, production is therefore expected to show good capacity utilization in the coming months and years.In the “Public and Industrial Lighting” segment, revenue was below initial expectations at EUR 4.5 million (H1 2024: EUR 6 million). The weaker order intake and sluggish industrial economy in Germany are still having an impact. Extensive measures to strengthen the business have been implemented. Following the relocation in the second quarter, production at the Budweis site was fully operational with significantly lower rental and personnel costs. To strengthen order entry, product certifications were obtained for projects with Deutsche Bahn and local authorities. The acceleration measures taken by politicians and industry should also have an increasingly positive effect. In addition, there are plans for greater cooperation with OEM customers in the future. Despite the many challenges, we have achieved significant improvements. The structural measures that have been introduced will take full effect from the coming fiscal year.The new “Sensor Technology and Electromechanics” segment performed solidly in the first half of the year, generating revenue of EUR 7 million (H1 2024: EUR 7 million). Measures to increase earnings are already having a positive effect. Based on the promising order backlog, a good result is expected by the end of 2025. In the long term, the increasing synergy effects will strengthen the earnings power of the entire Group. The segment will thus play a central role in the Group's growth strategy.Outlook for 2025 confirmedFor the 2025 fiscal year, the Management Board expects revenue of EUR 43.0 to 46.0 million (previous year: EUR 47.2 million). Consolidated EBITDA is therefore expected to be in the range of EUR 1.5 to 2.5 million (previous year: EUR 0.6 million). In addition, a significant improvement in profitability is targeted from 2025 onwards.The 2025 half-year report is available on the company's website at https://www.sbf-ag.com/investor-relations/finanzpublikationen.About the SBF-Group:The listed SBF Group is a specialist for innovative solutions in the fields of rolling stock, lighting, electromechanics and sensor technology.
