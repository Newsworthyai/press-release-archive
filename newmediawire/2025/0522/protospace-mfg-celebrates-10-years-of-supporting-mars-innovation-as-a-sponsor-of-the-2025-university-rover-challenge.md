# ProtoSpace Mfg Celebrates 10 Years of Supporting Mars Innovation as a Sponsor of the 2025 University Rover Challenge

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - May 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ProtoSpace Mfg, a global leader in rapid, precision manufacturing for aerospace and defense, proudly marks its 10th consecutive year as a sponsor of the University Rover Challenge (URC) - the world’s premier robotics competition for university students designing the next generation of Mars Rovers. The 2025 event takes place May 29-31 at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Hanksville, Utah, where 38 teams from 10 countries will face off in a grueling series of space exploration-inspired missions.

 As in previous years, ProtoSpace is offering substantial monetary and in-kind manufacturing support to every participating team. Each team will receive a $2,000 USD credit toward the fabrication of custom components, plus a 50% discount on additional custom-manufactured parts. This support accelerates rover development while giving students access to real-world manufacturing experience - a core part of ProtoSpace’s commitment to hands-on innovation.

 “Ten years of supporting the University Rover Challenge is more than a milestone- it’s a testament to what we believe in as a company,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Protocase Companies. “Each year, we’re amazed by the creativity, grit, and talent these students bring. We’re honored to help turn their ideas into functioning rovers that might one day influence real missions to Mars.”

 "ProtoSpace Mfg has been a tremendous partner of the University Rover Challenge for the last decade,” said Kevin Sloan, Director, University Rover Challenge. “Their creativity, passion, and skill come through in everything they do, from directly supporting the teams, to collaborating with judges on innovative test hardware for the competition. We're always excited to see what they will build next!"

 Organized by the Mars Society, the URC pushes student teams to design, build, and test Mars rover prototypes capable of tackling real-world tasks under extreme terrain conditions. Over the three-day competition, rovers will perform in four mission challenges: Science Cache, Equipment Servicing, Extreme Terrain Traversal, and Autonomous Navigation - each simulating a key aspect of extraterrestrial exploration.

 To further strengthen its engagement, ProtoSpace Mfg will send a team onsite to provide support and celebrate the students’ hard work:

 * Chris McGean – Marketing
* Scott McIntyre – Marketing
* Jarret MacNeil – Engineering and Design Services
* Michael MacLean - Engineering and Design Services
* Lynette Sampson – Admin and Logistics
* Crystal Pearson – Admin and Logistics

 Since 2015, ProtoSpace Mfg’s partnership with URC has helped thousands of students bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world engineering. Many past URC participants have gone on to careers at top aerospace companies and research institutions, carrying with them the lessons - and hardware - they developed with ProtoSpace’s help.

 Other notable sponsors of URC 2025 include AstroLab Venturi, MDA Space, Kiss Institute for Practical Robotics, and Nissan Advanced Technology Center.
