 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Cboe Global Markets (Cboe: CBOE) will host a virtual webinar on Thursday, April 24, from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET, focused on the evolution of Zero Days to Expiration, or 0DTE, options. These options may help traders gain an edge and maximize opportunities in the fast-paced options market.

 Henry Schwartz, Vice President of Derivatives Market Intelligence at Cboe, will lead the session, providing a deep dive into the history of 0DTE options, how they can enhance trading strategies and why more and more option traders are incorporating them into their trading strategies.

 The Evolution Of 0DTE Options

 It all started in 2005, when Cboe introduced a.m. settled S&P 500 Index  Weekly options, which expired on Fridays, to broaden the way traders and investors manage risk. About a decade later, in early 2016, Cboe began offering options that expired every Wednesday of the week. That was quickly followed by options that expired on Mondays to address weekend risk, and by 2022, Cboe had added options that expired Monday through Friday, offering more opportunities for traders to engage in same-day trading. 0DTE options, which expire on the same trading day, opened the door to more precise trading, which is one of the many reasons why it has been used over the years.

 Schwartz will explain the evolution of 0DTE options, why Cboe launched this trading tool and how using 0DTE options may help maximize trading strategies.

 Opportunities Within 0DTE Options

 The webinar will provide real-world strategies on how to use 0DTE options to add more flexibility into trading strategies, the opportunity to react quickly to current events and adjust positions based on changing market conditions.

 That’s particularly true in the current environment in which volatility remains high amid uncertainty over the impact tariffs will have on everything from automobiles to semiconductors. With the stock markets whipsawing between up and down days and with the bond market acting up, traders can leverage that volatility with trading tools like 0DTE options.

 Manage Risk With 0DTE Options

 Cboe’s 0DTE options can provide benefits, including lower capital requirements and potentially a less expensive way to trade short-term volatility. Plus, you’ll have more flexibility and know the outcome of your trade on the same day. In the webinar, Schwartz will also explain how to manage risk with 0DTE options.

 Live Q&A Session

 Capping off the webinar will be a live Q&A session in which attendees can submit questions directly to Shwartz about the evolution of 0DTE options, why they are growing in popularity, how traders can incorporate them into their trading portfolio and how to manage risk.

 The event is geared toward veteran option traders, those starting out or any traders looking for ways to trade short-term volatility and maximize their strategies – all the while managing risk and controlling their investment dollars. Click here to register now!
