By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Lance Alstodt, CEO of BioRestorative Therapies (NASDAQ: BRTX), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 BioRestorative Therapies is a regenerative medicine company that wants to alleviate chronic lower back pain, obesity and diabetes and is developing stem cell therapies to meet that end. The company’s flagship program, BRTX-100, which is in a phase 2 clinical trial, uses a patient’s stem cells to alleviate chronic back pain. Meanwhile, ThermoStem®  uses adipose-derived (brown fat) stem cells to generate new brown fat tissue to target metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Both are addressing unmet health needs that inflict pain and suffering on millions of people around the world.
