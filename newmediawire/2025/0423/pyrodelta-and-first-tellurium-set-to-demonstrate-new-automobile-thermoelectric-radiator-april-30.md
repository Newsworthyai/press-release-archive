# PyroDelta and First Tellurium Set to Demonstrate New Automobile Thermoelectric Radiator April 30

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - First Tellurium Corp. (CSE: FTEL, OTC: FSTTF) reports that its majority-owned subsidiary PyroDelta Energy Inc. will demonstrate the operation of its tellurium-based, thermoelectric generator/radiator in a video presentation on April 30, 2025. The device, which contains no moving parts, replaces alternators and radiators in combustion engine vehicles and provides substantial fuel savings by recovering waste heat. It also reduces engine weight.

 “Internal combustion engines are quite inefficient, converting only about twenty to thirty percent of gasoline into useful mechanical energy,” said PyroDelta Head Engineer Michael Abdelmaseh. “Thirty percent of the fuel burned in a combustion engine is lost as waste heat in the radiator. Our device taps into this waste heat and provides significant fuel savings of at least six percent. Also, the device eliminates the need for belts and pullies that drive the alternator, greatly reducing friction and providing further fuel savings. It’s simple, clean and lightweight, and we believe it will revolutionize an inefficient design that has remained essentially the same for over a hundred years.”

 Here's a pie chart that illustrates the approximate energy distribution in combustion engines:

 Abdelmaseh added that the generator/radiator requires no modifications to existing automobile designs. “It’s a relatively simple conversion,” said Abdelmaseh. “Whether the device is being installed on an assembly line or retrofitted into a used vehicle, it’s simply a matter of replacing the radiator and alternator with the thermoelectric device. The engine compartment remains the same.”

 Tyrone Docherty, President and CEO of First Tellurium Corp, stated: “We’re thrilled to have reached this exciting milestone with PyroDelta. Michael has been developing the device for the past eight years, and this product launch represents the culmination of his hard work and dedication.”

 Docherty added that First Tellurium will host a luncheon in mid-May in downtown Vancouver for company shareholders and interested investors. “We will discuss the thermoelectric device as well as plans for the upcoming exploration season at our Deer Horn gold-silver-tellurium property in British Columbia. We will also include Michael Abdelmaseh via video feed so audience members can ask him questions and get a better understanding of the thermoelectric device’s applications and market potential.”

 Seating for the event is limited. Interested attendees are asked to email the Company at info@firsttellurium.com.

 Docherty also noted that the automobile version of the generator/radiator is only the beginning of its potential applications. “With minimal modifications, we believe this device will efficiently recover waste heat and provide significant energy savings for AI and crypto mining data centers, as well as many other industrial applications.”

 First Tellurium also announces it has granted 1,500,000 incentive stock options to directors of, and consultants to, the Company, exercisable at a price of $0.15 per share for a period of 10 years.
