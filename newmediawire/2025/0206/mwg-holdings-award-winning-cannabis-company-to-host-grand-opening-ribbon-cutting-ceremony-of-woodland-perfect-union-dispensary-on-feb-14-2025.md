Celebratory Event to Mark Commitment to Premier Cannabis Products and Community-Focused Service in Woodland

 SACRAMENTO, CA - February 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings” or “MWG”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today the grand opening of its Perfect Union Woodland dispensary. CEO Tom Sheridan, joined by local community members, will host a ribbon-cutting ceremony Feb. 14 at 9 a.m. featuring food, music, and fun.

 Store hours are from 9 a.m. –  9 p.m. The new 2,695 square-foot store, located at 1810 E Main Street, Suite 101, Woodland, California, is close to home for the MWG team at only 20 minutes from Perfect Union’s flagship store and cultivation facility in Sacramento. In honor of the big event, Perfect Union Woodland will offer 40 percent off numerous leading cannabis brands Feb. 14-16.

 “We’re excited to become part of the Woodland community and bring our best-selling products, award-winning brands, and community-driven approach to this new location,” said Tom Sheridan, CEO of MWG Holdings. “Perfect Union is the perfect fit for this site because of our patient-first focus. Our knowledgeable and well-trained budtenders are dedicated to providing an exceptional experience. We look forward to serving Woodland and sincerely thank the Woodland City Council for their support throughout the licensing process.”

 MWG secured the coveted Woodland cannabis retail license in 2024, further expanding its footprint in the region. Woodland is the latest addition as MWG Holdings continues to grow its portfolio of brick-and-mortar locations.

 Chelsea Haskins, Director of State and Local Licensing at MWG Holdings, said, “We couldn’t be more excited to officially celebrate the opening of our Woodland dispensary with the community on Feb. 14. This moment is the culmination of two years of hard work, dedication, and a shared vision to bring something truly special to Woodland. What sets us apart is our hands-on leadership and deep commitment to being an active part of the community we serve.”

 Haskins was appointed to a seat on the Board of the Woodland Chamber of Commerce in January 2025. In this role, Haskins will strive to enhance community relationships, foster business growth, and encourage economic prosperity while advocating for a healthy business climate and the development of local resources. “The grand opening is more than just the launch of a retail store - it’s about creating job opportunities, fostering connections, and providing the Woodland community with safe and legal access to cannabis in a welcoming environment. We’re thrilled to open our doors and celebrate this milestone with everyone,” Haskins said.

 For two years, Perfect Union has engaged with the Woodland Community through various community benefits, including partnerships with Thriving Pink, Yolo County Meals on Wheels, the Yolo County Heritage Foundation, the Yolo Conflict Resolution Center, the Woodland Food Closet, the Yolo County Public Defender's Office CARES Program, and the Woodland Recreation Foundation for Field of Dreams.

 MWG also hosted two National Night Out events in 2023 and 2024 at the location in Woodland to provide the community with the opportunity to meet the team, view the space, and meet local law enforcement and fire department personnel.
