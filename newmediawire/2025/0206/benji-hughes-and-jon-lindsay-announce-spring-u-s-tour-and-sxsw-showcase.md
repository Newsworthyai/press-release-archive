His collaborative spirit has seen him partner with artists as varied as Jeff Bridges, Meshell Ndegeocello, and Priscilla Ahn, and he’s toured with indie icons Jenny Lewis and Jason Isbell and performed with Jackson Browne. Hughes’ expansive catalog, including Songs in the Key of Animals and a stunning 2020 trilogy (A Lover’s Extreme, Spirit Guide, and Another Extreme), cements his legacy as an American pop master.

 Lindsay, based in Savannah, Georgia, and New York, is a prolific solo artist, producer, and longtime member of Hughes’ band. Lindsay is known for his bold lyrical depth, compelling, vocal-driven live performances, and genre-blending innovation and experimentation from album to album. His music has been featured on MTV Cribs, Haven, and MSNBC, and in commercials for brands such as CREE, Miller, and Honda. As co-founder of the NC Music Love Army (with Caitlin Cary of Whiskeytown), Lindsay has collaborated and released music with luminaries like Rhiannon Giddens, American Aquarium, Caitlin Cary, Pierce Freelon, and many others. His upcoming fourth album, Big Stage, was recorded at Eric Valentine’s Barefoot Studios in Hollywood and features horn arrangements and performances by Matt Douglas (of The Mountain Goats).
