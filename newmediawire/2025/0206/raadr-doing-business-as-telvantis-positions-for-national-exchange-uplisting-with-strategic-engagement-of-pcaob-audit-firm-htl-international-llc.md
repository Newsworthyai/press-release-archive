NEW YORK - February 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc., now doing business as Telvantis (OTC PINK: RDAR) ("Telvantis" or the "Company"), a rapidly expanding U.S.-based global telecommunications provider, today announced a significant step towards uplisting to a national exchange, such as the Nasdaq or NYSE, by engaging HTL International, LLC (HTL), a PCAOB-registered, full-service accounting firm. This strategic move underscores Telvantis' commitment to the highest standards of financial reporting, transparency, and corporate governance.

 HTL: a proven partner for growth-oriented companies

 Telvantis selected HTL for their extensive experience and proven track record in serving both public and private companies across a wide range of industries, including expertise in guiding companies through the uplisting process. Companies that successfully complete a PCAOB audit and meet other listing requirements see an average increase in institutional investment of approximately 20% post-uplisting. (Source: Journal of Financial Economics, 2023). Headquartered in Houston, Texas, HTL has a global presence with offices in Austin, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Taipei, and Vancouver. The firm is renowned for its team of multilingual, solution-oriented professionals who bring deep subject matter expertise in U.S., Canadian, and international financial reporting standards (IFRS).

 Strengthening financial reporting, governance, and investor confidence

 The engagement of HTL further strengthens Telvantis' commitment to financial integrity and best practices. By undertaking this rigorous independent audit, Telvantis aims to enhance investor confidence, attract a broader base of institutional investors, and increase its visibility within the investment community.

 "We are pleased to partner with HTL, a firm with a strong reputation for excellence and a deep understanding of the complexities of U.S. and international financial reporting," said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of the Company. "Their expertise will be invaluable as we prepare for an uplisting to a national exchange and continue to execute our strategic growth plan. This audit demonstrates our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability to all our stakeholders."

 Uplisting strategy: a key component of Telvantis' long-term growth plan

 The PCAOB audit conducted by HTL is a cornerstone of Telvantis' comprehensive strategy to unlock its full potential and deliver enhanced shareholder value. This initiative is aligned with other key strategic initiatives, including:

 * The upcoming release of the company's 5-year strategic growth plan: this plan will detail Telvantis' roadmap for capitalizing on emerging opportunities in the 5G, cloud communications, and enterprise services markets.
* The launch of its Shareholder Ambassador Program: designed to foster a strong and engaged shareholder community, this program will provide investors with exclusive insights and opportunities to connect with the company's leadership.
* The recent strategic acquisition of Mexedia SpA's U.S. and Irish operations: this acquisition significantly expanded Telvantis' technological capabilities and market reach, positioning the company for accelerated growth in key markets.

 These initiatives, combined with the successful completion of the PCAOB audit, will position Telvantis as a leading innovator in the evolving telecommunications landscape and an attractive opportunity for investors.
