# 4 ways to support women s heart health during American Heart Month

(NewMediaWire) - February 06, 2025 - DALLAS  — To raise awareness that cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women, thousands of people and landmarks across the U.S. will once again “go red” on National Wear Red Day®, February 7, 2025.  Through its Go Red for Women®  movement, nationally sponsored by CVS Health, the American Heart Association®, which is devoted to changing the future in pursuit of a world of healthier lives for all, urges everyone to take action during American Heart Month in February to support women’s heart health in four ways.

 1. Wear red on National Wear Red Day, Friday, February 7, 2025 and spread the word about the unique heart health challenges women face on social media using #WearRedDay, #WearRedAndGive, #HeartMonth and #GoRedforWomen. Visit WearRedDay.org for more information and to download tools and resources to “go red” on February 7. The iconic Red Dress pin and other apparel are available at ShopHeart.org.
2. Learn Life’s Essential 8™. Women experience different life stages like pregnancy, motherhood and menopause that can increase their risk of heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 are key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health throughout your life: embrace healthy eating, move your body, quit tobacco, sleep well, maintain a healthy weight, be a cholesterol control freak, keep blood sugar in check and know the blood pressure basics. For more information, visit Life's Essential 8™ for Women | Go Red for Women.
3. Celebrate survivors and communities championing women’s health. Twelve women from across the country have been selected to represent the American Heart Association’s nationwide Go Red for Women movement in 2025. This sisterhood of survivors will share their inspiring personal stories of heart disease and stroke to help women across the country understand and embrace heart health at every age and every stage of life. By lifting their voices, these women—and survivors everywhere—can make a lasting impact as they raise awareness about risks and resources, inspire meaningful change for individuals and communities, and work to eliminate women’s greatest health threat. Read and be inspired by the stories of the 2025 class of Go Red for Women survivors at goredforwomen.org/survivors.
4. Learn CPR. The American Heart Association is urging every American family to learn CPR to protect the ones they love most. According to the American Heart Association, more than 23,000 children experience cardiac arrest each year, and nearly 40% of those are related to sports. Another close to 20% occur in infants. By calling on the everyday heroes like parents, teachers and coaches who impact the lives of children every day, the Association hopes to create an environment where every child has the best chance of survival in a cardiac emergency.  For more information on how to learn CPR, visit heart.org/nation.

 “Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women, yet women still remain underdiagnosed and undertreated,” said Nancy Brown, American Heart Association CEO. “At the American Heart Association, we are working to change the future of health. Go Red for Women is a powerful movement that connects women across the country to share information, motivation and inspiration. Together we can harness that support system to create better health outcomes for all women.”

 According to the American Heart Association’s newly released 2025 Heart Disease & Stroke Statistical Update, among women 20 years of age and older, nearly half -- 45% -- had some form of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains the greatest health threat for women, yet less than half of women are aware it is their leading cause of death.  The Go Red for Women movement continues working to close this gap through ongoing scientific research, community engagement and public policy initiatives.
