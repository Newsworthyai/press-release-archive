# Nationwide, 34 local schools win NFL PLAY 60 grants to help students move more

(NewMediaWire) - February 06, 2025 - DALLAS, Feb. 6, 2025 — Physical activity positively impacts overall mental and physical wellness which is essential to help children reach their full potential[1]. That is why the American Heart Association, committed to changing the future of health, and the National Football League (NFL) are awarding 34 schools, at least one for each of the NFL teams, with $1,000 grants for physical activity equipment. Through support from the NFL, the NFL PLAY 60 grants are distributed by the American Heart Association annually to recognize those classrooms and schools who are committed to moving for at least 60 minutes each day. To be eligible for this year’s grant, classes participated in the NFL PLAY 60 Daily Movement Moment Challenge.

 Held in Oct. 2024, the Daily Movement Moment Challenge encouraged classrooms to get moving through the NFL PLAY 60 app, available free on iOS and Android devices. Utilizing the daily “Movement Moment” feature of the app, students incorporated movement into their day by following an NFL PLAY 60 avatar who guided them through different daily exercises. Teachers tracked completion of the daily Movement Moment and submitted their tracker for an opportunity to receive a grant.

 “At the American Heart Association, our future is all about improving yours,” said American Heart Association Chief Executive Officer Nancy Brown. “For 18 years, the American Heart Association and the NFL have teamed up to inspire kids to get moving to support their overall wellness by pairing fun with health fundamentals to drive life-long wellness through NFL PLAY 60. In this next century of work, the American Heart Association will continue to be laser focused to propel physical and mental health in children.”

 The winners were announced today during the NFL PLAY 60 Fitness Break broadcast held in advance of Super Bowl LIX. The Fitness Break broadcast series delivers an action-packed, 15-minute synchronously streamed broadcast to help students add movement to their school day in advance of this weekend’s big game. This year’s Super Bowl broadcast featured Super Bowl host city team, the New Orleans Saints, along with the host of Super Bowl LX the San Francisco 49ers, the current AFC champions the Kansas City Chiefs and NFC champions the Philadelphia Eagles. On-demand playback of the Fitness Break broadcasts is available at heart.org/NFLPLAY60.

 In addition to the broadcasts, the American Heart Association and the NFL offer students, teachers and families other digital ways to reach their daily goal of 60 minutes of play. The NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Library features two-to-three minute exercise videos from each of the 32 NFL teams featuring players, NFL Legends, cheerleaders and mascots.

 The NFL PLAY 60 app allows users to select their favorite team and control personalized avatars onscreen with their own physical movement. Users can create custom workouts and earn special PLAY points and unlock cool NFL gear for on-screen PLAY 60 avatars.

 “Every year, NFL PLAY 60 helps students across the country achieve their daily goal of 60 minutes of play through the innovative and engaging NFL PLAY 60 app,” said NFL Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility Anna Isaacson. “We look forward to continuing to work with our partners at the American Heart Association to provide students with resources they need to lead healthy lifestyles.”

 Rooted in American Heart Association science, the NFL PLAY 60 initiative helps children to develop healthy habits for a better chance of a healthy adulthood. The program encourages kids to get a minimum of 60 minutes of vigorous physical activity each day to meet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans[2]. Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity are key to immediate and long-term health for children.

 The NFL and the American Heart Association have been teaming up since 2006 to inspire kids through fun and engaging ways to get physically active for at least 60 minutes a day. Information on NFL PLAY 60 resources and additional grant opportunities can be found online at heart.org/NFLPLAY60.
