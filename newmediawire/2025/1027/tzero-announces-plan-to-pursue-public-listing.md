# tZERO Announces Plan to Pursue Public Listing

NEW YORK, NY - October 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - tZERO Group, Inc., a leading innovator of blockchain-powered multi-asset infrastructure, including tokenized securities, real world assets and other digital assets, announced plans to pursue an initial public offering. The planned public listing reflects tZERO’s confidence in the tokenization of financial assets as the new rails for efficient cross-asset and cross-border formation and movement of capital.

 “tZERO has pioneered regulated infrastructure for digital assets by building its leading end-to-end broker-dealer platform for tokenized securities in the United States,” said Alan Konevsky, Chief Executive Officer of tZERO. “Our mission - and evolution into a public company - are particularly important now as tokenization finally enters the public equities markets. tZERO is uniquely positioned to bring scale, transparency, and credibility to digital assets, like public and private securities, residential and commercial real estate, derivatives, cryptocurrencies and predictive markets, through our growing regulated platform and tokenization technology and partner network.”

 The work towards a public company footprint (subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions) for tZERO will support its mission to operate and scale a multi-asset platform that unites traditional market infrastructure with the efficiencies of digital assets.

 “I am pleased to see tZERO management capitalize on the digital revolution and empower the marketplace to democratize access to a wide range of tokenized assets, particularly real estate. Blockchain and tokenization, through tZERO, are part of our companies' long-term strategy as we continue our path to being an “Everything Home” business. I appreciate that its board, led by its Chairman, Matt Mosman, recognize what the platform and technology of tZERO, underpinned by a public market footprint, can do for commerce and liquidity,” said Marcus Lemonis, Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer of Bed Bath and Beyond, Inc., tZERO’s largest shareholder through its direct interest and partnership with Pelion Venture Partners.

 Blockchain technology’s greatest promise is to converge the fragmented global financial ecosystem and tZERO is working towards that goal by scaling its platform, with strategic partners, across asset types and geographies. By integrating security, automation, and transparency, tZERO is reshaping how capital formation and ownership evolve in the Web3 economy.
