# Forward Industries (FORD) Featured in Oak Ridge Financial Research Report Highlighting Transition to Solana Digital Asset Treasury Model

LOS ANGELES, CA - October 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD) has been featured in a new research report by Oak Ridge Financial, which provides an in-depth analysis of the company’s strategic transformation into what the report describes as “the world’s leading Solana treasury company.” The Oct. 23, 2025, report details how Forward has shifted from a traditional design and manufacturing business to a digital asset-focused enterprise following its $1.65 billion private placement led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital.

 The Oak Ridge Financial report outlines Forward’s entry into the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) sector, emphasizing its focus on acquiring and managing Solana (SOL) tokens to generate shareholder value through active onchain strategies such as staking, lending, and decentralized finance participation. Oak Ridge identifies the company’s partnerships and management team as key differentiators expected to position Forward ahead of peer DATs.

 According to Oak Ridge, Forward Industries’ Solana holdings total approximately 6.87 million SOL, with a market capitalization of $1.57 billion and an enterprise value of $1.58 billion. The report does not assign a rating or price target pending a full quarter of DAT operations but frames this as an “initial informational report” aimed at providing investors context on Forward’s new direction and its role in the evolving crypto asset management landscape.
