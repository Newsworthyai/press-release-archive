# PetVivo Holdings, Inc. to Present at Spartan Capital Securities' Second Annual Investor Conference

Premier Event Showcases Innovative Growth Companies and Connects Them with Leading Institutional Investors

 MINNEAPOLIS, MN - October 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (OTCQX: PETV; OTCID PETVW), a leading provider of biomedical therapeutics for equines and companion animals, is proud to announce that it will present at the Spartan Capital Securities Second Annual Investor Conference on November 3, 2025, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.

 Participation by PetVivo Holdings, Inc. underscores the conference’s mission to spotlight innovative companies and emerging market leaders positioned for long-term growth.

 "We are excited to share our company’s story with such a distinguished audience of investors and peers," said John Lai, Chief Executive Officer of PetVivo Holdings, Inc. "The Spartan Capital Conference offers an unparalleled platform to highlight our progress, connect with new investors, and strengthen relationships within the capital markets community."

 Mr. Lai intends to provide an overview of PetVivo Holdings, Inc. as well as discuss its flagship products, SPRYNG(TM) with OsteoCushion(TM) Technology and PrecisePRP(R). SPRYNG with OsteoCushion Technology, is an intra-articular injectable veterinary medical device consisting of sterilized, extra-cellular matrix microparticles. The microparticles of Spryng have been found to adsorb onto the joint synovial lining of animals and subsequently integrate with the animal’s subsynovial tissue. Such action promotes the restoration of proper joint mechanics, thereby aiding in the management of noninfectious sources of joint pain such as joint instability, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis.

 PrecisePRP is a first-in-class off-the-shelf platelet-rich plasma (PRP) product designed for use by veterinarians. PrecisePRP is a leucoreduced, allogeneic, pooled, freeze-dried PRP intended to provide a species-specific source of concentrated platelets in plasma for intra-articular administration in dogs and horses. Unlike any PRP mechanical kits currently on the market, PrecisePRP™ does not require a blood draw or centrifugation making it a truly off-the-shelf product that is easy and convenient. Perhaps more important is the uniformity and consistency that PrecisePRP® guarantees. Each vial of PrecisePRP(R) contains a consistent dose of 4 billion platelets per vial at a concentration of 500,000 platelets per microliter and is leucoreduced with less than 1500 white blood cells per microliter.

 "We are delighted to feature PetVivo Holdings, Inc. at our second annual investor conference," said John D. Lowry, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Spartan Capital Securities, LLC. "Spartan Capital has built its reputation on helping growth companies access the right investors and resources, and this conference is a powerful extension of that mission - bringing together high-quality issuers and serious capital providers under one roof."

 Organized in partnership with B2i Digital, the conference will showcase more than 60 carefully selected companies across technology, healthcare, consumer, mining, precious metals, and other high-growth sectors. Over 500 institutional and high-net-worth investors are expected to attend.

 “In collaboration with Spartan Capital’s banking team, we invited PetVivo Holdings, Inc. to share their perspective with the investors in attendance,” said David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital. “Their participation is part of our broader commitment to connecting investors with a diverse range of growth companies, supporting B2i Digital’s core mission - combining the broad reach of digital marketing with the powerful impact of face-to-face investor engagement.”

 The event will feature main-stage presentations, expert panels, curated one-on-one meetings, and extensive networking sessions, creating meaningful opportunities for dialogue between growth companies and the investment community.
