# New Certification Helps Clinicians Advance Digital Cardiac Care

DALLAS - October 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The rapidly expanding availability of remote telehealth cardiac health care poses a growing challenge for health care providers to learn how to use new digital tools and resources safely and effectively to treat people living with chronic health conditions. The American Heart Association (Association), a global force changing the future of health for all, just launched its latest professional certification program to help bridge the gap between traditional practice and remote patient monitoring and care, while promoting privacy and compatibility with existing health care systems. The Association’s Digital Health in Cardiac Care certification aims to ensure quality care in telehealth by better equipping health care providers and professionals in the health and wellness sector who use digital health technology to help individuals manage and prevent heart conditions.

 This new certification is the fourth individual professional certification offering in the Certified Professional by the American Heart Association (CPAHA) science-based portfolio, which currently includes telehealth, telehealth stroke and tobacco treatment. This latest certification, offered by the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth®, is designed to standardize training and validate health care providers’ expertise in delivering care in technology-enabled clinical settings. Digital health in cardiac care refers to the use of technology tools such as wearable devices, smartphone apps, telehealth platforms and remote monitoring systems to help people manage and prevent heart conditions beyond traditional clinical settings - such as at home, work or out in the community.

 "The American Heart Association is committed to ensuring that quality standards for digital health technology are clear, trusted and embraced by health care providers. This certification keeps individuals at the heart of care helping to boost patient engagement while empowering providers and wellness professionals to manage chronic conditions more effectively through digital tools," said Lee H. Schwamm, M.D., FAHA, volunteer member of the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth Expert Panel, senior vice president and chief digital health officer of Yale New Haven Health and associate dean of digital strategy and transformation at Yale School of Medicine. "Digital health technology paves the way for better self-management, earlier detection of issues and improved treatment outcomes by delivering continuous data and insights to people living with chronic conditions and to their care teams.”

 The certification equips providers with skills to implement best practices in digital health to help engage people more effectively to build their confidence in managing their chronic conditions. Enrollment is available to health care professionals (licensed or pursuing licensure) with a clinical or administrative background, as well as health and wellness specialists using digital health tools to monitor, track and engage with their patients.

 The certification process features:

 * digital health literacy to enhance professional understanding of various terms and technology to better promote behavior change among patients;
* high-quality, evidence-based online digital health education that combines research, hands-on experiences and best practices;
* assessment delivery via live remote-proctoring, certification award and renewal via American Heart Association platforms; and
* opportunities for individual professional promotion by display of personalized certificate award and credentials, which are valid for three years.

 The Certified Professional by the American Heart Association program brings the same gold standard used by the Association for hospital certifications. A stroke coordinator certification is planned to launch later this year.
