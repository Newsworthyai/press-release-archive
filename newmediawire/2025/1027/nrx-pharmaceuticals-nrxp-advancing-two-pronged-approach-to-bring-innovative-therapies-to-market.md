# NRx Pharmaceuticals (NRXP) Advancing Two-Pronged Approach to Bring Innovative Therapies to Market

LOS ANGELES, CA - October 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP) was featured in a recent article that discussed its approach to bring preservative-free ketamine-based therapies to market, pursuing distinct regulatory and commercial pathways for both KETAFREE(TM) and NRX-100. “The company recently refiled an Abbreviated New Drug Application (‘ANDA’) for KETAFREE(TM), a preservative-free intravenous (‘IV’) ketamine formulation intended for all currently approved ketamine indications,” the article reads. “This filing follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of NRx’s Suitability Petition to eliminate benzethonium chloride (‘BZT’), a chemical preservative still found in many ketamine formulations. BZT, a quaternary ammonium compound, has been associated with cytotoxic and neurotoxic effects. It is no longer considered Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective (‘GRASE’) for parenteral or topical pharmaceutical use. The European Medicines Agency has already discouraged its use in injectable drugs, and the FDA previously removed it from topical antiseptics and hand cleansers over safety concerns… By developing KETAFREE(TM), NRx aims to provide a safer and fully compliant version of ketamine for both hospital and outpatient use, at a time when supply constraints and rising demand have challenged healthcare providers… Alongside the ANDA pathway for KETAFREE(TM), NRx is advancing NRX-100, a separate preservative-free ketamine product, under a New Drug Application (‘NDA’) for the treatment of suicidal depression, including bipolar depression. The formulation has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA, positioning it for potential expedited review.”
