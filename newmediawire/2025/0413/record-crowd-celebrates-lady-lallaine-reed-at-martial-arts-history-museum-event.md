 The highlight of the evening was the screening of the museum's latest biographical film, chronicling Reed's life story, a tale of resilience and triumph over adversity. Attendees were deeply moved by her narrative, which included surviving a childhood kidnapping and later navigating the harrowing experience of her own child's abduction.

 Museum president Michael Matsuda expressed his delight at the event's success, stating, "We are thrilled with the overwhelming response to Lady Lallaine Reed's event. Her story is a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of the human spirit. We believe it is crucial to document and share the stories of martial arts pioneers and significant achievers who have made noteworthy contributions to both Asian and American history. The museum's growing library of biographical films, now totaling nearly 30, which can be seen on Roku and other media outlets, is a testament to our commitment to preserving and celebrating these important legacies."

 Matsuda further emphasized the importance of these biographies, noting, "While major networks like A&E and History Channel highlight the lives of industry pioneers and historical figures, the contributions of martial artists are often overlooked. Our museum is dedicated to filling this gap and ensuring that their stories are told."
