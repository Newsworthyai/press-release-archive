# Green Monke Enters Northeast Market With Remarkable Liquids Launch

Green Monke’s full lineup of hemp-infused beverages is now available statewide, reaching all 9.2 million residents of New Jersey

 JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY - May 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) – Green Monke USA (“Green Monke”), an award-winning hemp-D9 beverage brand, has entered into a distribution agreement with Remarkable Liquids to launch its premium hemp beverages in New Jersey. This strategic partnership marks Green Monke’s entry into the Northeast, expanding its portfolio of high-quality, hemp-infused Happy Sodas to a growing number of consumers across 10 states. Green Monke has now fulfilled the first purchase orders, delivering the brand’s full portfolio of 8 SKUs - including its flagship, Green Monke Happy Soda line, and its Cookies beverage line.

 Remarkable Liquids, a leading craft beverage distributor based in Guilderland, NY, brings unparalleled expertise to the partnership. Founded in 2012 and recognized four years in a row on the Inc. 5000 list, Remarkable Liquids is renowned for its state-of-the-art cold storage facility and extensive distribution network across New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.

 “At Remarkable Liquids, our mission is to deliver the highest quality beverages to consumers and retailers across our network,” said Jeremy Irving, Co-Founder of Remarkable Liquids. “As the beverage industry evolves, we are committed to sourcing world-class products across all categories, including the innovative and rapidly growing hemp-infused beverage sector.”

 New Jersey Opportunity

 “We’re thrilled to introduce Green Monke Happy Sodas and Cookies beverages to the Northeast, partnering with a trusted brand known for quality and innovation to expand our offerings in New Jersey and beyond,” Irving continued.

 New Jersey’s 9.2 million residents and progressive regulatory framework make it a key market for Green Monke. Senate Bill 3235, endorsed and signed by Governor Phil Murphy, regulates hemp-derived THC products under the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (NJ-CRC), prioritizing consumer safety and transparency - values Green Monke shares. NJ-CRC Acting Executive Director Christopher Riggs recently hailed new testing guidelines (February 2025) as “rigorous research” to ensure safety and consistency, standards Green Monke is poised to meet.

 “Our history is rooted in transparency and authenticity,” said Pat Gleeson, CEO of Green Monke. “We go above and beyond with FDA-certified third-party lab testing and QR codes on every can linking to those results, so consumers know exactly what they’re getting. New Jersey’s commitment to high standards makes it the perfect place for us to deliver our Happy Sodas with confidence.”

 Green Monke’s Expanding National Footprint

 This launch builds upon Green Monke’s successful introduction in the Southeast, where its hemp-derived Delta-9 beverages have gained a loyal following for their refreshing taste and casual buzz. The New Jersey expansion positions Green Monke to further penetrate the Northeast.
