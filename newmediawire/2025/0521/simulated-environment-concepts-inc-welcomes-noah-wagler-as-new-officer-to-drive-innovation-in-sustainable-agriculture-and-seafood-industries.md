# Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. Welcomes Noah Wagler as New Officer to Drive Innovation in Sustainable Agriculture and Seafood Industries

NEW BERN, NC - May 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. (SMEV) is proud to announce the appointment of Noah Wagler, a pioneering Amish farmer from Hamilton, Indiana, as a new company officer. Bringing extensive experience in cutting-edge sustainable technologies, Mr. Wagler is set to accelerate SMEV’s growth and innovation across the agricultural and seafood sectors.

 Mr. Wagler has been successfully testing advanced sustainable solutions that are delivering remarkable results in crop and meat production. His projects include establishing a resilient supply chain and food distribution network catering to distributors, restaurants, and direct-to-consumer programs. He is also developing a comprehensive distribution pipeline for local, regional, national, and international partners in the agriculture and seafood industries. Currently, his groundbreaking structured water testing has shown promising results, increasing the size and yield of crops and livestock across various regions including the United States and Asia. These technologies have been tested on cattle in Japan, poultry and sweet corn in the U.S., as well as rice fields in Mississippi, Arkansas, and throughout Asia.

 In addition to these initiatives, Mr. Wagler is spearheading the development of an environmental campus in Indiana dedicated to agriculture, seafood, poultry, and beef production, with support from a local University and the Amish community. He is also investing in a European fund related to the EIS UK program, which aims to raise up to 12.5 million pounds (approximately $17.5 million) to finance SMEV’s projects with minimal dilution to the company.

 Noah Wagler commented, “My interest in SMEV stems from the potential I see in combining the capabilities of my farms in Indiana with SMEV’s farm in North Carolina. With proper funding from external sources and international subsidiaries, we can achieve extraordinary organic growth. Coming from a humble Amish background, I value a team-oriented culture built on hard work and dedication. I look forward to bringing my contacts, associates, and innovative technologies to SMEV to expand our impact. These technologies are truly groundbreaking, and I already have clients eager to implement them.”

 SMEV’s leadership believes that Mr. Wagler’s expertise and vision will be instrumental in advancing the company’s mission to revolutionize sustainable food production and distribution.
