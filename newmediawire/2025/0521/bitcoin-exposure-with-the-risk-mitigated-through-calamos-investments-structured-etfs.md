 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Matt Kaufman, senior vice president and head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Calamos Investments is a 45-year-old risk management firm and one of the largest convertible bond managers in the U.S. The company provides investors with access to convertible securities, alternative funds and a growing number of active and structured outcome ETFs, including what it says is the world’s first 100% protected ETFs tied to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000 and even Bitcoin.

 Launched in April, the Calamos Bitcoin Structured Protection ETF is designed to match the positive price return of Bitcoin up to a defined cap while protecting against 100% of losses over a one-year period. Leveraging technology and decades of institutional knowledge, Calamos Investing is aiming to turn the ETF market on its head with this and its other products.
