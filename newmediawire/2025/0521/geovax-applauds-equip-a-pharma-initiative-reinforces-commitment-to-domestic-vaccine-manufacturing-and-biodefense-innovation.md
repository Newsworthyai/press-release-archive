# GeoVax Applauds EQUIP-A-Pharma Initiative, Reinforces Commitment to Domestic Vaccine Manufacturing and Biodefense Innovation

GeoVax’s Advanced MVA Manufacturing Platform Supports ASPR-DARPA Vision for Scalable, AI-Integrated Pharmaceutical Production

 ATLANTA, GA - May 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today welcomed the launch of the EQUIP-A-Pharma initiative - a new joint program between the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the private sector. This bold collaboration with private industry seeks to transform pharmaceutical manufacturing by leveraging artificial intelligence and next-generation platforms to expand U.S. production capacity and improve supply chain resilience.

 David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax, commented: "The EQUIP-A-Pharma initiative is a major step toward strengthening the domestic biomanufacturing backbone our country urgently needs. GeoVax has long championed the same goals this program now advances - self-reliant, scalable, and rapid production of critical medicines. Our advanced MVA manufacturing platform aligns perfectly with this mission, and we stand ready to support the federal government’s vision of pharmaceutical independence and pandemic resilience."

 GeoVax’s Alignment with EQUIP-A-Pharma

 GeoVax is advancing a next-generation manufacturing platform for its Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine technology - a platform that eliminates reliance on pathogen-free eggs and instead uses a continuous avian cell line system compatible with existing U.S. GMP infrastructure. This enables:

 * Rapid, high-volume vaccine production adaptable for pandemic response and public health emergencies.
* Integration with AI-driven optimization tools for scale-up and quality control.
* Deployment within small-footprint, modular facilities aligned with DARPA’s vision for agile, point-of-care biomanufacturing.
* Reduced dependence on foreign suppliers, supporting the White House Executive Order on re-shoring pharmaceutical manufacturing.

 The MVA platform underpins GeoVax’s pipeline of multi-antigen vaccines, including its lead candidates GEO-CM04S1 (COVID-19) and GEO-MVA (Mpox and smallpox), and was recently selected under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority’s Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) for further development, pending funding availability.

 A Strategic Partner for National Health Security

 GeoVax’s domestic manufacturing strategy directly addresses vulnerabilities identified in recent biodefense reviews and the National Strategic Stockpile shortfalls highlighted by the Mpox outbreak. The Company continues to advocate for robust public-private collaboration to accelerate the deployment of resilient, U.S.-sourced medical countermeasures.

 Dodd concluded: "GeoVax is committed to delivering scalable solutions that align with the Administration’s priorities - from HHS to DARPA to BARDA. EQUIP-A-Pharma represents the future of biomanufacturing in the United States, and we are proud to be among the companies positioned to help build that future."

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The Company is also developing GEO-MVA, a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
