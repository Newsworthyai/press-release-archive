 “Nephros finished 2024 strong despite annual revenue results approximately flat to 2023. Throughout the year we consistently showed growth as our core programmatic revenue steadily increased. In contrast, we had a significant decline in our emergency response business over the first half of the year. Historically, Nephros has experienced double-digit percentages of our total revenue as a result of our emergency business, yet in Q1 and Q2, those values declined to single digits. We were able to overcome this headwind in the second half of 2024, particularly with 19% year-over-year growth in total sales in the fourth quarter,” said Robert Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Nephros has always had a strong product offering and been able to demonstrate significant customer value within a diverse range of applications. I am excited to share that we are continuing to expand both our product lineup and range of customer market sectors into areas such as office space and transportation-related entities.”

 Mr. Banks continued, “With regard to our portfolio of products, most notable was the launch of our 20” HydraGuard Ultrafilter which is a new product ideal for applications with higher volumes of water than we typically support. Sterile processing, laboratories, and manufacturing are just a few of the broader industries for which we believe we are now well-positioned to advance. Concerning sterile processing (i.e., the sterilization of medical instruments), the late-2023 release of the ANSI/AAMI ST108 standard, stipulates strict guidelines for the water quality used throughout the operation. We believe the new HydraGuard, which has the tightest control of bacteria and endotoxins on the market, has the potential to serve as a key asset for sterile processing compliance, while supporting improved patient safety.

 “While 2024 did not meet our revenue expectations, we achieved profitability for the first time in Q3, thanks to a fantastic job controlling costs and keeping our spend in line with our revenue. Of additional note, we added nearly 600 new customer sites, which combined to almost $2 million in sales, and represented more than 13% of our annual revenue,” said Mr. Banks. “We believe that we continue to be well-placed for growth as we cultivate steady expansion into new and existing markets. I am very proud of our entire team as they persist in their dedication and hard work, driving us ever closer to large-scale success!”Financial Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2024

 Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 was $14.2 million, respectively. Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $3.9 million, compared with $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19%. Our core programmatic revenue grew 9% for the year, despite a decline in the emergency response business, with our fourth quarter of 2024 showing double-digit growth in programmatic revenue year-over-year. The increase in programmatic sales reflects the development of our newer sales personnel hired in 2023 and a number of new customer accounts added throughout the year.

 Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $5.4 million, compared with $5.8 million in 2023, a decrease of 7%. Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 13%.

 Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024, was 62%, compared with 59% in 2023. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 64%, compared with 62% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in gross margin reflects primarily more favorable terms with our largest supplier.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $7.7 million, compared with $8.9 million in 2023, a decrease of 14% due to a decline in bonuses, commissions and stock compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were approximately $1.9 million, compared with $2.4 million in 2023, a decrease of 22% due to a decline in bonuses, commissions and professional fees.

 Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0.9 million, respectively. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $0.3 million, compared with $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 21% due to higher headcount.

 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately $135,000, compared with approximately $214,000 in 2023, a decrease of 37%. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were approximately $34,000, compared with approximately $51,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 33%.

 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.1 million, compared with a net loss of ($1.6 million) in 2023, an improvement of 105%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $0.3 million, compared with a net loss of ($0.7 million) during the same period in 2023. 2024 benefitted from the improvement in gross margins and decline in operating expenses. We are extremely pleased to show our first quarterly and annual net income in the Company’s history.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.5 million, compared with ($0.1 million) in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2024 was approximately $0.5 million, compared with approximately ($0.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 As of December 31, 2024, Nephros had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.8 million, compared to $4.3 million as of December 31, 2023, and remains debt free.

 Adjusted EBITDA Definition and Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net income (loss) calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and excluding all interest-related expenses and income, tax-related expenses and income, non-recurring expenses and income, and non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, non-cash inventory write-offs, and non-cash compensation. The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter and year to date of the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years:

 Nephros believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Nephros’ financial condition and results of operations. Management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in Nephros’ financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. To compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with net income loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Nephros urges investors to review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income loss and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.
