# ZippedScript Announces Total Funding of $3.15M to Transform Global Credential Verification, Boasting 20 Million Degrees in Database

TORONTO - March 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ZippedScript, the pioneering technology company transforming education and employment verification, today announces its total funding to date of $3.15 million across two rounds. This investment fuels the company’s mission to make the world more efficient by eliminating outdated verification methods, highlighted by its impressive database of over 20 million pre-verified degrees. Unlike incumbents who offer speed, accuracy, affordability, or global coverage - but never all four - ZippedScript provides a comprehensive solution that meets all of these critical factors.

 ZippedScript’s funding journey began with a $750,000 pre-seed round in December 2021, which was instrumental in developing the core proprietary technology that now powers its seamless education verification platform, backed by notable emerging technology investors including Arcanum Capital, Right Side Capital, and New Stack Ventures.

 “I had known Chris for several years prior to him launching ZippedScript, and he is quite simply the most driven, visionary, and hard-working founder I have ever met,” said James McDowall, Founding Partner at Arcanum Capital. “I invest in people, and I have full faith in Chris and the team he has built around him to execute their vision and grow ZippedScript into a world leader in the background check industry.”

 Building on that momentum, ZippedScript successfully closed a $2.4 million seed round in Summer 2023, led by Work-Bench.

 “The ZippedScript team has an intense fire in their commitment to rethinking the future of education verification and building a market-transforming company here. We're thrilled to support them,” said Jessica Lin, Co-founder and General Partner at Work-Bench.

 Nick Moran, Founder and General Partner at New Stack Ventures, added, “ZippedScript is innovating at the intersection of three critical technology trends - Digital Identity, Intelligent APIs, and Democratized Authentication. Companies like Plaid have empowered individuals to connect their financial institution data with a few clicks. ZippedScript empowers individuals to connect their educational institution data with a few clicks. Chris, David, and the team are building the foundation for professional digital identity and verification. We are thrilled to call ourselves investors in ZS’s ambitious and bold vision.”

 Raising this seed round amid the volatility following the Sam Bankman-Fried scandal underscores ZippedScript CEO Chris Harper’s resilience and skill, as investors became increasingly cautious and risk-averse in the wake of heightened scrutiny on the tech sector and venture capital markets.

 "We saw an industry that was stuck in the past, using outdated and inefficient methods," said Chris Harper, CEO of ZippedScript. "Our goal was to create a seamless and global verification process that gets results in minutes, not days or weeks."

 ZippedScript is set to expand into employment verification in 2025, addressing a critical gap in the hiring process. This expansion will leverage ZippedScript’s proven technology to streamline employment history verification with the same speed and accuracy that exists with its education verification product. The company is actively exploring partnerships with major HR tech providers and background check firms to integrate its verification services into broader hiring workflows, a highly demanded product amongst its existing customer base.
