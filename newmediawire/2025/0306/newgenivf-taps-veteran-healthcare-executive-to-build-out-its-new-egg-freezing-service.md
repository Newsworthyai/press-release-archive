# NewGenIvf Taps Veteran Healthcare Executive To Build Out Its New Egg Freezing Service

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - March 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NewGenIvf Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: NIVF), the fertility services provider helping couples and individuals in Asia obtain access to fertility treatments, is doubling down on its recently launched lifetime egg freezing service, bringing on a new leader to build and grow the business.

 The company, aiming to change the approach to fertility in some of the world’s most populous regions, named Thorain Ko as the business development director. Ko is tasked with spearheading NewGenIvf’s lifetime egg-freezing business in China and Asia and developing new initiatives that build sales across the company’s fertility service offerings.

 Ko, who recently served as sales and marketing director at USANA Health Sciences, has more than thirty years of experience in business development, healthcare and direct selling. Previously, Ko held leadership positions at Jeunesse Global Group Ltd. and HEC International LLC.

 “Ko’s extensive experience in healthcare business development across Asia will be instrumental in driving our growth initiatives, particularly in our lifetime egg-freezing business,” said Siu Wing Fung Alfred, founder, chairman, and CEO of NewGenIvf. “These developments reflect our commitment to creating value for shareholders while expanding access to fertility services across Asia.”

 Innovative Approach To Egg Freezing

 Earlier in 2025 NewGenIvf launched what it says is a revolutionary service for women and families across Asia that aren’t ready to have a baby: a lifetime egg freezing service. The “one charge, no worries” egg freezing plan enables women to make one payment to keep their eggs frozen for as long as they want.

 When it comes to reproductive choices, women across Asia are increasingly demanding more flexibility and control. While many women prefer to wait to have children as they pursue their careers or other goals, they are also aware there is a clock on fertility, and freezing their eggs can offer more flexibility. However, local rules can cause limitations. In China, single women are prohibited from freezing their eggs and only women who have a medical condition like cancer are allowed to do so. Females can only store their eggs for ten years in China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

 NewGenIvf launched its latest service aiming to overcome those limitations and tap a growing market opportunity. The company claims to be among the only fertility companies in Asia offering lifetime egg freezing, and it is going after affluent women who have the financial resources but haven’t found a partner yet, with bold projections about its potential success rate.

 The fertility provider expects to grow its customer base for this service by 10% over a five-year period. Depending on the number of customers NewGenIvf lands in year one, the company is projecting net profit of between $4.95 million and $24.8 million in year one. By year five that increases to between $7.25 million to $36.4 million. As for revenue, NewGenIvf is targeting $12 million in the first year of operations.

 Making Strides, Getting Business In Order

 NewGenIvf has also recently regained compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market’s minimum bid price requirement, having received notice of this on February 27, 2025. Additionally, the company was notified on the same day that it had received approval to transfer the listing of its securities from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market.

 With NewGenIvf’s equity issues in the rearview mirror and with Ko on board to grow its egg freezing initiative, the company is feeling confident. Ko brings years of experience working with healthcare companies to the table, which he is expected to leverage to expand NewGenIvf’s network and reach. The company says its egg freezing business is gaining traction and attention and more families across Asia are seeking help with fertility, positioning this fertility company for more growth.
