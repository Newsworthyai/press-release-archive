 FISHERS, IN - February 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce that it is expanding its investment in the alternative currency marketplace through its holdings in Land Betterment Exchange (LBX.X), a utility-based token which is currently trading on DEXSCREENER, and the Company’s initiation and expansion of its holdings in Solana (SOL.X). Royalty Management is also evaluating sponsoring the launch of other utility-based tokens that can give visibility and exposure to the Company’s portfolio holdings and provide a mechanism to help create additional value for these investments.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We are intrigued by the ability to utilize cryptocurrencies as an asset class as part of our overall return profile and holdings, and we are further interested in working with or helping launch various other utility tokens to help provide additional value and opportunity to our portfolio investments and companies, thereby increasing value for our shareholders across multiple fronts and asset classes.”

 Tom continued, “Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum all have attributes that we believe could represent additional attractive upside potential for our shareholders. For LBX, we believe the token issuance process and its partnership with Land Betterment represents a fully transparent and certifiable process to drive the development and integrity of a fundamental market for this utility-specific token in the future. The uniqueness of the LBX tokens is that they possess attractive metrics for advancing communities, industries and the environment, and will look to support the launch of additional tokens in the future with similar utility-based characteristics.”

 Land Betterment Exchange ($LBX.X) is a utility-based cryptocurrency token that creates a financial incentive and trading market to pull forward environmental cleanup and optimize regional industrial growth by creating new sustainable jobs for the local community. Land Betterment Exchange has engaged Land Betterment Corporation, an Indiana Benefit Corporation and B-Corp, as its token issuance partner to ensure that integrity of the token issuance process is adhered to.  Land Betterment Corporation and Land Betterment Exchange both firmly believe that with real solutions it is possible for restoration of impacted areas to live side-by-side long term employment, while building sustainable and safe surroundings for communities and our planet.
