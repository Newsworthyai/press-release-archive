# Troubadour Resources Announces Follow-up Induced Polarization Survey at the Senneville Gold-Silver-Copper Project Ahead of Maiden Drill Program

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - February 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Troubadour Resources Inc. (“TR”, “Troubadour” or the “Company”) (TSXV: TR) (OTCQB: TROUF) (WKN: TROUF), a North American mineral acquisition and exploration company, is pleased to announce it has begun a follow-up Induced Polarization (IP) Survey at the Senneville Gold-Silver-Copper property (“Senneville” or the “Property”) in the eastern Val d’Or district.

 2025 Follow-up IP survey Highlights

 - The Company is completing this survey to address gaps due to seasonal obstacles and limitations in the initial survey completed in 2024 in Gustav Cere Au showing where historic and recent drilling campaigns have intercepted high-grade gold from1.4 g/t Au to 18.75 g/t Au (Fig 1)

 - The Company will be able to finalize diamond drill holes for its’ maiden drill program after completing the complementary IP survey using the additional data.- A total of 3000m across 5 parallel lines were designed to collect additional IP survey data. (Fig 2). Geophysique TMC of Val d’Or will complete the survey.

 “The results from our November 2024 IP survey indicate two zones on the Senneville property that are favorable for gold mineralization which have not previously been targeted with diamond drilling; this complementary IP survey will provide key data as we move ahead with our maiden drill program,” stated CEO Chris Huggins. (Fig 3)

 He continued: “While some extent of the main showing has been defined through diamond drilling by previous claimholders, Troubadour is approaching the property with a fresh perspective that looks beyond where historic work has been completed. Our strategy has provided compelling new targets with potential for discovery in the Val d’Or district, and we are eager to test these zones with the upcoming spring 2025 diamond drill program.”

 The Senneville property is prospective for both orogenic gold and polymetallic VMS-style mineralization and comprises 255 mineral claims located in the eastern part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, ~25 km northeast of the gold mining center of Val-d’Or, Quebec. It covers over 12,000 ha of ground and is contiguous with Probe Gold’s Val d’Or East properties to the north and south, which host a combined resource of 6.7 Moz gold measured and indicated and 3.3 Moz gold inferred (Probe News Release Sept. 5, 2024).

 Highlights of the Conducted IP Survey and previous exploration:

 - The survey identified chargeability anomalies along the hanging wall and footwall contacts of the Senneville Komatiite in areas where there had been no previous diamond drilling.

 - These zones are within areas host to previously proposed diamond drillholes, where work by the previous claimholder had returned Ag, Cu, Ni and Zn metal anomalies.

 - Northwest of the NW chargeability anomaly, the previous claim holder Xander Resources, intersected a 10-metre wide blue-grey quartz vein that returned a widespread Ag anomaly (10.62 g/t Ag over 12.3m an up to 250 g/t Ag over 0.33m) along the same geologic contact, suggesting the mineralized veins extend to the northwest.

 - At the Gustave Cere gold showing, high-grade gold (including 16.52 g/t Au over 0.82 m at DDH#AHS-83-5, 11.03 g/t Au over 1 m at SV-12-3, 9.79 g/t Au over 1 m at SV-12-1  and 18.75 g/t Au over 0.85 m at DDH#XR-21-01A), based on historical results along with other several high value of gold intercepts) is hosted in quartz and quartz-carbonate+/-tourmaline veins that bear many similarities to the gold-bearing veins of the neighbouring Novador deposits.

 - This showing along with several parallel NW-SE gold bearing veining system have been identified through multiple drilling campaigns along an approximately 450 metres strike from drillholes ASH-84-1 to SV-12-03 (Fig. 4).  Sulphide mineralization at the Gustav Cere showing consists of haloes of disseminated to stringer pyrite that mantle the gold-bearing veins.
