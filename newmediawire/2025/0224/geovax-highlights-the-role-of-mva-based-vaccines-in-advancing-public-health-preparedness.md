# GeoVax Highlights the Role of MVA-Based Vaccines in Advancing Public Health Preparedness

Recent Studies Support Diversified Vaccine Strategies, Aligning with GeoVax’s MVA-Based GEO-CM04S1 for Enhanced Protection, Particularly for Immunocompromised Populations

 ATLANTA, GA - February 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in immunotherapies and vaccines, today reaffirms the critical role that mRNA vaccines have played in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the growing recognition of the need for complementary vaccine platforms, particularly for immunocompromised patients and those requiring broader, more durable immunity.

 The rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines were pivotal in mitigating the initial impact of the pandemic, offering a timely and effective response. However, the scientific literature continues to underscore the importance of a diversified vaccine strategy directed towards enhanced durability and expanded protection against variants for populations that may not mount a sufficiently strong immune response to a single vaccine platform. GeoVax’s Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidates, such as GEO-CM04S1 (COVID-19), may complement other existing vaccine platforms by addressing specific challenges.

 Building a More Resilient Vaccine Landscape

 Recent scholarly analyses, including research from leading experts [1] and a strategic review by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) [2], stress the importance of broadening vaccine portfolios beyond mRNA. These publications highlight areas where alternative vaccine platforms, such as viral-vector and live-attenuated vaccines, may provide advantages in durability, cellular immunity, and accessibility.

 GeoVax’s MVA-based vaccines may offer an alternative approach, by utilizing a well-established vaccine vector, particularly in high-risk populations. Unlike current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, GEO-CM04S1 expresses both the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) antigens, to elicit a broader immune response. This enhanced immunogenicity may be especially valuable for immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients and cancer patients, who often exhibit suboptimal responses to mRNA vaccines.

 GeoVax’s MVA-based COVID-19 vaccine can serve as an important addition to the global immunization strategy by offering:

 * Enhanced Immune Response: The inclusion of both Spike and Nucleocapsid antigens in GEO-CM04S1 is intended to elicit a more comprehensive immune response, potentially reducing the need for frequent boosters.
* Durability and Broader Variant Protection: Studies suggest measures of T-cell responses induced by GEO-CM04S1 elicit protection against emerging variants, minimizing the need for frequent reformulation.
* Better Suitability for Immunocompromised Populations: Clinical trials demonstrate that GEO-CM04S1 elicits robust T-cell responses in patients unable to generate adequate antibody responses to conventional (spike-only) COVID-19 vaccines. This is critical for individuals with immune systems compromised by disease (e.g. cancers, genetic defects) or immunosuppressive therapies.
* Scalability and Global Accessibility: GeoVax is further addressing vaccine availability with plans to transition manufacturing to a Next-Generation MVA manufacturing platform, with the potential for improved production efficiency and reduced costs, facilitating global distribution.

 A Proven Technology with a Strong Safety Record

 MVA was originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine. MVA-based vaccines have been safely administered for decades.  MVA’s extensive track record aligns with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) emphasis on vaccine safety, durability, and transparency. The well-documented safety and efficacy of MVA-based vaccines positions them as an important complement to existing mRNA-based approaches.

 Government and Industry Support for Diversified Vaccine Strategies

 Under BARDA’s $5 billion Project NextGen initiative, GeoVax was awarded a contract to conduct a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating an Omicron-updated version of GEO-CM04S1 in a comparison format against an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. This study aims to validate the value of multi-antigen MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in long-term pandemic preparedness and protection against future health threats.

 Positioning for the Future of Vaccine Innovation

 “The success of mRNA vaccines in responding to COVID-19 has been remarkable, but the evolving nature of infectious diseases calls for a diversified, complementary approach to immunization,” said David Dodd, Chairman & CEO of GeoVax. “Our MVA-based vaccines offer enhanced protection for those who need it most, including immunocompromised patients and populations requiring longer-lasting immunity. We are committed to advancing vaccine innovation in collaboration with public and private stakeholders.”

 As the industry moves towards a more integrated and diversified vaccine ecosystem, GeoVax’s MVA-based vaccines should provide a scalable, durable, and globally accessible solution that enhances the existing landscape, ensuring broader protection for all populations.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
