# Millions mobilized on livestream game show to fight heart disease and save lives

(NewMediaWire) - January 31, 2025 - DALLAS — In a contemporary effort to meet people where they are and address the leading cause of death globally, the American Heart Association teamed up with 20 influential, nationwide creators to launch American Heart Month (February) and inspire a new generation to prioritize their heart health. The creators came together at TikTok’s headquarters in New York City for a live trivia gameshow streamed on TikTok LIVE,  calling on millions of viewers to take action, amplifying the fight against heart disease and stroke — which, according to the American Heart Association’s 2025 Statistical Update, remain the leading cause of death, claiming more lives annually than all cancers combined. With preventable risk factors like high blood pressure, poor diets and inactivity on the rise, the urgency to educate and engage communities has never been greater.

 Hosted on TikTok LIVE, the livestream trivia gameshow blended entertainment with education. Two-time heart survivor, creator and American Heart Association volunteer, JT Laybourne, served as host, challenging participants and viewers alike with questions designed to raise awareness about heart health. The livestream empowered audiences with knowledge about prevention while encouraging donations to support the Association’s lifesaving mission.

 Content creators participating in the gameshow extended the event’s impact by using their own platforms to further extend the lifesaving message, urging their audiences and followers to take action and join the fight against heart disease. The event featured a lineup of notable creators including:

 * Sheena Melwani
* TheRealIndianDad
* Chris Olsen
* MamaTot
* Shawn Johnson & Andrew East
* Stephanie & Carlos LaTorre
* Ling & Lamb
* SavageMomLife
* Nurse Blake
* HealthyGamerGG
* ScottyKFitness
* Dr. ShantaQuilette
* JT & Brooklyn Laybourne
* Melanie Cade
* Stephanee Beggs
* Reyhauna Yates

 Together, these creators boast a combined following of over 110 million people across various platforms.

 “It’s incredible to see how digital platforms can transform the way we educate and inspire people. By combining entertainment with critical health information, we aim to reach people in new ways and help them make meaningful changes for themselves and in their communities,” said Laybourne.

 The funds raised during the event will directly support the American Heart Association’s efforts to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease and stroke, fund groundbreaking research, and bring resources to communities in need.
