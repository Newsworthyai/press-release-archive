 In addition, the PureColo Securityholders will receive cash consideration expected to be approximately $2,326,000 (the “Cash Consideration”). The Cash Consideration is payable over a nine month period following closing and is subject to adjustment based on certain debt covenants of PureColo in the SPA.

 Completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of customary closing conditions set forth in the SPA, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. The transaction was negotiated at arm's length and no finders fees or other commissions are payable.

 PureColo’s unaudited revenue for 2025 is forecast to be CAD ~$2.35M based on current run rates. On the same measure, gross profit is ~$1.13M (48%) and operational expenses are forcast to be $1M (~46%).

 Rainer Paduch, Chief Executive Officer of PureColo, commented, “The PureColo team has been working with the CCDS team through the due diligence process. The relationship has progressed well indicating that the integration of PureColo into CCDS should go smoothly. PureColo has been seeing opportunities for CCDS’ existing data centers that were referred over. PureColo has also seen an uptick in mid-market AI opportunities that fit well into the CCDS & PureColo data centers and should drive significant revenue going forward.”

 “We are thrilled to be adding PureColo’s Ottawa based data centers to the Carrier Connect portfolio. With this acquisition Carrier has 4 data centers, in 3 regions, with a strong revenue base and expansion capacity as well,” said Carrier’s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Binns. ”PureColo gives us more space to offer our existing and prospective customers while we continue to accumulate further capacity through ongoing acquisitions. We welcome the whole PureColo team to the Carrier family.”
