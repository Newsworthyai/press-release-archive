 About Sigyn Therapeutics™

 Sigyn Therapeutics is developing blood purification technologies to enhance the benefit of cancer therapies and to address life-threatening infections that are not treatable with drugs. The Company’s lead product candidate, Sigyn TherapyTM has been demonstrated to reduce the presence of viral pathogens, bacterial toxins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines from human blood plasma. Based on these capabilities, Sigyn TherapyTM is a candidate to treat life-threatening viruses, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis, which is the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals. The clinical protocol of first-in-human studies incorporates Sigyn Therapy in series with regularly schedule dialysis treatments to address endotoxemia and concurrent inflammation, which contribute to shortening the lives of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Extending the lives of individuals with ESRD would boost dialysis industry revenues.

 The Company has also established an oncology pipeline comprised of ImmunePrepTM, a platform to enhance the delivery of immunotherapeutic antibodies; ChemoPrepTM to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents; and ChemoPureTM to reduce chemotherapy toxicity. If successfully advanced, the Company’s therapies offer to provide strategic value to the dialysis and biopharmaceutical industry.
