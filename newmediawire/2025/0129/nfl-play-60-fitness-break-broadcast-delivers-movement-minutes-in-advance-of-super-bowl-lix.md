# NFL PLAY 60 Fitness Break broadcast delivers movement minutes in advance of Super Bowl LIX

(NewMediaWire) - January 29, 2025 - DALLAS — The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, and the National Football League (NFL), in collaboration with its 32 NFL clubs, are challenging kids to get moving and PLAY 60 in advance of Super Bowl LIX with the latest installment of the NFL PLAY 60 Fitness Break school broadcast series. On Thursday, Feb. 5 at 1 p.m. ET/ 12 p.m. CT/ 10 a.m. PT the Association and the NFL will deliver an action-packed, 15-minute synchronous streaming broadcast to help elementary school students add movement to their day leading up to the big game along with help from the New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers, Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.

 “For a century meeting kids where they are on a path of lifelong health and wellness is a core value of the American Heart Association and we are excited to continue that work,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer at the American Heart Association. “Partnering with the NFL through NFL PLAY 60 brings innovative and engaging ways to inspire kids to get active, supporting both mental and physical health, as they learn and develop skills that can lead to a longer, healthier life.”

 Rooted in American Heart Association science, the Fitness Break broadcast helps students learn more about how physical activity supports their overall wellness. This Fitness Break will show students how to add movement to daily games and activities to help them grow and be healthy. In addition to the physical exercises, the 32 national grant winners of NFL PLAY 60 Daily Movement Moment Challenge, one per NFL team, will be announced. These 32 winners will each receive $1,000 NFL PLAY 60 grants to be used towards the purchase of physical activity equipment.

 This is the second broadcast of the school year. The NFL PLAY 60 Fitness Break Kickoff broadcast aired in schools in September. Past Fitness Break broadcasts can be found in the online NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Library which also features two-to-three minute on-demand exercise videos from each of the 32 NFL teams – featuring players, NFL Legends, cheerleaders and mascots. This on-demand digital library allows parents, teachers and caregivers access at any time to support daily physical movement goals.

 The American Heart Association recommends that kids get a minimum of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day to meet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans[1]. Developing healthy habits and reducing sedentary behaviors in kids is key to immediate and long-term health benefits. The benefits of physical activity are unmatched when it comes to lowering risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases. But the perks of physical activity also extend to the classroom as active kids have better sleep, improved cognition and an overall better quality of life according to the American Heart Association. Helping students understand the full benefits of getting active can establish healthy habits at a young age for a better chance of healthier adulthood.

 “As the world turns its attention to Super Bowl LIX, we are proud to team up with the American Heart Association to share the importance of developing healthy habits with our youth,” said NFL Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility Anna Isaacson. “Physical activity is critical for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and the NFL PLAY 60 fitness break continues to be a fun and engaging way to inspire kids to get moving before the big game.”

 In addition to the NFL PLAY 60 Super Bowl Fitness Break, the NFL and the American Heart Association will host New Orleans area students at Pan American Stadium on Wednesday, Feb. 5 for the annual NFL PLAY 60 Kids Day in advance of the Super Bowl. This by-invitation only event welcomes 1,000 students to participate in various football themed skills and drills and learn Hands-Only CPR.

 The NFL and the American Heart Association have teamed up since 2006 to inspire kids through fun and engaging ways to get physically active for at least 60 minutes a day. The impact of physical activity on overall mental and physical wellness is essential to help children grow to reach their full potential.
