# Strengthening America's Biosecurity: GeoVax Advances Domestic Vaccine Capability

Addressing Critical U.S. Vulnerabilities in Vaccine Supply and National Preparedness

 ATLANTA, GA - January 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies, today highlighted that it is committed to playing a pivotal role in reinforcing America's biosecurity through its GEO-MVA vaccine, designed to combat both smallpox and Mpox.  In light of recent global health challenges, the United States has recognized the critical need to reduce dependence on foreign vaccine suppliers and bolster domestic production capabilities.

 The 2022 Mpox pandemic significantly depleted the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of vaccines, exposing vulnerabilities in the nation's preparedness for emerging health threats. Compounding this issue is the nation's reliance on a single foreign manufacturer for smallpox and Mpox vaccines. This dependency poses a strategic risk, especially considering the current Clade I Mpox outbreak in Africa, characterized by an estimated 5%-10% mortality rate, increasingly migrating to other regions worldwide.

 GeoVax's GEO-MVA vaccine is expected to offer a timely and strategic solution. Developed on the proven Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform, a clinical batch of GEO-MVA has recently been produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production.  Clinical evaluation of the vaccine is expected to begin this year.  The Company's innovative advanced MVA manufacturing process is anticipated to provide scalable, flexible and cost-effective vaccine production, reducing reliance on foreign vaccine manufacturers and reinforcing domestic biosecurity.

 America First – Bolstering U.S. Biomanufacturing Resilience

 The importance of onshoring medical product manufacturing has garnered bipartisan support among U.S. legislators. Reps. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) officially launched the bipartisan Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Caucus for the 118th Congress.

 Representatives Blake Moore (R-UT), August Pfluger (R-TX), Mark Green (R-TN), and former Representative Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) have also sought feedback on policy solutions to secure and enhance domestic medical supply chains.

 GeoVax's commitment to domestic vaccine production aligns seamlessly with these national initiatives, positioning GEO-MVA as a cornerstone in America's strategy to achieve vaccine independence and enhance public health preparedness.

 David Dodd, GeoVax's Chairman and CEO, stated, "With GEO-MVA, we intend to create the first U.S.-based source for a Mpox vaccine, an important biodefense goal."

 About GEO-MVA

 GEO-MVA is a Mpox and smallpox vaccine candidate utilizing U.S. NIH rights acquired by GeoVax. Designed for robust immune responses, GEO-MVA is anticipated to offer a safe and effective solution for both immunocompromised and general populations​.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology, the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned to initiate during the first half of 2025. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
