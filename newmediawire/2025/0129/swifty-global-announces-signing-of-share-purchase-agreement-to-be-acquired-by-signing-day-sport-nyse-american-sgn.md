 Daniel Nelson, CEO of Signing Day Sports, commented, “We are thrilled to announce the signing of the SPA with Swifty Global, which reflects the shared vision and collaboration between our organizations. I extend my sincere appreciation to James Gibbons and Nick Link for their exceptional efforts throughout this process. We see the SPA as a significant step toward accelerated expansion, enabling us to leverage Swifty Global’s cutting-edge SaaS technology to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs by over 50%, and accelerate product development. Together, we expect to increase user growth, retention, and new revenue opportunities while expanding into emerging markets across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Together, we are confident in our ability to build a stronger company, committed to innovation, positioned for global expansion, and powered by cutting-edge technology - delivering exceptional value to our shareholders and clients.

 “Following the closing of the SPA, Swifty Global will operate as a subsidiary of Signing Day Sports, with its financial results fully integrated into our operations. Signing Day Sports’ pre-closing business will likewise operate within a subsidiary of Signing Day Sports.”

 James Gibbons, CEO of Swifty Global, commented, “The Swifty Global team has worked extremely hard, demonstrating exceptional diligence and discipline in building an outstanding business with a solid foundation. We are excited about the future and look forward to working together to achieve great things."

 Terms of the Transaction

 At the closing of the acquisition under the SPA, Signing Day Sports will acquire from James Gibbons and Nicolas Link (the “Sellers) the common stock and preferred stock of Swifty Global held by them constituting 99.13% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Swifty Global. Additional sellers holding Swifty Global common stock or preferred stock may enter into substantially identical agreements with Signing Day Sports and also sell their Swifty Global capital stock to Signing Day Sports, which would increase the aggregate percentage of Swifty Global acquired by Signing Day Sports.

 At the closing, the Sellers will receive a number of shares of Signing Day Sports common stock that is equal to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Signing Day Sports as of the date of the SPA. The balance of the shares that Signing Day Sports must issue to the sellers will be in the form of convertible preferred stock that will have no voting or dividend rights until shareholder approval of conversion and the clearance of an initial listing application with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Signing Day Sports legacy shareholders are expected to retain approximately 8.24% of the post-transaction company’s shares, with the remaining approximately 91.76% being issued to the sellers and the other stockholders of DRCR, based on the number of shares of Signing Day Sports common stock outstanding as of the date of the SPA, subject to adjustment as described below.

 At the closing, James Gibbons will become the Chief Executive Officer of Signing Day Sports and remain the Chief Executive Officer of Swifty Global. Signing Day Sports management will remain the management of the Signing Day Sports subsidiary that will be established in connection with the acquisition. One Signing Day Sports executive director will resign, and Mr. Gibbons will be elected to the Signing Day Sports board.

 After the closing, Signing Day Sports will consolidate Swifty Global’s financial statements and operate Swifty Global as a subsidiary. Signing Day Sports’ existing assets will be contributed into a newly formed subsidiary.

 After the closing, Signing Day Sports will hold a shareholder meeting to, among other things, approve the conversion of the preferred stock issued to the Sellers into common stock, and elect a new board of directors of Signing Day Sports. If the stockholders approve the proposals, the Signing Day Sports preferred stock will convert into 18,316,086 shares of Signing Day Sports common stock. In addition, the board will continue to consist of five members, consisting of one board member nominated by Signing Day Sports, two independent directors and one executive director nominated by Swifty Global’s pre-closing board, and one independent director jointly nominated by both Signing Day Sports and Swifty Global jointly.

 Signing Day Sports and Swifty Global will also seek all necessary stockholder, regulatory, and stock exchange consents or approvals, in order for Signing Day Sports to acquire the remaining outstanding equity ownership of Swifty Global not acquired from the Sellers under the SPA or additional stock purchase agreements through a merger of Swifty Global into Signing Day Sports or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signing Day Sports (the “Merger”). Signing Day Sports will file a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to, among other things, the registration of the offer and sale of the shares of Signing Day Sports common stock to be issued to the stockholders of Swifty Global in the Merger.

 Both Signing Day Sports and Swifty Global will collectively seek to raise at least $2.0 million in financing as soon as possible, with the proceeds split equally. These funds will be used for the operations of each of Signing Day Sports and Swifty Global, and the payment of outstanding liabilities of Signing Day Sports, such that there will be no material liabilities of Signing Day Sports remaining at the time of the conversion of the preferred stock.  If, at the effective time of the Merger, Signing Day Sports has any indebtedness for borrowed money or liabilities in excess of $150,000 relating to the period prior to the closing, then Signing Day Sports will issue to the legacy stockholders of Swifty Global, including the Sellers, as soon as practicable following the closing of the Merger, a number of shares of Signing Day Sports common stock equal to the aggregate Signing Day Sports liabilities divided by the Applicable Price Per Share (as defined in the SPA).

 Both Signing Day Sports and Swifty Global will complete due diligence before the closing under the SPA. The closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, including, without limitation, conditional approval from Nasdaq of an initial listing application that has been filed with such exchange, and no assurance can be given that the closing will occur, or that post-closing requirements for the acquisition will be met.  From and after the closing, Signing Day Sports is expected to commence trading on the Nasdaq.

 The sellers and the officers and directors of Signing Day Sports will be subject to a three-month lock-up period following the closing.

 The SPA contains provisions for termination, representations, warranties, covenants, and mutual indemnification provisions.

 Advisors to the transaction include Maxim Group LLC, which is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Swifty Global. Lucosky Brookman LLP is serving as counsel to Swifty Global. Bevilacqua PLLC is serving as counsel to Signing Day Sports.

 A copy of the SPA will be filed as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K to be filed by Signing Day Sports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on or about the date of this press release.
