# BioLite, Inc., an ABVC BioPharma Subsidiary, Receives $230,000 Milestone Payment from AiBtl, Advancing Botanical Drug Licensing Collaboration

Silicon Valley, CA - (NewMediaWire) - August 27, 2025 - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today announced that one of its subsidiaries, BioLite, Inc., received an additional $230,000 milestone payment from AiBtl BioPharma, Inc. (“AiBtl”) under the strategic licensing agreement for ABV-1504 and ABV-1505, two botanical-derived drug candidates being developed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 Strong Financial Impact

 Including this latest payment, BioLite has received a cumulative $230,000 from AiBtl. Under the same licensing agreement, BioLite remains eligible to receive up to $7,000,000 in future cash milestone and licensing payments, subject to the achievement of specified milestones.

 ABVC, as BioLite’s majority owner and co-licensor, has separately received $350,000 to date and remains eligible for up to $6,650,000 in additional milestone and licensing payments, also subject to milestones. Thus, on a consolidated basis, the ABVC group could benefit from up to $13,420,000 in future cash payments, if all conditions are met.

 In addition to the cash component, the licensing agreement includes equity consideration in which AiBtl issued 46,000,000 common shares, with 23,000,000 shares allocated to ABVC and 23,000,000 shares allocated to BioLite. When combining the total milestone payments, equity stakes, and potential future royalties, the transaction could represent approximately $667 million in potential value, based on internal valuations and assumptions.

 Unlocking Market Potential in CNS Botanical Drugs

 

 Botanical-derived therapies for psychiatric disorders represent a growing global market opportunity.

 * The anxiety and depression treatment market was valued at approximately US$15.4 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$19.3 billion by 2030 (CAGR 3.8%).[1]
* The ADHD therapeutics market was valued at approximately US$14.3 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to US$18.6 billion by 2030 (CAGR 3.7%).[2]

 In addition, major health organizations highlight the continued unmet medical needs:

 * The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting more than 380 million people globally.[3]
* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies ADHD as one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children, with a prevalence rate of 9.8% among U.S. children.[4]

 These figures demonstrate the scale of the unmet needs in psychiatric care and the potential role that innovative botanical-based therapies may play.

 

 Management Commentary

 Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, stated: “This milestone payment to BioLite underscores the progress of our collaboration with AiBtl. While future payments remain contingent on milestone achievements, the combined structure of cash and equity can provide both companies with an important foundation to advance development. Depression and ADHD represent major global health challenges, and our continued work with AiBtl aims to explore safe and effective botanical-based treatment options that may expand therapeutic choices for patients.”

 Forward-Looking Outlook

 We believe the licensing partnership with AiBtl has the potential to put ABVC in a unique position to become a frontrunner in the emerging field of botanical CNS therapies. By combining potential cash inflows, equity stakes, and a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity,[5] ABVC believes it will be able to strengthen its balance sheet and hopefully unlock transformational long-term value for shareholders. Based on the total potential proceeds at stake in this partnership, we believe ABVC is strategically set to capture both financial and clinical upside – reaffirming its trajectory toward becoming a global leader in botanical-derived psychiatric treatments.
