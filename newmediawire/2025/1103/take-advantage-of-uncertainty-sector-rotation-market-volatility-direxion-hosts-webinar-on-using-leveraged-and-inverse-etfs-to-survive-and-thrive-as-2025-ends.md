By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As the markets enter the final stretch of 2025, investors are facing a high-stakes mix of macro uncertainty, sector rotation and elevated volatility. That calls for a protective stance, but traders can also use that volatility to their advantage. Join Direxion for an online bootcamp at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, November 6, to learn how.

 During this high-impact webinar, investors will learn how to use leveraged and inverse ETFs to take advantage of the current elevated volatility and sector rotation when the markets are whipsawing between highs and lows at any given moment in the trading day. Through expert-led sessions and real-time case studies, traders will gain insight into market behavior around macroeconomic catalysts and how to use leveraged ETFs to amplify their trading strategies.

 Direxion's Senior Vice President of Institutional ETF Strategy, Eliott Wellenbach and Gianni Di Poce, analyst at The Mercator LLC, will lead this interactive webinar, giving traders an insider look into Direxion’s leveraged and inverse ETF product suite and how to use them to take advantage of volatility, uncertainty and sector rotation as we close out 2025. The two seasoned professionals will be on hand to provide strategies to gain clarity and to position tactically - not just to protect your portfolio but to also pursue amplified gains. Audience participation is encouraged, so come ready with questions and get the answers you need in real time.

 Volatility Has Been A Key Theme This Year

 From tariffs to geopolitical uncertainty, volatility has been front and center since the start of 2025 and it hasn’t gotten any better as we moved through the year. With so much uncertainty still lingering, particularly with what will happen with tariffs, the Federal Reserve and trade wars, it's not surprising that volatility is heightened and appears here to stay for a while. It's also something that, through Direxion's webinar and inverse and leveraged ETFs, you can capitalize on.

 * How volatility is reshaping short-term opportunities for traders.
* Strategies for using leveraged ETFs in trend and range environments.
