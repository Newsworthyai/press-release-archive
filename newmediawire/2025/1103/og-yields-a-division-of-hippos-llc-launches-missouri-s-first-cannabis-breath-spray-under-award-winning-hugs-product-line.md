# OG Yields, a Division of Hippos, LLC, Launches Missouri's First Cannabis Breath Spray Under Award-Winning HUGS Product Line

Fast-Acting, Discreet, and Precise HUGS Breath Spray Delivers 3mg THC Per Pump in a Refreshing Mint Flavor

 VIENNA, MISSOURI - November 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - OG Yields, owned by Hippos, LLC, Missouri’s premier producer of cannabis cultivated in the heart of the Ozarks, today announced the launch of Missouri’s first and only cannabis breath spray, expanding its award-winning HUGS wellness line. The new HUGS Breath Spray is a fast-acting, discreet, and portable product offering precise dosing and consistent effects.

 Launching in Missouri, one of the nation’s most rapidly expanding retail markets, HUGS Breath Spray fills a growing demand for convenient, micro-dosed, on-the-go cannabis products, marking another step forward in OG Yields’ mission to innovate in wellness driven cannabis formats.

 Missouri’s cannabis market has quickly become one of the most active in the country. With more than 200 retailers across Missouri, the Show-Me state showed total sales reaching approximately $118 million in September 2025, according to Headset data. Building on the success of the HUGS Salve and the September 2025 launch of the brand’s Daytime, Stress Relief, and Nighttime tinctures, the new HUGS Breath Spray is a first-of-its-kind product in Missouri’s cannabis market.

 The launch follows OG Yields’ recent recognition at the 3rd Annual Missouri Grower’s Cup, where the HUGS Cannabis Salve earned first place in the topical category, reinforcing the line’s reputation for quality, consistency and innovation in cannabis wellness.

 “HUGS has always been about making cannabis wellness simple and accessible,” said Nicholas Rinella, CEO of Hippos, LLC. “While traditional consumption formats like flower, vapes and edibles remain cornerstones of the cannabis experience, HUGS Breath Spray complements these categories by offering a discreet, precisely dosed option for moments when those formats might not be as practical. It broadens how and where consumers can enjoy cannabis, empowering them to personalize their experience with confidence and control."

 New HUGS Breath Spray Product Line

 The HUGS Breath Spray delivers a consistent 3-milligram THC sublingual dose per spray and uses nanotechnology to improve cannabinoid absorption, offering faster onset than traditional edibles. Each sleek aluminum bottle contains 150 milligrams of total THC, providing up to 50 precisely measured doses. The formulation contains no sugar, artificial flavors or fillers and is available in a mint flavor, with additional varieties planned for 2026.

 As the first company to bring cannabis breath spray to Missouri, OG Yields continues to lead the state’s innovation curve. Manufactured in OG Yields in the heart of the Ozarks, the HUGS line reflects the Company’s commitment to quality and innovation from cultivation to finished product. The full line of HUGS products, including the new HUGS Breath Spray, is now available at dispensary locations across Missouri.
