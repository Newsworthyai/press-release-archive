# Ares Strategic Mining Completes Secondary Ventilation System at Its Mine, Clearing Path for Industrial-Scale Mining

VANCOUVER, BC - November 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Ares Strategic Mining Inc. (CSE: ARS) (OTC: ARSMF) (FRA: N8I1) is pleased to announce the successful completion and activation of its secondary underground ventilation system at the Lost Sheep Fluorspar Mine in Juab County, Utah. This achievement marks the final regulatory and operational milestone required to commence industrial-scale mining operations in full compliance with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) standards.

 The secondary ventilation system has been engineered, installed, and tested to provide continuous, high-volume airflow to active underground work areas, ensuring a safe and compliant operating environment for personnel and equipment.

 Major Infrastructure Milestone Completed

 As part of Ares’ strategic ramp-up to full-scale production, the newly completed secondary ventilation system includes:

 - A 75-horsepower, 30-inch diameter fan generating a minimum of 30,000 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of fresh airflow

 - Custom-built by ABC Ventilation Systems, the fan was installed along a dedicated ventilation raise that also serves as a second egress pathway, meeting MSHA’s redundancy and safety requirements

 - Designed and implemented by Provo Mining & Construction (PMC), with future airflow expansion plans integrated as mining activities deepen and advance

 The ventilation system marked with BLUE provides the secondary air pathway and escape route which facilitates meeting regulatory conditions to mine

 This development finalizes all critical underground infrastructure required to move into continuous mining operations at scale. James Walker, CEO of Ares Strategic Mining, commented, “The completion of the ventilation system marks a turning point for Ares. With this vital infrastructure now in place and MSHA standards fully met, our teams are greenlit to ramp up to full-scale, continuous mining. This is the final step before true production begins - and it brings us closer than ever to generating consistent revenue as America’s only fluorspar producer.”

 Positioned for Production and Growth

 This development builds upon months of construction and underground advancement, including:

 * - The completion of spiral decline development and ore access drifts - The mobilization of full mining equipment fleets, including loaders, articulated trucks, and jumbo drills - The construction and commissioning of surface processing infrastructure (Lumps Plant)

 With the ventilation system online, the Company is now cleared to begin ore extraction at industrial levels, supporting near-term stockpiling and processing targets.

 Strategic Importance of Fluorspar

 Fluorspar is a U.S.-designated critical mineral, vital to the production of:

 * - Aluminum and steel - Lithium-ion batteries and fluoropolymers - Hydrofluoric acid and nuclear fuel production

 Ares’ Lost Sheep Mine is currently the only permitted and operational fluorspar mine in the United States, placing the Company in a unique position to support North American industrial supply chains and reduce dependence on foreign sources.

 Ares is also pleased to announce that the Company has agreed to the settlement of an aggregate of $64,901.13 of debt incurred by the Company for accounting and financial services provided by Viktoriya Griffin, Prospero, and Craven Capital. The Company issued an aggregate of 150,933 common shares at a deemed price of $0.43 per Share,

 DISCLOSURE AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

 Companies typically rely on comprehensive feasibility reports on mineral reserve estimates to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with a production decision. Historically, situations where the issuer decides to put a mineral project into production without first establishing mineral reserves supported by a technical report and completing a feasibility study have a higher risk of economic or technical failure, though some industrial mineral ventures are relatively simple operations with low levels of investment and risk, where the operating entity has determined that a formal prefeasibility or feasibility study in conformance with NI 43-101 and 43-101 CP is not required for a production decision. Based on historical engineering work, geological reports, historical production data and current engineering work completed or in the process by Ares, the Company intends to move forward with the development of its Utah asset.
