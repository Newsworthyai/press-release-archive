# One World Products Secures OEM Approval for Cellulose Fiber-Filled Masterbatch for Future Vehicle Programs

Milestone Caps a Strong October That Included Surpassing 100,000 Pounds of Rubber Shipments and Expanded Ecosystem Partnerships

 DETROIT, MI - November 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - One World Products, Inc. (OTC: OWPC), soon to be renamed Isiah Enterprises, announced that a major automotive OEM has approved the company’s cellulose fiber-filled masterbatch for use in near-future vehicle models. The approval validates One World Products’ bio-based masterbatch as a performance-proven, production-ready alternative to traditional plastics and positions the company as a key supplier in the global shift to renewable and circular manufacturing.

 The OEM approval headlines a strong close to October. The company surpassed 100,000 pounds of pelletized rubber shipped from its Eco Bio Plastics facility in Midland, Michigan, and expanded partnerships across the sustainability ecosystem, including pelletizing rubber for Full Circle Technologies. Together, these milestones reflect One World Products’ rapid evolution into a vertically integrated materials innovator powering the next generation of automotive and industrial products.

 One World Products continues to advance a portfolio that includes cellulose, hemp, and bio-feed masterbatches alongside rubber masterbatch and pelletized compounds. These materials are engineered to lower carbon impact, improve weight and performance metrics, and integrate with existing OEM manufacturing systems.

 “The OEM approval is a turning point; it confirms that our materials are not just sustainable, they are ready for the production line,” said Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of One World Products. “Crossing 100,000 pounds of pelletized rubber shipped in the same month proves that our innovation scales with industrial reliability. From Stellantis, West Michigan Compounding, Flex-N-Gate, and Full Circle Technologies, our partnerships and customers show that the future of manufacturing is sustainable, circular, and inclusive.”

 October also featured strategic plant visits from Stellantis and Dow, two global industry leaders that are collaborating with One World Products on next-generation sustainable material systems. These engagements highlight growing industry recognition of the company’s technology, manufacturing capability, and environmental leadership.
