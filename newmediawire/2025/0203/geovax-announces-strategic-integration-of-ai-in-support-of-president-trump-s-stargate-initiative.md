# GeoVax Announces Strategic Integration of AI in Support of President Trump's Stargate Initiative

Harnessing AI to Revolutionize Vaccine and Therapy Development

 ATLANTA, GA - February 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a leader in vaccine and immunotherapy development, announced today its endorsement of President Donald J. Trump’s Stargate Initiative, which aims to harness advanced technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) to strengthen U.S. healthcare, biosecurity, and global innovation leadership. This announcement aligns with GeoVax’s commitment to leveraging AI across its vaccine and cancer immunotherapy programs to accelerate research, optimize operations, and deliver life-saving solutions.

 Revolutionizing Healthcare with AI

 GeoVax has embedded AI into its platforms for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy, enabling groundbreaking advances:

 * Vaccine Development: AI drives target discovery and design for vaccines using the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform, including GEO-CM04S1, GeoVax’s next-generation vaccine for COVID-19, and vaccines for Mpox and Smallpox. AI predicts pathogen mutations, ensuring long-lasting and variant-proof vaccines.
* Cancer Immunotherapy: AI optimizes GeoVax’s Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (GDEPT) for solid tumors, including predictive modeling of tumor microenvironments, real-time adjustment of protocols to maximize therapeutic efficacy, and identifying synergistic combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
* Clinical Targeting: AI-powered analytics will refine patient stratification, ensuring that GeoVax’s therapies reach underserved populations most in need, aligning with the initiative’s national focus to maximize therapeutic efficacy.
* Manufacturing and Operations: AI improves GeoVax’s vaccine production scalability and supply chain management, ensuring timely delivery to strategic stockpiles.

 Aligned with the Stargate Vision

 President Trump’s Stargate Initiative, supported by up to $500 billion in private-sector investment, represents a bold step forward in embracing transformative technologies. GeoVax proudly aligns with this vision, advancing U.S. healthcare innovation and pandemic preparedness.

 David Dodd, GeoVax Chairman and CEO, stated: “President Trump’s Stargate Initiative exemplifies leadership in harnessing AI to address critical healthcare challenges. GeoVax is honored to support this initiative, highlighting its application of AI to develop vaccines and therapies that save lives and enhance biosecurity. We are proud to contribute to a future where the United States leads the world in healthcare innovation.”

 Building on Operation Warp Speed’s Legacy

 GeoVax’s efforts reflect the spirit of President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment. By integrating AI into its research and operational strategies, GeoVax aims to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in medical science.

 A Commitment to Life-Saving Innovation

 GeoVax remains steadfast in its mission to develop innovative vaccines and immunotherapies, leveraging the power of AI to meet the healthcare needs of today and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. With AI now embedded in its processes, GeoVax anticipates shorter development timelines, increased efficiency in clinical trials, and enhanced capacity to deliver life-saving therapies globally. Collaborations with academic institutions, industry partners and federal agencies will further amplify the reach and impact of GeoVax’s innovative programs under the Stargate framework. AI-enabled supply chain optimization will further ensure efficient vaccine distribution to high-priority populations and regions.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned to initiate in mid-2025. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
