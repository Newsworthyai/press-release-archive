# Splash Beverage Group Announces New LOI for Merger and Acquisition of Western Son Vodka via Equity Exchange

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - February 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) ("Splash" or "the Company"), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced it has signed an updated Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire Western Son Vodka (“WSV”) primarily through a stock-for-equity transaction. The addition of the Western Son revenue base will effectively double Splash’s peak trailing twelve-month revenue, significantly expanding the Company’s financial footprint. Under the proposed structure, Western Son shareholders would receive restricted stock in Splash Beverage Group and an approximate 10% of cash consideration. In return, Splash would assume certain outstanding debt obligations of WSV.

 This merger structure represents an alternative to the previously announced majority cash-based acquisition and provides a pathway to completion that aligns the interests of both companies. The transaction remains subject to definitive agreements, standard regulatory approval, and a shareholder vote.

 "We have always believed that Western Son Vodka would be an outstanding addition to Splash’s portfolio, which is why we have been so persistent to bring it into the Splash Portfolio," said Robert Nistico, CEO of Splash. “Both teams have not stopped their work together and today is very exciting … we are very much looking forward to working with Western Son and building the next major spirits brand. This LOI is an important step forward, and we are confident that structuring the deal as an equity exchange gives us a clearer path to completion. We believe our shareholders are very much in favor of this as it adds significant revenue and operational efficiencies,  shortens our path to profitability, and will be accretive. We look forward to working together in a unified manner as we move forward on this important transaction."

 Western Son Vodka, founded in 2011 and located in Pilot Point, Texas, is an award-winning craft vodka with a growing national footprint. The brand’s 10X distilled vodka, made with 100% American corn, has earned multiple industry awards and continues to expand its national distribution. Western Son Vodka won the 2024 Newsweek Readers’ Choice Award for Best Vodka voted on by consumers (https://www.newsweek.com/readerschoice/best-vodka).

 Carlos Guillem, Western Son’s President, said, “The new LOI marks a significant milestone for Western Son Vodka. This strategic move strengthens our foundation for continued expansion, enhances our market presence, and reinforces our commitment to delivering the exceptional quality our consumers expect. We are excited about the future and the opportunities this partnership creates. Together, we are building a stronger, more innovative Western Son Vodka for our customers and stakeholders.”

 The Company will provide additional updates as key milestones are achieved. The two companies are targeting to close the transaction this quarter.
