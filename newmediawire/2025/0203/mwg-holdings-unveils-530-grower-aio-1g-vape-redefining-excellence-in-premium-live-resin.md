# MWG Holdings Unveils 530 Grower AIO 1g Vape: Redefining Excellence in Premium Live Resin

Innovative All-in-One Vape Launches With Rich Terpene Profile Options, Expands 530 Grower’s Premium Product Lineup

 SACRAMENTO, CA - February 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings” or “MWG”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today the launch of its latest innovation in premium cannabis vaping: the 530 Grower AIO 1g Vape.

 The new AIO cart enhances 530 Grower's comprehensive product lineup, which includes premium flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, and the existing 510-thread vape cart. Combining the rich flavors and potent effects of true terpene Live Resin BHO with the convenience of an all-in-one design, the new 530 Grower AIO 1g Vape product line reinforces 530 Grower’s commitment to quality and innovation in the indoor cannabis space.

 The 530 Grower AIO 1g Vape lineup launches with three meticulously crafted strains, each reflecting the brand’s dedication to premium indoor cultivation:

 * Holy Grail OG: Earthy, pine-forward notes meet a calming, euphoric experience
* Crystal Cookies: A delectable balance of sweet and citrus flavors, paired with uplifting effects
* Red Dragon: Exotic, fruity undertones deliver a bold flavor and energizing experience

 These AIO vapes are crafted using 100 percent true terpene Live Resin BHO – a category that continues to captivate cannabis consumers for its unmatched flavor profiles and cannabinoid retention. Unlike terpene enhanced products, 530 Grower’s Live Resign captures the authentic essence of freshly harvested, premium indoor cannabis.

 “We’re thrilled to introduce the 530 Grower AIO 1g Vape to our consumers,” said Tom Sheridan, CEO of MWG Holdings, Inc. “With all of the AIO devices currently available in the market, we’re offering an unparalleled experience that stays true to the plant. It’s not just about convenience for us, it’s about elevating what's possible in the cannabis vaping space.”

 The 530 Grower AIO vape devices are designed with user-friendliness in mind, featuring sleek, portable hardware that is ready to use straight out of the box. These products cater to consumers who value both quality and simplicity, making them an essential addition to any consumer’s collection.

 530 Grower products including their new AIO 1g vapes are available exclusively to the California Market at all Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness stores.
