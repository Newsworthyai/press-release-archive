# Join the Nation of Lifesavers at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans

(NewMediaWire) - February 03, 2025 - DALLAS — Football fans can also learn how to save a life during this year’s Super Bowl Experience. The American Heart Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ Mobile CPR Unit will be on site at the NFL’s Super Bowl Experience presented by Panini taking place at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. Qualified CPR trainers will be onsite while the experience is open to the public Wednesday, Feb. 5 through Saturday, Feb. 8 providing Hands-Only CPR instructions to attendees.

 In this walk-up style instruction, participants will learn the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions. This marks the fifth appearance of the Association’s Mobile CPR Unit at a signature NFL event. Previously, it trained fans at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, LVII in Phoenix, the 2023 NFL Draft in Kansas City and the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit. The Mobile CPR Unit will also be at the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

 The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is collaborating with the National Football League (NFL) to bring Hands-Only CPR education to events throughout the Super Bowl week. The science has shown that compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest[1].

 “We are delighted to join the NFL once again at the Super Bowl Experience in New Orleans to teach thousands of fans the lifesaving skill of Hands-Only CPR. Starting CPR immediately supports a critical link in the chain of survival when a cardiac emergency occurs,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “The Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ initiative has set a bold goal to double the survival rate for an out of hospital cardiac arrest by 2030. The NFL and a player ambassador class led by Buffalo Bills safety, Damar Hamlin are supporting our efforts. As we celebrate 18 seasons working with the NFL, we know that with every CPR training we perform, we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and help save a life.”

 In addition to the mobile unit, the American Heart Association will bring CPR education to the annual NFL PLAY 60 Kids Day held in advance of the Super Bowl. This by-invitation only event will welcome 1,000 kids to Pan American Stadium on Wednesday, Feb. 5. Students and their chaperones will rotate to stations participating in various football themed skills and drills and learn Hands-Only CPR. Rooted in American Heart Association science and in its 18th season, NFL PLAY 60 inspires kids to get a minimum of 60 minutes of physical activity each day and is a collaboration with all 32 NFL clubs and the American Heart Association.

 As part of its activities in recognition of Black History Month, the American Heart Association’s 12 New Orleans-based Scholars will visit the Nation of Lifesavers Mobile CPR Unit on Friday, Feb. 7. The American Heart Association Scholars Program at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) helps undergraduate students seek graduate professional careers in biomedical sciences, research, health care and public health. For Black History Month, the Association is addressing the biggest health challenges in Black communities, including cardiac arrest. While at the Super Bowl Experience, these emerging science and health leaders will help change the future of health by completing their Heartsaver® CPR AED course, which provides the highest quality evidence-based training in the lifesaving skills of CPR, as well as the appropriate use of an AED.

 To celebrate the increase in CPR education, the Association and the NFL will welcome the five students who won Super Bowl LIX tickets through the Association’s in-school programs, Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™. Students who learn Hands-Only CPR through the program can win Super Bowl tickets and their school can be eligible for a $10,000 physical education makeover as part of the collaboration to inspire Hands-Only CPR adoption. This is a year-round activation by the two organizations to support CPR education through the NFL Foundation. Entries are currently available to win tickets to Super Bowl LX taking place in San Francisco in 2026.

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is essential. Increasing the number of people prepared to administer CPR improves the likelihood of a positive outcome.

 The NFL and the American Heart Association want more people to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency, adding more people to the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ movement, which intends to double survival rates by 2030. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 To help with the call to action to learn CPR, the inaugural class of the American Heart Association’s Nation of Lifesaver Player Ambassadors are asking family, friends and fans to learn this lifesaving skill. The 2024-2025 ambassador class is led by cardiac arrest survivor and Buffalo Bills safety, Damar Hamlin, and includes DeeJay Dallas, Arizona Cardinals; Bradley Pinion, Atlanta Falcons; Johnny Hekker, Carolina Panthers; Gerald Everett, Chicago Bears; Chris Evans, Cincinnati Bengals; Kris Jenkins, Cincinnati Bengals; Denzel Ward, Cleveland Browns; Justin Reid, Kansas City Chiefs; Demarcus Robinson, Los Angeles Rams and Devin Singletary, New York Giants.

 Since January 2023, the American Heart Association has worked alongside more than half of the NFL teams to educate players and staff, local youth coaches and fan families on Hands-Only CPR and train in Heartsaver® CPR AED. The Atlanta Falcons, Arizona Cardinals, Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears, Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs, Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Rams, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans, have since hosted American Heart Association trainings and education opportunities making their community better prepared to respond to a cardiac emergency where fans live, work and play.

 The Association encourages everyone to take 90 seconds to learn how to save a life now at www.heart.org/nation.
