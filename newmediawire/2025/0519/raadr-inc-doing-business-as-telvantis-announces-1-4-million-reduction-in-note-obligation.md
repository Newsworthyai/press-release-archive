# Raadr Inc., Doing Business as Telvantis, Announces $1.4 Million Reduction in Note Obligation

NEW YORK - May 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc. (OTC: $RDAR), doing business as Telvantis (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), today announced that it and JanBella Group, LLC (“JanBella”) have agreed to amend the Company’s note obligation to JanBella to a total of $400,000 - the original note had a principal amount of $540,000 and an additional $1,260,000 in conditional obligations, including an 18-month 10% “fee tail” obligation on certain future funding. The revised $400,000 note balance is payable in four monthly installments, with the first payment having already been made by the Company.

 “The increasing strength of our business operations has enabled us to take this decisive action, which, together with our previously announced share buyback program, delivers both short-term and long-term benefits,” said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “Each of these actions, in their own way, creates meaningful long-term value for our shareholders,” Mr. Contreras added.

 “We constantly seek to allocate our available cash where it offers attractive returns, and our ability to dramatically reduce our future obligations to JanBella was an opportunity that magnifies our ability and, importantly, our willingness to strike at the right time,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. Mr. Gilcher extended his comments by expressing the Company’s gratitude to JanBella for working toward a mutually beneficial outcome.
