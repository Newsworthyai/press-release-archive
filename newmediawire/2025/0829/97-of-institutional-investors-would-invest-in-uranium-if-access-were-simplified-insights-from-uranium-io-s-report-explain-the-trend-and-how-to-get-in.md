 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Investors have a new alternative investment that can give them upside potential: uranium. Spot uranium has outperformed the S&P 500 for the past five years, yet it’s proven elusive for retail traders to invest in. It trades on opaque over-the-counter markets, with little liquidity and limited price transparency, shutting retail investors, family offices and even midsized funds out.

 But Uranium.io is changing that. It's the first platform that enables everyday investors to buy, own and trade physical uranium, specifically uranium ore concentrate (U3O8). Uranium.io does this by tokenizing U3O8 that is securely stored at a regulated storage facility, operated by one of the three globally recognized uranium conversion and storage providers. Investors purchase fractional amounts of uranium in the form of a smart contract known as an xU308. Each xU308 represents a unit of ownership of U3O8.

 “Fractionalization enables minimum investments far below traditional market thresholds; In traditional OTC uranium markets, minimum trade sizes often exceed $4 million, placing the asset far beyond the reach of retail investors and even mid-sized institutions,” noted the Team in a recent research report that shines a spotlight on the commodity and the trends driving price momentum. “Tokenization breaks this barrier, enabling participation with as little as $5, allowing everyone to participate. Around-the-clock trading makes uranium accessible across time zones.”

 Uranium For Good

 The uranium that Uranium.io is tokenizing isn’t the stuff used to create weapons. It is a stable powdered form of uranium concentrate, known as “yellowcake.” It’s used as the base material for nuclear fuel production to power Big Tech’s AI infrastructure and by governments around the world to meet their net-zero goals. As a result, it doesn’t face the same regulatory oversight that the weapon-grade material does. To dive into the details around that, click here to access Uranium.io’s free report: Fuel the Future.

 Timing Is Everything

 The platform comes at a fortuitous time. Big tech companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into nuclear energy to power their AI data centers. Large language models and machine learning require tons of computational power, which means a lot of electricity consumption. That is only expected to get worse as AI and machine learning advance. Also driving demand are a shift away from fossil fuels and growth in interest in emerging markets.

 That demand is already outstripping supply. As it stands, the report notes there is a gap of more than 40 million lb annually between the amount of uranium produced and the amount needed, and that’s expected to widen as new reactors come online and geopolitical events in Kazakhstan, Niger and Canada disrupt mining. What’s more, small modular reactors or SMRs are likely to boost localized uranium demand. “Uranium is at the nexus of energy resilience, digital infrastructure and industrial sovereignty,” noted in the report.

 Investing in uranium is also something institutional and regular investors want. The survey polled investors and found 97% of institutional investors would consider investing in uranium if access were simplified, while 61% of retail investors said they would be “very interested” in trading uranium under similar conditions. These figures reflect a clear disconnect between interest and accessibility, highlighting a market inefficiency that tokenization can directly address, reports the company.

 Meanwhile, the poll also showed that a clear majority - 81% - believes the energy demand from AI and data centers is accelerating the case for uranium, highlighting its relevance as a future-focused clean energy commodity. Plus, when you buy tokenized uranium, you are getting commodity exposure as close as you can to its elemental form.

 Tokenization: The Future Of Uranium Investing?

 Uranium is perfectly suited to join the tokenization trend. Other real-world assets, from gold to diamonds, have been following this model for good reason. It enables investors to access markets that have been either hard for everyone to enter or only reserved for the few. Tokenizing uranium “dismantles the legacy market access barriers that have excluded all but the largest players, it replaces friction with fluidity, manual processes with smart contracts, and opacity with on-chain transparency,” highlights the report. “In doing so, it transforms uranium from an inaccessible industrial commodity into a modern, investable asset.”
