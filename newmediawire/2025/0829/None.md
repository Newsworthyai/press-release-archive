 These figures highlight the substantial commercial opportunity for ABVC and BioLite through their partnership with OncoX.

 Management Commentary

 Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, stated:

 “The $450,000 received from OncoX this quarter, including $350,000 in August, demonstrates the execution strength of our collaboration. At the ABVC standalone level, we have secured $650,000 in cash receipts to date, with $1.85 million still receivable and 5 million OncoX shares in hand. When viewed at the Group level, including our subsidiary BioLite, ABVC collectively is entitled to $3.75 million in total cash consideration and 7.5 million OncoX shares. This broader perspective highlights not only immediate liquidity but also the long-term equity value embedded in our partnership with OncoX.”

 Mr. Yen, Chief Executive Officer of OncoX BioPharma, added:

 “Our partnership with ABVC reflects our vision of combining innovation with strategic collaborations to create long-term value. According to industry research, the global cancer therapeutics market was valued at approximately US$194.67 billion in 2024 and is projected to expand to US$469.38 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 9.2%[3]. Against this backdrop, our licensing agreement with ABVC, together with our acquisition of the Lycogen® platform for $4.06 million, demonstrates our commitment to expanding our oncology portfolio and preparing for global market opportunities.”

 Forward-Looking Outlook

 This licensing partnership with OncoX strengthens ABVC’s strategic positioning in oncology. By combining immediate and potential cash inflows, equity holdings, and future royalty streams, ABVC has created a framework with a consolidated value exceeding $41 million (excluding royalties). We believe this collaboration further cements ABVC’s leadership in advancing botanical-derived oncology therapeutics toward global commercialization.
