# Sauce Debuts Full End-to-End Discovery, Delivery & Retention Platform at NRA Show

Following Success in New York and Miami, Sauce Enters a Key Chicago Market to Help Restaurants Reclaim Customer Relationships

 NEW YORK, NY - May 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sauce, the leading first-party ordering and delivery platform built for independent restaurants, announced today the launch of its complete end-to-end customer engagement solution at the National Restaurant Association Show. The company also announced its expansion into the Chicago restaurant market, bringing its flat-fee delivery and white-glove support to one of America’s most iconic food cities.

 This end-to-end launch marks a major milestone for Sauce and for the first-party delivery category. For the first time, restaurants can now manage the entire guest journey in one platform: from discovery to online ordering, delivery fulfillment to fully managed customer support, and now, powered by Sauce’s new AI retention engine, automated re-engagement and loyalty.

 AI-powered retention, now available to all Sauce customers, uses behavioral insights and dynamic content to drive repeat orders automatically. In early testing, the system increased return orders by over 20%, helping restaurants capture more value from every guest.

 “The roll out of these final pieces completes our vision of being a truly end-to-end solution for restaurants - a first for us and for the industry,” said Li-ran Navon, CEO of Sauce. “Most first-party delivery platforms stop at delivery. Sauce doesn’t just go further - it manages the entire delivery customer journey, from end-to-end. With discovery built-in, fully managed fulfillment, and AI-powered discovery and retention, we’re giving restaurants everything they need to build long-term customer relationships and grow delivery profitably.”

 With this launch, Sauce offers the only fully-managed first-party delivery solution that includes:

 * Branded online ordering
* Managed delivery with a local courier network
* Live customer support
* AI-powered email marketing and retention

 NRA Show attendees can visit Sauce at Booth #5517 to experience the full platform and learn how Sauce is helping restaurants reduce fees, grow direct orders, and keep customers coming back.
