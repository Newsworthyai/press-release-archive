VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications platforms, is pleased to announce that steel fabrication has commenced on the first three Nexus platforms, following the company’s successful Australian Government Grant application. Production is now underway for Nexus 1, 2, and 3, with two additional platforms scheduled to follow.

 Delivery into CiTech’s production facility is expected as follows:

 - Nexus 1 and 2 - within 10 weeks- Nexus 3 - end of January 2026

 Upon receipt, each Nexus platform will undergo final fit-out, with completion expected within 4-6 weeks.

 Demonstrations and Strategic Engagements

 Once completed, demonstrations and/or pilot programs of the Nexus platform will be carried out with:

 - Major mining companies in Western Australia- The Australian Defence Force (ADF)- Emergency Services departments

 These demonstrations in Australia will showcase the platform’s versatility across mining, defence, emergency services, and critical infrastructure.

 Future Production and International Roadmap

 Production of Nexus 4 and 5 is scheduled to commence in November 2025, with one of the platforms to be shipped directly to Poland for final fit-out. This unit will then embark on a European product roadshow in March/April 2026 given the significant interest we have received, engaging defence, government, and industry stakeholders across the EU.

 “This milestone reflects the momentum behind the Nexus program, supported by the Australian Government and our global partners,” said Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech. “The upcoming demonstrations and international engagements will highlight the capability of the Nexus platform to deliver innovative solutions for defence, border security and surveillance, emergency services and the mining sector.”
