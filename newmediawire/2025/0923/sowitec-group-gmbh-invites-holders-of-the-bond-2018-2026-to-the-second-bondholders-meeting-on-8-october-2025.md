# SOWITEC group GmbH Invites Holders of the Bond 2018/2026 to the Second Bondholders' Meeting on 8 October 2025

SONNENBUHL, Germany - September 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SoWiTec group GmbH (SOWITEC) announces that, as expected, the voting without a meeting regarding the bond 2018/2026 (ISIN: DE000A2NBZ21) did not reach the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding bond volume with a participation rate of 12.18% and therefore did not constitute a quorum. For this reason, the company invites the bondholders of the bond 2018/2026 to participate in a second bondholders’ meeting, which will take place on 8 October 2025 in Sonnenbühl in the form of a physical meeting. The invitation (German language only) was published today, 23 September 2025, in the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) and on the company website https://investor.sowitec.com/de/.

 SOWITEC would like to thank all bondholders who participated in the voting without a meeting. For the second bondholders’ meeting, a quorum of 25% is required in order to implement the planned measures. The company therefore kindly requests all bondholders of the bond 2018/2026 to actively participate in the second bondholders’ meeting.

 SOWITEC will reimburse bondholders of the bond 2018/2026 participating in the second bondholders’ meeting an amount equal to 0.5% of the outstanding nominal value registered for the second bondholders’ meeting, but at least EUR 75.00 per deposit, whereby payment of the participation fee is subject to the required quorum of 25% of the outstanding nominal value being reached. Furthermore, payment will only be made after the resolutions have been implemented. The form for applying for the participation fee is available for download on the company website https://investor.sowitec.com/de/.

 SOWITEC is currently in advanced negotiations with investors regarding the sale of a partial portfolio with 80 MW in Germany. The resulting proceeds will also be used to finance the partial repayment of the bond 2018/2026 due on 8 November 2025. However, in the event of a delay in the conclusion of the contract and the execution of the partial portfolio sale, SOWITEC could experience a liquidity shortage, as the company’s liquidity situation remains tense. Liquidity decreased by EUR 3.1 million compared to the previous year to EUR 0.4 million as of 31 December 2024 and stood at EUR 0.5 million as of 30 June 2025 and EUR 1.4 million as of 31 July 2025. In order to prevent the risk of a liquidity shortage, the holders of the bond 2018/2026 are kindly requested to participate in the second bondholders’ meeting and to vote in favor of the proposed resolutions.

 The proposed resolutions agreed with SdK Schutzgemeinschaft der Kapitalanleger e.V. (“SdK”) which remain unchanged compared to the voting without a meeting include deferring the partial repayment of EUR 2,290,200 due on 8 November 2025 by six months until 8 May 2026, waiving the exercise of termination rights regarding the non-payment of the partial repayment due on 8 November 2025, and authorising and empowering the joint representative to exercise terminations and temporary waivers.

 The interest of 8% or approximately EUR 0.4 million due on 8 November 2025 is not subject to the proposed resolutions and shall be paid in full and on time.Contact:Frank HummelSOWITEC group GmbH07128 38 08-20frank.hummel@sowitec.com
