# Swedish EdTech Leader Mathleaks Launches U.S. Initiative, Expanding AI-Powered Math and Financial Literacy Education

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - September 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Swedish education technology leader Mathleaks is launching its U.S. initiative with a clear mission: to support K-12 educators through AI-powered, adaptive math instruction, while also exploring new opportunities in Financial Literacy education - a critical area of growing national need.

 Founded in Stockholm and widely adopted across Sweden for mathematics education, Mathleaks has reached more than 2.5 million students and educators globally. Now, it brings its adaptive learning platform to the U.S. to address two key priorities: enhancing math instruction through dynamic, personalized learning and contributing to more effective Financial Literacy education through teacher collaboration and state-specific resources.

 “We believe that both strong math skills and foundational financial literacy are essential to lifelong success, and we are committed to empowering U.S. educators with the tools they need to deliver both,” remarked, Jesper Mårtensson, Mathleaks’ co-founder.

 Mathleaks will introduce its fully U.S.-ready AI-powered math curriculum to Departments of Education, private school communities, and educational councils nationwide through its U.S. initiative. In addition, the company will focus on developing adaptive Financial Literacy tools - leveraging insights from its success in Sweden and guided by direct input from U.S. educators and stakeholders.

 The Mathleaks U.S. initiative will begin by offering AI-powered math resources, alongside teacher-facing Financial Literacy sample materials and educator webinars designed to gather direct feedback. This feedback will inform the development of expanded resources tailored to state and local needs across both subject areas. The company aims to support classroom instruction, not replace it, by centering its tools around flexibility, adaptability, and the insights of U.S. educators.

 According to a 2024 national report, only 27% of U.S. high school students are in schools where personal finance is required as a standalone course. An additional 16% receive financial education integrated into other required courses, leaving over half of the students with access to elective courses or no financial education.

 “Financial Literacy is one of the most pressing education gaps in the U.S., and we believe that adaptive, AI-supported tools - developed with direct input from U.S. teachers - can play an important role in helping to close that gap,” Martensson added.

 In parallel with its Financial Literacy work, Mathleaks will offer AI-powered adaptive math modules that support personalized learning and teacher flexibility - building on the company’s proven success in Sweden, where its platform serves as a dynamic alternative to traditional math textbooks.

 Both Math and Financial Literacy modules incorporate an AI-powered adaptive engine that adjusts instructional content in real time based on student inputs. The system helps identify where learners may need additional support and offers personalized learning paths to build competence and confidence.

 Unlike automation-heavy models, Mathleaks positions its AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant. Educators remain in full control of instruction, with tools to track student progress, differentiate lessons, and customize content to align with their instructional styles and curriculum goals.

 “Our philosophy is simple: technology should serve teachers, not replace them.”

 Initial U.S. pilot content includes foundational math modules and Financial Literacy modules on topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and credit management - supported by adaptive exercises and intended to evolve through educator feedback gathered via webinars and classroom testing.

 The U.S. version of the platform will include editable content templates, state-specific adaptability, and compatibility with both hybrid and in-person learning environments.

 As its U.S. initiative progresses, Mathleaks plans to expand outreach to private schools and additional state education networks. Growth will remain measured and educator-driven, reflecting feedback gathered throughout the pilot phase.

 Mathleaks has indicated that its long-term role is not to serve as a conventional curriculum provider but as an innovation partner - developing adaptive educational resources through collaboration, transparency, and alignment with state and local needs.
