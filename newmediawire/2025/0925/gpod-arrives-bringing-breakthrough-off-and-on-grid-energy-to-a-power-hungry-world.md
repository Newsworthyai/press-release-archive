# GPOD Arrives - Bringing Breakthrough, Off and On-Grid Energy to a Power-Hungry World

Debut of GPOD Signals a New Chapter in Global Energy, Delivering Reliable, Off and On-grid Electricity With Zero Emissions and Validated by Independent Experts

 FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - September 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sustainable and off and on-grid energy is on the verge of a historic leap forward. SuperCloud Energy today announced the launch of GPOD (Green Power On Demand), a fully integrated, multi-faceted, zero-emission energy platform now available for commercial orders.

 Designed to deliver reliable, industrial-grade power virtually anywhere, GPOD combines proprietary power generation technology with advanced sodium-ion battery storage, satellite and 5G connectivity, and comprehensive security systems. All housed in a self-contained and transportable unit, GPOD’s offers advanced technologies for remote maintenance, power monitoring, shedding, generation, and output with control anywhere in the World.

 At the core of GPOD’s breakthrough capability is its Magnetic Exciter Technology and proprietary OmniPX1 energy multiplier is a system that enables unprecedented stability, scalability, and efficiency in power generation. By dynamically aligning and managing magnetic fields to sustain optimal efficiency, the Magnetic Exciter with OmniPX1 acts as a catalyst that amplifies output while maintaining consistent, predictable performance. This innovation allows GPOD to scale from small kilowatt units to multi-megawatt installations without sacrificing reliability or control.

 The first GPOD models have been independently tested and validated by respected third parties, including two highly regarded international accreditation bodies and a U.S. Department of Defense Physicist and energy systems consultant, confirming the system’s ability to deliver stable, amplified output under continuous operation. Integrated high-capacity batteries store excess energy for off-cycle use, while satellite and cloud-based controls provide real-time performance monitoring and remote management from anywhere in the world.

 SuperCloud Energy is already in discussions with both domestic agencies, government contractors and foreign governments regarding large-scale deployments, from national grid resilience projects to remote infrastructure and disaster recovery operations. Additional GPOD power source models, built on the same Magnetic Exciter foundation and other energy generation technologies, like thermal and quantum energy, are under development and will be announced in the coming months along with the first-of-its-kind quantum power system which will be unveiled to the World soon.

 “We are not overstating it when we say that GPOD is, and will remain, the foundation for a new era in energy,” said Jim Devericks, Founder and CEO of SuperCloud Energy. “Our Magnetic Exciter Technology, powered by the OmniPX1 multiplier, is the enabling innovation that makes stable, scalable, and truly world-changing on and off-grid power shedding and power generation possible. Combined with the multiple breakthrough technologies we are prepared to integrate into GPOD, this platform will transform how energy is generated, distributed, monitored and maintained for many years to come. From delivering consistent, reliable power to rural regions and nations struggling with energy access, to boosting grid capacity for high-demand projects like data centers and accelerating the adoption of EVs, GPOD is the solution the world has been waiting for.

Today we have a proven, commercially ready system and as we integrate additional breakthrough energy technologies alongside our exciter technology, we will redefine off-grid & on-grid and sustainable power generation for decades to come.”

 Each GPOD is engineered as a fully self-contained energy hub, housed in a secure, transportable container ranging from 10 to 40 feet in length with multiple power output configurations depending upon onboard energy power source. With continuous output from 60 kWh to 2 MWh, a single GPOD can power everything from a cluster of homes to a large-scale industrial facility or mission-critical infrastructure. Scalable by design, GPOD units can be deployed individually or networked together to form resilient microgrids, instantly expanding capacity to meet surging energy demands. Potential applications span across industries and geographies - supplying reliable power to AI data centers, mining operations, and EV charging networks; supporting humanitarian relief efforts in disaster zones; enabling military forward operating bases to run silently and emission-free; and electrifying island nations or remote communities where traditional grid access is costly or impossible. Every unit comes equipped with advanced security features, temperature regulation, and real-time performance monitoring via satellite or cloud, ensuring autonomous, 24/7 operation anywhere on the planet.

 With commercial orders now open at: https://supercloudenergy.com, GPOD represents a rare opportunity to secure early access to a proven, independently validated platform that addresses one of the most pressing challenges of our time - delivering clean, reliable, and scalable power where and when it is needed most. Private demonstrations are available under NDA for qualified parties, offering a first-hand look at the technology set to redefine energy generation in the 21st century. Initial production quantities are intentionally limited to maintain deployment quality and support strategic rollouts, with units allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.
