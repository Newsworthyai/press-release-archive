# NFL Mascots Inspire Kids to PLAY 60 Daily for Better Health

DALLAS - September 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Six NFL (National Football League) club mascots are stepping up to inspire kids to move more to support mental and physical health. These NFL mascots are serving as members of the inaugural NFL PLAY 60 Ambassador class supporting the NFL and the American Heart Association’s work to help kids achieve a minimum of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day. Rooted in the American Heart Association’s physical activity guidelines, NFL PLAY 60 supports the evidence-based guidance that students who are active learn better, focus more, think more clearly, react to stress more calmy and perform and behave better in the classroom.

 “Collaborating with these NFL mascots brings our science to life in a fun and engaging way to help kids develop healthy habits so they can grow to their full potential,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Our longstanding partnership with the NFL has always focused on building a world of longer, healthier lives through physical activity, heart health and safety.”

 Since 2006 the NFL and the American Heart Association have been teaming up to inspire kids through fun and engaging ways to get physically active. For 19 seasons, NFL PLAY 60 has come to life on the ground in NFL markets and beyond working to reduce sedentary behaviors in kids to support immediate and long-term health benefits. The program evolves over the years to support the needs of kids in real time. This new mascot ambassador element adds recognizable characters from communities around the country bringing a game-day atmosphere to the program.

 The NFL PLAY 60 mascot ambassadors will encourage kids to get active throughout the school year with exercise ideas, promote healthy habit choices and build excitement with team spirit. The 2025 season NFL PLAY 60 mascot ambassadors are:

 * Freddie Falcon, Atlanta Falcons
* Gumbo, New Orleans Saints
* Rampage, Los Angeles Rams
* Rowdy, Dallas Cowboys
* Sir Purr, Carolina Panthers
* T-Rac, Tennessee Titans

 NFL PLAY 60 works alongside the Association’s school programs Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ to offers resources for kids to get active while at school and at home. The program also includes learning modules to better their individual health, be a good friend and support the community through lessons such as Hands-Only CPR.

 The NFL’s support of this work includes an introduction video by Damar Hamlin, Nation of Lifesavers™ National Ambassador, Buffalo Bills safety and cardiac arrest survivor, in advance of the Kids Heart Challenge’s CPR instruction. Each student who completes the Hands-Only CPR instruction will earn an entry for two tickets to Super Bowl LXI on February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Five individual winners will be drawn and five schools participating in the challenge will receive $10,000 fitness equipment makeovers. Entries are available now to those completing Finn’s Mission. Parents and school administrators can visit heart.org/schools to learn how their students can participate.

 Every student participating in Kids Heart Challenge can also access the NFL PLAY 60 Family Challenge which encourages families to get active together at home, matching quality time with prioritizing wellness with creative ways for the whole family to move more and sit less.

 The NFL PLAY 60 mascot ambassadors can also be found in the NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Library, which features two-to-three minute on-demand exercise videos from each of the 32 NFL clubs. These videos are helpful to parents, teachers and caregivers on days where outside play is not possible due to weather conditions, when students need to get the wiggles out to refocus in the classroom or even a fitness break in the day to add minutes towards the daily movement goal of 60 minutes.
