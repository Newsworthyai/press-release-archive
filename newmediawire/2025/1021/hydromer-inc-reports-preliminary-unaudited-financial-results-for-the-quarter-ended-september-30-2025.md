# Hydromer, Inc. Reports Preliminary Unaudited Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2025

CONCORD NC - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hydromer, Inc. (OTC: HYDI) (the “Company”), a leader in hydrophilic, thromboresistant, and antimicrobial coating technologies for medical devices for over 44 years, today announced certain preliminary, unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. These results are based on the most current information available to management, are unaudited, and are subject to the completion of the Company’s 2025 year-end financial reporting processes, reviews, audit, and potential adjustments, each of which could result in changes to the numbers reported.

 For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, Hydromer generated revenue of $0.91 million, an 11% increase compared to $0.81 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company reported a net income of $53,000 in the third quarter.

 "We are pleased to report continued top line growth and return to a profit-making quarter. Hydromer maintains a high level of customer loyalty and begins to see growth from new customers entering its production coating line-up. The company continues to invest in certain infrastructure and equipment needs while focusing heavily on new product development. We also note the artificially low valuation of HYDI and associated difficulties in trading the stock and will be taking steps to return HYDI to the OTCID Basic Market,” said Michael Torti, CEO of Hydromer.

 Hydromer remains committed to building a scalable, innovation-driven platform and will continue to prioritize operational efficiency, customer partnerships, and next-generation technology development.
