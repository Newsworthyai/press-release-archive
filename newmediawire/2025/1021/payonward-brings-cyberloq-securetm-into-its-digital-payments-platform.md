# PayOnward Brings CyberloQ Secure™ Into Its Digital Payments Platform

CyberloQ Secure™ Will Bring Transaction-level Security Across PayOnward’s Entire Ecosystem

 SARASOTA, FL. - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CyberloQ Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: CLOQ), a cybersecurity company specializing in real-time fraud prevention through user authentication tools that ensure secure access to digital assets, today announced that it is integrating CyberloQ Secure™ into PayOnward’s full suite of modern digital payment solutions. PayOnward provides a next-generation cloud-native universal payments platform for credit unions and community-based financial institutions (CBFIs) and their consumers, and this integration will further protect its clients from a wide range of digital Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer security threats.

 Cyber fraud is one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations, including credit unions and CBFIs. Its impact is more than just fiscal - it can significantly disrupt business operations, destroy business reputations, and upend the lives of consumers. Community-based financial institutions may be particularly vulnerable because of their size and levels of experience.

 CyberloQ Secure™‘s Multi-Factor Authenticator provides added protection for financial institutions by ensuring that payments, transfers, and other financial transactions initiated in the institution’s systems are legitimate. CyberloQ Secure™ does this by authenticating the user’s identity on every transaction and restricting access to only those users who successfully verify their identity using a combination of the following challenge factors: LOCATION, unique one-time passcodes, and fingerprint, face, or voice biometrics.

 With CyberloQ Secure’s™ strong authentication protocols and location-based access constraints implemented, financial institutions can prevent bad actors - including, unfortunately, rogue employees - from initiating fraudulent activities, including but not limited to:

 * Diverting funds to a personal or other fraudulent account.
* Using spoofed accounts receivable links that divert payers to malicious payment sites.
* Creating fake vendors and submitting fraudulent bill pay transactions or altering the payment instructions of legitimate vendors.
* Executing Consumer Account takeovers using compromised user credentials (e.g., acquired through successful phishing attacks).

 “PayOnward is excited to be working with CyberloQ Technologies to offer this extra layer of security to our clients,” said Cary Strange, CEO, PayOnward. “By integrating with CyberloQ Secure™, we will be able to address one of the most pressing concerns for credit union and CBFI clients. By reducing fraud at the account and transaction level, our clients can be even more confident that their customers and their brand are protected from the costly consequences of cybercrime.”

 “Cybercriminals never sleep. And the risk they represent for financial institutions is significant and growing. CyberloQ Secure™ provides real-time, risk-based authentication around the clock for companies where trust and security are mission critical. We look forward to helping PayOnward’s clients remain protected and secure,” said Chris Jackson, President and CFO, CyberloQ Technologies.
