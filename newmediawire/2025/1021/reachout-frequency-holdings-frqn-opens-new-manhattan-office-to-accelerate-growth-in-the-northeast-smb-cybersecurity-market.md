# ReachOut (Frequency Holdings FRQN) Opens New Manhattan Office to Accelerate Growth in the Northeast SMB Cybersecurity Market

NEW YORK, NY - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Today, Frequency Holdings Inc. (OTC: FRQN), through its wholly-owned subsidiary ReachOut Digital Intelligence (“ReachOut”), announces the opening of a new office located at 80 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004, in the heart of Manhattan’s Financial District. This strategic expansion underscores ReachOut’s commitment to serving the greater tri-state small and mid-size business (SMB) market, and reinforces its vision of becoming the household name in cybersecurity services for growing enterprises.

 The newly established office sits just blocks from Wall Street and key financial, legal, and technology institutions, positioning ReachOut at the epicenter of the region’s business ecosystem. The building at 80 Broad Street is a distinguished 36-floor Art Deco tower with approximately 420,000 sq ft of office space, modern amenities, and strong access to transit, making it a prime location for companies aiming to be at the crossroads of innovation and commerce.

 This expansion comes on the heels of ReachOut securing several new customer contracts in the New York metropolitan area. These engagements reflect growing demand for scalable, subscription-based cybersecurity platforms, supported by ReachOut’s combination of SaaS, 24/7 security monitoring, and expert human response.

 “Opening our Manhattan office isn’t just a new address, it’s a statement of our intent,” said Rick Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of ReachOut and Frequency Holdings. “We’re advancing beyond market roots to become a nationwide force for SMB cybersecurity. Our customers demand enterprise-grade protection with the agility of a trusted partner. This office gives us the footprint and presence to deliver both, right in the world’s business capital. We’ve always said: clarity, protection, and compounding value. This move delivers on all three.”

 With this expansion, ReachOut will:

 * Provide localized sales, customer engagement, and technical support in the Northeast region.
* Strengthen its brand presence among SMBs seeking best-in-class cybersecurity and technology solutions.
* Accelerate deployment of its proprietary SaaS protection platform, powered by AI and backed by human expertise.
* Support Frequency Holdings’ broader roll-up strategy of acquiring and integrating local MSPs, scaling them through ReachOut’s platform.

 “As Frequency continues its evolution, this office marks a meaningful milestone,” added Jordan. “We are building infrastructure, security, and identity. And we pledge to our shareholders that every expansion, every contract, every operational move is built with discipline and clarity.”
