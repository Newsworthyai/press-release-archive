 TROY, MI - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - One World Products, Inc. (OTC: OWPC), soon to be renamed Isiah Enterprises, today announced the appointment of Ambassador Ertharin Cousin to its Board of Directors. Her appointment follows that of Minyon Moore, creating a rare alignment of leadership and global influence on a single board at the intersection of sustainability, innovation, and inclusive growth.

 “We are honored to welcome Ambassador Ertharin Cousin alongside Minyon Moore,” said Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of One World Products. “These two extraordinary leaders bring proven judgment and real world execution. They have shaped policy, built coalitions, and delivered measurable results for people and communities. Their presence on our board underscores our commitment to integrity, innovation, and impact as we build Isiah Enterprises for long term value. We are executing in automotive packaging and expanding into food packaging, two sectors where our capabilities and partnerships can scale responsibly and deliver long term value.”

 “This company reflects what the future of business should be. Sustainability, equity, and economic empowerment are not competing goals,” said Ambassador Cousin. “I am honored to join Isiah Thomas and this board to help scale solutions that create value for people and for the planet.”

 Minyon Moore added, “Having two leaders who have been named to Forbes’ 100 Most Powerful Women on the same board is not about symbolism. It is about substance. Ambassador Cousin and I share a belief in leadership that listens, collaborates, and acts with courage. Isiah Enterprises is charting that path.”

 Ambassador Ertharin Cousin brings more than four decades of global leadership across public, private, and social sectors. She served as Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme from 2012 to 2017, leading assistance for tens of millions of people worldwide.

She holds a JD from the University of Georgia and a BA from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Ambassador Cousin has been named to TIME’s 100 Most Influential People and Forbes’ 100 Most Powerful Women.
