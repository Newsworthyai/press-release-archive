# Angkor Resources Advances Drilling Plans On Block VIII Oil &amp; Gas License, Cambodia

GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ANGKOR RESOURCES CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” OR “THE COMPANY”) announces management’s intent for exploratory oil and gas drilling on Block VIII, Cambodia.

 Angkor’s subsidiary EnerCam Resources Co. Cambodia Ltd. (‘EnerCam’) completed approximately 350-line kilometres of 2-D seismic across Block VIII in southwest Cambodia at the end of September 2025. These seismic lines are being processed and interpreted in batches and both the South Bokor and Central Bokor sections have identified at least three significant closed anticlines, one in South Bokor and two in Central Bokor the northern one being probably larger than currently imaged due to a lack of extra seismic line data in that area of the sub-basin.

 CEO Delayne Weeks comments on the findings to date, “Although we await results from additional seismic lines, we are confident and very motivated with the interpretations of the data to date. ANGKOR RESOURCES IDENTIFIES SECOND DRILL TARGET FOR OIL & GAS ON ITS BLOCK VIII, CAMBODIA | Angkor Resources Corp. Even with only half the interpretation of the seismic lines in hand, based on those results, we confirm that EnerCam is committed to drilling multiple exploratory wells in 2026. These structures are of a quality and size that need to be tested and drilling is the only way to prove up Cambodia’s first onshore oil and gas resource.”

 Dr. David Johnson, technical advisor to EnerCam, comments: “Angkor’s decision to pursue drilling of both the South Bokor and Central Bokor structurally closed leads is extremely exciting and well founded. It is rare to find anticlines with four-way closures of over 48 square kilometres and 60 square kilometres respectively in a large sedimentary basin with indications of a working hydrocarbon system, and which have not yet been drilled. The anticlines present themselves clearly and are unmistakable in both the seismic line data and also in the surrounding surface geology.

 The indications of a working hydrocarbon system are evident in the multiple legacy and newly discovered surface live oil seeps located within each of these sub-basins, and in adjacent basin areas. “

 Dave Johnson continues his assessment, “While seismic processing and interpretation is not yet complete, a potential thick ribbon-like top seal presents itself in multiple sections as a thick layer with clear, continuous, conformable reflectors (see Figure 3), consistent with mudstone and lower energy depositional environments.

 An underlying potential reservoir-bearing section presents itself as a thick succession of semi-continuous higher amplitude reflectors with a cross-cutting habit, consistent with higher energy siliciclastic environments, or some carbonate facies development perhaps. It is currently impossible to know for sure what these seismic facies represent in terms of sealing integrity, or both reservoir presence and quality, without drilling an exploratory wellbore to sufficient depth.

 It is however, possible to estimate that the rock volume of a single ‘1 metre thickness reservoir zone’ under proven 4-way closure as 48 million and 60 million cubic metres respectively. There are indications of what geophysicists refer to as Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHIs), and there is the potential for there being multiple layers of reservoir strata, satisfying the first essential requirement for the presence of significant hydrocarbon accumulation in place beneath the closed sealing formation cap layer.

 Work is ongoing to better understand the potential hydrocarbon system and to reduce the risks associated with reservoir quality, seal integrity and source quality. But only the drill bit will prove the true potential of these prospects.”

 Management advances its activities, including sourcing a suitable oil and gas drilling rig and all the appropriate supporting equipment and ancillary services to bring into Cambodia to complete what will be the first onshore wells drilled in the nation. Concurrently, the team is also working on efforts to improve the signal to noise data over each processed line as it becomes available to develop a stronger and broader picture of the potential in Block VIII.

 ABOUT ANGKOR RESOURCES CORPORATION:

 ANGKOR Resources Corp. is a public company, listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange, and is a leading resource optimizer in Cambodia working towards mineral and energy solutions across Canada and Cambodia. Since 2022, Angkor’s Canadian subsidiary, EnerCam Exploration Ltd., has been involved in gas/carbon capture and oil and gas production in Saskatchewan, Canada. ANGKOR’s carbon capture and gas conservation project is part of its long-term commitment to Environmental and Social projects and cleaner energy solutions across jurisdictions.

 The company’s mineral subsidiary, Angkor Gold Corp. in Cambodia holds two mineral exploration licenses in Cambodia with multiple prospects in copper and gold.

 Its Cambodian energy subsidiary, EnerCam Resources, was granted an onshore oil and gas license of 7300 square kilometres in the southwest quadrant of Cambodia called Block VIII. The company then removed all parks and protected areas and added 220 square kilometres, making the just over 4270 square kilometres. EnerCam is actively advancing oil and gas exploration onshore in Cambodia to meet its mission of discovering and proving Cambodia as an oil & gas producer.
