# Announcing the Launch of Feynman Point Asset Management as an Independent Institutional Platform

NEW YORK, NY - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Feynman Point Asset Management (“FPAM”) today announced its formal launch as an independent institutional asset management platform focused on digital asset markets and frontier technologies.

 While newly branded as Feynman Point Asset Management, the organization continues to represent the same proven team and strategy now in its fourth year under CEO & CIO Joe Naggar. It has established a multi-year track record of attractive performance, disciplined risk management, and institutional partnership.

 Previously operating as Republic Digital Fund Manager, and originally incubated at GoldenTree Asset Management in 2022, the transition to the standalone FPAM brand marks the firm’s next phase of growth - providing greater strategic autonomy while preserving the same performance-driven culture, operational infrastructure, and alignment with investors.

 “Feynman Point Asset Management is the natural evolution of what we’ve been building from day one,” said Joe Naggar, CEO & CIO of Feynman Point Asset Management. “We have the same process and the same commitment to performance - now with even greater flexibility to scale partnerships, launch new products, and deepen our institutional relationships. We’re deeply grateful to both GoldenTree and Republic for their partnership and support as we take this next step in our growth.”

 Prior to Republic, Joe spent 16 years at GoldenTree Asset Management, where he was instrumental in the development of the firm’s Structured Products investing platform and was a member of the firm’s Macro Committee.

 Steve Tananbaum, Founder, Managing Partner and CIO of GoldenTree, commented: “I have great respect for Joe’s discipline and conviction as an investor, and we look forward to seeing FPAM’s continued success as an independent platform.”

 Republic also shared well wishes on the transition, noting the team’s institutional discipline, capabilities and clarity of vision.

 “Joe and his team have consistently demonstrated what institutional execution in digital assets should look like,” said Andrew Durgee, co-CEO of Republic. “Their transition to FPAM is a natural progression, and Republic wishes them continued success,” added Ken Nguyen, co-CEO of Republic.

 Feynman Point Asset Management provides institutional investors with access to the return potential of digital assets through a platform anchored by four foundational strengths:

 * Experienced Leadership: FPAM is led by Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Joe Naggar, a seasoned investor and risk manager with decades of experience across macro, structured products, credit, and alternative assets.
* Global Team with Hybrid Expertise: The firm is powered by a 20+ person global team with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto-native strategies, providing continuous market coverage and proactive investor engagement across regions and time zones.
* Institutional-Grade Infrastructure: As a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), FPAM engages best-in-class service providers and operates within a compliance framework designed to meet institutional standards.
* Risk Management & Governance: FPAM maintains rigorous systems, processes, and oversight protocols to mitigate operational, counterparty, and market risks, ensuring disciplined portfolio construction and operational integrity across all strategies.

 Feynman Point Asset Management remains focused on its flagship strategy focused on digital asset markets and frontier technologies with a flexible mandate designed to tactically pursue high-conviction opportunities across digital assets, equities, and secondaries. The strategy seeks to compound superior risk-adjusted returns through shifting market environments via active portfolio construction and institutional risk management.

 The firm complements its flagship strategy with co-investments that provide increased exposure to high-capacity trades and asymmetric opportunities.

 “Institutional investors are increasingly seeking sophisticated, risk-managed exposure to digital assets,” added Naggar. “FPAM blends traditional asset management rigor with deep crypto-native insights - purpose-built to meet those needs. We believe we are positioned at one of the most compelling investment frontiers of the coming decade.”
