# Swiss Quantum Technology SA Signs 10M Agreement to Deploy D-Wave (QBTS) Advantage2 Annealing Quantum Computer

LOS ANGELES, CA - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”) a leader in quantum computing systems, software, and services, announced an agreement with Swiss Quantum Technology SA (“SQT”) to deploy a D-Wave Advantage2TM annealing quantum computer in Europe. The agreement represents a €10M multi-year QCaaS commitment from SQT, with an option to purchase the system.

 Placement of the SQT funded Advantage2 system supports Italy’s newly formed Q-Alliance, an initiative focused on establishing Italy’s quantum leadership. Capable of solving complex computational problems beyond the reach of classical computers, the Advantage2 system funded by SQT will be accessible to customers via D-Wave’s Leap real-time quantum cloud service. Featuring D-Wave’s most advanced quantum processor to date, the 4,400+ qubit Advantage2 system is a powerful and energy-efficient quantum computer designed to facilitate quantum and hybrid quantum applications for production deployment.

 “The agreement with SQT is an important milestone in our ongoing effort to expand global access to our fleet of annealing quantum computers and to help our rapidly growing customer base solve computationally complex problems faster and more efficiently,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “As Europe extends its quantum leadership, we believe that D-Wave’s production-grade annealing quantum computing technology will serve as a critical component, fueling quantum application development and adoption now.”
