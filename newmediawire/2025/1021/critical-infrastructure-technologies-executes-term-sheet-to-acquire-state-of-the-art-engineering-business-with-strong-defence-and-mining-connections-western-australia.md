# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Executes Term Sheet to Acquire State of the Art Engineering Business With Strong Defence and Mining Connections, Western Australia

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - October 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to announce it has entered into a binding Term Sheet to acquire 100% of the issued shares in a Western Australian precision manufacturing company, to expand its advanced production capabilities and secure local sovereign manufacturing capacity for its Nexus 20 and future product lines.

 Under the agreement, CiTech will acquire the company from founders for a total consideration of AUD $7.7 million, plus standard net debt and working capital adjustments.

 The acquisition adds a profitable and well-established business to CiTech, with revenue exceeding AUD$7.4 million and EBITDA of more than AU $1.9 million. This provides a robust earnings base to support accelerated growth in sovereign defence manufacturing, enabling CiTech to scale production, strengthen supply chain control, and advance delivery of its Nexus 20 and future autonomous communication systems.

 Key Highlights

 * CiTech to acquire 100% of a leading Western Australian precision manufacturer serving the defence and infrastructure sectors.
* Strengthens sovereign manufacturing capability in Australia with state-of-the-art fabrication facilities in Western Australia.
* Establishes vertically integrated manufacturing capacity in Australia, improving speed to deployment, cost control, and scalability for defence-grade systems.
* The acquisition provides revenue exceeding AUD$7.4 million and EBITDA of more than AUD$1.9m (based on 2025), delivering a robust earnings base and immediate production capability.
* Provides immediate eligibility for Defence tenders and projects requiring DISP (Defence Industry Security Program) membership.

 Strengthening Australian Manufacturing Sovereignty

 The business, founded in 1997 and based in Western Australia, has more than 25 years of experience delivering precision sheet-metal fabrication, CNC machining, and engineering solutions for the defence, mining, infrastructure, and government sectors. The company is certified to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), and ISO 45001 (Safety) standards, and operates a fully equipped in-house manufacturing facility featuring state-of-the-art laser cutting systems, CNC folding and bending machines, robotic welding technology, and advanced CAD/CAM integration.

 This combination of modern equipment, skilled personnel, and a robust quality management system enables it to produce defence-grade components and assemblies with precision, repeatability, and efficiency.

 This acquisition provides CiTech with direct access to a highly skilled workforce and modern fabrication systems, enabling faster prototyping, improved cost control, and scalable manufacturing for its defence and communications technologies.

 “The business has established itself as a leading precision manufacturer supporting defence and heavy industry in Australia,” said Brenton Scott, CEO and CEO of CiTech. “This acquisition provides CiTech with a consistent revenue stream together with instant profitability, making the CiTech Group cashflow positive from completion. It ensures the group can accelerate production of our Nexus 20 and future product lines while strengthening Australia’s sovereign industrial base.”

 DISP Accreditation Achieved

 The business has successfully achieved DISP accreditation (Defence Industry Security Program), a critical credential administered by the Australian Department of Defence. DISP membership ensures that companies meet rigorous security, governance, and information protection standards required to work with Defence and its supply chain partners.

 This accreditation confirms it can securely handle classified information, personnel, and projects - enabling closer collaboration with Defence and enhancing Australia’s sovereign capability in advanced manufacturing.

 “Achieving DISP accreditation represents a significant milestone,” added Brenton Scott. “It demonstrates our shared commitment to the security, integrity, and resilience required to deliver mission-critical systems to Defence and allied nations.”

 Integration and Transition

 The founders will remain with the business through a structured transition and integration period to ensure operational continuity and maintain the high-quality standards for which it is known for.

 The transaction remains subject to due diligence together with the finalisation of a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) and standard completion conditions. It has been agreed to not name the company being acquired until after due diligence has concluded. Completion is anticipated within 90 days of the Term Sheet’s execution.

 Strategic Alignment

 The acquisition reinforces CiTech’s commitment to building a sovereign Australian manufacturing ecosystem capable of supporting rapid-deployment systems for defence, emergency response, and secure communications. It complements CiTech’s growing network of international partnerships, including collaborations with Babcock International, Terma, and the establishment of an EU presence in Latvia, and therefore further expanding its reach across NATO’s Eastern Flank and allied markets.
