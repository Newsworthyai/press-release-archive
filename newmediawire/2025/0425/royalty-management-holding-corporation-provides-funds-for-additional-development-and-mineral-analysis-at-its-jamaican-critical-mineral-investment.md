# Royalty Management Holding Corporation Provides Funds for Additional Development and Mineral Analysis at Its Jamaican Critical Mineral Investment

Company Provides Additional Capital to Progress the Projects Permitting and Analysis for Potential of Additional Rare Earth Elements and Critical Minerals Within the Deposit

 Initial Target Resource of Vanadium, Titanium, Magnetite, and Iron Ore; Analysis to Identify Other Targets

 FISHERS, INDIANA - April 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, announce today that it has provided additional capital towards the progress and development of T.R. Mining & Equipment Ltd.’s (“TR Mining”) operating permit for its vanadium, titanium, magnetite, and iron ore mine currently under development.  With the prospecting permit established, TR Mining and the Company are advancing efforts to complete the operating permit for TR Mining’s resource extraction, processing, and sale from this diverse mineral deposit.  Royalty Management receives a 10.0% royalty on the sale of all minerals, elements, resources, and products from the permit, which encompasses an area of 25 square kilometers along the southern region of Jamaica and contain no less than 212 million tons of raw sand and ore containing critical minerals and other valuable elements.

 Concurrent with the capital investment towards completing the operating permit, Royalty Management is also investing capital towards additional sampling and analysis of the deposit to determine if there are any other rare earth elements or other critical minerals in meaningful concentration to be commercially valuable, as can be typical with other similar resources.

 “We believe this property will be highly economic based on the already proven reserves that have been identified but the unique characteristics of the site lead us to believe that there may be other valuable elements and minerals that make sense to test and analysis," commented Tom Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Management.  “We have deployed additional capital to the site to start building infrastructure in conjunction with our operator, American Infrastructure Corporation.  Furthermore, we are executing on a testing program to see if there are other elements present at this deposit that have not been tested yet and can be monetized by TR Mining and Royalty Management. The need for critical and rare earth elements in the world today is expanding rapidly, and in other similar resource deposits, these valuable materials have been present as well.  We look forward to sharing any sampling and analysis results with our shareholders."

 The Jamaican-based resource deposit is part of a Special Exclusive Prospecting License (or “SEPL”) that covers an area of approximately 25 permitted square kilometers.

 Of the identified minerals within the SEPL thus far, RMCO will work with mining companies to focus on the extraction and sale of an initial set of high value products, including:

 * Titanium Dioxide and related compounds:  Used in a variety of applications, such as the manufacturing of paints, plastics, paper, and for the aerospace, defense, medical, and steel industries;
* Vanadium Ore: Used for strengthening steel and is a component of rechargeable batteries; and
* Iron Ore: Used in a variety of industries and applications, from ironmaking and steelmaking to resource processing, in the form of magnetite and other related compounds.
