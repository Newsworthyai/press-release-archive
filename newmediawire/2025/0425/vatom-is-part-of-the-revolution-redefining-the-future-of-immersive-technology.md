 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As the fine margins between reality and virtualization become increasingly blurred, modern consumers have grown accustomed to the myriad benefits and conveniences that advanced technologies deliver. Thanks to digital engagement platforms like Vatom, brands, enterprises and event organizers can connect with their target audiences in ways never seen before, and the company is currently running a crowdsourced investment campaign at WeFunder to fuel its vision.

 Vatom says it has established itself as a key player in the digital engagement space, helping some of the world’s largest corporations drive deeper connections with their audiences. By offering tailored digital experiences – ranging from virtual events and loyalty programs to interactive brand activations – Vatom enables companies to enhance engagement while reducing customer acquisition costs and increasing ROI.

 Unlike many traditional platforms that struggle to scale with enterprise demands, Vatom’s technology is built to accommodate millions of users simultaneously. This reliability ensures that businesses can deploy robust, high-impact engagement tools that evolve alongside their growth.

 Consumers Want More Immersion – And Vatom Delivers Just That

 AR has become a technology that many people are familiar with; in fact, the global AR market size reached a valuation of $83.65 billion last year. However, Vatom believes it is leading the charge in the engagement revolution. The company specializes in Spatial Web, a digital layer that allows brands to communicate with people based on where they are in the physical world, not just what websites they visit. Instead of relying on cookies or social feeds, Vatom enables real-time, location-based engagement: offers, content and experiences delivered at the moment, in the places that matter.

 Vatom is not just another digital tool; it’s an entirely new way of thinking about engagement. The company has built a platform that lets businesses create interactive brand activations, digital rewards programs and immersive events – without needing a team of engineers to pull it off.

 This shift is already catching the attention of some of the world’s biggest brands. Google, State Farm and PepsiCo Inc are using Vatom’s technology to deepen their connections with customers. Why? Because engagement is no longer about making people watch – it’s about making them participate.

 How Is Vatom Setting The Curve?

 The problem with most digital engagement tools is that they don’t scale well. They work for a few thousand users, maybe even a few hundred thousand, but if the demand skyrockets, bugs and development problems can arise.

 That’s where Vatom believes it has an edge that few can match. At the helm of its technology is Robert Frederick, the co-founder of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a platform that quietly reshaped the internet and grew into a multibillion-dollar giant. The same principles that powered AWS – scalability, reliability and seamless global access – are now embedded in Vatom’s DNA, allowing it to handle millions of users at once. For brands looking to create massive, real-time digital experiences, that’s not just an advantage – it’s a revolution.

 For example, Vatom partnered with the iHeartRadio Music Festival. Vatom powered an interactive experience where fans could access exclusive content, join virtual meet-and-greets and unlock special rewards. This resulted in millions of interactions, extending the festival’s reach far beyond its physical location.

 Winning In The New Digital Paradigm

 As digital transformation accelerates, businesses must adapt to shifting consumer and workplace expectations. Whether through immersive shopping experiences, AI-powered virtual workspaces or metaverse-driven brand engagement, the demand for interactive, personalized experiences is undeniable.

 Now is the time to consider the future of digital engagement. To be a part of the revolution that is shaping the next era of business, commerce and connectivity, check out Vatom’s WeFunder campaign today.
