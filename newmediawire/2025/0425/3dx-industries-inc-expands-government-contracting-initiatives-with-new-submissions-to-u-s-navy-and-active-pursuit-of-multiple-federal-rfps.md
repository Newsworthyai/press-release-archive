# 3DX Industries, Inc. Expands Government Contracting Initiatives With New Submissions to U.S. Navy and Active Pursuit of Multiple Federal RFPs

SEATTLE - April 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 3DX Industries, Inc. (OTCM: DDDX), a leading manufacturer specializing in additive and subtractive manufacturing, is pleased to announce the continued expansion of its Government Contracting Division. This week, the company submitted Capabilities Statements and Corporate Profiles via SAM.gov and directly to the United States Navy in response to two official opportunities:

 * Naval Opportunity 1: Shipboard Crane Arm and Cable Assemblies
* Naval Opportunity 2: Submarine Hull Components and Fabrication Support

 In addition to these submissions, the company has identified three additional Requests for Proposals (RFPs) that it intends to bid on throughout May, continuing to build a robust government procurement pipeline.

 “This is a major step forward for 3DX,” said Nicholas Coriano, Vice President of 3DX Industries and head of the Government Contracting Division. “There is a significant amount of behind-the-scenes work involved in identifying appropriate federal opportunities, responding to Sources Sought notices, and communicating with procurement officers to ensure that agencies know who we are and what we can provide. We’ve invested time and energy into developing the infrastructure to be a serious federal supplier - and now, we’re starting to see that effort pay off.”

 The U.S. Department of Defense, including the U.S. Navy, has made clear its interest in partnering with technically capable, responsive manufacturing suppliers - especially those capable of providing high-precision components through advanced manufacturing methods such as metal 3D printing and CNC machining. 3DX Industries’ demonstrated proficiency in these areas has positioned the company as a strong candidate to fulfill mission-critical government contracts.

 “Our government contracting initiative is a natural evolution of what we already do well,” said Roger Janssen, CEO of 3DX Industries, Inc. “Precision, reliability, and speed—these are our strengths in the private sector, and they align perfectly with what government agencies demand. The recent submissions to the U.S. Navy and our upcoming RFP bids signal just the beginning of what we believe will be a high-growth opportunity for 3DX.”

 The process of competing for federal contracts is rigorous and highly competitive, requiring a detailed understanding of agency needs, compliance protocols, and relationship-building within the federal procurement ecosystem. 3DX Industries has committed to expanding this effort by dedicating internal resources to government contract research, SAM.gov monitoring, and direct outreach to contracting officers.

 “We’re not just throwing our hat in the ring,” added Coriano. “We are building a long-term presence in the government contracting space.”
