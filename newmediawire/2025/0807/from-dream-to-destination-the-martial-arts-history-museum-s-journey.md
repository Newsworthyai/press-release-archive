 Museum founder and president, Michael Matsuda (NewMediaWire) - August 07, 2025 - Glendale, CA - Like Walt Disney’s vision for a magical kingdom, Michael Matsuda, a former Disney artist and historian, dreamed of a different kind of beautiful place—one that would preserve history. That dream became the Martial Arts History Museum, a unique institution dedicated to keeping history alive not just through kicks and punches, but through a deep dive into the art, music, and traditions of Asian culture.

 The museum's journey began humbly in 1999 as a traveling exhibit before finding its first home in Santa Clarita, then later moving to Burbank. After 15 years, it has now settled into a large new facility in Glendale, where it continues to expand its mission.

 More than just a showcase of fighting techniques, the museum is a testament to how martial arts connect to a rich cultural heritage. "It is the Chinese lion dancing that is an essential part of Chinese Kung Fu. It is the artistry of the samurai sword, the beauty of Korean dancing, and the uniqueness of Filipino stick dance," explains Matsuda. "Culture, art, and music all work together to help establish the arts."

 This focus on cultural richness has set the museum apart. It has earned a spot as one of the top 10 places to visit in Los Angeles and has been featured in numerous articles and news segments.

 As it celebrates its 26th year, the museum is committed to more than just its exhibits. It's also dedicated to its community, offering special weekly tours for individuals with dementia and adults with mental challenges. Matsuda believes the museum must be a part of the community and play a role in helping others.

 The museum's humanitarian efforts are a cornerstone of its mission, and they hope to move to an even larger facility to expand these programs. To continue its journey and keep its doors open, the museum is seeking support from the community through donations and other forms of investment.

 With a rich past and a compassionate future, Matsuda and the Martial Arts History Museum continue to make their mark on history.
