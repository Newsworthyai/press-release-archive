# Food Insecurity Ravages Kenya - Easy Environmental Solutions Plans To Implement Proprietary Technology To Eliminate Starvation

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Kenya, an East African nation that offers diverse landscapes, culture-rich heritage and a variety of wildlife, is undergoing rapid population and economic growth, yet far too many Kenyans are dealing with food insecurity.

 Over one-third of the country’s population lives below the poverty line, while 29% of the children in rural regions suffer from stunted growth due to famine. With 80% of the country’s land area arid or semi-arid, growing nutritious foods is a huge challenge - especially since the country is also experiencing relatively fast population growth. Climate change and inefficient food systems only add to the pain and suffering. Finding ways to grow crops is important to the nation’s survival.

 That’s where Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. (OTC: DUTV) comes in. Formerly known as Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. and listed under the same name, the company is on a mission to improve food security, promote sustainable forms of agriculture, create access to clean water and renewable energy and work toward a net carbon-neutral future.

 As part of a recent rebranding, the company said it is focused on its four subsidiaries: Easy Energy Systems Technologies, Easy Modular Manufacturing, Lifestyle Dock Company, and Feed Earth Now. “Easy Environmental Solutions readily identifies our company’s focus as we continue to grow our footprint in both the United States and internationally,” said Bill Bliler, Director of Business Development, when announcing the rebranding. “Our name now better reflects our mission statement of developing innovative modular technology that will produce green energy sources, promote regenerative agriculture and provide clean drinking water while simultaneously recycling resources & capturing carbon.”

 Fighting Famine

 Easy Environmental Solutions is bringing that approach to Kenya, aiming to work with the government to help transform the country’s agriculture sector. That took on more life late last month when Easy Environmental Solutions CEO Mark Gaalswyk met with Mutahi Kagwe, the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture and Livestock Development of Kenya. The mandate of the ministry is to ensure food and nutrition security for everyone in the country. Kagwe is calling for agencies under his ministry to revitalize the agriculture sector and improve the food insecurity situation in the county by leveraging technology and innovation.

 During the meeting the two discussed boosting farming in Kenya and modernizing farming practices. One particular area of interest during talks was Terreplenish, the company’s organic microbial fertilizer that is made from recycled food and crop waste and targeted at lifeless, unproductive soil.

 Boosting Soil For Growth

 Terreplenish works by introducing beneficial microbes into the soil. These microbes break down organic matter, release essential nutrients and create a more favorable environment for plant roots. This leads to improved soil structure, better water retention and increased nutrient availability for plants, reports the company. Easy Environmental Solutions says there are several benefits to using Terreplenish, including enhancing soil health, improving plant growth, increasing crop yields, reducing chemical dependence and supporting sustainable farming practices by improving the soil’s health naturally without the need for chemicals.

 Powering Terreplenish is the company’s Easy FEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System. Easy Environmental Solutions describes it as a decentralized, fully automatic “Fertilizer Plant in a Box” that can be deployed at rural agricultural co-ops and communities all over the world. The Easy FEN can process two tons of biomass per hour, producing up to 2.7 million gallons of fertilizer annually, reports Easy Environment Solutions.

 The fully automatic system feeds crop waste from each local community to produce the Terreplenish microbial solution. Terreplenish is then able to transform waste into fertilizer directly on site, which effectively fights food insecurity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the company reports. Easy Environmental Solutions reports that Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture and & Livestock said that if the country adopted the Easy FEN to produce Terreplenish, it could treat more than 500,000 hectares of farmland, increase crop yield and reduce input and irrigation costs by as much as 20%.

 African Nations On Board

 Beyond the company’s meeting with Kenya government officials, Easy Environmental Solutions has already demonstrated its effectiveness in other areas, running trials across several African countries, including Somalia, Ghana, Liberia and the Congo. The company reports that the Minister of Agriculture in Somalia even endorsed Terreplenish on national television, highlighting its potential to eliminate starvation across the continent. Since then, Easy Environment Solutions says leaders throughout Africa have expressed interest in Terreplenish, underscoring the interest continent-wide for green tech solutions to famine and food insecurity.

 Food insecurity is a huge problem that requires big solutions, which is what Easy Environmental Solutions believes it has with Terreplenish. But it's not just giving the problem and solution lip service. It's meeting with leaders across Africa, undergoing trials and spreading the word about effective ways to make the soil, even in the most arid places on Earth, fertile ground for growing nutritious food.
