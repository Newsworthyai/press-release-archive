# Fintech Platform Roy, Inc. Launches NILVault to Help Universities Manage Compliance and Reporting

New Software Supports Athletic Departments as They Adapt to NIL Reporting Standards Introduced Under the House v. NCAA Settlement

 MINNEAPOLIS, MN - May 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Roy, a leading fintech startup developing tools to support NIL, today announced the launch of NILVault, a software platform that automates the reporting and organization of NIL deals for athletic departments and universities. The platform will ensure programs stay compliant with new reporting requirements expected to take effect on July 1, 2025, as part of the House v. NCAA settlement. Unlike previous oversight by the NCAA, these requirements will now be enforced under federal judicial authority.

 NILVault seamlessly integrates into the existing workflows of compliance and athletic departments. Athletes sign up, upload their NIL contracts and the platform automatically reviews and reports the details to the university’s compliance team.

 Once an athlete is onboarded, their bank account is linked directly to NILVault, enabling the platform to monitor transactions and flag potential NIL payments over the $600 reporting threshold via text message. This creates a critical ‘pause moment’ – a chance for athletes to confirm or correct reporting, reducing errors while reinforcing education. On the backend, athletic departments get tailored dashboards that surface the most active sponsors, position-by-position earnings and compliance gaps – helping GMs, coaches and development officers make smarter, faster decisions with real-time data.

 By automating this process, NILVault addresses a growing challenge in the NIL era: the burden of manual tracking and reporting often falls on athletes. With NILVault, compliance check-ins and reporting are no longer dependent on memory or manual processing.

 Roy was launched in 2024 by Cale Johnston, a serial entrepreneur who began his career in financial services before founding ClickSWITCH, a fintech platform used by over 450 financial institutions that was acquired by Q2 in 2021. Johnston founded Roy to apply his fintech expertise to the rapidly evolving NIL landscape.

 “NILVault isn’t just about ticking compliance boxes, it’s about turning oversight into opportunity,” Johnston said. “We’re seeing the same transformation in college athletics that fintech sparked in banking 15 years ago: legacy processes are being replaced by smarter, faster, more transparent systems. But in college sports, that shift is happening even faster.”

 NILVault provides athletic departments with a high-level, real-time view of NIL activity across every sport without exposing any personal banking details from athletes. It identifies trends by position, flags compliance gaps and surfaces which brands are most active with their athletes – insights that can drive recruiting conversations, guide sponsor outreach and help development teams uncover new opportunities.

 “Tracking and reporting NIL activity shouldn’t be viewed as a burden,” Johnston said. “For years, valuable data points have been overlooked, data that can now inform everything from recruiting strategies to sponsorship outreach. The programs that start leveraging this data today will have a real competitive edge in the new era of college sports.”
