# Free webinar can help women take the stress out of planning for their financial health

(NewMediaWire) - May 13, 2025 - DALLAS — Women often face unhealthy and undue stress related to financial uncertainty impacted by longer life expectancy, income disparities and caregiving responsibilities[1]. That is why the American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, invites women of all ages to join a free estate planning webinar focused on financial empowerment and future security. The one-hour webinar will take place on Tuesday, May 20, at 2 p.m. Eastern / 1 p.m. Central / 11 a.m. Pacific. Participants will learn how to establish estate plans to securely protect themselves, their loved ones and assets when they are no longer able to.

 According to a McKinsey & Company study, women are poised to control much of the $30 trillion in wealth held by the “baby boomer” generation by the end of the decade. This timely session will provide essential strategies to help women take proactive steps toward building strong financial futures and creating lasting legacies.

 "Every woman deserves to feel empowered and equipped to make choices that protect her loved ones and build a lasting legacy", said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and retired financial executive for The PNC Financial Services Group. "This webinar offers practical tools to help women take charge of their financial journey. By reducing financial stress through thoughtful estate planning, we are supporting their overall health and well-being."

 The free webinar will feature nationally recognized financial expert Stacy Francis, CFP®, CDFA®, CES™, president and CEO of Francis Financial, Inc., and founder of Savvy Ladies™—a nonprofit that has delivered free financial education to more than 20,000 women. Francis will share guidance on practical steps for financial stability and long-term planning. The session will explore strategies to build resilience during uncertain times and help participants navigate difficult life transitions such as widowhood or divorce. Attendees will also learn how to create estate plans that reflect their personal values, identify strategies for sustaining income over time and consider how charitable bequests can make a lasting impact. Participants will receive complimentary, no-obligation estate planning guides upon registration.

 Planned giving is a powerful way to create lasting impact and support the causes that matter most. Donations contributed from planned gifts allow the Heart Association to support the organization’s 2028 Impact Goal that will drive breakthroughs and implement proven solutions in science, policy and care for healthier people and communities. American Heart Association donors who choose to give a legacy gift through charitable financial planning are recognized for their leadership as members of the Paul Dudley White Legacy Circle, a designation within the Cor Vitae Society, named in tribute to one of the Association’s visionary founders and a pioneer of preventive cardiology.

 Legacy gifts have contributed more than $3 billion to the American Heart Association, helping sustain its role as the nation’s leading non-governmental funder of cardiovascular research, with more than $5.9 billion invested in scientific discovery since 1949. This generosity is what fuels lifesaving research and education, helping people everywhere live longer, healthier lives for generations to come.
