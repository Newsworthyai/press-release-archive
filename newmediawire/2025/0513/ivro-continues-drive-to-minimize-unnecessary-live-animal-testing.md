# IVRO Continues Drive to Minimize Unnecessary Live Animal Testing

PLACENTIA, CA - May 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Today, InVitro International (OTCQB: IVRO) reported first half FY '25 sales of $440,650, up 4.4% vs. the same period in FY '24. Net income of $49,239 declined from $65,345 (24.7%) for the same six months in FY '24, reflecting inflationary and OTCQB increased costs.

 CEO and Chairman, W. Richard Ulmer, enthused: "We believe IVRO's first half FY '25 indicates we may be entering a growth period for Non-Animal test technologies. Canada more recently passed legislation, now about to be joined by the U.S.A., follows Europe's 2013 ban on the introduction of new cosmetcs if they have been developed using animal tests. Our Congressional discussions in support have discussed even extending such a ban to include OTC shampoos and skin care products. Now would be an excellent time to mandate additional areas for Regulatory acceptance of scientifically proven invitro test methods."
