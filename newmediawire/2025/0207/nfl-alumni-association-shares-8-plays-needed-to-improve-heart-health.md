# NFL Alumni Association shares 8 plays needed to improve heart health

(NewMediaWire) - February 07, 2025 - NEW ORLEANS — According to the just released American Heart Association 2025 Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics report, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men in the United States.[1] That is why the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, and the National Football League Alumni Association (NFL Alumni) are teaming up for a men’s health campaign to boost heart health through promotion of the Association’s Life’s Essential 8™- the eight steps everyone should take to achieve ideal cardiovascular health[2].

 “As the nation’s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke for more than 100 years, we've been helping people reach their maximum potential to live longer, healthier lives,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer at the American Heart Association. “We are proud to work with the NFL Alumni Association as both organizations are working to meet people where they are to inspire them to champion their health.”

 The campaign was announced Thursday on Radio Row at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. Chaired by Ken Coffey, former NFL safety and NFL Alumni senior vice president and chief operating officer, the social media initiative focuses on improving those measures used to define optimum heart health by the American Heart Association known as Life’s Essential 8: four indicators related to cardiovascular and metabolic health status (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and body mass index); and 4 behavioral/lifestyle factors (smoking status, physical activity, sleep and diet). Recent studies have shown that adults who follow a heart-healthy lifestyle measured by Life’s Essential 8 tend to live longer lives free of chronic disease.

 The collaboration features eight NFL Alumni who highlight the pillars of Life’s Essential 8 to help both retired NFL players and the general public understand both the health risk factors as well as the opportunities for improvement. Ambassadors include retired NFL players, including leaders from NFL Alumni chapters across the United States. The campaign will include public service announcements (PSAs) and will focus primarily on two periods -- Men’s Health Week, June 10-16, and Hispanic Heritage Month, Sept. 15-Oct. 15.

 “As former athletes, we recognize the importance of being proactive about our health,” said Brad Edwards, former NFL All-Pro safety and chief executive officer of NFL Alumni. “We look forward to teaming up with the American Heart Association to promote the eight ‘essential’ steps that everyone should take to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.”

 About 1 in 5 people in the U.S. have optimal heart health according to the American Heart Association[3]. A free tool is available to help improve those numbers by empowering individuals to better understand their heart health score to more accurately understand their individual health. My Life Check™ is an assessment that is based in the science of Life’s Essential 8. The tool asks questions about health behaviors, factors and well-being to offer health insights. Participants are given a personal health score along with a custom plan with the eight specific steps to help them start living a healthier life. Supporting good heart and brain health helps to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke and other major health problems.
