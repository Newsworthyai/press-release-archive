Unaudited first quarter revenue represents nearly 400% growth in revenues from the same quarter last year

 First quarter revenues for 2025 exceed all of last year’s revenue of the Company, showcasing ability to grow business fundamentals while in conjunction with other value-added activities, such as stock repurchases and commencing dividend payments

 FISHERS, INDIANA - April 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to pre-announce the Company’s estimated first quarter 2025 (ending March 31, 2025) total revenues, interest income, and income from investment in the amount of approximately $973,000, a significant increase from the first quarter of 2024 where the same number was $197,721. This 392% increase in year-over-year revenues from Royalty Management reflects the Company’s continued growth in its investment income and returns from portfolio investments, including a meaningful increase in the revenue from the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RMC Enivronmental Services LLC, which recently expanded revenues through new contracting business.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Management, commented, “Our Company has been continuing its growth since going public in late 2023 through expansion of its current portfolio of investments in various resources, including deposits of rare earth elements, and new and synergistic investments in other projects that can yield royalty income to the company in the near and intermediate term. This growth in revenues in the first quarter of this year exhibits an attractive increase in returns and income from a number of our portfolio holdings, especially the addition of new environmental services contracts to our RMC Environmental Services LLC, which was previously announced on January 28, 2025. Our revenue expectations have been exceeded from that first announcement, with better returns for this investment than originally anticipated, with this first quarter revenue itself exceeds our total revenues for all of 2024, which was $964,703.”

 Tom continued, “We anticipate additional quarterly growth in our company throughout 2025, which has led to the board’s decision to institute a previously announced quarterly cash dividend for our shareholders, with the first payment to shareholders of record on June 30, 2025, in the amount of $0.025 per share. We look forward to working with our Board of Directors to expand payment of this dividend as our company continues its growth and seeks ways to increase value to its shareholders. The turmoil in the general markets has led to a very large amount of deal flow and opportunities to evaluate for additional growth.  Our goal is to be cautious, yet prepared, to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities to catapult the business forward should the right opportunity be presented.”
