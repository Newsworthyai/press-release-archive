 Proposed Sign for the Museum. (NewMediaWire) - April 14, 2025 - Glendale, CA â€“ The Martial Arts History Museum, a cornerstone of cultural preservation and community engagement, today announced the launch of a crowdfunding campaign to secure funding for the installation of new, prominent outdoor signage. The signage, slated for installation on Brand Boulevard in May, will enhance the museum's visibility and accessibility to the public. The museum seeks to raise $20,000 to cover the costs associated with permits, design, and installation.

 Entering its 26th year, the Martial Arts History Museum has established itself as a vital resource, not only for martial arts enthusiasts worldwide, but also as a haven for community outreach. The museum provides humanitarian efforts, including specialized tours and visitation for groups of individuals facing dementia, Alzheimer's, and mental disabilities, as well as offering free admission to children and adult groups with mental disabilities.

 "We believe it is crucial to be an integral part of our community," states Museum President Michael Matsuda. "By offering specialized tours and complimentary admission to those groups, we open doors and potentially unlock memories and experiences for individuals who may benefit from them. I recall a visitor with dementia who, upon seeing a photograph of his old instructor, was able to converse in detail about his past. When people discuss underserved populations, these are the individuals we are referring to. In our own modest way, we offer a beacon of hope."

 Michael Matsuda For over 15 years, the museum has provided specialized programs for the underserved, offering a supportive environment for individuals facing mental health challenges. This initiative provides a platform for expression and personal growth, demonstrating the museum's commitment to making a positive impact on lives.

 Beyond its role as a repository of martial arts history, the museum serves as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the arts and the sacrifices made by those who brought them to America. "The martial arts and the Asian American community deserve a place in history," adds Matsuda, "a place where their contributions are acknowledged and preserved for future generations."

 The museum's fundraising goal of $20,000 will address the substantial costs incurred for permits, design, and installation. "We faced significant bureaucratic hurdles, including the need for variances and additional permits," explains Matsuda. "Despite being a non-profit, we received no discounts. We are committed to bringing inspiration and hope to the city of Glendale. While we have not received any waivers, we are determined to move forward."

 The Martial Arts History Museum invites community members, martial arts enthusiasts, and supporters of cultural preservation to contribute to this important initiative. Donations can be made through https://www.facebook.com/donate/2474125976254861/
