 About Voyageur Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

 Voyageur, a Canadian public company trading under the symbol VM on the TSX Venture Exchange, is in development of barium and iodine Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) that offer high-performance and cost-effective imaging contrast agents. With a strategic focus on vertically integrating the barium and iodine contrast markets, Voyageur aims to become a key player by producing its own barium and iodine. In addition, Voyageur is pursuing the development of new endo fullerene drugs.

 Voyageur's business plan is set to generate cash flow to prove economics for the Frances Creek barium contrast project feasibility study, by working with established third-party good manufacturing process (GMP) pharmaceutical manufacturers in Canada thereby ensuring the validation of its products by regulatory agencies worldwide. As Voyageur solidifies its presence in the market, it plans to transition into a high-margin domestic manufacturer of radiology drugs.

 At the core of its operations, Voyageur owns a 100% interest in the Frances Creek Project. Currently, the world's pharmaceutical barium sulphate is almost entirely synthetically produced resulting in a less effective imaging quality product. Voyageur’s Frances Creek resource boasts a rare and exceptional grade mineral suitable for the pharmaceutical marketplace that Voyageur believes will replace the current synthetic products with higher quality imaging products.

 Voyageur's ambitious vision is to become the first vertically integrated company in the radiology contrast media drug market. By controlling all primary input costs, from the sourcing of raw materials to final production, Voyageur believes it can ensure quality and cost efficiency. With its approach, it embodies the motto of "From the Earth to the Bottle," highlighting Voyageur's commitment to responsible sourcing and manufacturing practices.
