# Worried About Being Priced Out Of Gold's Rally? Check Out These ETFs

By Kyle Anthony, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - October 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Unquestionably, gold has been a top-performing asset class in 2025, with price appreciation that has been truly historic. Recently, gold smashed past the $4,000 per ounce price level. This has many asking where the most compelling investment opportunities might be found to capitalize on the precious metal’s growth, and one avenue to look at would be gold miners.

 Gold: A Potential Haven In Times Of Uncertainty

 Much of the strong performance of gold throughout the year can be attributed to ongoing political uncertainty and U.S. dollar weakness, ultimately leading investors to seek a safe haven in gold or gold-related investments. Regarding the former, amid rising geopolitical risk from tariff threats and regional instability stemming from ongoing military activities, some believe the outlook for gold remains resoundingly strong in 2025. For many investors, this could mean an increased allocation toward gold as market uncertainty increases, especially as the dollar’s value has seen erosion.

 Furthermore, as noted by the World Gold Council, central banks added a net 19 trillion to global gold reserves in August 2025. The steady purchase of gold and other hard assets highlights investors' growing desire for safety and their efforts to hedge against the perceived sovereign risk of the U.S. at this time.

 Against this backdrop, gold miners represent an alternative to pure exposure to the commodities space; what's intriguing about the gold market is that the investment narrative extends beyond the metal's spot price, and some gold-related enterprises have witnessed a more than doubling in market value in 2025.

 Investing In Gold Miners With Sprott

 For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, one way is to invest in gold miners' equities, as the price of gold relates to gold mining stock prices, even though each business’s fundamentals influence its individual performance. For investors looking to gain exposure to gold miners, Sprott offers three ETFs: the Sprott Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: SGDM), the Sprott Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: SGDJ) and the recently launched Sprott Active Gold & Silver Miners ETF (NASDAQ: GBUG).

 The Sprott Gold Miners ETF seeks investment results that correspond to the performance of the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which aims to track the performance of larger gold companies listed on Canadian and major U.S. exchanges. Similarly, the Sprott Junior Gold Miners ETF will track the performance of the Solactive Junior Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which reflects the performance of small-capitalization gold companies whose stocks are listed on regulated exchanges. For those interested in accessing the insights of Sprott’s specialized portfolio management team, the Sprott Active Gold & Silver Miners ETF is the first active ETF focused on providing exposure to gold and silver miners.

 Time For A Closer Look At Gold Miners Through These ETFs?

 Gold mining stocks can serve as an effective way to diversify within an equity portfolio, especially during volatile market conditions. Historically, these stocks have been highly responsive to changes in gold prices, frequently outperforming the metal during prolonged bull markets but lagging during declines due to their leveraged nature. Sprott’s gold miners ETFs are pure-play instruments that allow investors to gain access to gold miners in a single-ticket wrapper.

 Gold and precious metals are referred to with terms of art like "store of value," "safe haven" and "safe asset." These terms should not be construed to guarantee any form of investment safety. While “safe” assets like gold, Treasuries, money market funds and cash generally do not carry a high risk of loss relative to other asset classes, any asset may lose value, which may involve the complete loss of invested principal.

 Diversification does not protect against loss.

 An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of each fund carefully before investing. To obtain a fund’s Prospectus, which contains this and other information, contact your financial professional, call 1.888.622.1813 or visit SprottETFs.com. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.

 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are considered to have continuous liquidity because they allow for an individual to trade throughout the day, which may indicate higher transaction costs and result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account.

 The Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index is rules-based, size-tilted index of large-cap North American gold mining companies that overweights firms with stronger revenue growth, higher free cash flow yield, and lower long-term debt-to-equity ratios. The Solactive Junior Gold Miners Custom Factors Index is a rules‑based index tracking small‑cap (“junior”) North American gold mining companies, emphasizing those with strong revenue growth among producers and high price momentum among exploration firms.

 One cannot invest directly in an index.

 The funds are non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of assets in securities of individual issuers, particularly those in the natural resources and/or precious metals industry, which may experience greater price volatility. Relative to other sectors, natural resources and precious metals investments have higher headline risk and are more sensitive to changes in economic data, political or regulatory events, and underlying commodity price fluctuations. Risks related to extraction, storage and liquidity should also be considered. For an actively managed fund, a fund adviser’s judgements about the growth, value or potential appreciation of an investment may prove to be incorrect or fail to have the intended results, which could adversely impact the fund’s performance.

 Shares are not individually redeemable. Investors buy and sell shares of the funds on a secondary market. Only “authorized participants” may trade directly with the fund, typically in blocks of 10,000 shares.

 The Sprott Active Gold & Silver Miners ETF is new and has a limited operating history.

 Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc. is the Investment Adviser to the Sprott ETFs. ALPS Distributors, Inc. is the Distributor for the Sprott ETFs and is a registered broker-dealer and FINRA Member. ALPS Distributors, Inc. is not affiliated with Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc.
