# Helix BioPharma Corp. Announces Fiscal 2025 Year-End Results

TORONTO, ONTARIO - October 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Helix BioPharma Corp. (TSX: “HBP”, OTC: “HBPCF”, FRANKFURT: “HBP0”) (“Helix” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage oncology company shaping a near future where today’s hard-to-treat cancers are vincible, today announced financial results for the 2025 fiscal year ended July 31, 2025.

 Overview

 The Company reported a net loss and total comprehensive loss of $5,205,000 for the year ended July 31, 2025, (July 31, 2024: $9,264,000) and a loss of $0.09 per common share (July 31, 2024: loss of $0.21 per common share.

 Clinical Development

 In the second half of 2024, the Company conducted an extensive review of its assets and forward strategy, that resulted in the following key decisions:

 * The Company decided to focus its resources on developing L-DOS47 as a combination therapy with PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, as first-line therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). This decision was the result of an extensive expert review of available pre-clinical and clinical data on L-DOS47, the significant unmet medical need in NSCLC despite the emergence of immunotherapy as the standard of care, and an assessment of where a pharmacological tumor alkalization therapy is most likely to deliver meaningful clinical impact in the near term, also keeping in mind the shortest time to FDA approval.
* On August 9, 2024 and August 13, 2024, the research collaborations with University of Tuebingen, Germany, and Peter Mac, Australia, respectively, were terminated. Projects with these institutions were outside the scope of the new focus on NSCLC.
* The Company resolved to close its laboratory in Edmonton Canada, which was closed on 31 October, 2024, with liquidation of laboratory equipment and safekeeping of documents, reagents, and lab samples with a third-party storage provider.
* The Company reviewed its CMC practices and entered discussions with several Contract Drug Manufacturing Organizations to optimize both resource expenditure as well as plan for manufacturing of the next batch of drug in advance.
* The Company’s Phase Ib/II combination trial in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LDOS006) evaluating the safety and tolerability of L-DOS47 in combination with doxorubicin was completed in October 2024. Data and sample analyses are ongoing with the Clinical Study Report (CSR) expected to be issued fall 2025.

 LDOS007 is a new Phase Ib/Randomized Phase II, open label study to assess L-DOS47 in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy in NSCLC, currently in the planning stage. The Company received positive and constructive feedback in writing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the study design of LDOS007 on August 8, 2025, ahead of a planned End-of-Phase I (EOP1) meeting that was scheduled with the FDA via videoconference on August 13, 2025. As the FDA indicated that the Company could proceed without the meeting if the written feedback was sufficiently clear, and given that no additional discussion was deemed necessary, the Company elected to forego the videoconference in favor of preparing the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) as the next step in its interactions with the Agency. The study design will include an initial dose escalation safety lead-in investigating low, medium and high L-DOS47 dose levels in combination with standard pembrolizumab, followed by a randomized Phase II arm to test two selected L-DOS47 dose levels in combination versus standard pembrolizumab alone.

 Corporate Development

 * On September 5, 2025, the Company announced it will not proceed with the previously announced equity draw-down subscription facility with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (together, “GEM”), given that the Company determined that the GEM facility no longer aligns with its capital strategy or its commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Since its inception, the Company has mainly relied on financing its operations from public and private sales of equity. The Company does not have any credit facilities and is therefore not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements or covenants. The Company manages its liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecasts and actual cash flow from operations and anticipated investment and financing activities.

 The Company reported a net loss and total comprehensive loss of $5,205,000 or $0.09 per common share for the year ended July 31, 2025, (July 31, 2024: $9,264,000 or $0.21 per common share). As of July 31, 2025, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $2,807,000, shareholders’ deficiency of $15,586,000 and an accumulated deficit of $215,876,000.

 On January 8, 2025, the Company closed its private placement financing for gross proceeds of $3,000,000 from the issuance of 4,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.75 per common share. In connection with the closing, the Company paid a cash fee of 10% of gross proceeds raised to an eligible finder.

 On April 21, 2025, the Company issued 125,000 common shares for the exercise of 125,000 stock options for cash proceeds of $113,000.

 On May 20, 2025, the Company closed the Laevoroc asset acquisition transactions, acquiring substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Laevoroc Immunology AG and Laevoroc Chemotherapy AG, in consideration for the issuance of 11,555,076 common shares at a fair value of $9,880,000, and 9,454,153 common shares at a fair value of $8,083,000, respectively.

 On August 16, 2024, the Company completed a one-for-five (1:5) consolidation of all of its issued and outstanding common shares, resulting in a reduction in the issued and outstanding shares from 245,107,749 to 49,021,536 common shares. Shares reserved under the Company’s equity and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the Consolidation. The Consolidation was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on January 18, 2024 and became effective on August 16, 2024. No fractional common shares are issued in connection with the Consolidation, which are, if any, deemed to have been tendered by its registered owner to the Company for cancellation for no consideration.

 As at July 31, 2025, the Company’s cash reserves of $65,000 are insufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months, nor are they sufficient to see the current research and development initiates through to completion. To the extent that the Company does not believe it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations, management considers securing additional funds primarily through equity arrangements to be of utmost importance.
