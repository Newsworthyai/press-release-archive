 Chinese Lion Dancing for the Grand Opening (NewMediaWire) - August 31, 2025 - Glendale, CA - If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind experience in the Los Angeles area, you have to check out the Martial Arts History Museum in Glendale, California. While Glendale is known for its incredible shopping and dining, including the famous Americana, this hidden gem is a unique find for those who dare to look beyond the typical tourist spots.

 Nestled on Brand Blvd., the museum is the only one of its kind in the entire world. It was designed by former Disney artist and publisher Michael Matsuda, giving the space a truly magical feel with a creative, engaging layout.

 Inside, you'll find an awesome collection of unique artifacts, including movie props, authentic Cobra Kai outfits, and even a section dedicated to animation. Matsuda, a renowned martial arts historian, guides you through a rich tapestry of art, culture, and tradition, showing how the martial arts have influenced and changed American history.

 As Matsuda puts it, the museum is "a maze of excitement." It features sections on martial arts from Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Thailand, and even Hawaii. There are also exhibits on iconic figures like Bruce Lee, women warriors, and the art of Lucha Libre. Even if you've never thrown a punch in your life, you'll be captivated by the stories and history on display.

 This small but mighty 8,000-square-foot museum is a must-see for anyone interested in martial arts, history, or simply discovering something new and extraordinary.
