# Splash Beverage Group Announces a 1-for-40 Reverse Stock Split

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - March 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) (“Splash” or the “Company”), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced a reverse stock split of its authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of one (1) share of common stock for every forty (40) shares of common stock, effective as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 27, 2025 (the “Effective Date”). The Company believes that its common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on March 28, 2025. The reverse stock split was authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 14, 2025.

 Pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada, the Company’s state of incorporation, the Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to effect a reverse stock split without stockholder approval if the number of authorized shares of common stock and the number of outstanding shares of common stock are proportionally reduced. The Company will file a certificate of change to its articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect the reverse stock split. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade on the NYSE American under the stock ticker “SBEV” but will trade under a new CUSIP number. The reverse stock split is being effected to ensure that the Company can meet the per share price requirements of the NYSE American, the Company’s current listing exchange.

 As a result of the reverse split, each forty (40) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one (1) new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding common shares will be reduced from 61,711,017 shares to approximately 1,542,776 shares without taking into account fractional shares. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 300 million shares to 7.5 million shares and the ownership percentage of each stockholder will remain unchanged other than as a result of the rounding of fractional shares.

 No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share because they hold a number of shares not evenly divisible by the 1 (one) for forty (40) reverse split ratio, will automatically be entitled to receive an additional fractional share of the Company’s common stock to round up to the next whole share.

 In addition, the Reverse Stock Split will apply to the Company’s common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding warrants and stock options, with proportionate adjustments to be made to the exercise prices thereof and under the Company’s equity incentive plans, as applicable. Accordingly, each publicly traded warrant (SBEV-WT) will become exercisable into 1/40th of a share of common stock at an increased exercise price of $184.00.

 The Company’s transfer agent, VStock Transfer LLC, will act as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding their shares in book-entry form or in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other nominee will not need to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split.
