# Giant Mining Corp. Finalizes and Outlines Drill Targets for Core Drill Program to Commence Next Week at Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project, Nevada

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that the company has finalized its drill targets for the 2025 Drill program commencing next week at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit (“Majuba Hill”) located in Pershing County, Nevada.

 The 2025 Core Program is designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings. The primary goal of the drilling is to extend known copper mineralization in order that the company may work towards a Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 Exploration Technologies (“ExploreTech”) was engaged by Giant Mining to apply its Engine AI (artificial intelligence) and cloud computing platform to evaluate the planned core program and generate additional targets by focusing on the breccias and large, low-resistivity anomalies. The collaborative effort by the Giant Mining team and ExploreTech utilized the Companies extensive geophysical and drilling database.

 "Gold has now surpassed USD $3,000 per ounce and Copper has just hit a 2025 high of USD $4.93 per lb under threat of Tariffs and looming copper shortfalls. We are approximately one week away from 2025’s maiden drill program and have now finalized our targets for the program," said David Greenway, chief executive officer of Giant Mining. "The company is fully funded for an active year of exploration and development drilling to add to the over 100 drill holes and over 80,000 feet of past drilling at Majuba Hill in order to work towards a NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for the project.”

 The 2025 Drill Program is planned for 4,400 feet (1,340 meters) of core drilling. A minimum of 2,600 feet (792 meters) will be completed and the contract does not have a maximum drilling requirement, allowing for flexibility in the execution of the project. Planned drill holes (“PDH”) are shown on Figure 1 and Table 1.  Four of the planned drill holes are follow-up and extension holes to the 2024 drilling. A fifth hole has been added to the program to drill test the high-potential Southern Resistivity Anomaly generated by the ExploreTech AI program.

 Some of Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:                     Nevada – The #1 mining jurisdiction on the planet according to the Fraser Institute

 Project Size:                9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:            The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects.

 History:                       Historical Producer

 Drilling:                     83,930  feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization:           The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:            The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:           Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign

 About Giant Mining Corp.

 Giant Mining Corp. is focused on identifying, acquiring, and advancing late-stage copper and copper/silver/gold projects to meet the growing global demand for critical metals. This demand is driven by initiatives like the Green New Deal in the United States and similar climate-focused programs worldwide, which require substantial amounts of copper, silver, and gold for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and the modernization of clean and affordable energy systems.

 The Company’s flagship asset is the Majuba Hill Copper, Silver, and Gold District, located 156 miles (251 km) from Reno, Nevada. Majuba Hill is situated in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations and has the potential to become one of the next major copper deposits, critical for meeting the increasing need for this red metal.
