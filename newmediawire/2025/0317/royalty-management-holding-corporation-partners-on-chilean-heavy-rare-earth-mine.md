# Royalty Management Holding Corporation Partners on Chilean Heavy Rare Earth Mine

Company acquires equity option in NeoRe SpA, the entity that holds the mineral rights to the La Marigen ionic REE clay project, containing rare earth elements Terbium, Dysprosium, Praseodymium, and Neodymium, among others

 Option allows Royalty Management to participate in the growth of NeoRe through equity participation

 FISHERS, INDIANA - March 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce that it has partnered with NeoRe, SpA on the development and commercialization of their Chilean rare earth mine. The partnership is initially in the form of an option for Royalty Management to acquire an equity ownership position in the operations of the mine at a set valuation, giving the Company meaningful upside exposure to valuable resources at NeoRe’s La Marigen project, which is located along the coastal belt of Chile and adjacent to other valuable regional rare earth deposits, such as Aclara Resources’ Penco rare earth project.

 NeoRe’s La Marigen Project consists of five license areas within ionic adsorption clay deposits that contain meaningful amounts of valuable rare earth elements. It also comprises 74 exploration applications and four granted exploration concessions covering over 56,300 acres of mining rights, located 50 miles north of Chile’s second largest city, Concepciòn, a major industrial city with multiple ship loading terminals. The management and operational team at NeoRe has over a decade of experience with the successful evaluation, definition and development of ionic adsorption clay deposits with strong in-country technical relationships and have been conducting surface exploration and test work across the La Marigen region for the past three years.  While currently under permitting and development, NeoRe is looking to accelerate the commercialization of La Marigen Project through a combination of private sector investment, such as that from Royalty Management, and governmental support.  NeoRe has also recently signed a letter of intent with ReElement Technologies Corporation to incorporate localized processing and refining into La Marigen project, thereby providing unique commercialization opportunities and enhanced viability for the project as compared to other regional deposits of similar nature.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “After careful due diligence and verification of the deposit’s resources and its composition, we are very excited about partnering with the team at NeoRe to help develop and commercialize their La Marigen project. Initial analysis has shown meaningful amounts of valuable rare earth elements present at this project, including significant presence of heavy rare earth minerals, such as Terbium and Dysprosium, which are in high demand and not seen in commercially meaningful quantities in a lot of rare earth deposits. Along with our investments in other resources and mines, such as our Ferrox investment in the Limpopo Province of South Africa and our TR Mining & Equipment investment in Jamaica, we are continuing to position the Royalty Management to be a diversified leader in access to rare earth, critical mineral, and specialty metal resources that go into a variety of critical application, from both a commercial and defense perspective.  As 2025 continues, we look forward to updating our shareholders as we continue our investment into this key sector for Royalty Management.”

 The demand for heavy rare earth elements (or “HREE” as it is sometimes referred to) like Dysprosium and Terbium are soaring, driven by the growth of the electrified economy such as artificial intelligent (AI) data centers, electrified mobility, and defense applications, with expectations of a significant increase in demand over the next few decades

 A more detailed look at the demand for heavy rare earths and why the demand is rising include:

 * Renewable Energy: The global shift towards renewable energy sources, especially wind power and electric vehicles (EVs), is a major driver of the increasing demand for rare earth elements.
* Permanent Magnets: Heavy rare earths are crucial components in the production of permanent magnets, which are essential for electric motors in data center cooling devices, power tools, EVs, wind turbines and defense applications.
* Other Applications: Rare earths are also used in consumer electronics, medical equipment, and many defense applications.
* Geopolitical Factors: China's dominance in rare earth production and processing, along with geopolitical tensions, have highlighted the need for diversified supply chains and increased domestic production in countries like the United States.
* Significant Growth Trend: The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that demand for rare earth elements could increase three to seven times by 2040, and the United States demand for rare earth magnets is expected to more than quadruple by 2050. According to another study by Future Market Insights, the global rare earth metals market is projected to grow from $6.2 billion in 2024 to $16.1 billion by 2034, underpinning the importance of these elements.

 China currently dominates the production and processing of rare earth elements, creating a vulnerability in the global supply chain and prompting efforts to diversify sources and increase domestic production, such as the processing and refining capabilities of United States-based ReElement Technologies Corporation (www.reelementtech.com).
