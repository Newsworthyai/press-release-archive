# Eating healthy doesn t have to break the bank

(NewMediaWire) - March 17, 2025 - DALLAS — Rising food costs can make healthy eating a challenge for many families. A June 2024 public opinion poll from the American Heart Association and Research found about 60% of Americans cite the cost of healthy food as their single biggest barrier to achieving better nutrition. The American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, has some simple tips and delicious recipes to help you enjoy your favorite meals while keeping both your heart and wallet happy.

 "Food is deeply rooted to family and community. Recipes are passed down through generations, but as grocery prices rise, finding creative ways to stretch your budget while maintaining a nutritious diet is key,” said Arlen Vanessa Marin, M.S., R.D., a registered dietitian and national volunteer for the American Heart Association. “Simple swaps—like homemade vinaigrette instead of sugary bottled dressings, frozen veggies instead of fresh or lentils instead of processed meat—can make a big difference without sacrificing flavor.”

 Protein without the price tag

 Looking to add more protein without overspending? Try these affordable, nutrient-packed options:

 * Beans and other legumes are a protein-packed, high-fiber choice for heart-healthy meals. Add them to soups, stews, salads or enjoy them as a dip with whole-grain crackers or tortillas. Choose canned, no-salt-added varieties for a quick and healthy option.
* Tofu & tempeh are plant-based staples rich in protein, versatile and often more affordable than meat.
* Add silken tofu to a simple miso soup or stir-fry firm tofu with garlic for a heart-smart meal or add tempeh to noodle dishes and curries. Here are some recipes for quick heart-smart meals: Asian marinated vegetable salad and Curry-spiced tofu with Asian vegetables
* Ground turkey or chicken are leaner, often more affordable alternatives to ground beef but just as delicious. Try them in dishes like turkey picadillo or homemade tacos for a budget-friendly twist.

 Better grains for your heart

 White rice is a staple in many diets, but it can spike blood sugar and when refrigerated and reheated, it can increase resistant starch while also raising the risk of harmful bacteria—Here are safer ways to keep it heart-smart:

 * Brown rice is a fiber-rich alternative to white rice that pairs well with any dish.
* Quinoa is another protein-rich grain that’s great in soups, salads and side dishes.
* Barley is used in many Asian soups and is a great whole-grain swap that supports heart health.

 Canned, dried and frozen? Absolutely!

 Healthy eating doesn’t mean you have to buy everything fresh, especially when fresh food isn’t readily available. Canned, dried and frozen foods can be just as nutritious and helps eliminate costly food waste from spoilage as it stays edible longer. The American Heart Association recommends checking nutrition labels for low-sodium, no-salt-added and no-sugar-added options.

 * Frozen fruits and vegetables: These are picked at peak ripeness and frozen to lock in nutrients. Use them in stir-fries, soups, smoothies or as a quick side dish.
* Canned tuna are packed with omega-3s, wallet-friendly and easy to mix with salads, sandwiches or in brown rice bowls.

 Love avocados? Simple tips to make this healthy fat last

 * Buy them green & store them smart by keeping them on the counter until they start to soften, then refrigerate to slow ripening.
* Freeze for later by mashing ripe avocados with lime juice and freeze in an airtight container.
* Use what you need and if using only half, leave the pit in the unused portion, wrap tightly and store it in the fridge.

 “I never thought making small changes could make such a big difference,” said Claudia Montano, a Mexican American stroke survivor and national volunteer for the American Heart Association who had a stroke while at work. “But after shifting to a heart-healthy diet, my recovery improved, my energy came back and I felt like myself again — without giving up flavors I love.”
