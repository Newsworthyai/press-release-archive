# Green Monke Welcomes Veteran Cannabis Executive David Paterson

Former Canopy Growth President to Guide U.S. Expansion and International Opportunities Amid Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity

 SACRAMENTO, CA - October 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Green Monke (“Green Monke”), an award-winning hemp-D9 THC beverage brand, has appointed David Paterson, former President at Canopy Growth Canada, as Special Advisor to the Board. Green Monke is at a tipping point in the development of its business as it continues to have major success and significant growth in its U.S. and Canadian markets with new product launches, growing retail success, and an ever-expanding distribution map. For Green Monke, Paterson’s appointment levels-up its executive team, particularly with his commercial expertise and industry renown.

 A Proven Leader in Cannabis and Consumer Goods

 Paterson joins Green Monke with more than 15 years of experience spanning the cannabis, beverage, and consumer packaged goods industries. Most recently, Paterson was President of Canopy Growth Canada, where he oversaw commercial, operational, and go-to-market activities across Canopy’s recreational and medical brands. He previously served as Chief Commercial Officer at Indiva and VP Consumer Sales & Trade Marketing at Aurora Cannabis. Earlier in his career held leadership roles at The Beer Store, TravelBrands Inc., and Major League Baseball Canada.

 With over 15 years of experience in product development, marketing, and corporate strategy, Paterson has a proven record of building commercial capabilities, launching successful brands, and driving growth across all industries.

 “We are delighted to welcome David as Special Advisor at such an exciting moment for both Green Monke and the overall hemp THC beverage category,” commented Pat Gleeson, CEO of Green Monke. “His expertise in scaling cannabis brands and his vision for the hemp THC category will be invaluable as we continue to expand across the U.S. and prepare for a future shaped by federal legalization.”

 Unlocking Growth in Hemp THC Beverages

 Paterson’s appointment underscores Green Monke’s confidence in the hemp THC beverage sector. The category is rapidly gaining traction with consumers seeking flavorful, better-for-you alternatives to alcohol - an opportunity Paterson sees as transformative.

 “What drew me to Green Monke is how far ahead they are of the curve,” said Paterson. “The products taste exceptional, the branding stands out on shelves, and the company has already proven it can win in retail. The next step is scaling that success - expanding into new channels, deepening relationships with national distributors, and building the foundation for international markets as regulations evolve.”

 Continuing Great Momentum in the U.S. and Abroad

 Paterson joins Green Monke at a time of strong forward momentum:

 * The company recently expanded its Green Monke Happy Soda portfolio to six SKUs with the launch of Orange Cream and Lychee.
* Continued retail success across convenience and grocery channels nationwide.
* The impending launch of Green Monke Drinks in both a nationwide convenience store chain and a leading grocery chain.
* Expanding into additional iconic entertainment venues across the U.S.

 “For retail alcohol distributors and on-premise venues alike, hemp beverages represent a complementary offering, giving customers new reasons to return, stay longer, and spend more without the downsides of alcohol,” added Paterson.

 Green Monke’s disciplined approach to quality and compliance has helped establish its leadership in the hemp beverage market. Paterson’s experience operating within tightly regulated frameworks - including his tenure at Canopy Growth - reinforces that foundation.

 He will also play a key role in advancing Green Monke’s international expansion, supporting the brand’s existing FSA authorization in the U.K. and pending approvals across Europe. This regulatory groundwork positions Green Monke for long-term growth while ensuring every product meets the highest standards of consistency, safety, and consumer trust.

 “David brings not only expertise but also a global perspective,” said Gleeson. “His background in regulated markets will help Green Monke navigate new territories confidently while maintaining our commitment to excellence from product formulation to shelf experience.”
