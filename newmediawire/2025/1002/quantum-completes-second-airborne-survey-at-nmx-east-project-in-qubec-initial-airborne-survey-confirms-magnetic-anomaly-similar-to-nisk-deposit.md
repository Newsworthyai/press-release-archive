# Quantum Completes Second Airborne Survey at NMX East Project in Qubec - Initial Airborne Survey Confirms Magnetic Anomaly Similar to Nisk Deposit

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLOMBIA - October 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantum Critical Metals Corp. (TSX.V: LEAP) (OTCQB: ATOXF) (FSE: 86A1) ("Quantum" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that, further to the news of September 22nd, 2025 the Company has successfully completed a MAG-TDEM (magnetic-time domain electromagnetic) airborne survey on its wholly owned NMX East Property in Northern Quebec.

 During September, Quantum completed two airborne surveys at NMX East:

 1. an electromagnetic (“EM”) very low frequency electromagnetic (“VLF”) and magnetic geophysical survey to validate historical government data and enhance geological targeting; followed by

 2. a MAG-TDEM airborne survey to obtain additional high-resolution data to allow a better definition of EM anomalies for improved design of drill targets aimed at Ni-PGE mineralization, similar to that of neighbouring Power Metallic Mines.

 The magnetic anomaly from the first airborne survey prompted Quantum to undergo an immediate follow up investigation, requiring a second airborne survey. The second TDEM system survey detected good quality bedrock conductors at greater depth than was previously possible with the VLF-EM technology.

 Nickel and PGE are commonly searched for with airborne and magnetic surveys to help locate the rock types of interest (Vallee et al. 2024). The NMX East Property is located in a James Bay region of Quebec which has a known source of lithium, nickel and platinum group elements (“PGE”).

 The map below was generated during the first round of geophysics and confirms a magnetic anomaly on Quantum’s NMX East Property which is similar in amplitude, strike, shape and size, to the anomaly found at the Nisk deposit (Figure 1), based on public results from another MAG-TDEM survey performed over Nisk (Dube, 2023).

 Next Steps: Drill Permits

 Quantum is in the midst of planning detailed drill targets for the NMX East and intends to apply for drill permits in the upcoming weeks.

 CEO Marcy Kiesman stated:

 "It is encouraging for shareholders that a magnetic anomaly on the NMX East Property is similar in amplitude, strike, shape and size to the anomaly found at the neighbouring Nisk deposit. With the significant amount of activity undertaken in the surrounding James Bay area this season, we look forward to continuing to provide our shareholders with further updates in the weeks and months to come.”
