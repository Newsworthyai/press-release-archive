# Axim Biotechnologies Files Pre-Submission With FDA for CLIA Waiver Pathway on Lactoferrin Point-of-Care Diagnostic Test

SAN DIEGO, CA - June 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Axim Biotechnologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AXIM), a leading developer of rapid diagnostic testing for ocular and systemic conditions, today announced that it has filed a Pre-Submission (Pre-Sub Q) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first formal step in seeking a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver for its rapid, point-of-care Lactoferrin diagnostic test (TearScan Lf).

 Axim’s TearScan Lf is the first and only FDA 510 (k)-cleared point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test specifically intended to support the diagnosis of Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye Disease (ADDE). Lactoferrin tear levels are a convenient POC diagnostic that aids in determining the viability of the lacrimal gland. Lactoferrin levels are reduced in 80% of patients with ADDE. By distinguishing ADDE from other forms of Dry Eye Disease, the test helps avoid trial-and-error use of therapies that are ineffective for tear deficiency. Additionally, because Lactoferrin levels reflect lacrimal gland function, repeated testing allows the physician to monitor response to treatment and disease progression over time.

 The Pre-Sub Q process allows device developers to engage early with the FDA to receive feedback, clarify regulatory expectations, and minimize risks of delays during the formal waiver application. FDA feedback is anticipated within 60 days. Upon FDA feedback, the company plans to conduct a comparative clinical study to support its CLIA Waiver Application, which is expected to be submitted later this year. The FDA typically completes review of CLIA Waiver Applications within 90 days.

 Currently, facilities must obtain CLIA certification and adhere to laboratory protocols in order to administer Axim’s Lactoferrin test. A CLIA waiver would eliminate the certification requirement and enable administration of the point-of-care Lactoferrin test by ophthalmologists and optometrists in non-laboratory settings thereby allowing for far broader clinical use and accelerating commercial adoption.

 “The Company’s Pre-Sub Q submission marks a significant milestone in its strategy to broaden access to its tests by obtaining a CLIA waiver. We are committed to making it easier for eye care providers to integrate our tests into their practices without complex lab infrastructure,” said Catalina Valencia, CEO of Axim Biotechnologies. “Today’s submission is the first step in that process, and we believe it will open the door to widespread use of our Lactoferrin test - and soon after, our IgE test - in primary eye care and beyond. We believe that securing CLIA waivers for our Lactoferrin and IgE tests will be transformative, unlocking significant commercial opportunities in the U.S. market and enabling earlier, more accessible diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease, including ADDE and ocular allergy. As a CLIA waived, semi‑quantitative, point-of-care biomarker test, TearScan Lf would be well-positioned to capture market share in the diagnostic device segment for Dry Eye.”

 Forward-Looking Statements

 The statements made by Axim Biotechnologies Inc., in this press release may be “forward-looking” in nature within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements describe Axim’s future plans, projections, strategies and expectations, and are based on assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Axim Biotechnologies, Inc. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to there being no assurance that our diagnostic candidate will ever be approved for use by the U.S. FDA or any equivalent foreign regulatory agency. Further, Axim’s eye care diagnostic products that are FDA cleared may not be manufactured in large enough quantities or that third parties with established eye care physicians will enter into agreements or purchase from the Company, and even if the Company’s diagnostic candidates are successful, they may generate only limited revenue and profits for the Company. Various other factors are detailed from time to time in Axim’s Reports filed on OTCMarkets.com
