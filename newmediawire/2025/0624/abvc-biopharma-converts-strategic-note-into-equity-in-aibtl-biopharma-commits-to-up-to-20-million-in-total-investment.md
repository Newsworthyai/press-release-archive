# ABVC BioPharma Converts Strategic Note Into Equity in AiBtl BioPharma; Commits to Up to $20 Million in Total Investment

SILICON VALLEY, CA - June 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, announced today that it has converted its initial $100,000 convertible note into 10,000 shares of common stock of AiBtl BioPharma Inc. at a conversion price of $10 per share.

 The conversion price is supported by an independent third-party valuation report, which estimated the current fair value of AiBtl’s equity. In addition, ABVC disclosed its intention to invest up to $20 million in AiBtl over time, further reinforcing its role as a lead strategic investor.

 ABVC expects that AiBtl will utilize the additional funds to fulfill its licensing obligations and collaborate with global pharma partners to accelerate Phase III development. ABVC will continue executing its capital-light strategy by investing in innovative partners through a combined licensing and equity model.

 AiBtl currently holds exclusive global development and commercialization rights to ABVC’s two CNS drug candidates, ABV-1504 and ABV-1505, under a previously announced licensing agreement. The agreement includes equity, milestone payments and royalties, with each of ABVC and its subsidiary BioLite entitled to receive up to 23 million shares of AiBtl common stock (totaling 46 million shares), up to $7 million in cash milestone payments, and future sales-based royalties, if achieved.

 “As both the licensing partner and anchor investor, ABVC is committed to AiBtl’s success,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC Chief Executive Officer. “This investment strengthens AiBtl’s ability to advance its pipeline, while also positioning ABVC to benefit from future milestone and royalty revenues.”
