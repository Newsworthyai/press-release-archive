# NeuralBase Confirms Participation in Middle East Enterprise AI Conference, Submits Name Change to FINRA

LAS VEGAS, NV - August 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and recognized as a fast-growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced two strategic corporate updates: the formal submission of its name change request to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to become BMP AI Technologies Limited, and its participation in the upcoming Middle East Enterprise AI & Analytics Summit 2025 on August 28 in Dubai, UAE.

 As part of its coordinated rebranding process, the Company will complete the Nevada Certificate of Amendment only after receiving initial confirmation from FINRA that it has no objection to the name change. This sequencing is designed to maintain full regulatory compliance, minimize unnecessary costs, and ensure a smooth and orderly transition for shareholders and the marketplace. Upon receiving FINRA’s confirmation, the Company will promptly file the Nevada amendment and provide public notice of the effective date and any related ticker symbol updates.

 The BMP AI brand underscores the Company’s commitment to secure, scalable, and explainable AI solutions that meet the complex needs of sectors such as finance, healthcare, legal, and government. Participation in the Dubai-based summit provides NeuralBase with a high-visibility platform to engage enterprise leaders, policymakers, and AI innovators across the Middle East. The event marks an important step in expanding BMP AI’s global footprint, particularly in fast-emerging markets, and aligns with the Company’s goal of accelerating adoption of enterprise-ready AI solutions.

 While not a formal sponsor or speaker, NeuralBase plans to leverage its attendance to build strategic alliances, explore regional collaboration, and showcase the BMP AI platform’s advanced capabilities - including secure, explainable, and document-grounded AI systems optimized for regulated environments. This follows the Company’s previously announced plans to participate in The AI Conference 2025 in San Francisco and underscores NeuralBase’s multi-market strategy to engage with enterprise AI leaders across North America, the Middle East, and beyond.

 “Filing with FINRA is more than a procedural step, it is a statement of intent,” said Vighnesh Dobale, CEO of NeuralBase AI Ltd. “The BMP AI Technologies name captures our identity as a next-generation AI company, while our participation in the Middle East Enterprise AI & Analytics Summit provides a unique opportunity to engage directly with the partners, clients, and innovators shaping the future of enterprise AI.”

 The Company’s flagship BMP AI platform is currently in beta testing with select enterprise clients and incorporates advanced capabilities in workflow automation, contextual understanding, and AI-powered decision support. The platform is designed to operate within strict compliance frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2, making it uniquely suited for high-trust environments.

 The Company will provide a follow-up announcement upon FINRA’s approval of the name change, including the effective date and any associated ticker symbol change.
