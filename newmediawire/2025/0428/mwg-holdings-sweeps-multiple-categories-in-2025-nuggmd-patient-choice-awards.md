# MWG Holdings Sweeps Multiple Categories in 2025 NuggMD Patient Choice Awards

Perfect Union Northside Dispensary Earns Top Honors for Customer Experience; 5G Pop Recognized as Best Cannabis Beverage

 SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today that it earned top honors across multiple categories in the 2025 NuggMD Patient Choice Awards. MWG’s Perfect Union Northside cannabis retail store earned Gold recognition in four Northern California retail categories. The Company’s cannabis beverage, 5G Pop, was also voted Best Beverage by California consumers.

 The NuggMD Patient Choice Awards amplify the voices of cannabis consumers by allowing patients and recreational users nationwide to vote for their favorite dispensaries, brands, and products. MWG’s wins reflect the Company’s commitment to delivering high-quality products, exceptional customer service, and accessible pricing to California consumers.

 In Northern California, Perfect Union Northside earned Gold honors in four key categories:• Best Overall Dispensary• Best Prices• Best Selection• Best Budtenders

 “These honors mark a continued wave of momentum for MWG Holdings in 2025, as the Company expands its award-winning product portfolio and deepens its roots in California communities,” said Tom Sheridan, CEO of MWG Holdings. “With a focus on quality, consistency, and customer connection, MWG remains committed to setting the standard for cannabis retail and product excellence.”

 These awards underscore Perfect Union’s reputation for delivering top-tier customer service, competitive pricing, and a carefully curated menu that meets the evolving needs of California’s cannabis consumers.

 Perfect Union’s Northside location serves as the company’s flagship store in Sacramento. Many of MWG Holdings’ top leaders today are the very same individuals who opened this location 14 years ago – checking in customers at the front door, budtending, filling deli jars, purchasing products for the shelves, and sweeping the floors at closing time. This “ground-up” approach has shaped a customer-first culture that remains at the core of every Perfect Union dispensary.

 The Northside store continues to demonstrate strong performance, reporting a year-over-year sales increase for March 2025 and an average 30% growth in guest count over the past year.

 MWG’s cannabis beverage brand, 5G Pop, was awarded Gold in the Best Beverage category. Known for its bold flavors, fast onset, and consistent dosing, 5G Pop continues to raise the bar for cannabis beverages in California. The product is available in three mouth-watering flavors: Orange, Zero Sugar Root Beer, and Berry Lemonade, and remains a top seller across MWG’s retail locations.

 “This recognition is especially meaningful because it comes from the cannabis community itself,” said Nicole Hanratty, VP of Marketing at MWG Holdings. “Our teams are passionate about creating experiences and products that make a difference, and it’s exciting to see that dedication resonate with consumers.”
