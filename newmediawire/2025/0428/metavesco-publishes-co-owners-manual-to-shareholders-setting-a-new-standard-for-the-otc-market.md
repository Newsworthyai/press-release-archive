# Metavesco Publishes Co-Owners Manual to Shareholders, Setting a New Standard for the OTC Market

CUMMING, GA - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC PINK: MVCO) ("Metavesco" or the "Company"), a trailblazing holding company, today announced the publication of its Co-Owner’s Manual - a document outlining the company’s long-term operating principles, capital philosophy, and commitment to building shareholder value in the OTC marketplace.

 The Co-Owner’s Manual was developed as a blueprint for transparency and accountability, directly addressing the concerns many investors face when evaluating OTC companies. Inspired by Warren Buffett’s approach to shareholder communication, the Metavesco Co-Owner’s Manual sets forth the company's clear commitment to responsible capital deployment, prudent operational management, and long-term value creation.

 “Metavesco stands firmly committed to operating with full transparency, discipline, and integrity,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “We believe the OTC can be a thriving ecosystem for real business building. Our Co-Owner’s Manual details exactly how we operate, how we allocate capital, and how we intend to build Metavesco into a model for what’s possible on the OTC.”

 Highlights from the Co-Owner’s Manual include:

 * A long-term, startup-style growth strategy focused on exponential revenue generation.
* A disciplined, high-impact capital allocation framework, emphasizing cash flow generation and scalability.
* A commitment to maintaining a Bitcoin-denominated treasury strategy as a core element of long-term balance sheet strength.
* A firm stance against the uncontrolled dilution-driven practices that often plague the OTC landscape.
* A decentralized, operator-driven business model designed to scale efficiently while empowering leadership within each business segment.

 The publication of the Co-Owner’s Manual underscores Metavesco’s belief that success in the OTC markets requires more than financial engineering - it requires real operational excellence, transparency, constant open communication, and long-term thinking.
