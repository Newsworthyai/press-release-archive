# Quantumzyme Highlights Benefits and Commercialization Opportunities of Pending Breakthrough Green Chemistry Patent

SAN DIEGO, CA - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantumzyme Corp. (OTC: QTZM), a biotechnology company leveraging computational enzyme engineering, is pleased to announce the key benefits and commercialization avenues of its soon to be published patented enzymatic process for sustainable ibuprofen production. This innovation not only strengthens Quantumzyme’s leadership in green chemistry but also positions the company to capitalize on the global shift toward cleaner, more efficient manufacturing technologies.

 The process utilizes a specially engineered enzyme to streamline ibuprofen production, significantly reducing the use of harsh chemicals, solvents, and energy. By replacing traditional multi-step chemical synthesis with a selective biocatalytic transformation, Quantumzyme’s method offers both environmental and economic advantages.

 Key Benefits of the Breakthrough Process:

 * Environmental Sustainability
* Reduces hazardous waste and solvent usage, in line with global green chemistry principles.
* Lowers the carbon footprint of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturing.
* Production Efficiency and Cost Savings:
* Simplifies manufacturing by cutting down on reaction steps and improving yields.
* Decreases raw material and operational costs for pharmaceutical companies.
* Strategic Intellectual Property Strength.
* Secures a competitive position in the sustainable API sector and opens new licensing opportunities.

 Quantumzyme plans to offer this soon to be patented process across multiple channels:

 * Licensing to major pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking to green their supply chains.
* Direct partnerships for co-development of green production lines.
* Expansion into broader non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) manufacturing, leveraging the platform’s modular adaptability to related compounds.

 “Our enzymatic ibuprofen process exemplifies how cutting-edge science can address real-world industrial challenges,” stated Naveen Kulkarni, CEO of Quantumzyme. “Through strategic commercialization, we aim to help manufacturers achieve regulatory compliance, meet ESG goals, and reduce costs - all while making chemistry greener.”

 This breakthrough directly resonates with the scientific momentum sparked by the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded for advancements in computational enzyme design and protein structure prediction. Like Nobel laureates David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper, Quantumzyme leverages artificial intelligence and protein engineering to revolutionize industrial chemistry - delivering sustainable, scalable solutions for the pharmaceutical sector.

 By combining green chemistry, computational design, and strategic commercialization, Quantumzyme’s goal is to set new standards for the future of sustainable pharmaceutical production.
