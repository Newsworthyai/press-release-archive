KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE)  Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (NASDAQ:LEXX)(NASDAQ:LEXXW) (the "Company" or "Lexaria"), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering with a single institutional investor for the purchase and sale of 2,000,000 shares of common stock  (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (or per pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof). Other than the pre-funded warrants, no other warrants were issued to the institutional investor in the registered direct offering.

 “We are pleased to have raised funds in what is an extremely difficult market,” stated Richard Christopher, CEO of Lexaria. “Despite the related market challenges, we were able to successfully complete a transaction, during a particularly uncertain market period, which consciously minimized the dilutive impact on our existing shareholders by avoiding the issuance of any new warrants in the deal, other than the pre-funded warrants."

 The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were $2.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
