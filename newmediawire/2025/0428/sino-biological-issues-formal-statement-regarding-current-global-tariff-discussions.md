 WAYNE, PENNSYLVANIA - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sino Biological, Inc., a biotechnology company listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange subsidiary ChiNext (SZSE: 301047) specializing in biological research reagents and related technical contract research services, has issued the following statement in reference to global trade discussions and the potential impact tariffs may have on the supply of company products and services:

 Dear Colleagues, Partners, Clients and Shareholders:

 In light of the ongoing trade discussions among the major economies, we here at Sino Biological want to take a moment to reaffirm our full commitment to uninterrupted service and supply.

 While Sino Biological maintains substantial operations in China, we have proactively invested in a robust North American infrastructure. These efforts have ensured business continuity without the need for broad price adjustments.

 Key actions we’ve taken include:

 * Launched the Center for Bioprocessing (C4B) in Houston, Texas in Nov 2023, which produces catalog products and delivers CRO services;
* Acquired SignalChem Biotech (SCB) in Vancouver, Canada, in May 2024, expanding our local manufacturing and service capacity;
* Stocked over 90% of our catalog inventory at our Wayne, Pennsylvania warehouse to support long-term supply assurance.

 These measures have positioned us to continue meeting your product and service needs without disruption. We encourage you to explore using our C4B (Houston, U.S.) and SCB (Vancouver, Canada) production sites for strategic sourcing and CRO partnerships.

 Thank you for your continued trust. We look forward to supporting your research with the same quality and consistency you’ve come to expect from Sino Biological.

 Regards,

 Rob Burgess

 Chief Business Officer
