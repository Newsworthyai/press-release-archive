# BNDS ETF Aims To Offer High Yield In Low-Rate Era

By JE Insights, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Throughout the post-pandemic recovery phase, worsening inflation represented one of the main impediments, thereby inspiring the Federal Reserve to implement a hawkish monetary policy. At the same time, an overly tight framework can lead to economic deceleration due to the increased cost of borrowing money. With the latest report on inflation showing a cooler-than-expected print, the Fed is now considering easing its monetary policy.

 Based on trading activity on Fed funds futures, the market expects at least three rate cuts this year. To be fair, such a dovish shift may require the economy to slow down before policymakers feel comfortable pulling the trigger. Notably, the current geopolitical environment - especially as it relates to trade wars - heightens the risk of a deceleration in growth.

 This circumstance then raises the question: where will investors find high yield without overreaching on risk? Boutique financial specialist Infrastructure Capital Advisors, LLC - commonly known as Infrastructure Capital - seeks to answer this inquiry with its product, Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF (ARCA: BNDS).

 An exchange-traded fund, BNDS presents a flexible, actively managed approach to income in this complex and evolving economic landscape. Unlike a typical bond fund, Infrastructure Capital Bond is designed to adapt across multiple credit cycles. At the same time, it aims to consistently deliver high yields through a mix of corporate bonds and options income strategies.

 Rising Above The Broken Math Of Traditional Bonds

 A sensible investment strategy could involve a diversified mix of capital gains potential and robust income-generating baselines. However, not all yield-focused investments are built equally, potentially allowing the outsized performance of the BNDS ETF to distinguish itself from the competition.

 In particular, benchmark yields like the 10-year Treasury may have risen sharply since 2022. Unfortunately, with inflation still elevated, the real return for bondholders remains modest. And while 10-year Treasuries yield around 4.25% and investment-grade corporates deliver around 5.4%, these rates are declining. Should rate cuts materialize, income investors could be under more pressure to find adequate rewards.

 The aforementioned dynamic is a byproduct of spread compression. Representing the difference in yield between a riskier bond and a safer bond (such as a Treasury), the spread narrows when interest rates drop across the board. Essentially, this dynamic means that high-risk debt securities don’t typically offer much more yield than safer alternatives, creating an incentivization problem. After all, who would want to absorb high risk for low reward?

 Subsequently, spread compression pushes income investors into a corner. One approach is for market participants to heighten their risk exposure with junk bonds - also known as highly speculative or distressed debt. Another approach is to abandon income altogether and instead focus on wealth protection, explaining in part the meteoric rise of gold.

 What makes Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF stand out is that it offers a potentially happy middle ground. Armed with an active strategy, the BNDS fund’s portfolio management team hunt for income in places where other funds can’t or won’t go. This attribute affords the ETF flexibility, facilitating adjustments to market conditions in real time.

 How The BNDS ETF Moves The Needle

 As reported by Statista, in 2023, investors had access to 10,319 ETFs. As of 2022, these funds globally managed assets up to over $11 trillion. To be quite blunt, the concept of an income-generating fund is hardly unique. So, why would investors consider the Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF?

 Primarily, BNDS ranks highly on relevance. As stated earlier, this ETF is actively managed, delivering important advantages over passive ETFs. Perhaps the most conspicuous element is the ability and flexibility to navigate dynamic market conditions. Indeed, the BNDS doesn’t passively track an index or benchmark; instead, actual human beings adjust the portfolio based on economic trends, Fed policy changes and a host of other impact points.

 This distinguishing factor segues into another point: people, people, people. The BNDS ETF is spearheaded by Infrastructure Capital founder, CEO and lead portfolio manager Jay D. Hatfield. Leveraging a broad perspective on the U.S. financial markets, Hatfield commands extensive experience as an investment banker and research director. In concert with his team of experts, the BNDS fund aims to be geared for whatever the market throws at it: shifting credit cycles, energy booms and busts and monetary policy pivots.

 The Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF also enjoys credibility. One of Infrastructure Capital’s most popular investment vehicles is Virtus InfraCap US Preferred Stock ETF (ARCA: PFFA). Another actively managed fund, PFFA buys U.S. preferred stocks that pay fixed dividends, aligning with the Infrastructure Capital philosophy of extracting income from uncommon places.

 Still, what arguably moves the needle for investors considering the BNDS ETF is its yield. At the moment, the fund’s 30-day Sec Yield clocks in at 7.12%. Combined with a management fee and gross expense ratio of 0.80% and 0.81%, respectively, the BNDS aims to deliver a robust income at a sensible cost.

 Finally, the meat and potatoes of this income fund centers on long-duration, higher-yield corporate issuers, such as Plains All American Pipeline LP and Lincoln National Corp. These companies tend to represent stable businesses with tangible cash flows - aligning with Infrastructure Capital’s broad strategic view of targeting assets with intrinsic value and free cash flow potential.

 Rethinking The Income Game

 In a world where the traditional playbook no longer cuts it, income investors may want to consider going beyond surface-level yields and embrace adaptability. The days of relying on static bond strategies are fading fast, replaced by a need for dynamic approaches that can respond to evolving risks - and just as importantly, uncover overlooked rewards.

 By marrying real-time flexibility with a disciplined focus, Infrastructure Capital’s strategy represents something more than just another bond fund: it’s a deliberate response to the challenges of this new rate environment.
