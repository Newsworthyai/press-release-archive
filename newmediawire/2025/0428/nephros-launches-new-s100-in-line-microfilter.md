# Nephros Launches New S100 In-Line Microfilter

New Filter Offers Enhanced Installation Flexibility for Bacterial Retention

 SOUTH ORANGE, NJ - April 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Nephros, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEPH), a leading water technology company providing filtration solutions to medical and commercial markets, today announced the launch of its S100 In-Line filter.

 The S100 In-Line filter model is an extension of the existing S100 microfiltration line, expanding Nephros’ infection control portfolio to offer greater flexibility in installation and broader application versatility. Designed to support bacterial remediation in both clinical and non-clinical settings, the new in-line model enables installations beyond traditional sink and shower fixtures to include low-pressure plumbing environments commonly found in emergency eyewash and shower stations, pharmaceutical and laboratory settings, dental equipment, and recreational vehicle water supplies.

 The new in-line model maintains the trusted performance and safety standards of the S100 product line, such as a 0.1-micron pore size and FDA 510(k)-clearance as a Class II medical device. It features an increased flow rate, a filter life of up to 90 days, and achieves bacterial retention performance in accordance with ASTM F838 standards. With this release, Nephros bridges the functional gap between its microfiltration and ultrafiltration product lines, offering a more complete and versatile product portfolio.

 “The S100 in-line microfilter is a practical extension of our medical-grade filtration offerings,” said Robert Banks, President & CEO of Nephros. “It allows us to address specific installation scenarios where traditional sink or shower fixture filters are not suitable, and within low-pressure environments where the use of our in-line ultrafilters is not appropriate. This addition enhances our ability to support customers with more tailored, flexible water safety solutions.”

 The S100 In-Line microfilter is available in two configurations, Quick Connect (70-0288) and Threaded (70-0289), to accommodate varying installation needs. Two compatible installation kits (70-0290 and 70-0347), ensure ease of integration across diverse environments.
