# MWG Holdings' Chief Executive Officer Tom Sheridan, Esq. to Speak at IgniteIt California Market Spotlight

Premier Cannabis Company CEO to Join Fellow Panelists at IgniteIt California to Discuss California Cannabis Industry Retail Operations

 SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - September 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, is thrilled to announce their presence at the first iteration of IgniteIt’s California Market Spotlight in Anaheim on Oct. 8, 2025. MWG Holdings CEO Tom Sheridan, Esq., will join fellow California cannabis industry leaders for the panel discussion titled “Second Chance at 15%: How You Can Maximize California’s Tax Reset & Build a Growing, Resilient Business."

 With California’s cannabis excise tax repeal from 19% to 15%, operators across the state continue to face tough decisions on pricing, consumer engagement, and operational efficiency. On October 8 at 10:05 am PT, Sheridan will join a panel of distinguished cannabis professionals, including Tim Dodd, CEO of Sweet Flower; Lauren Carpenter, CEO of Embarc; and Matt Rakow, CFO of NUG. The conversation will be moderated by Tiffany Richardson, Partner at Crowe, and will provide actionable insights on maximising the tax reset by recalibrating pricing strategies, reinvesting in customer experience, and fueling innovation that drives sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive California market.

 “California operators have always been resilient and innovative, and the repeal of the excise tax proves that both opportunities and new complexities drive collaborative solutions,” said Sheridan. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to share what we’ve learned at MWG and exchange strategies with fellow industry leading minds.”

 IgniteIt California Market Spotlight attendees will be able to connect with key executives from MWG and Perfect Union’s leadership team to explore potential collaborations and strategic partnerships on site. For members of the media interested in speaking with members of the MWG team, please reach out to mwg@americanapr.com.

 The event comes on the heels of MWG’s two-year remodel across all Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness locations, which replaced the outdated “behind-the-counter” model with a modern open shop design. The refreshed stores create a welcoming, guest-friendly environment where consumers can browse products, connect with knowledgeable staff, and enjoy a streamlined checkout experience. These in-store improvements align with the company’s recent launch of the new Perfect Union website, which provides location-specific promotions, improved mobile usability, and convenient ordering for pickup and delivery, helping Perfect Union strengthen its connection with communities across all of their locations.
