# Moon Pursuit Capital Sharpens Crypto Strategy With 14 Public Token Launches

Showcasing the Power of Its Liquid Venture Model

 SAN FRANCISCO - September 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Moon Pursuit Capital, a next-generation crypto-native investment firm, announced today that it is accelerating its Liquid Venture strategy with 14 portfolio companies launching public tokens. With three token generation events already completed and eleven more slated through Q4 2025, the firm is leaning into what Founder & Managing Partner Utkarsh Ahuja calls “a breakout moment for Liquid Venture investing.”

 At the core of Moon Pursuit’s edge is a hybrid strategy that fuses institutional-grade crypto trading with early-stage token investments. For founders, that means faster access to capital, larger-than-industry-average check sizes, and market-cycle guidance informed by daily trading and deep cycle analysis. This structure offers greater liquidity than traditional venture capital, with positions that can be actively managed and adjusted to market cycles, providing allocators with both faster capital recycling and stronger downside protection.

 Moon Pursuit’s approach is shaped by Ahuja’s nearly decade-long track record in the crypto markets, where he built a reputation for anticipating shifts across multiple market cycles. His ability to connect global money supply movements and broader macroeconomic fundamentals to crypto price action gives the firm an advantage not only in trading but also in advising founders on when and how to bring tokens to market. This cycle-driven perspective ensures that portfolio companies are positioned to launch and grow during windows of maximum opportunity, while investors benefit from risk-aware timing and liquidity discipline.

 “What sets us apart is liquidity,” said Ahuja. “Because we run a liquid fund, we always have dry powder ready. That means founders don’t wait months for capital; Moon Pursuit can deploy in days and at larger check sizes. And because I spend every day studying cycles, we know how and when a token should launch. That combination of speed, scale, and timing is something traditional VCs just can’t offer.”

 Looking ahead, Moon Pursuit will back eleven more public token launches through the end of the year, spanning tokenized infrastructure, AI, blockchain, DeFi, and gaming. These launches are complemented by the firm’s liquid trading portfolio and selective OTC investments, highlighting a multi-pronged approach to capturing digital asset growth.

 The firm’s accelerating traction underscores a broader shift in crypto capital markets. Traditional venture capital is slow, with deals taking months to close, and traditional equity investments can take multiple years to yield a return on investment. However, Moon Pursuit combines the discipline of a venture investor with the speed and liquidity of a trading desk. With liquidity returning, volatility creating asymmetric entry points, and macro forces pushing digital assets into the mainstream, Moon Pursuit is positioned to meet the moment with a model that moves faster than conventional VCs.

 With Token2049 on the horizon, Moon Pursuit Capital aims to expand its international presence while continuing to raise the bar for crypto-native capital deployment.
