 ZURICH - September 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The naoo Group reports a positive and growth-driven first half of 2025, marked by significant strategic progress. Consolidated group revenue in the reporting period rose sharply, primarily due to the Kingfluencers acquisition, to CHF 4.3m (H1 2024: CHF 0.42m). Gross profit also increased substantially to CHF 1.62m (H1 2024: CHF 0.07m), corresponding to a more than doubled gross margin of 38% (H1 2024: 16.0%).

 EBITDA was mainly impacted by extraordinary expenses for further growth of the naoo Group and the successful integration of Kingfluencers totaling approx. CHF 0.9m. Including these extraordinary effects in full, EBITDA for the first half of 2025 amounted to -CHF 1.22m (H1 2024: -CHF 0.52m). Net income for the period came to -CHF 1.95m (H1 2024: -CHF 0.52m).

 The first half of 2025 was characterized by decisive strategic advances. With the highly synergistic acquisition of Kingfluencers, Switzerland’s leading influencer agency with more than 3,800 creators and over 300 clients, the group not only expanded its reach and customer network but also integrated stable, profitable agency revenues into the group structure. The combination of agency expertise and platform technology provides the naoo Group with a unique market position and sustainably strengthens its presence.

 In June, the naoo Group also launched Gaia, a central data lakehouse for all AI functions. Gaia already serves as the foundation for successful AI-applications such as naooSense 2 in the feed and a new semantic search engine. Initial joint initiatives with Kingfluencers - including the launch of naoo Mirror+, onboarding of creators with over 3 million followers, and the inaugural KING Awards, a new industry award honoring creativity and authenticity in social media - underscore the growing attractiveness of the platform.

 With the addition of Gregor Doser (13 years at Google Switzerland, instrumental in building YouTube Switzerland) and Philip Hofmann (over 15 years of sales and media experience), the naoo Group has also strengthened its commercial capabilities. Together with the adjusted 4-pillar sales strategy at Kingfluencers, the sales and consulting team is being expanded to deepen customer relationships, acquire key accounts, and establish strategic partnerships with agencies.

 For the full year 2025 and beyond, naoo remains very positive and plans to continue its highly dynamic growth trajectory, with both revenues and operational performance expected to increase significantly.

 Karl Fleetwood, CFO & COO of the naoo Group, stated: “The first half of 2025 was very positive for naoo. We increased group revenues tenfold and laid an important strategic and operational foundation for the future. With the integration of Kingfluencers and the expansion of our AI infrastructure, we are positioning naoo as a leading, high-growth technology and media company in the long term.”

 Dr. Thomas Wolfensberger, Founder, Anchor Shareholder and Senior Advisor of naoo, added: “We intend to maintain our strong growth momentum and in the coming periods further expand and monetize our unique foundation with innovation, new features and products, as well as regional expansion.”
