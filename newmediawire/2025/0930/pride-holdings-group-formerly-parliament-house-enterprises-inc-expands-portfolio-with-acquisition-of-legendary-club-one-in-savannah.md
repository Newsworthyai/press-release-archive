# Pride Holdings Group (Formerly Parliament House Enterprises Inc.) Expands Portfolio With Acquisition of Legendary Club One in Savannah

SAVANNAH, GA - September 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Pride Holdings Group (OTC: PHSE) is proud to announce the acquisition of Club One, one of Savannah’s most iconic nightlife destinations and a cornerstone of the city’s LGBTQ+ community. For over three decades, Club One has been celebrated for its vibrant atmosphere, world-class drag performances, and unwavering commitment to inclusion.

 Made internationally famous by the legendary entertainer The Lady Chablis, whose memoir Hiding My Candy and unforgettable role in the bestseller Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil placed a spotlight on the club, Club One has long stood as a cultural beacon representing courage, creativity, and unapologetic authenticity.

 “This acquisition is about more than nightlife, it’s about honoring an institution that shaped Savannah’s cultural identity,” said Michael Barrett, CEO of Pride Holdings Group. “Club One is not just a club; it’s a landmark of LGBTQ+ history, and we’re excited to preserve its legacy while introducing fresh experiences for the next generation of guests.”

 Under Pride Holdings Group, Club One will continue to showcase its legendary drag performances and signature events while introducing new programming, upgraded amenities, and expanded community outreach initiatives. Guests can expect the same spirit of joy, laughter, and inclusivity that has defined the venue since 1988.

 “Club One has brought together countless people over the years, breaking barriers while building community,” added Dr. Albert “Bart” Whitehead, Chair of Pride Holdings Group. “We are committed to honoring that history and ensuring its impact continues for decades to come.”

 Effective immediately, Club One will operate under the Pride Holdings Group banner. Guests can expect seamless continuity during the transition, with exciting announcements and enhancements set to roll out later this year.
