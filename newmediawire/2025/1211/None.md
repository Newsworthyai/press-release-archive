# With December Rate Cut Odds Rising, Investors May Be Even Hungrier For The Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF

DETROIT, MICHIGAN - December 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - After a lengthy period where the underlying sentiment of monetary policy teetered, Federal Reserve officials appeared to have taken on a more dovish tone. On Nov. 21, data provided by the CME FedWatch tool revealed that the probability of a 25-basis-point rate reduction at the Dec. 10 policy meeting jumped to 74%.

 To provide some stark context, just the day before, the odds sat at 25%.

 Thanks to a flurry of comments from key policymakers, the apparent strategic trajectory shifted dramatically. Specifically, remarks by New York Fed President John Williams and Governor Stephen Miran cast recent inflationary concerns as overblown. At the same time, they noted that the more pressing issue could be downside risks to employment, which have been rising amid a cooling labor market.

 In an interesting bit of economic nuance, Williams noted that while the Trump administration’s tariffs have contributed to higher prices, the levies are “not expected to lead to persistent inflation.” Further, he reiterated the need to balance inflation control with the goal of maximum employment.

 If that wasn’t enough of a signal, just a few days following the above report, Polymarket - a decentralized prediction platform - noted that the odds of a 25-basis-point cut surged to 81%. A day before, this stat was 67% and just 44% one week prior. Interestingly, the odds that rates would remain unchanged plunged from 30% to 18% in a span of 24 hours.

 Finally, financial heavyweights JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have realigned their interest rate outlooks. Both institutions are now forecasting that the Fed will deliver the much-anticipated quarter-point cut following its policy meeting later this month. Conspicuously, JP Morgan reversed its earlier prediction of a pause until January.

 All signs point to an accommodative stance - and that could have serious implications for a key exchange-traded product.

 Shifting Monetary Winds Bolsters the Case for Infrastructure Capital’s BNDS ETF

 As of this writing, the latest data pegs the odds of a quarter-point rate cut at 87.2%. One session earlier on Friday, the metric was 84.7%. Fundamentally, while elevated consumer prices represent a serious overhang, the Fed seems much more concerned about the avoidance of inflicting great harm on the economy.

 Given the current trajectory of monetary policy winds, it’s quite possible that financial services provider Infrastructure Capital could be standing on fertile ground. In particular, its income-focused fund called Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF (ARCA: BNDS) may see greater interest among investors seeking more robust and reliable total returns.

 Structurally, the BNDS ETF is an actively managed platform designed to maximize current income while pursuing capital appreciation opportunities. Primarily, the team aims to achieve this directive via fixed-income securities - mostly corporate bonds. Plus, the structure of BNDS allows the management team to opportunistically employ an option-writing strategy to enhance income.

 Still, the star of the show is the income first mandate. Unlike many other income funds that passively mirror broad indices, the BNDS ETF is actively geared toward delivering above-market income that is distributed monthly. As such, the distribution cycle aligns conveniently with the flow of most financial obligations.

 Providing fuel for the aforementioned mandate is the active credit selection undergirding the BNDS ETF. Effectively, Infrastructure Capital views mispricing as an opportunity. Going beyond vanilla credit ratings or benchmark indices, the management team utilizes a proprietary protocol to filter for fixed-income securities that are undervalued relative to their fundamentals. As well, the financial services specialist targets companies with strong profitability and access to capital.

 Following a rigorous evaluation of enterprise value, capital ratios, operating metrics and credit-relevant correlations, viable prospects are carefully integrated into the BNDS ETF portfolio. Combined with a hybrid exposure - comprising of approximately 84% toward fixed income and 16% toward preferred securities - Infrastructure Capital is able to achieve a 30-Day Sec Yield of 7.52% (as of Nov. 28, 2025).

 Such performance may attract more investors, especially if the Fed does lower the benchmark interest rate. Doing so would reduce what’s known as the risk-free yield, which means that if investors want a greater reward, they must accept greater risk.

 For such individuals, the BNDS ETF may represent an intriguing alternative.

 Actively Addressing the Ergodic Fallacy

 One of the most important but overlooked lessons in the market is that humans naturally assume that the long-term average behavior of a single instance is equal to the average behavior of the entire system at any given time. However, the market is non-ergodic, which effectively translates to an ecosystem where circumstances like volatility spikes can disrupt the expected compounding associated with steady returns.

 Consider a thought experiment where one person gets three nights of restful sleep, eight hours at a time, while another person stays awake for one 24-hour cycle and then sleeps for the next 24 hours. Mathematically speaking, both individuals are receiving a total of 24 hours of sleep. However, one is enjoying ergodic sleep and the other non-ergodic - and they have vastly different health outcomes even though their total hours of sleep are identical.

 Essentially, the beauty of the BNDS ETF is that it addresses this so-called ergodic fallacy through active management. And this leadership is provided by Infrastructure Capital’s Founder, CEO and Portfolio Manager Jay D. Hatfield. Leveraging almost three decades of experience in the securities and investment industries, Hatfield also serves as the lead manager of other funds, including Infrastructure Capital Small Cap Income ETF (ARCA: SCAP) and Virtus InfraCap US Preferred Stock ETF (ARCA: PFFA).

 What makes Hatfield stand out from the rest of the competitive financial services industry is his broad expertise. Commanding an acumen that encompasses investment banking, energy infrastructure, real estate and research and analysis, Hatfield is one of few experts who are truly qualified in finding structurally mispriced opportunities in the open, preferred and derivatives market.

 It’s also worth mentioning that the credit market where Hatfield plies his trade is intensely non-ergodic. In practical terms, the fundamentals could become divorced from underlying intrinsic value due to sudden shifts in liquidity, spreads and rate expectations. However, the selling point of the BNDS ETF is that Hatfield leverages these periods of non-ergodicity as opportunities to identify and exploit mispricings.

 A New Policy Paradigm Forces a Critical Rethink

 With the Fed all but poised to issue an accommodative monetary policy soon, the broader economic benefit could translate to serious implications for passive-income-focused investors. A dovish shift would reduce the risk-free yield, forcing those who want greater returns to accept greater risk. Such market participants may find the BNDS ETF to be a viable alternative, especially under the active management of one of the world’s top financial experts.
