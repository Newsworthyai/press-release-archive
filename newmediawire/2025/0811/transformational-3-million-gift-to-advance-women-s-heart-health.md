# Transformational $3 million gift to advance women s heart health

(NewMediaWire) - August 11, 2025 - DALLAS — Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women, according to the American Heart Association, claiming more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined. The American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is working to change that through its continued investments in groundbreaking science, community programs and targeted initiatives which aim to close the gaps in awareness, diagnosis and treatment for women’s heart health.

 That work will get a powerful boost through a transformational $3 million gift from longtime American Heart Association volunteer leaders and philanthropists Lee and Valerie Shapiro, of Chicago. This investment will help sustain the Association’s Mother’s Day matching gift campaign for years to come while also providing critical support to the Go Red for Women® Venture Fund, fueling innovation and advancing research in women’s heart health.

 The Shapiros’ connection to the American Heart Association is deeply personal. Both lost parents to cardiovascular disease — yet Valerie’s mother lived an additional two decades thanks to advances in treatment supported by the Association. That profound gift of time inspired the couple to help ensure more families have the opportunity to share moments with the women they love.

 In 2021, Lee and Valerie helped launch the Millions Honoring Moms campaign, matching every online gift made during May, the month of Mother’s Day, up to $1 million. Heart Association research shows that fewer than half of women recognize heart disease as their greatest health threat, and women — particularly women of color — continue to be underrepresented in cardiovascular research. The Millions Honoring Moms campaign helps combat that by investing in research, prevention and education. The campaign helps further spread awareness around women’s health through a variety of media channels, such as social media, email, and television. The effort has grown into a national movement, inspiring thousands to give in tribute to all mothers and cherished women in their lives. The Shapiros’ leadership as both dedicated volunteers and foundational supporters has amplified the campaign’s reach and inspired others to give.

 “The Shapiros’ generosity is nothing short of extraordinary and will support the Association’s work to change the future of health,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Their commitment has already touched thousands of lives, and this new gift will drive even greater impact for years to come. We are deeply grateful for their vision, leadership and unwavering dedication to our mission.”

 With their new $3 million gift, the Shapiros will continue their matching gift commitment for multiple future Millions Honoring Moms campaigns, ensuring that every dollar donated in honor of mothers and other meaningful women will continue to be multiplied. The gift will also advance the Go Red for Women Venture Fund, which invests in innovative solutions and community-based initiatives to improve outcomes for women’s cardiovascular health.

 “Having spent the last 25-plus years investing in innovation for better health, we have learned how important it is to nurture early-stage founders who are passionate about improving lives,” said Lee Shapiro, venture capitalist and managing partner at 7wireVentures. “We are proud to support the Go Red for Women Venture Fund and their mission of advancing women’s health at every age, stage and season of life.”

 Lee Shapiro currently serves as volunteer chairperson of the American Heart Association’s Board of Directors and has held multiple leadership roles over the years, including treasurer and chair-elect. Valerie has been an equally passionate partner in the mission, co-leading the Chicago Heart Ball to record-breaking success. Together, they have championed women’s heart health locally and nationally, inspiring countless others to join the fight against cardiovascular disease.
