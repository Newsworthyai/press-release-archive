# 45Drives Announces Third Wave of Creators for 2025 Creators Summit: Level 1 Techs' Wendell Wilson, NGW Post's Nick Wiczynski, and Cinematographer Joseph DiGiovanna Join the Lineup

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA and WILMINGTON, NC - August 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 45Drives is thrilled to announce the third wave of creators who will join the 2025 Creators Summit, taking place September 8–12 in Wilmington, North Carolina. This year’s event will mark the U.S. debut of the Summit and the official launch of 45Studio, a new division dedicated to delivering high-performance creative workflows for video editors, musicians, VFX artists, game developers, designers, and animators.

 They join an already exciting lineup that includes electronic music visionary deadmau5, Tom Lawrence of Lawrence Systems, Craft Computing, and Allan Jude of ScaleEngine.

 The latest lineup additions are Wendell Wilson of Level 1 Techs, Nick Wiczynski, Executive Colorist and Editor at NGW Post, and Joseph DiGiovanna, the cinematographer, composer, and editor behind the NYC Timescape project.

 Wendell Wilson is known for his deep technical insight into enterprise-grade hardware and open-source applications. His recent video review of the Stornado F16 server exemplifies the kind of detailed analysis attendees can expect from his session at the Summit. “A lot of what I do depends on real insight into how people actually use technology - not just the ideal use case, but the reality,” said Wilson. “At the Creator Summit, 45Drives doesn’t hold anything back. They openly share how their customers use their products, where they run into challenges, and how they succeed. That level of honesty, paired with their commitment to open source, is what sets them apart. What makes the Creator Summit unique is that this mindset is built into the event itself. It’s a genuine exchange between creators and engineers, between real-world experience and technical vision. It pushes back against an industry that too often hides behind closed systems and vague promises. Here, users are seen, heard, and taken seriously.”

 Nick Wiczynski brings elite post-production expertise to the Summit through his work as Executive Colorist and Editor at NGW Post, where he specializes in high-end color grading and finishing. “I’m so excited about the 45Drives Creators Summit,” said Wiczynski. “It provides a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most influential voices in the creative and open-source storage world. I am looking forward to the presentations and the smaller roundtables throughout the summit.”

 Joseph DiGiovanna has spent more than a decade capturing over 30 million images of the New York City skyline for his NYC Timescape project. Migrating his massive archive to a 45Drives server has transformed his workflow. “Over the first ten years of my NYC Timescape project, I’ve captured more than 30 million images of the New York City skyline. Moving those images onto a 45Drives server has completely transformed how I access and work with my project,” said DiGiovanna. “I’m incredibly excited to attend my first 45Drives Creators Summit. I know that by connecting with fellow artists and creators, I’ll uncover answers to questions I hadn’t even thought to ask. In the six months I’ve been using the 45Drives server, I’ve felt fully supported by their team. I’m confident that, at the Creators Summit, we’ll imagine new and inspiring ways to use 45Drives technology to elevate my art beyond anything I ever expected.”

 The 2025 Creators Summit will be the company’s most ambitious event to date, featuring dual-track programming for both enterprise technologists and creative professionals. The enterprise track will spotlight innovations in open-source storage, clustered servers, and high-performance platforms like ZFS, Ceph, and DRBD. The creative track will focus on direct-from-server editing, real-time rendering, and other workflows powered by 45Studio’s tailored hardware and software solutions. The Summit will take place across 45Drives’ Wilmington facility and partner venues, with keynote presentations, hands-on workshops, roundtable discussions, and networking events bringing together technologists, engineers, creators, and industry thought leaders.

 “This event is about more than storage - it’s about the people who push technology to its limits,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President and Co-Founder of 45Drives. “Wendell, Nick, and Joseph each bring a unique mix of technical skill and creative vision. When you put people like this in the same room with engineers, creators, and our team, you create the conditions for breakthroughs.”
