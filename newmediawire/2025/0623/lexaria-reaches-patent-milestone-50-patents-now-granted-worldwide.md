# Lexaria Reaches Patent Milestone - 50 Patents Now Granted Worldwide

New patents received for the treatment of epilepsy and for the sublingual delivery of nicotine

 KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA - June 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (Nasdaq: LEXX, LEXXW) (the “Company” or “Lexaria”), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, is pleased to announce that it has received 2 new international patents. This now brings Lexaria’s total worldwide patent portfolio to 50.

 “We are pleased to announce the addition of these patents as we continue to execute on our strategy to broaden Lexaria’s patent portfolio. We believe that this not only increases our likelihood of entering into commercial deals within the pharmaceutical industry, but that it also serves as an important building block for establishing and protecting long-term value for our shareholders and all stakeholders,” said Rich Christopher, CEO of Lexaria. “The achievement of 50 worldwide patents marks the accomplishment of a milestone that had been envisioned by the Company’s management for over a decade.”

 Lexaria has been granted a new patent in Australia within its patent family #24, Compositions and Methods for Treating Epilepsy. This broadens Lexaria’s intellectual property protection for the use of its DehydraTECH™ enhanced processing technology related to the treatment of epilepsy outside of the USA, where a strong patent portfolio of 6 existing patents has already been built. This new patent will expire in 2044.

 Lexaria has also been granted a new patent in Japan within its patent family #20, Compositions and Methods for Sublingual Delivery of Nicotine. This patent joins already-existing patents within the same family in both the USA and Canada. This new patent will expire in 2043.

 The epilepsy drug market was US$9.5 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach sales of over $15 billion by 2032. Approximately 50 million people in the US alone are affected by epilepsy.

 The global retail oral nicotine market was valued at US$5.5 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at 26%/yr until at least 2030, with additional revenue generated within the medically-prescribed market. The nicotine pouch market alone – where DehydraTECH™ has demonstrated absorption benefits in earlier studies – is expected to reach US$25.4 billion in revenue by 2030. Altria Ventures Inc. the 16.67% shareholder of Lexaria Nicotine LLC, holds a non-exclusive license to the use of DehydraTECH with nicotine products.
