# Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) Announces Launch of CDRChain, a Blockchain-Based Marketplace for Voice and SMS Settlement

NEW YORK, NY - June 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) ("Accredited Solutions" or the "Company") is proud to announce the coming launch of CDRChain, a next-generation blockchain-based settlement marketplace designed to revolutionize the way telecom carriers, MVNOs, and global partners manage and reconcile call detail records (CDRs) and SMS traffic.

 CDRChain offers a streamlined, automated solution for near real-time transaction validation and settlement, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in legacy billing and clearing systems. The platform reduces reconciliation times, minimizes fraud, and increases trust across the value chain by leveraging blockchain’s immutable ledger, smart contract functionality, and decentralized processing power.

 “The launch of CDRChain marks a transformative moment for our company and the telecom settlement industry at large,” said Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions. “We’ve built a product designed to serve the real-time needs of global voice and SMS markets, solving for inefficiencies that have plagued the industry for decades. Our mission is to simplify and secure the transaction settlement process, and we’re excited to now bring this technology to market.”

 CDRChain aims to empower its users with:

 • Accelerated Settlement: Transactions settled in near real-time, drastically reducing delays in payments and disputes.

 • Reduced Fraud Risk: Immutable blockchain infrastructure that ensures trust and traceability.

 • Operational Efficiency: Automation of invoice reconciliation and dispute resolution.

 • Cost Savings: Streamlined processes that significantly lower administrative overhead and reduce clearinghouse fees.

 • Transparency: All counterparties can audit transactions via the shared ledger.

 The Company views CDRChain as a potential end-game solution for the telecom industry - one that could serve as the unified, go-to marketplace for the bulk of global SMS and voice traffic settlements. With no other established players offering a comparable blockchain-based platform for this purpose, CDRChain is uniquely positioned to become the central hub for industry-wide interconnect reconciliation.

 The solution is fully described at https://cdrchain.ai/, where users can explore the platform’s benefits and join the waiting list for early access. Accredited Solutions encourages interested carriers, MVNOs, wholesale providers, and infrastructure partners to register and be among the first to experience the platform firsthand. Our estimation is to have a full working MVP with 3 test clients interconnected by end of Q3 of this year. Our team wil begin to engage with potential telco clients in the coming days, taking into advantage this launch announcement.

 The Company’s leadership team is uniquely positioned to drive CDRChain’s adoption and success, with a proven track record in entrepreneurship and longstanding partnerships across the telecommunications ecosystem. Their deep experience and connectivity in the telco world give CDRChain a significant operational and strategic advantage as it enters the market.
