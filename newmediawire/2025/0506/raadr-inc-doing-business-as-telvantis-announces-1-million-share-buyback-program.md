# Raadr Inc., Doing Business as Telvantis, Announces $1 Million Share Buyback Program

NEW YORK - May 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc. (OTC: $RDAR), doing business as Telvantis (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), today announced the initiation of a share buyback program. The company’s board of directors approved an initial purchase of up to $1,000,000 worth of common stock through market purchases.

 The share buyback comes as the company’s first quarter performance showed strength into the rest of 2025.

 “This is the start of another initiative to create long-term value for shareholders,” said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “The board believes that our common stock represents an excellent investment opportunity as the company is currently valued significantly below its intrinsic value.”

 “As stewards of the company’s capital, we allocate our cash where it offers attractive risk-adjusted returns. At the current valuation, we believe our own common stock offers such returns,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. “This one million US-dollar buyback program is an initial commitment. We will continuously evaluate this program and might extend it in the future.” Mr. Gilcher added that no number of shares is required to be purchased in the buyback and that all funds used in the buyback will be derived from operations.
