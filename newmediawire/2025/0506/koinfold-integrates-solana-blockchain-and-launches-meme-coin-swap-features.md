RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - May 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - KYN Capital Group (OTC: KYNC)

 KOINFOLD has officially integrated the Solana blockchain into its platform, leveraging Solana’s high-speed and low-cost infrastructure to enable seamless swapping of meme coins. This integration brings several exciting updates:

 * Bi-Weekly Meme Coin Spotlights: Every two weeks, KOINFOLD will research and highlight trending Solana-based meme coins, making them easily accessible within the app.
* Thriving Solana Meme Coin Market: As of April 18, 2025, the Solana meme coin market holds a capitalization between $6.77 billion and $7.17 billion, with daily growth ranging from 1.8% to 3.9%. Thousands of new tokens launch each day, reflecting the sector's explosive momentum.

Solana’s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second at minimal cost is a perfect fit for the fast-paced nature of meme coin trading.
