# 7-HOPE Alliance Launches to Support Science-Backed Advocacy for 7-OHM Consumers Amidst Misinformation Campaigns

New Nonprofit Launches to Engage in Science, Advocacy, and Support of Users of 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OHM) Based Products

 LOS ANGELES, CA - May 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Today marks the official launch of 7-HOPE Alliance, (“7-HOPE”) a trailblazing nonprofit coalition dedicated to protecting legal access to 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OHM), a kratom-based alkaloid that is positively transforming lives across the country. As misinformation and a concentrated campaign to ban this emerging natural product ingredient is taking place in multiple states across the U.S., 7-HOPE Alliance was founded to unify the voices of 7-OHM users, researchers, and advocates who rely on 7-OHM as a safe and effective alternative to dangerous painkillers and illegal drugs.

 The mission of 7-HOPE Alliance is to promote responsible access to 7-OHM through science, education, advocacy, and community building. By bringing together consumers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and ethical brands, 7 HOPE is working to change the national conversation around 7-OHM. This work includes supporting rigorous scientific studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the compound, countering misinformation and predatory narratives in the policy sphere, and creating the first formal support community for 7-OHM users. 7-HOPE is also compiling and releasing the largest collection of real-world 7-OHM user data in existence including testimonials and outcomes that reveal just how profoundly these products are improving lives. From managing complex pain conditions to helping individuals transition away from harmful synthetics, the stories collected reflect a consistent, compelling truth: 7-OHM is working where other solutions have failed.

 "The people who depend on 7-OHM are not fringe users - they're parents, veterans, workers, and patients who were left with no safe and natural options to help support their wellness - until now," said Jackie Subeck, Board Member of the 7-HOPE Alliance. "The 7-HOPE Alliance was founded with a mission to support these individuals through scientific research and validated education. We will work to protect the people’s right to choose a natural, effective solution that fits with their needs through science-based advocacy. We look forward to working with some of the greatest scientific minds in the industry to study this emerging product class and leverage that work in a way to protect safe and legal access to 7-OHM products on a national level."

 In its initial phase, 7-HOPE will focus on commissioning and funding scientific studies to better understand 7-OHM’s pharmacology, safety, and therapeutic potential. Additionally, 7-HOPE is building a national infrastructure to support 7-OHM users by providing resources, guidance, and a place to make their voices heard. It will organize coordinated efforts to push back against local and federal legislation that seeks to criminalize or limit access to 7-OHM, and it will share its growing body of real-world data with researchers, regulators, and the public. By combining community stories with academic research, 7-HOPE aims to shift the narrative and establish a clear, evidence-based path forward for legal, safe access to 7-OHM.

 Prior to this official launch, 7-HOPE hosted the first public panel discussions on 7-OHM at the CHAMPS event in Las Vegas in March 2025 entitled “Understanding 7-OHM.” The discussion aimed to separate fact from fiction and open up an honest conversation about 7-OHM with topics such as responsible industry practices, consumer education, and how 7 HOPE can work together to ensure safe and fair access. It can be viewed here.

 7-HOPE Alliance is currently seeking founding sponsors, members, board participants, and brand partners who want to take an active role in shaping the future of 7-OHM access and awareness. 7-HOPE invites any type of supporters who believe in natural solutions and evidence-based harm reduction to join in the mission and make their voice heard.
