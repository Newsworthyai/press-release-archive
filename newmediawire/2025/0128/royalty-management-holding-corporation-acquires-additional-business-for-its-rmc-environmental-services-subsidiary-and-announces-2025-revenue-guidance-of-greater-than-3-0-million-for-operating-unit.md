Acquired Additional Environmental Services Revenue Contracts to Expand to Multiple States Beyond Its Current Central Indiana Operations

 RMC Environmental Services Provides 2025 Revenue Guidance of Greater Than $3.0 Million, Representing Greater Than 300% Growth Year-over-year

 FISHERS, INDIANA - January 28, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” or the “Company”), an innovative royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce the acquisition of an existing environmental management and remediation book of business operating in Indiana and Kentucky.  Through this acquisition, which will be consolidated within and managed by the Company’s existing environmental management business, RMC Environmental Services LLC, the Company has purchased an existing contract services book of business that manages personnel serving various companies with their environmental remediation, reclamation, and support services.  With profit margins in excess of 10.0% on initial estimated revenues of over $3.0 million per year, the Company plans to expand this business within the current geographical footprint of Kentucky and southern Indiana, which expands its operating footprint currently located in central Indiana.

 Concurrently with this acquisition, the Company is announcing revenue guidance for its wholly owned environmental management services division, RMC Environmental Services LLC, at greater than $3.0 million for the calendar year 2025, equating to an estimated greater than 300% growth in that business of the Company.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “We applaud the hard work of our team and relationships to continually progress the business forward in a non-dilutive manner.  Our RMC Environmental Services business line had a great 2024, with that operating division alone covering about all of the operating costs of the parent company, Royalty Management Holding Corp.  As a result of expanding our contracts and revenues for this business line, we are also announcing that we are expecting the revenues from this operating division alone (RMC Environmental Services) to exceed approximately $3 million for the full year 2025.  We are hopeful that we can work to continue to grow the business beyond 2025 in a meaningful way through organic growth within this newly acquired book of business, and through additional customers.  With the expanded revenues also comes with anticipated expanded profitability in 2025, which will be used to provide capital for current and new portfolio investments, continue our stock repurchase program, and other activities that result in the creation of shareholder value.  We also continue to evaluate multiple investment opportunities in the data center sector, agriculture sector and environmental services.”
