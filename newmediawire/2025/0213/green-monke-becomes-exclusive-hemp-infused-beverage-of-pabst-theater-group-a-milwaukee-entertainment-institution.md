# Green Monke Becomes Exclusive Hemp-Infused Beverage of Pabst Theater Group, a Milwaukee Entertainment Institution

Green Monke Set to Revolutionize the Guest Experience at Five Milwaukee Theatres as It Builds on Its Relationship With Oak View Group

 MILWAUKEE, WI - February 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Green Monke USA (Green Monke), an award-winning hemp-D9 beverage brand, has entered into an agreement with the esteemed Pabst Theater Group, an OVG Theater Alliance member based in Milwaukee, to enhance the guest experience at the venues. The partnership was secured by OVG Global Partnerships, the sponsorship and naming rights division of Oak View Group that connects leading consumer brands with world-class live entertainment properties.

 This collaboration will allow Green Monke to reach a diverse audience across five iconic venues within the group:

 * Miller High Life Theatre (4,000 capacity)
* Riverside Theater (2,500 capacity)
* Pabst Theater (1,350 capacity)
* Turner Hall Ballroom (1,000 capacity)
* Vivarium (400 capacity)

 "The essence of a community is reflected in its theaters and music venues. That is why having Green Monke Happy Sodas in Pabst Theater Group venues shows our commitment to bring our award-winning hemp-derived THC beverages to passionate audiences," commented Pat Gleeson, CEO of Green Monke. "Our goal is not only to enhance the overall guest experience - imagine watching your favorite artists and comedians perform after enjoying a Happy Soda or two - but also to creatively elevate the arts and attract a new generation of theatergoers in Milwaukee."

 Partnership Details & First Sampling

 Green Monke kicked off the partnership with Pabst Theater Group with a highly successful launch weekend. The launch centered around a performance by the band Goose at Miller High Life Theatre, where guests had the opportunity to enjoy samples of Green Monke’s Orange Passionfruit and Mango Guava flavors.

 Going forward, Green Monke will be prominently featured across all Pabst Theater Group venues and participate in activation opportunities and event marketing efforts throughout the year.

 “This partnership with Green Monke will help us to take the Pabst Theater Group live event experience to the next level, making this the perfect collaboration and kicking off the new year with a real high,” said Gary Witt, President & CEO of the Pabst Theater Group.

 Wisconsin Market Opportunity

 Green Monke is working with the leading liquor distributor in Wisconsin, Johnson Brothers Limited, to sell Green Monke Happy Sodas through traditional liquor distributors and retail outlets. This means that theatre-goers who first enjoy a Green Monke Happy Soda at a Pabst Theatre Group show can purchase them locally for at-home consumption at retailers throughout the State.

 In Wisconsin, where recreational cannabis has not been legalized, consumers are increasingly turning to hemp-derived beverages both as an alcohol alternative and as a legal, socially-accepted mode of THC consumption. This presents a significant opportunity to reach a largely untapped market of approximately 6 million people statewide, including a focus on the Milwaukee metro area, with a population of approximately 1.5 million.
