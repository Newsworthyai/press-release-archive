 (NewMediaWire) - February 13, 2025 - Glendale, CA – From the demonstrations of Jiu-Jitsu in the late 1800s to Teddy Roosevelt's pursuit of Judo, the martial arts have woven a vibrant thread through the tapestry of American history. Long before the explosion of anime like Samurai Champloo and One Piece captivated global audiences, these ancient disciplines, born in the East, found fertile ground in the West.

 Imagine a world without the electrifying artistry of Bruce Lee, a world where the grace and power of martial arts never graced the silver screen. From John Wayne's brawling style to the intricate choreography of today's action films, the influence is undeniable.

 But this rich history, a legacy built on the shoulders of pioneering masters, is fading like a whisper in the wind. The stories of their journeys, their triumphs, their very existence, risk being lost to the relentless march of time.

 In the heart of Glendale, a beacon of hope flickers: the Martial Arts History Museum. It's not just a museum; it's a sanctuary. The only museum on Earth dedicated to preserving the global story of martial arts, from their ancient origins to their modern-day incarnations.

 Step inside, and you're transported through time. Witness artifacts touched by the hands of legends – their uniforms, their weapons, tangible echoes of their extraordinary lives. The museum unveils a living timeline, tracing the evolution of these arts and their profound impact on both Asian and Western cultures.

 "This is our last hope," implores museum president Michael Matsuda, the visionary who founded this treasure trove in 1999. "It would be a tragedy, an irreparable loss, to let this history vanish forever."

 The Martial Arts History Museum is more than just a collection of relics; it's a vibrant space where families can connect with history, where children can find inspiration, and where the fight against prejudice and misunderstanding is waged through understanding and appreciation.

 Supporting the museum isn't simply about keeping its doors open; it's about safeguarding a legacy. It's about ensuring that the stories of courage, discipline, and cultural exchange continue to inspire generations to come. It's about preserving the very soul of martial arts history.

 Be a part of something bigger than yourself. If you have studied the martial arts, if you have been inspired by the martial arts, if the martial arts gave you hope, confidence and inspiration. If the martial arts helped you defend yourself against a bully or attacker. If you have made a career because of the martial arts, if you have benefitted financially because of the martial arts, then take this moment to give back to the martial arts by keeping its history alive.

 For the city of Glendale, the museum is a tourist attraction bringing people from all over the world to visit the "home of the martial arts world wide.

 Every donation counts and since the museum is a non-profit 501c3 organization, your donations are tax-deductible. The goal of the museum is to raise $5 million to purchase a new location in the Southern California area. A place that could not only house the museum, but be a place for seminars, workshops, health classes, teachings and even a large theater for screenings and lectures.
