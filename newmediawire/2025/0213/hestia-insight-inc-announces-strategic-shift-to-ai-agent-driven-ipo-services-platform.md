 The Company’s Chief Strategy Officer, Edward Boyle, leads our AI initiatives with extensive experience, including a Master's in Automation from Stanford University and past roles as an asset manager of $250 million in AUM. Since the rise of AI-powered tools, Mr. Boyle has helped numerous companies integrate AI into their fundraising processes. His AI-driven solutions include financial modeling tools to test various scenarios and investor-focused agents that refine pitch materials.

 Mr. Boyle stated, "After seeing the impact of my early AI solutions and how quickly Agent technology has advanced, now is the perfect time to offer this service on a larger scale. With our public company backing, we bring decades of IPO experience to support our clients."

 Hestia Insight continues to provide comprehensive advisory services, including compliance, investor outreach, and market analysis. AI strengthens each offering, helping companies navigate public markets more effectively. Our AI-enabled solutions cover every stage of the IPO process, including:

 * Valuation and Market Timing: AI tools analyze financial data and market trends to determine optimal valuation and timing.
