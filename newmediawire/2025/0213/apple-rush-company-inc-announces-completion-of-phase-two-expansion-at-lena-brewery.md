# Apple Rush Company, Inc. Announces Completion of Phase Two Expansion at Lena Brewery

Co-Packing Capacity Increased to Over One Million Cans a Month

 ORLANDO, FL - February 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Apple Rush Company, Inc. (OTCpink:APRU), a leading supplier in the functional botanical beverage industry, is excited to announce the completion of phase two at our Lena Brewery. The new brewing facility consists of two spaces, one for canning botanical beverages and another specifically for beer. This separation is important to keep fermentation cross contamination from affecting our amazing products. The expansion includes a new 70 ton chiller, 200 bbl of additional capacity for botanical beverages and an inline carbonation system optimized for our style of production.

 Tony Torgerud, CEO of Apple Rush, said, "APRU has spent an enormous amount of capital to do this expansion and has built a team that can take it to the next level.  Our final commissioning of the new equipment is scheduled for Monday and Tuesday of next week.  This commissioning will give us the capability to produce 30,000 cans a day with a long shift or two short shifts.  We are expecting to add a second shift during the second quarter to give us the capacity of 1 million cans a month in a five day week. The company plan is to focus on existing product lines but are seeking additional labels within the botanical category and are quoting new business weekly. Manufacturing facilities make the most money operating seven days a week and our goal will be to push production to that level to maximize returns for our investors.”

 This marks a new phase for APRU. The Company continues to execute on its ambitious plans to build out additional capacity in other locations throughout the country. The company will be starting a more aggressive social media campaign and will blend that with a formal pr program as well.  Several of our sites will be getting updated over the coming weeks and our financial statements for year end will be filed in a timely manner.
