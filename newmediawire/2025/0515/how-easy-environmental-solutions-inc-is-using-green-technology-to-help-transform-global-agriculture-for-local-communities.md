# How Easy Environmental Solutions, Inc. Is Using Green Technology To Help Transform Global Agriculture For Local Communities

By Faith Ashmore, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As the world combats the threat of climate change, one of the major hurdles to overcome is waste. The world generates over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste every year, and this number is projected to increase by 70% by 2050. This waste is not only a major contributor to methane emissions, but also pollutes our oceans, and policymakers are struggling with how to best deal with the mounting issue.

 Waste is a problem that countries and companies alike are hoping to solve, and the green tech industry’s expansion is part of the solution. The green tech market size is projected to grow from $20.90 billion in 2024 to $105.26 billion by 2032. Companies like Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. (OTC: DUTV) are part of the vanguard helping effect change. Easy Environmental Solutions uses modular solutions to convert waste into energy and microbial liquid fertilizer, and uses nanotechnology to clean water.

 Formally known as Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. and listed under the same name, the company is on a mission to improve food security, promote sustainable forms of agriculture, create access to clean water and renewable energy and work toward a net carbon-neutral future. The company works on blending disruptive technologies to create new solutions to contribute to the global good.

 “Our approach to innovation is about blending—blending ideas, blending technologies,” shared CEO Mark K. Gaalswyk. “We’ve essentially taken every drawer of a college science lab and modularized it. You can then mix and match them to create rapid, full-scale solutions for some of the world’s most urgent challenges.”

 Change On The Horizon

 The company’s commitment to transforming global agriculture and food security through innovation is evident through its scalable solution, which the company reports not only feeds millions but also generates substantial recurring revenue. At the heart of this model is the EasyFEN system, which the company reports is a breakthrough agricultural technology that utilizes Terreplenish – a proprietary microbial seed inoculant – to dramatically increase crop yields using sustainable practices. Terreplenish is able to transform waste into fertilizer directly on site, which effectively fights food insecurity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

 The company has already proven its effectiveness in real-world trials across several African countries, including Somalia. According to the company, the Minister of Agriculture in Somalia even endorsed Terreplenish on national television, stating its potential to eliminate starvation across the continent. This public support triggered interest from leaders throughout Africa, a hopeful signal of a continent-wide readiness to look to green tech for much-needed answers.

 The company says its business model is uniquely powerful. According to the company’s projections, every $1.7 million invested in its EasyFEN system generates over $19 million in annual recurring revenue from two key sources – ongoing purchases of the microbial inoculant and associated licensing fees. Easy Environmental Solutions says it has also built in fail-safes to ensure profitability while maintaining operational control: systems will automatically shut down if payments aren’t made or if the inoculant supply is cut off.

 Easy Environmental Solutions Is Increasing Agency In Local Communities

 One of the benefits of Easy Environmental Solutions’ technology is the locality. Its solutions can provide self-sustaining alternatives for persistent global problems, not requiring ongoing public, private or government financial support. As local communities navigate their future, it is essential for them to have effective solutions that can help combat the threats of climate change.

 Furthermore, the company is looking at the future of green infrastructure across multiple facets. Aligned with its mission to tackle the global need for clean water and energy, the company has developed and licensed a patented Nano Void Technology. These trillions of nanoscopic gaseous bubbles can purify water by creating “voids” that remove particulates. The technology has already reaped results, clearing algae from lakes and restoring polluted bodies of water.

 Easy Environmental Solutions wants to present a shining example of how innovation, sustainability and local empowerment can converge to address the planet’s most pressing challenges. With technologies like EasyFEN and Nano Void already showing real-world impact, the company is not only carving its space in the green tech revolution but also helping rewrite the narrative around agriculture, food security and environmental responsibility.

 As communities across the globe continue to face the compounded effects of climate change, Easy Environmental Solutions offers a powerful, decentralized and scalable roadmap – one that seeks to foster resilience, economic opportunity and environmental restoration from the ground up.
