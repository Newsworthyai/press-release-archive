BOCA RATON, FL - May 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vycor Medical, Inc. (“Vycor” or the “Company”) (OTCQB - VYCO), today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

 The Company operates through two business units: Vycor Medical, which produces the ViewSite™ Brain Access System (VBAS) for neurosurgery; and NovaVision®, a business in development which offers therapy programs to help patients recover from visual disorders after stroke or brain injury.

 Company Highlights

 The Vycor Medical division revenues increased by 31% over 2023; approximately one-third of the increase was from growth in sales to hospitals in the US and approximately two-thirds in international markets.

 Vycor entered into new distribution agreements for France and Spain, two important markets targeted for international expansion.

 Three new clinical papers were published involving the ViewSite Brain Access System (VBAS) during the first three months of 2025, two in the UK and one in Japan, highlighting the clinical advantages of VBAS with respect to reduced brain tissue damage, improved patient outcomes and reduced hospital stay.

 Financial Results

 For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company reported revenue of $436,378, an increase of $99,410 (or 30%) over the same period in 2024. The Vycor Medical division (VBAS) generated revenue of $418,520, an increase of $99,962 (or 31%) over the same period in 2024.

Gross profit for 2025 was $341,798, a 21% increase over 2024, generating a margin of 82% versus 89% in 2024, with the lower gross margin in 2025 attributable to validation and shipping costs of new production as well as sales mix .

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information

 Non-GAAP Reconciliation

 Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures (including non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP net loss and loss per share), which exclude non-cash depreciation of purchased assets and non-cash stock-based compensation. Management does not consider these costs in evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Therefore, management calculates the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this earnings release excluding these costs and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to enable it to analyze further, and more consistently, the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operations. Management believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measures gives them additional important information to enable them to assess, in the same way management assesses, the Company’s current and future continuing operations. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.

 On a GAAP basis the Company reported Operating Expenses of $371,340, an operating loss of $12,806, a net loss of $200,748 and a loss of $0.01 per share.

 Vycor’s GAAP operating costs for the three months ended March 31, 2025 include non-cash depreciation of purchased assets ($16,110) and non-cash stock compensation charges ($18,315). The Company is providing additional non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these charges and expenses, and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables included in this release.

 On a non-GAAP basis, taking into account these adjustments, operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025  were $336,915, non-GAAP operating profit was $21,619, and non-GAAP net loss was $166,323 or $0.00 per share.

These are non-cash charges related to assets which can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing costs and performance and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.

 (2) Non-Cash Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense relating to stock-based compensation issued to employees, outside directors and non-employees including stock options, restricted common stock, and warrants. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the fact that these amounts vary in size and timing, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense allows for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of stock-based compensation expenses on our operating results.
