# Harris Northwest Advisors Represents The Complex in Sale to AEG Presents

FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA - May 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - In a landmark transaction uniting two powerhouses in live entertainment, Harris Northwest Advisors advised on the sale of The Complex - Salt Lake City’s iconic live music and events venue - to AEG Presents, one of the globe’s foremost leaders in music and entertainment.

 The acquisition marks a significant milestone for both parties with AEG Presents expanding its footprint in the Rocky Mountain region by acquiring its first owned and operated venue in Salt Lake City.  Located at 536 West 100 South, The Complex has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the city’s vibrant music scene, offering a diverse range of indoor and outdoor performance spaces and hosting over two million music fans since its founding in 2010.

 "This transaction was especially meaningful given The Complex’s cultural impact on Salt Lake City and its legacy as a top-tier venue," said Ed Harris, Founder & CEO of Harris Northwest Advisors. "We were honored to help guide the ownership through this milestone and ensure the venue’s continued success under AEG Presents."

 "This acquisition is not only a testament to the venue’s strong market position and loyal fan base, but also a powerful endorsement of Salt Lake City’s growing influence in the national live entertainment landscape,” added Jabarie Campbell, Partner at Harris Northwest Advisors.

 “Working with Harris NW Advisors was one of the best decisions of my life," said Gabe Elstein, Founder and CEO of The Complex, praising Harris Northwest Advisors for their role in the sale process. "From start to finish, our deal took nearly a year. Throughout that time, they were there - every step of the way. Saturday evenings, early mornings - it didn’t matter. He always picked up the phone, always brought fresh insight, and always made me feel like I was their top priority. I easily spent hundreds of hours on the phone with him, and never once did they make me feel like a burden."

 Elstein found the entire process a positive experience, adding, “Their ability to navigate negotiations, analyze every angle, and calmly guide me through tough decisions was extraordinary. In the end, we secured a deal far better than I had ever imagined."

 The Complex includes multiple event spaces, most notably the 2,500-capacity Rockwell, the 850-capacity Grand, and the 4,000-capacity Lot for outdoor summer concerts. Over the years, the venue has welcomed top-tier artists across genres, including Billie Eilish, Travis Scott, Slayer, Lil Wayne, Macklemore, and J. Cole, among many others.

 AEG Presents plans to build on The Complex’s strong foundation while preserving its unique character.

 “The Complex is the backbone of live music in Salt Lake City,” said Don Strasburg, President of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest Regional Offices at AEG Presents. “We have always loved promoting shows at The Complex and are so thrilled to bring AEG Presents’ knowledge, relationships and resources together with the entire management team. We are diligently reviewing every opportunity to enhance the already stellar patron and artist experience to make sure the live music fans get even better world class experiences.”

 The existing staff of The Complex will remain in place, including General Manager Paul Brucks, ensuring a smooth transition and continued excellence in operations and event curation.

 “After 15 years as an integral part of the Salt Lake City music scene, we’re looking forward to taking things to the next level as an AEG Presents venue,” said Paul Brucks. “We've always been focused on providing the exceptional live music experience for our community and this will allow us to expand on that endeavor."

 The sale of The Complex to AEG Presents highlights the continued growth and evolution of Salt Lake City’s live music ecosystem, promising increased opportunities for both artists and audiences alike.
