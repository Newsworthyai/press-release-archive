# Kansas teen recognized as national champion for heart health

(NewMediaWire) - May 15, 2025 - DALLAS — Since 1921, heart disease has remained the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. While medical advances have been made, lifestyle factors lead to continued cardiovascular problems. That is why the American Heart Association’s Teen of Impact™ campaign empowers Gen Z leaders to drive lifesaving change in their communities. Inspired by his own family’s history of heart illness, Lad Oborny took his passion for improving health and well-being for his peers, his community and across the country to build a campaign that earned him the title of the 2025 National Teen of Impact Winner. Oborny, of Wichita, Kansas, set a national record, raising more than $220,000 to support the mission of the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all.

 “Lad Oborny, and all of the participants of the nationwide Teen of Impact initiative, are changemakers who are fighting for sustainable health efforts in their local communities that will save lives,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and retired financial executive for The PNC Financial Services Group. “Lad’s passion reflects what has driven the American Heart Association for the past century. Our future is about improving yours, and that is made possible with the support from volunteers like Lad.”

 Oborny was one of 177 nominees selected from almost 50 communities across the country, all working to make an impact by advocating for equitable health to combat the nation’s leading cause of death, cardiovascular disease, while raising funds for the American Heart Association’s lifesaving mission. His campaign inspiration was driven by his grandfather’s heart journey and lifesaving bypass surgery, as well as his grandmother’s struggle with high blood pressure. Two uncles have a heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation, which further deepened his commitment to fighting heart disease. Oborny began supporting the Heart Association as a 2024 Wichita Heart Ball ambassador prior to his role as a Teen of Impact nominee.

 “This campaign is a great opportunity to get involved with your community and address health concerns that are becoming more prevalent each year in this country,” Oborny said. “As an athlete, heart health has always played a large role in my life. As a Teen of Impact nominee, I learned how the American Heart Association is tackling local health priorities—and how I could be part of the solution to drive lasting change.”

 As the 2025 National Teen of Impact Winner, Oborny will receive a scholarship of $10,000 through Gift of College and a college letter of recommendation from American Heart Association leaders.

 “We’re very proud of the leadership and responsibility Lad has taken on to make his community a better place to live,” Oborny’s father, Gary, said. “His campaign has engaged community leaders and created momentum as we work toward a mission that will truly impact Wichita and the nation.”

 This year’s annual Teen of Impact campaign launched on National Wear Red Day®, Feb. 7, and culminated on April 10. For more information about the American Heart Association’s Teen of Impact campaign, visit teenofimpact.heart.org.
