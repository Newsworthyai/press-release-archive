 GLENDALE, CA - December 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Martial Arts History Museum, a unique cultural treasure and the only museum of its kind in the world, is calling on the community, philanthropists, business leaders, and martial arts enthusiasts to make a crucial donation before the end of 2025. The museum is a vital institution dedicated to preserving and sharing the profound connection between art, history, and the diverse cultures that shaped martial arts globally, particularly within the American narrative.

 Why Your Donation MattersMuseums are essential cornerstones of any thriving society. They provide an opportunity to look at the past in an effort to shape the future. They remind us of our roots and measure how far we have come and the sacrifices that so many made to have an effect on not only America, but throughout the world. Museums keep us in touch with our humanity, they remind us of our humility, and they inspire us to create a new path and have an impact on the world. Museums are our last connection to past societies, past iconic figures, and innovators.

 The Martial Arts History Museum, nestled in Glendale, CA, is more than a collection of artifacts and ancient weaponry. It is a living story that preserves the incredible sacrifices made by early Asian immigrants who came to America seeking hope—the very individuals who brought their unique traditions, culture, and, critically, their martial arts to the West.

 "The Martial Arts History Museum is a story of those who came before. Those who paved the way and faced unimaginable suffering in a country that would not accept them for over a hundred years," says Michael Matsuda, museum president and founder. "It is a place where history is preserved, and stories are shared for this and future generations. There is no other place like it in the world, and without community support, this irreplaceable history is at risk of being lost forever."

 An Urgent Call to ActionCurrently, the museum relies on periodic community donations to continue operating. We encourage everyone who values the preservation of history and culture to participate. If you are a company, a philanthropist, an innovator, or if you have been blessed with skills that have provided you with a good life, then consider giving back before the end of 2025. For martial arts school owners, the more your students learn about the arts, the better your chances are of continuing to study with you.

 If you believe museums have value, if you believe museums deserve a place in our society, if you believe that the sacrifices made by so many won’t be lost, then donate to the museum. History needs to be saved, and without the Martial Arts History Museum to keep it alive, everything will be lost.

 Make a difference, make an impact, change the future by donating today.

 The museum is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and is located at 201 N. Brand Blvd., B100, Glendale, CA 91203. Website is MAmuseum.com, and email is info@MAmuseum.com.
