# GeoVax Highlights Dual Protective Potential of GEO-CM04S1 Following Presentation at the AAI Annual Meeting 2025

GEO-CM04S1 Demonstrates Robust COVID-19 and Mpox Immunogenicity in Immunocompromised Patients and Healthy Adults

 ATLANTA, GA - May 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against infectious diseases and solid tumor cancers, today recapped the presentation of clinical and translational data for its next-generation multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine candidate, GEO-CM04S1, delivered at IMMUNOLOGY2025™, the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI), held May 3–7, 2025, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

 The presentation, titled “Immunogenicity of Synthetic MVA-based Vaccine COH04S1 Against SARS-CoV-2 in Post-HCT/CAR-T Patients and Its Cross-Protective Potential Against Mpox” (Abstract Number: 9352), highlighted findings from an the initial segment of an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study in blood cancer patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy that was conducted by investigators at City of Hope Medical Center with the next-generation multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine COH04S1 (licensed by GeoVax as GEO-CM04S1), as well as studies with sera obtained from COH04S1-vaccinated healthy adults and non-human primates demonstrating induction of orthopox-specific and Mpox cross-reactive immune responses.

 The study in blood cancer/cell transplant patients demonstrated robust, durable, and broad anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses following vaccination with COH04S1, including cross-reactive immunity against variants of concern such as Omicron XBB.1.5. Immune responses in healthy adult and non-human primates receiving COH04S1 were cross-reactive against Mpox virus and found comparable to those in humans receiving the currently licensed smallpox/Mpox vaccine (Jynneos).  Further, sera from these vaccinated individuals were shown to protect against lung infection in susceptible mice challenged with Mpox virus.

 These studies demonstrate the potential of GEO-CM04S1 to provide protection against both COVID-19 and Mpox.

 “These findings underscore the differentiated potential of GEO-CM04S1 to serve dual roles as both a next-generation multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine and a cross-protective agent against Mpox,” said Kelly T. McKee, Jr., M.D., Chief Medical Officer of GeoVax. “The ability to stimulate strong, broad, and durable immunity, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, represents a meaningful advancement over current vaccines.  The added benefit of cross-reactive immunity against Mpox is especially important in regions where this virus is endemic, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding areas in Africa.”

 About GEO-CM04S1

 GEO-CM04S1 is a next-generation multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine designed using a synthetic Modified Vaccinia Ankara (sMVA) vector platform. The vaccine expresses both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens of SARS-CoV-2, offering the potential for broader and more durable immune protection across current and emerging variants. GEO-CM04S1 is licensed from City of Hope and is currently being evaluated in three Phase 2 clinical trials:

 1. As a primary vaccine in immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing stem cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy in a randomized comparison to mRNA vaccines.
2. As a booster vaccine for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in a randomized comparison to an mRNA vaccine.
3. As a booster for healthy adults previously vaccinated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The Company is also developing GEO-MVA, a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
