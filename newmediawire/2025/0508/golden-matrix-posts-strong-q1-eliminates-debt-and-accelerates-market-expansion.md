# Golden Matrix Posts Strong Q1; Eliminates Debt and Accelerates Market Expansion

LAS VEGAS, NV - May 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) (“Golden Matrix” or the “Company”), a developer, licensor, and global operator of online gaming platforms, today announced financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. The quarter reflects the Company’s strong group execution, platform innovation, and continued expansion across regulated gaming markets.

 Brian Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix, commented, "We entered fiscal 2025 with elevated operating efficiency and diversified revenue streams that continue to scale across high-growth markets. Our raffle segment reached all-time highs, our debt profile strengthened meaningfully, and our B2B and B2C businesses are both operating from positions of renewed financial and strategic strength."

 Financial and Strategic Highlights

 * Record Raffle Segment Performance: The Company’s raffle businesses reported all-time highs in revenue, ticket sales, and prize values. User growth surged 146% year-over-year, with 26,000 new registrations in Q1.
* Strategic Balance Sheet Optimization: GMGI eliminated approximately $9.6 million in Lind Global debt and converted over $9.5 million in Meridianbet acquisition-related debt into equity this year, enhancing financial flexibility.
* Revenue Growth: Q1 2025 consolidated revenue was $42.7 million, up 72% year-over-year, partially impacted by a negative 4% FX headwind
* Gross Profit: Gross profit reached $24.2 million, with a consolidated gross margin of approximately 57%. Meridianbet gross margin improved to 72%, while the combined GMAG and Rkings/CFAC segments improved to 29%.
* The Company had a net loss of $300,000 or a 0-cent loss per share. This was a decline of $4.2 million, or 5-cents a share, from the same period last year. The decline was due to an increase in acquisition-related amortization of $1.7 million, interest expense of $1.5 million, and stock-based compensation of $1 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by $0.3 million, or 5%, to $5.6 million, as increased gross profit was offset by an operating spend increase to expand our business geographically, improve our market share, and advance our gaming technology in support of full-year growth initiatives.

 Meridianbet Performance

 Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet, commented, "Our Q1 results demonstrate focused execution across regulated markets, bolstered by operational efficiency and continuous innovation. We are deepening user engagement, expanding licensing coverage, and strengthening our position as a global operator of choice."

 * Brazil: Secured a permanent online betting license, unlocking full national access in a projected $5.6 billion gross gaming revenue market for 2025.
* Africa: Launched B2B operations in Nigeria through a fully licensed local entity, entering one of Africa’s most dynamic gaming economies.
* Serbia: Renewed a 10-year online license, preserving regulatory continuity in a mature and profitable core market.
* User Metrics: First-time deposits grew 56%, new registrations rose 22%, and total deposits increased 12% compared to Q1 2024.
* Expanse Studios: Meridianbet’s proprietary game development arm expanded its North American footprint with five new integrations into U.S.-based sweepstakes casinos. The studio also advanced its in-house content roadmap, including an enhanced crash games portfolio and anticipates licensing in Romania for Q2.

 Financial Outlook

 Golden Matrix expects full-year 2025 revenue to range between $190 million and $195 million, reflecting a growth rate of 26% to 29% over 2024. The Company continues to invest in technology, content, and international licenses to drive long-term shareholder value.

 Rich Christensen, CFO of Golden Matrix, added, "We’re executing on disciplined capital allocation and long-term strategic investments. Our improving net leverage, healthy free cash flow, and scalable platform position us to accelerate growth across 2025 and beyond."(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Tax, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based Compensation Expense and Restructuring Costs", included in the tables at the end of this release.

 In terms of GAAP accounting and Meridianbet being the accounting acquirer, the comparisons presented are correctly stated and are reflective of our new structure. Comparisons presented in terms of GAAP are the consolidated Company’s results against Meridianbet Group historical results and not against Golden Matrix Group’s, historical results.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA or AEBITDA, is a “non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized in accordance with GAAP, is unaudited, and has limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reﬂect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reﬂect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reﬂect the signiﬁcant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reﬂect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures, please see the section titled “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based Compensation Expense and Restructuring Costs” included at the end of this release.
