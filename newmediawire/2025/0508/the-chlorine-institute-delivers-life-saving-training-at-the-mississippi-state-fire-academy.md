# The Chlorine Institute Delivers Life-Saving Training at the Mississippi State Fire Academy

JACKSON, MS - May 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Chlorine Institute (CI) returned to the Mississippi State Fire Academy last week for its annual CHLOREP Team Training, equipping first responders and hazmat professionals from around the globe with the knowledge and skills needed to respond swiftly and safely to chlorine-related emergencies.

 CHLOREP - The Chlorine Emergency Plan - is a mutual aid program established by CI to ensure rapid, expert support during chlorine incidents across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Chlorine plays a critical role in modern life - from drinking water disinfection and public health protection to pharmaceutical and energy production - making safe handling and emergency preparedness essential. This year’s training brought together 124 students from 30 states and four countries, including six Canadian provinces, Colombia, Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago, for an intensive, hands-on learning experience rooted in real-world emergency scenarios given by 75 expert instructors across the industry.

 Robyn Kinsley, CI’s Vice President of Transportation and Emergency Preparedness, emphasized the Institute’s commitment to proactive safety measures. In an interview with 16 WAPT News Jackson, Kinsley stated, "Our mission is safety-focused, so we try to prevent incidents, we to develop safety guidance for the plants or transportation. We want to reduce or eliminate incidents."

 While CI and the industry work diligently on preventing accidents, the CHLOREP training exemplifies CI’s dedication to ensuring that emergency responders worldwide are prepared, connected, and supported when seconds matter most.

 The Chlorine Institute exists to support the chlor-alkali industry in advancing safe, secure, environmentally compatible and sustainable production, distribution and use of its mission chemicals: chlorine, sodium and potassium hydroxides, sodium hypochlorite, the distribution of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), and the distribution and use of hydrogen chloride.  Visit us online at: www.chlorineinstitute.org.
