# Nephros Announces Financial Results for Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

First-Quarter Net Revenue of $4.9 million;Robust Growth Drives 38% Increase in Net Revenue

 SOUTH ORANGE, NJ - May 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Nephros, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEPH), a leading water technology company providing filtration solutions to the medical and commercial markets, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.

 Financial Highlights

 * Net revenue was $4.9 million, compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 38%
* Net income was $558,000, compared to a net loss of ($169,000) in the first quarter of 2024
* Adjusted EBITDA was $667,000, compared to ($95,000) in the first quarter of 2024
* Gross margin was 65%, compared to 62% in the first quarter of 2024

 “Q1 2025 marked a strong start to the year, with a record quarterly net revenue of $4.9M characterized by robust growth and all-time highs in both core programmatic business and emergency response business. Net revenue increased by $1.4 million, or 38%, in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024,” said Robert Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nephros. “More specifically, the results of our programmatic business in the first quarter represent a pinnacle in performance, additionally complemented by a similar peak within our dialysis business. These increases in demand reflect improved reorder rates and, we believe, demonstrate the value of our product portfolio.”

 Robert Banks noted, “As mentioned above, we saw a record escalation in emergency business along with more geographically diverse demand than in prior periods. While we continue to position ourselves as the company to rely on in a water-safety-related crisis, we do not anticipate this level of emergency activity to persist throughout the year, particularly with recent administrative changes and attitudes toward regulation. Rather, we continue to focus on our core programmatic business, an approach which continues to yield positive returns.”

 Commenting on overall performance and outlook, Robert Banks continued, “Taking the totality of our business results into account, our first-quarter results highlight growing market adoption and operational momentum, as further evidenced by our expanding number of active sites - a record high of 1,600 in Q1 - and the hundreds of filter locations logged within our digital support app. Looking ahead, although the recent tariff activity has created some macro-economic uncertainties, we believe Nephros is well-positioned among long-term customers and with strong margins, to maintain our footing and weather challenges. To reinforce our standing, Nephros will continue to innovate with a pipeline of new product launches and capability advancements.”Financial Performance for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

 Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 was $4.9 million, and $3.5 million respectively, an increase of 38%. Our core programmatic revenue grew by 23% over the same period in 2024.  The increase in programmatic sales reflects strong reorders, a number of new active sites, as well as some pre-ordering for the year ahead of a small price increase put through in February 2025.

 Cost of goods sold for the first quarter of 2025 was $1.7 million, compared with $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 29%.

 Gross margin for the first quarter of 2025 was 65%, compared with 62% in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a price increase implemented during the first quarter and a more favorable product mix coupled with lower inventory reserves and write-offs compared to the prior period.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $2.3 million, compared with $2.1 million in 2024, an increase of 5% due to higher sales commissions resulting from increased revenue and stock compensation expense.

 Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were $0.3 million, compared with $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 39% due to higher headcount.

 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $39,000, compared with approximately $33,000 in the first quarter of 2024.

 As a result of the improved sales and gross margins, net income for the first quarter of 2025 was $0.6 million, compared with a net loss of ($0.2 million) during the same period in 2024. We are extremely pleased to show our second quarterly net income in the Company’s history.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2025 was approximately $0.7 million, compared with approximately ($0.1 million) in the first quarter of 2024.

 As of March 31, 2025, Nephros had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.1 million, compared to $3.8 million as of December 31, 2024, and remains debt free.

 Adjusted EBITDA Definition and Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net income (loss) calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and excluding all interest-related expenses and income, tax-related expenses and income, non-recurring expenses and income, and non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, non-cash inventory write-offs, and non-cash compensation. The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year:

 

(unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 (in $ thousands) Net (loss) income                              558                           (169) Adjustments: Depreciation of property and equipment                               17                               11Amortization of other assets                               23                               23Interest expense  -                                  1Interest income                             (13)                             (25)Non-cash stock-based compensation                               76                                (9)Non-cash inventory impairments                                 6                               73 Adjusted EBITDA Income (loss)                             667                             (95)

 Nephros believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Nephros’ financial condition and results of operations. Management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in Nephros’ financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. To compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Nephros urges investors to review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.
