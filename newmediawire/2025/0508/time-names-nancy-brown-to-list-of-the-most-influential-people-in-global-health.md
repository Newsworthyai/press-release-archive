# TIME names Nancy Brown to list of the most influential people in global health

(NewMediaWire) - May 08, 2025 - DALLAS — Nancy Brown, Chief Executive Officer of the American Heart Association, has been named to TIME’s 2025 TIME100 Health, a list recognizing the 100 most influential individuals in health. The full list and related tributes appear in the May 26, 2025 issue of TIME, available on newsstands on Friday, May 16, and now at time.com/time100health.

 The list highlights the impact, innovation and achievement of the world’s most influential individuals in health. Leaders were selected by TIME based on their dedication to creating tangible, credible change for a healthier population.

 “It’s a tremendous honor to receive this recognition from TIME and to be mentioned alongside innovators also working to change the future of health in communities around the world,” said Brown. “This recognition is a tribute to our dedicated volunteers, patients, supporters and staff who champion the American Heart Association’s lifesaving work—advancing health and hope for everyone, everywhere.”

 Brown has served as CEO of the Association since 2008. Under her leadership, the organization has become a global force transforming the way the world understands, treats and prevents heart disease and stroke, the No.1 and No. 2 causes of death worldwide. A relentless advocate for patients, families and caregivers, Brown has accelerated the Association’s lifesaving research, science and innovation to empower people to live longer, healthier lives.

 To help address the historic and pervasive lack of investment in women’s health, Brown built on the Association’s groundbreaking  Go Red for Women® movement by launching a $75 million Go Red for Women Venture Fund®. The fund supports companies that are translating evidence-based science into products and services that drive better heart and brain health outcomes for women. She is also the driving force behind the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ movement, which aims to double survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest by 2030 as well as other vital initiatives like Health Care by Food™—all designed to meet people where they are.

 “Nancy is a visionary leader who forges powerful relationships to tackle some of healthcare’s biggest challenges by inspiring and mobilizing others to act with urgency,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and a retired executive from The PNC Financial Services Group. “With the Association’s second century underway, her leadership remains invaluable as we empower people to live their healthiest lives.”
