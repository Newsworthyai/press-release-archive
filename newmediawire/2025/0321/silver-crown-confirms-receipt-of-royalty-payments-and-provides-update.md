# Silver Crown Confirms Receipt of Royalty Payments and Provides Update

TORONTO, ONTARIO - March 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Silver Crown Royalties Inc. (Cboe: SCRI, OTCQX: SLCRF, BF: QS0) (“Silver Crown”, “SCRi”, the “Corporation”, or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the receipt of payments on its producing royalties. PPX Mining Corp. (“PPX”) has paid the royalty due to SCRi for the period ending March 31, 2025 in full in the amount of US$40,672.70 several weeks before it was due. Additionally, Elk Gold Mining Corp. (“Elk Gold”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold Mountain Mining Corp. (“GMTN”), has paid the first C$29,811.99 of its royalty payment due for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 5, 2025, SCRi agreed to delay Elk Gold’s payment of the residual $30,070.25 royalty payment due to SCRi for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 until March 31, 2025.  SCRi anticipates that Elk Gold will pay this residual amount owing on or before March 31, 2025.

 On Monday, March 17, 2025, GMTN announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2025. Highlights from the three months ended January 31st, 2025 include gold sales of 291 oz from 10,055 tonnes delivered grading at an average of 1.23 g/t. Low production results realized during the period were directly attributable to the planned winter work program, which substantially reduced operations throughout the quarter. As a result, production from the Elk Gold Project is consistent with the reduced activity level. The combination of lower stripping volumes and anticipated lower gold production in Q4 2025 resulted in reduced unit costs compared to Q4 2024.

 Historically, the silver to gold ratio at the Elk Gold mine was 2:1, implying silver production of approximately 573 oz during the period. SCRi’s royalty agreement with Elk Gold provides for a minimum quarterly royalty payment equal to the cash equivalent of 1,500 ounces of silver, almost 300% of the current quarterly silver output at the mine. Although part of GMTN’s update noted that its current technical report on the Elk Gold Project should not be relied upon, the minimum delivery ounces will remain unchanged while the Elk Gold Project remains in operation.

 Peter Bures, Silver Crown’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are thankful to PPX for their early royalty payment to SCRi, which showcases the successful ongoing operations at Igor 4. We are also encouraged by GMTN’s payment as mining at Elk resumes following the winter work program. We remain committed to supporting our partners and greatly value the collaborative endeavors that contribute to our collective achievements. Furthermore, we wish to underscore the efficacy of our minimum delivery provision, which has proven instrumental in mitigating additional downside risk associated with operating mines.”
