# Rainmaker Announces Successful Deployment of Another Fully Containerized Seawater to Tap System in Turks and Caicos

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. (OTC: RAKR), a global leader in water technology solutions, is thrilled to announce that its subsidiary, Miranda Water Technologies, has successfully deployed another fully containerized Seawater to Tap system in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The latest deployment is now fully operational at Northwest Point Condominiums in Providenciales.

 This cutting‑edge system draws directly from a deep saltwater well with salinity levels exceeding 40,000 PPM, which is even higher than the average salinity of most ocean water, typically around 35,000 PPM (NOAA). Over the past four months, the unit has produced over 2 million litres of high‑quality, remineralized drinking water, delivering reliable potable for both residents and guests.

 Designed for rapid deployment and operational flexibility, Miranda’s fully containerized R/OCell® system integrates with SmartCell remote monitoring and is backed by strong local support. Rainmaker remains committed to enabling decentralized, energy‑efficient water infrastructures in remote and island communities worldwide.

 Chris Potts, Chairman of Northwest Point Condominiums, said: “When I became Chairman, one of my first goals was to enhance our infrastructure. Access to fresh, safe drinking water was a top priority. With Miranda’s system, we now have a reliable, remotely monitored and locally supported water source. The turnkey solution delivered exactly what we needed, and I’m extremely happy with the results.”

 Michael O’Connor, Chairman and CEO of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc., added: “This deployment is a great example of how we combine proven international technology with strong local partnerships. While Miranda’s system represents some of the most energy efficient and compact water‑purification capabilities in the world, its immediate success in Turks and Caicos was made possible by the outstanding support of Been Construction Ltd, our key implementation and service partner on the ground.”

 This installation marks another containerized Miranda system now operating in Turks and Caicos, reinforcing Rainmaker’s ongoing push for resilient water infrastructure in the region.
