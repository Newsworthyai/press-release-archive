# BioKey Stands as a Strategic U.S. Pharmaceutical Platform Amid Global Tariff Shifts

ABVC’s 28,000 sq ft Silicon Valley Manufacturing Facility Stands Ready as Global Supply Chains Realign and Trust-based Localization Becomes Key

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - August 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today reaffirmed the strategic positioning of its fully owned subsidiary, BioKey, Inc., as a U.S.-based pharmaceutical platform designed to meet the urgent global demand for resilient, transparent, and compliant drug development and production.

 BioKey operates a 28,000-square-foot FDA-compliant pharmaceutical facility in Fremont, California, at the heart of Silicon Valley’s life sciences hub, which is home to more than 3,000 biotech companies.[1] While many are virtual or focused solely on early-stage R&D, BioKey is among the few with physical manufacturing capacity and regulatory execution under one roof.

 “While many are virtual, BioKey is physical. While others are adjusting, we are already aligned,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer.

 The BioKey site supports over 50 clinical trial batches annually, with infrastructure in place for both clinical supply and early commercial production. Its regulatory team specializes in FDA IND filings, including 505(b)(2) and botanical-based drug applications, offering rare expertise in both U.S. compliance and cross-border translation. BioKey’s current lease is a 5-year term set to expire in the winter of 2026, with the option to extend. While terms of a new lease are yet to be finalized, BioKey intends to continue operations at the current manufacturing facility for the foreseeable future.

 In 2025, the United States enacted tariffs of up to 40% on select pharmaceutical and medical imports from Asia. Meanwhile, the global pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) market, valued at $140 billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.2%, reaching $262 billion by 2030.[2] Companies with established U.S. infrastructure - especially those with proven compliance records - are now at a strategic advantage.

 “BioKey wasn’t built in response to this policy shift - we built it ahead of it,” said Dr. Patil. “We believe that foresight is now becoming a distinct competitive advantage.”

 With strong roots in both U.S. regulatory practice and cross-border development, BioKey offers a rare operational bridge for Asia-originated drug programs - particularly those from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia - seeking to enter the U.S. market without the risk of building infrastructure from scratch.For Asian biotech companies, the advantages of collaborating with BioKey include:

 * FDA regulatory alignment for IND, 505(b)(2), and botanical drug submissions
* Support in formulation transfer and CMC documentation - potentially reducing preparation time by 12 to 18 months
* Access to a fully operational 28,000 sq ft cGMP facility, avoiding significant upfront CapEx
* Culturally fluent project management for bilingual technical communication and FDA meetings

 “We understand the challenges Asian developers face when entering the U.S. - from formulation to filings to language. We built BioKey to solve them,” Dr. Patil added.

 According to IQVIA, 72% of Asia-based pharmaceutical companies cited increased difficulty accessing the U.S. market post-2024, with lack of local facilities and regulatory barriers being top concerns.[3]

 “BioKey reflects our belief that localization is not optional - it’s inevitable. In this new global landscape, trust will not be assumed. It must be demonstrated. And BioKey is ready,” Dr. Patil concluded.
