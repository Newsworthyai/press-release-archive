# Vycor Medical Releases Financial Results for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025

BOCA RATON, FL - August 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vycor Medical, Inc. (“Vycor” or the “Company”) (OTCQB-VYCO), today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.

 The Company operates through two business units: Vycor Medical, which produces the ViewSite™ Brain Access System (VBAS) for neurosurgery; and NovaVision®, a business in development which offers therapy programs to help patients recover from visual disorders after stroke or brain injury.

 Company Highlights

 * The Vycor Medical division revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 increased by 24% and 28%, respectively, most of the increase being from growth in international markets.
* Operating profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was $51,146 and $38,340, respectively, and non-GAAP operating profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was $84,481 and $106,944, respectively, all substantial increases over the 2024 periods.
* Vycor entered into new distribution agreements for France and Spain during the six months ended June 30, 2025, two important markets targeted for international expansion.
* Two new clinical papers were published involving the ViewSite Brain Access System (VBAS) during the three months ended June 30, 2025 in addition to the three papers published during the first three months of the year, bringing the total published peer reviewed clinical papers to 48. The two studies published were systematic reviews of tubular retractors in general brain surgery and neuro-oncology surgery, respectively, and highlighted the clinical advantages of VBAS.
* A new clinical study on NovaVision’s NeuroEyeCoach was published, comparing results from using the program at home or in a clinic. The study concluded that both home-based and clinic-based patients showed meaningful improvements with no significant differences in activities of daily living improvements, validating NeuroEyeCoach as an effective tool, whether used clinically or accessed remotely. This is an important study for the company given the significant drive in healthcare systems worldwide to access digital technologies in home settings.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information

 Non-GAAP Reconciliation

 Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures (including non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP net loss and loss per share), which exclude non-cash depreciation of purchased assets and non-cash stock-based compensation. Management does not consider these costs in evaluating the continuing operations of the Company. Therefore, management calculates the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this earnings release excluding these costs and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to enable it to analyze further, and more consistently, the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operations. Management believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measures gives them additional important information to enable them to assess, in the same way management assesses, the Company’s current and future continuing operations. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.

 Three months ended June 30, 2025

 On a GAAP basis the Company reported Operating Expenses of $364,125, an operating profit of $51,146, a net income of $23,887 and net income of $0.00 per share.

 Vycor’s GAAP operating costs include non-cash depreciation of purchased assets ($15,021) and non-cash stock compensation charges ($18,314). The Company is providing additional non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these charges and expenses, and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables included in this release.

 On a non-GAAP basis, taking into account these adjustments, operating expenses were $330,790, non-GAAP operating profit was $84,481, and non-GAAP net income was $57,222 or $0.00 per share.

 Six months ended June 30, 2025

These are non-cash charges related to assets which can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing costs and performance and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.

 (2) Non-Cash Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense relating to stock-based compensation issued to employees, outside directors and non-employees including stock options, restricted common stock, and warrants. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the fact that these amounts vary in size and timing, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense allows for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of stock-based compensation expenses on our operating results.
