# CMUV Bancorp Announces Regulatory Approvals Received for Sale of Assets to Frontwave Credit Union

EL CENTRO,CA - August 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CMUV Bancorp has received the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the sale of the assets and assumption of liabilities of Community Valley Bank to Frontwave Credit Union (“Frontwave”) (the “Asset Sale”) and subsequent dissolution of Community Valley Bank (the “Bank”) and CMUV Bancorp (the “Company”) (the Bank dissolution and Company dissolution together, the “Dissolutions”). We have also received the necessary corporate approvals to complete the Asset Sale and the Dissolutions.

 We expect that shareholders of the Company will receive approximately $25.00 per share, subject to adjustment for costs and expenses associated with the Dissolutions. Payment to shareholders will occur in multiple distributions, with the first distribution anticipated to occur following the completion of the Asset Sale, which is expected to be on or about September 30, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Distributions can be made only to shareholders who comply with the transmittal procedures.

 We intend to cause the Company’s common stock to no longer trade or be quoted on the OTCQB beginning on or about September 23, 2025. We expect to close our stock records at the same time. Thereafter, Company common stock will represent only the right to receive distributions.
