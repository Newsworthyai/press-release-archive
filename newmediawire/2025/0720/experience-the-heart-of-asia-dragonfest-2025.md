 Crowds at Dragonfest Expo (NewMediaWire) - July 20, 2025 - Glendale, CA - The Martial Arts History Museum is proud to host the 19th Annual Dragonfest expo happening this August 2, 2025 at the Glendale Civic Auditorium. Heralded as an Asian cultural and heritage event, it is more than that. It is a gathering, a reunion sort of speak, of martial arts fans, enthusiasts from all over the world to celebrate and support the museum.

 Coordinated by museum founder and president Michael Matsuda, Dragonfest, over the past nearly two decades, has gathered some of the biggest icons in martial arts history. From Bill Ryusaki, Fumio Demura, Tak Kubota, Leo Fong, all passed, but their legacy still dwells in the halls of the expo.

 The event, which begins at 11 am until 5 pm, is filled with 100 booths with vendors of jewelry, martial arts supplies, artwork, anime, and autograph signings from some of the arts biggest stars such as Michael Jai White, Cynthia Rothrock, Don Wilson, Simon Rhee, Phillip Rhee, James Lew, and many more.

 Special guests this year include celebrities such as Steve Oedekerk, Joe Mantegna, and more. There will be six lecture classes as part of the event, which will feature Benny Uquidez, Don Wilson, Michelle Manu, Lady Lallaine Reed, and more.

 Museum President Michael Matsuda “Every year we host this amazing event. And like the museum, you can feel the celebration of life and history throughout the day. Oh yes, there are many well-known icons in the house, but that’s not what Dragonfest is about. It’s about culture and history. We are trying to save our past and Dragonfest is a big part of that,” says Michael Matsuda.

 Throughout the day, Asian cultural performances grace the stage, including Chinese Lion dancing, Okinawan dancers, Hawaiian dancing and special guest, well well-known singer. Akusaa Powell.

 This is a charity event, and 100 percent of all funds collected go to the museum. “This is not designed for any one individual to sow in the proceeds, everyone volunteers and everything goes to the museum to keep their doors open.

 “We all gather for something bigger than us. We gather to support the Martial Arts History Museum. Without this museum, all, everyone’s history will be gone and lost forever in just five years. I encourage everyone, even if they can’t make it, give a donation to the museum,” adds Matsuda.

 Major sponsors for the event include Dr. Kemi Price, Musashi Collection, the city of Glendale, Supervisor Kathryn Barger and Dr. Robert Goldman.
