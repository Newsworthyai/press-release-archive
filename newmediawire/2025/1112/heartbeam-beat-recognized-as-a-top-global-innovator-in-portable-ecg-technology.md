 Cleared Indications for Use

 The HeartBeam System is a portable non-invasive recorder intended to record, store, and transfer a patient’s 3-Lead (in three-directions) electrocardiogram (“ECG”) acquired from 5 electrodes. The device is intended to be used by adult patients in either a clinical setting or at home. The device does not conduct cardiac analysis and can be used with an ECG Viewer software system for manual interpretation of non-life-threatening arrhythmias by a physician or healthcare professional. For full safety information, see the full Instructions for Use or Clinician Portal Manual.

 About HeartBeam, Inc.

 HeartBeam, Inc. is a medical technology company dedicated to transforming the detection and monitoring of critical cardiac conditions.
