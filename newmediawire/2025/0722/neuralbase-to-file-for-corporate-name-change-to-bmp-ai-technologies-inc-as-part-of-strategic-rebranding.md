# NeuralBase to File for Corporate Name Change to BMP AI Technologies Inc. as Part of Strategic Rebranding

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and recognized as a growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced that it is expected to formally initiate the process to change its corporate name to BMP AI Technologies Inc. within the week. The name change filing is a key part of a broader rebranding initiative aimed at aligning the Company’s legal identity with its core technology platform, market focus, and long-term strategic vision.

 The rebranding follows a year of rapid evolution for the Company, marked by the launch of its enterprise platform under the BMP AI brand - short for Bold, Modern, and Predictive. This philosophy has shaped the Company’s approach to intelligent automation, compliant AI workflows, and contextual enterprise collaboration tools.

 “We are excited to begin the next chapter of our journey as BMP AI Technologies Inc.,” stated Vighnesh Dobale, CEO of NeuralBase AI Ltd. “This new name better reflects the true direction of our company, one that is laser-focused on delivering cutting-edge AI solutions across industries, from intelligent automation to next-generation machine learning platforms.”

 Dobale continued: “While the name change marks a natural evolution of our brand, it also reflects our broader ambition. As we continue to grow and strengthen our operational and financial foundation, we intend to position the Company to meet the standards required for potential future uplisting opportunities. BMP is more than a name, it represents our commitment to modernity, innovation, and long-term value creation.”

 The transition to BMP AI Technologies Inc. will unify the Company’s legal and commercial identity, enhancing brand clarity across product, marketing, and investor communications. It also reinforces the Company’s commitment to innovation, transparency, and market leadership in the enterprise AI space. As part of the transition, the Company also intends to apply for a new ticker symbol to reflect the updated corporate name. The new symbol will be announced upon regulatory approval and will replace the current NBBI ticker on the OTC Markets.

 The Company will continue to operate uninterrupted during the transition, and no action is required from shareholders. Updated corporate branding, including a refreshed website, investor materials, and visual identity, will roll out in the coming weeks. The Company will provide timely updates as the transition progresses.
