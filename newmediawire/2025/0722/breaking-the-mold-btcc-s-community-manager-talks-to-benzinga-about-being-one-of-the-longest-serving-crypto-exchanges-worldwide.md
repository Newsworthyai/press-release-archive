# Breaking the Mold: BTCC's Community Manager Talks to Benzinga About Being One of the Longest-Serving Crypto Exchanges Worldwide

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Jermey Fok, community manager at BTCC, was recently sat down with Benzinga to discuss how the cryptocurrency exchange has been able to survive and thrive over the past fourteen years.

 BTCC is one of the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchanges, founded in June 2011, providing crypto futures trading services to users worldwide. The exchange offers perpetual futures on over 300 cryptocurrencies and spot trading on more than 200 currencies, including BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP and SHIB. The cryptocurrency exchange adopted industry-leading security standards early on, which it credits with its record of zero security incidents since its inception fourteen years ago. As of April, BTCC has over 7.04 million registered users around the world.

 “We have been here fourteen years and that was when Bitcoin was still a coffee’s worth, that’s pretty hard to imagine,” Fok told Benzinga’s Dan Leach in the interview. “We’ve survived four crypto winters…It’s been fourteen years of no security breaches and no insolvency issues.” That can’t be said of many other crypto exchanges that have faced data breaches and/or bankruptcies over the years.

 Volatility Driving The Growth

 In addition to boasting 7 million registered global users, BTCC is in growth mode, reporting first quarter volume of $815 billion and a 71% surge in futures trading. Fok said the growth during the first quarter was driven by volatility in the market that has been ever present this year. After all, so far in 2025, Bitcoin has set a new all-time high, and a lot of new crypto products have come online. As for the popularity of BTCC in general, Fok said that’s being driven by the crypto exchange’s two-pronged approach as part of which it is focused on security and providing users with an easy-to-use platform.

 “A lot of exchanges fail to provide the most core element of an exchange…ease of access. Crypto is hard to understand for a lot of people, and having it dumbed down is very attractive for a lot of crypto users. A lot of exchanges fail to capture that user experience,” said Fok. At the same time, BTCC is focused on security. “We try to refine and to carefully manage features to ensure security is the top thing. We understand we might not have features all the other exchanges provide but what we have is battle-tested,” he said further, noting that nothing is rolled out that is rushed or isn’t completely secure. Other exchanges may have more bells and whistles, but it comes at the expense of security.

 Rewarding Its Traders

 To celebrate its 14th anniversary this June, BTCC launched a trading contest on X and rolled out its 14-year momentum badge, which Fok said is the first of many reward badges to come. The idea of the badges is that traders are rewarded for engaging in certain actions, such as opening an account and funding it with a certain amount of money and then conducting a specified number of trades. Traders also get rewards for social tasks such as following BTCC on X, joining its Discord, following BTCC on Instagram and subscribing on YouTube.

 “In the future, there are a lot more badges to come,” said Fok. “These badges come with immediate rewards.” BTCC traders can expect to see badges around the holidays and many other events throughout the year, he said. What’s more, the crypto exchange is focusing more on the social aspects of its business, such as providing market insights and personal insights on trading, leveraging AI.

 All of it is about positioning BTCC for the next 14 years and beyond. “We’re not here for the trend, or one or two trades, we're here for the longer time,” said Fok.
