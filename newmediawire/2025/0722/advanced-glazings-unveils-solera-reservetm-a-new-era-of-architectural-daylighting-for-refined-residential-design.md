# Advanced Glazings Unveils Solera Reserve™, A New Era of Architectural Daylighting for Refined Residential Design

First Residential Rollout to Begin With Alair Homes Savannah, Bringing Industry-leading Translucent Glass to Luxury Homes Across the U.S. Southeast

 WILMINGTON, NC and SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - July 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Advanced Glazings Ltd., the pioneering force behind the world’s most elegant and high-performing daylighting solutions, is proud to announce the launch of Solera Reserve™, a groundbreaking translucent glazing product tailored specifically for refined residential design. Trusted for decades in landmark cultural and commercial architecture, Solera® now enters the home space for the first time by popular demand - blending beauty, performance, and wellness in one transformational product.

 This new offering is being piloted with Alair Homes® Low County, led by Partner David Balza, who will oversee a flagship residential rollout across an exclusive territory stretching from Jacksonville, Florida to Charleston, South Carolina.

 “Solera Reserve™ is what forward-thinking homeowners have been waiting for - something that doesn’t force you to choose between privacy, performance, and aesthetic,” said David Balza, Solera Reserve™ Dealer at Alair Savannah. “We’re honored to be the first to bring this product to market. It fits perfectly with our commitment to future-forward design and the pursuit of healthier, more livable homes.”  A Natural Choice for Visionary Design

 The pilot program with Alair Homes was a deliberate choice. Alair’s reputation for delivering state-of-the-art materials to discerning, design-driven homeowners makes it an ideal launch partner for Solera Reserve™. Balza and his team have cultivated a clientele that embraces innovation - and Solera’s category-defining blend of natural light diffusion, privacy, insulation, and elegance answers that call.

 Equally important is the geographic alignment: The U.S. Southeast is one of the most demanding environments for glazing solutions. High solar intensity, sweltering humidity, and relentless glare make traditional clear glass a liability. Solera Reserve® offers a transformative alternative, designed to tame the sun’s harshest effects while preserving light and enhancing comfort.

 “We chose the Southeast for a reason,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, Founder and Chairman of Advanced Glazings. “It’s a region that urgently needs a better way to work with natural light - not against it. Solera Reserve™ empowers architects and homeowners to embrace glass without the tradeoffs.”  Designed for Living, Engineered to Last

 Solera Reserve™ delivers a combination of performance characteristics rarely seen in a single residential glazing solution:

 * Light Diffusion Power (LDP) for full-spectrum, glare-free daylight throughout the home
* Up to R25 insulation and STC 48 acoustic attenuation, reducing HVAC demand and noise intrusion
* Built-in privacy without the need for blinds or window treatments
* Custom glass fabrication, including frit patterns, shapes, and daylight tuning options
* Maintenance-free, all-glass construction - no yellowing, fading, or degradation over time

 Whether used above, below, or beside vision glass, Solera Reserve™ balances openness and intimacy, creating serene, luminous spaces that align with the rhythms of human life.

 Exclusive Availability Through Premium Builders Solera Reserve™ will be available exclusively through a select network of premium dealers and builders, starting with Alair Savannah’s rollout in the Southeast. Future territories will be announced as part of a phased expansion strategy designed to maintain the product’s elite design standard and custom fabrication ethos.
