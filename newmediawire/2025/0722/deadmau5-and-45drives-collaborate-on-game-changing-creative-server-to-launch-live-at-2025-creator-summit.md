# deadmau5 and 45Drives Collaborate on Game-Changing Creative Server to Launch Live at 2025 Creator Summit

Ultra-Quiet, Passively Cooled Signature Series Server to Debut Live on Stage; Artist Will Also Perform at Creator Summit in Wilmington, NC

 WILMINGTON, NC and SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - July 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 45Drives, the leading open-source storage company trusted by enterprises, MSPs and homelabs alike, today announced that internationally renowned electronic music producer and performer deadmau5 will be the featured creator headliner at the upcoming 2025 Creator Summit, taking place September 8-12 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

 deadmau5 has been working closely with 45Drives’ R&D team on a groundbreaking new product: a signature series server built specifically for creative professionals. Designed for silent operation, low power consumption, and uncompromising SSD performance, it’s ideal for musicians, gamers, streamers, and digital artists of all kinds.

 Developed under 45Drives’ new 45Studio division - dedicated to meeting the needs of modern digital creatives - the server will be unveiled live by deadmau5 and 45Drives President Dr. Doug Milburn on Friday, September 12, during the Creative Artist Track of the Summit. The unveiling will feature a full spec reveal, a design showcase, and a behind-the-scenes look at the collaborative development process.

 The server is the first in a series of creator-designed systems being developed under 45Studio, a new product line announced earlier this year that aims to bring the power and openness of enterprise-grade infrastructure to the creative world. Each 45Studio system is purpose-built for demanding production environments - whether that’s rendering video, producing music, or developing games - and engineered to empower creators with maximum control over their workflows, their data, and their hardware.

 “deadmau5 represents the kind of creator who refuses to compromise - and that’s exactly who we built 45Studio for,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President and Co-Founder of 45Drives. “This isn’t just a partnership; it’s a shared belief that open, scalable hardware should be in the hands of the people actually making things. We’re proud to have built something truly new with him.”

 The 2025 Creator Summit marks a major evolution for 45Drives, with a move to the U.S., expanded programming, and a strategic focus on creatives alongside enterprise IT professionals. deadmau5’s participation and product collaboration represent a milestone moment for the company as it continues to reimagine what infrastructure looks like in the age of individual creators and small studios.

 The full 2025 Creator Summit schedule - including workshop sessions, keynotes, and performance details - will be announced later this summer. To register or learn more, visit: https://www.45drives.com/creators-summit/#form
