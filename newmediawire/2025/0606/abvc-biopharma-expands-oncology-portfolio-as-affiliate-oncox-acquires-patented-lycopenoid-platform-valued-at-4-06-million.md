# ABVC BioPharma Expands Oncology Portfolio as Affiliate OncoX Acquires Patented Lycopenoid Platform Valued at $4.06 Million

ABVC's Oncology Licensing to OncoX Highlights Scalable Royalty Strategy

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - June 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today announced that its affiliate, OncoX BioPharma Inc., has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire full ownership of the Lycopenoid Lycogen® platform, including patented manufacturing technology and commercialization rights, from Asia-Pacific Biotech Developing Inc. (APBDI). The transaction, structured as an equity-based acquisition, reflects a total value of approximately USD $4.06 million.[1]

 Strategic Royalty Structure to Benefit ABVC

 The Lycogen® acquisition is expected to unlock significant commercial potential for OncoX across dermatology, oncology, and nutraceutical sectors. Based on internal forecasts, OncoX estimates that, depending on future market conditions and product development milestones, cumulative revenue over the next five years could approach USD $25–30 million. Under ABVC’s existing licensing framework with OncoX, a share of these revenues will flow back to ABVC in the form of royalty payments, allowing ABVC to capitalize on downstream value. This structure exemplifies ABVC’s strategy of leveraging affiliate-driven development to achieve non-dilutive revenue growth.

 Lycogen® is a next-generation lycopene-analog produced by microbial fermentation using the patented WL-APD911 strain. With potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it has demonstrated preclinical promise in cancer-related and metabolic disease models. The acquisition positions OncoX to further develop the asset for targeted oncology indications and expand its pipeline of natural compound-based therapies.

 “OncoX’s acquisition of the Lycogen® platform further enhances ABVC Group’s position in botanical oncology innovation,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction strengthens our pipeline and demonstrates our ability to convert platform assets into monetizable growth.”

 Oncology Licensing Deal Already Delivering

 ABVC’s direct licensing agreement with OncoX for its broader oncology pipeline includes a deal valued up to $105 million, with equity-based consideration internally valued at $25 million already received. This milestone demonstrates the viability of ABVC’s scalable revenue model via strategic product licensing and affiliate activation.

 According to Precedence Research, the global oncology drug market exceeded USD $208 billion in 2023, with projected growth to $484 billion by 2032. In parallel, the global lycopene-based ingredients market is projected to surpass $170 million by 2029, reflecting growing demand for multifunctional natural compounds in both therapeutic and consumer applications.

 This transaction not only strengthens OncoX’s commercialization capability but also reflects ABVC’s long-term growth architecture - using platform assets in an attempt to drive clinical value and generate shareholder return through tiered partnerships.
