 “We have already identified initial partners for these new offerings. It’s an exciting commercial opportunity and we also expect short term business wins from this collaboration,” said Maickel Abdou, CEO of Telvantis’ subsidiary, Telvantis Voice Services Inc. “This MOU is an important step to stay close and relevant in the market. Technology keeps evolving and with Fortytwo we will stay at the forefront to serve our partners.”

 “We are a tech messaging and mobile engagement company and a recognized veteran in the industry. Partnering with a voice powerhouse like Telvantis will definitely open new doors for us,” said Glen Warren, GM at Fortytwo. “The team is very excited about joining forces.”

 Joint market entry into the US enterprise segment. The market entry will focus on bringing Fortytwo’s advanced mobile messaging solutions directly to medium sized enterprises in the US, replicating Fortytwo’s existing business model.

 “We are very excited to announce the launch of our enterprise offering with this MOU. Fortytwo is the ideal technology partner with the right mix of sophisticated services, boutique customer care and hands-on solutions delivery,” said Maickel Abdou.

 “Our enterprise business is fast growing and at structurally higher margins that Telvantis’ voice business. Leveraging Telvantis’ US market presence and substantial commercial relations will allow us to create significant additional value,” said Glen Warren, GM at Fortytwo. “It is a very exciting time in our dynamic industry and the opportunity to work closer with Telvantis will benefit all stakeholders through combining our technology expertise with Telvantis’ local commercial footprint.”

 The MOU further commits both parties to Accelerated Merger Discussions.

 “We believe that Fortytwo and its very advanced technologies, products and services would be a tremendous addition to our US based group. There is a significant commercial opportunity ahead of us if we join forces. It is only logical to consider combining both entities,” commented Daniel Contreras.

 “Fortytwo is a great company and its addition to the Telvantis group would strengthen our equity story for a regulated market substantially. We are working diligently to evaluate this option on an accelerated track. The market will be updated over the coming weeks how this potential acquisition will be structured and how it fits into our uplisting strategy,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. ”We believe bringing Fortytwo’s differentiated offering into the US poses a significant growth opportunity which we would like to fully participate in.”
