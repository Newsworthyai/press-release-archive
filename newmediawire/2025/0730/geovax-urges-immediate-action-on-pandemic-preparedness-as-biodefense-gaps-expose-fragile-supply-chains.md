# GeoVax Urges Immediate Action on Pandemic Preparedness as Biodefense Gaps Expose Fragile Supply Chains

With Mpox spreading globally, COVID-19 variants evading immunity, and bipartisan leaders demanding U.S.-based solutions, GeoVax calls for urgent investment in domestic manufacturing and vaccine diversification

 ATLANTA, GA - July 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigenic vaccines and immunotherapies, today renewed its call for decisive U.S. action on pandemic preparedness and biodefense. With escalating outbreak risks, public health system strain, and growing bipartisan consensus for domestic solutions, GeoVax underscored the urgent need to modernize the nation’s countermeasure infrastructure and end foreign vaccine dependency.

 “The warning signs are multiplying,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. “We are facing the global expansion of virulent Mpox strains, immune-evasive COVID variants, and a national stockpile reliant on outdated, offshore platforms. Pandemic readiness must be built at home - with modern, American-made solutions and proactive government-industry leadership.”

 GeoVax’s Domestic Platform for Emerging and Endemic Threats

 GeoVax’s Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine platform anchors two front-line candidates:

 * GEO-MVA for Mpox/smallpox, designed to protect against both Clade I and II Mpox strains.
* GEO-CM04S1, a multi-antigen, next-generation COVID-19 vaccine targeting the 40 million U.S. immunocompromised through robust, durable, antibody and T-cell–driven immune protection.

 The vaccine candidates are supported by Phase 2 clinical data (GEO-CM04S1) and favorable clinical development guidance from the European Medicines Agency (GEO-MVA) and current development plans include the implementation of an advanced MVA continuous avian cell line manufacturing process for U.S.-based, scalable production.

 New Health Threats Demand Immediate Preparedness

 * Mpox: The World Health Organization maintains Mpox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Clade I outbreaks have now spread to numerous continents, including sustained transmission in China and wastewater detection in the U.S. New data from the Democratic Republic of the Congo confirmed vertical transmission during pregnancy, raising fresh concerns for maternal and neonatal health.
* COVID-19: The NB.1.8.1 (“Nimbus”) variant continues to gain dominance, prompting updated CDC guidance recommending boosters for vulnerable groups, including older adults and the immunocompromised. However, mRNA vaccine uptake remains low in these populations, reinforcing the need for broader, longer-lasting immunity options like GEO-CM04S1.

 Alarmingly, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) remains overly dependent on a single foreign supplier for Mpox/smallpox MVA vaccine, which is reportedly unable to supply the current estimated global needs. Most concerning, the U.S. government has had to continuously shift MVA vaccine from the SNS, which is primarily intended for biosecurity purposes, resulting in a vicious cycle of SNS replenishment, followed by further reduction of the SNS as Mpox outbreaks continue.

 “The cost of delay is steep, and the status quo is unacceptable,” said Dodd. “The United States needs increased MVA vaccine competition - not complacency and dependency on a foreign, monopolistic supplier.”

 Bipartisan Momentum and Federal Mandate for Action

 Policymakers across the aisle are rallying behind a more secure biodefense posture:

 * At BIO 2025, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Chief of Staff Mark O’Neill emphasized the need for onshoring, platform diversification, and public-private partnerships to strengthen domestic pandemic response capabilities.
* In Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike are advancing legislation to reduce foreign dependency and prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing and procurement for pandemic countermeasures.

 “GeoVax supports and welcomes this emerging consensus,” Dodd added. “We’re aligned with ASPR and BARDA priorities - and we’re ready to deliver. Swift, decisive government action is needed.”

 Preparedness Requires Investment - Before the Next Crisis

 More than 120 nations have signed the new WHO Pandemic Agreement, and the U.S. is scaling its biodefense footprint through mobile biocontainment units, genomic surveillance, and expanded diagnostics. Yet, without domestically produced, next-generation vaccines and a diversified stockpile, those efforts will fall short.

 “We commend HHS, BARDA, ASPR, and congressional leaders for sounding the alarm,” concluded Dodd. “Now is the time to fund, procure, and manufacture domestically - before the next emergency hits.”

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
