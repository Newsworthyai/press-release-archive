# NeuralBase to Acquire HeartEase, Set to Revolutionize Enterprise Wellness and Preventive Health Diagnostics

LAS VEGAS, NV - July 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and a growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, is pleased to announce that it has executed an agreement to acquire HeartEase, a cutting-edge AI-powered diagnostic platform that uses smartphone microphones to detect early signs of heart abnormalities. This strategic acquisition marks a bold step in NeuralBase's mission to integrate wellness-focused, preventive healthcare solutions into its enterprise AI chatbot ecosystem.

 With rising demand from corporations and institutions for integrated employee wellness solutions, NeuralBase recognized a growing gap in tools that go beyond mental health chatbots and provide actionable health diagnostics. HeartEase fills this need by enabling non-invasive, accessible, and real-time heart health screening through mobile devices - a perfect complement to BMP AI’s enterprise-focused chatbot technology.

 "We believe that HeartEase will become a revolutionary platform as it harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and mobile technology to provide early detection of heart abnormalities. Unlike traditional diagnostics, it requires no external hardware - only a smartphone," stated Vighnesh Dobale, CEO of NeuralBase.

 Key Features of HeartEase are expected to include:

 * Smartphone-Only Diagnostics: Records heart sounds using the phone’s built-in microphone, removing the need for stethoscopes or peripherals.
* Global Accessibility: Designed for use in low-resource settings, rural clinics, and field health campaigns.
* Privacy-Focused: Future updates include offline diagnostic capabilities to ensure data privacy and access in disconnected areas.
* Scalable Roadmap: Plans underway to expand into AI-based screening for lung issues, anemia, and diabetes.

 This targeted acquisition represents a transformational shift in how enterprises can care for their workforce. BMP AI’s chatbot platform already supports companies with intelligent task automation, HR interactions, and employee engagement tools. The addition of HeartEase allows enterprises to take employee care to a whole new level by integrating preventive health screening into the daily digital experience - right on employees’ smartphones.

 “With HeartEase, we’re not just improving enterprise chatbot functionality - we’re redefining how technology can protect and empower people in their everyday lives,” added Dobale. “We see this as the foundation for a broader wellness initiative that supports both mental and physical health across global workplaces.”

 The backend AI engine of HeartEase is already fully trained using validated clinical datasets, and mobile integration is underway. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is slated for rapid field testing in Q4 2025, with pilots targeting enterprise clients, wellness programs, and rural health campaigns.

 As businesses increasingly recognize the ROI of employee wellness, from lower healthcare costs to higher productivity and retention, NeuralBase’s acquisition of HeartEase is set to deliver a unique competitive edge. It places the company at the forefront of AI-driven preventive healthcare, bridging the gap between enterprise tech and real-world impact.

 With this move, NeuralBase continues its commitment to building technologies that scale ethically, inclusively, and intelligently, transforming how companies operate.

 The closing of the transaction is subject to the completion of customary due diligence and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. NeuralBase will provide further updates if and when available.
