# BFCH Unveils Business Plan and Platform Vision Following Leadership Transition and Structural Reset

CRESTVIEW, FL - July 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTC: BFCH), doing business as EVERMIND Holdings, Inc., today announced the publication of its updated strategic business plan following a recent change in control, leadership transition, and material restructuring of its capital base.

 On July 21, 2025, physician-entrepreneur Dr. Jordan P. Balencic was appointed Chief Executive Officer following a formal change of control and board resolution. As the Company’s new controlling shareholder and CEO, Dr. Balencic brings a long-term ownership mindset and has moved quickly to realign BFCH’s corporate strategy, strengthen its financial position, and begin rebuilding trust with the Company’s investor base. The roadmap ahead centers on transforming BFCH into a restructured public platform focused on human optimization, cognitive performance, and longevity infrastructure.

 “In just one week, we’ve made meaningful progress in resetting the structure of the Company,” said Dr. Balencic. “The newly released business plan outlines our preliminary roadmap and current thinking as we work to reposition the organization toward long-term value creation. This is an exciting and rapidly evolving space, and I encourage investors to conduct their own research into the total addressable market and emerging opportunities - we believe there’s more potential here than most people realize.”

 Early Restructuring Milestones Achieved in First Week Post-Transition:

 Since the leadership transition, BFCH has taken the following actions:

 * Retired more than $2 million in legacy convertible debt through a fixed-price equity settlement
* Capped dilution through a $0.01 per share fixed-price conversion ceiling, with a 200 million share hard cap
* Reduced total liabilities to under $94,000
* Submitted updated documentation to OTC Markets and initiated corporate rebranding to EVERMIND Holdings, Inc.

 As outlined in the business plan, the $0.01 per share threshold reflects a negotiated, fixed-price equity conversion designed to eliminate variable-rate dilution from legacy obligations. Beyond that, it serves as a structural benchmark - establishing a transparent, disciplined floor from which the Company intends to build.

 Management views this threshold not as a reflection of intrinsic value, but as a structural reference point aligned with the Company’s current capital position and operating strategy. At an implied market cap of approximately $12 million, it establishes a consistent baseline from which future corporate activities - such as early-stage acquisitions or capital formation - may be planned and evaluated.

 Future equity activity will be structured in alignment with measurable execution milestones and long-term value creation.

 EVERMIND Holdings: Targeting Growth at the Intersection of Health, Technology, and Infrastructure

 The EVERMIND Holdings platform is designed to operate across three synergistic divisions - each targeting scalable, asset-backed opportunities in human optimization, cognitive performance, and longevity-focused innovation.

 * EVERMIND Labs - Focused on acquiring, developing, and scaling consumer-facing wellness brands that address the rising demand for brain health, mood support, longevity, and performance enhancement. This division is expected to serve as the Company’s primary revenue driver as the platform matures.

 * EVERMIND Technologies - A future-focused division designed to identify, acquire, and incubate technologies at the intersection of brain performance, digital health, and longevity. This includes potential investments in neuro-assessment platforms, cognitive health apps, wearable devices, biometric feedback tools, and AI-driven performance analytics. The goal is to build a portfolio of scalable assets that complement EVERMIND’s consumer and infrastructure strategy while enabling data-backed optimization across physical, cognitive, and biological domains.

 * EVERMIND Manufacturing - A long-term strategic initiative to explore the development of domestic co-manufacturing infrastructure for functional consumer products. This division is designed to increase supply chain resilience, support internal brands, and serve third-party partners in the functional beverage, nutrition, and supplement categories.

 The business plan anticipates that each division may operate independently, contribute to overall platform growth, and, where appropriate, support future spin-off potential.

 Planned Capital Formation and Initial Asset Development

 To support the next phase of development, the Company is preparing to initiate a $150,000 seed round to fund near-term objectives, including:

 * Completion of rebranding and regulatory filings
* Initiation of operational planning within EVERMIND Labs
* Legal and accounting infrastructure to support asset integration
* Design and buildout of corporate communications and investor relations strategy

 The Company is also evaluating a potential Regulation A offering, which may commence later in 2025, subject to share price, applicable filings, and qualifications. Any securities offerings will be conducted pursuant to available exemptions under federal and state securities laws.

 As of the date of this release, no definitive agreements for acquisitions have been signed. The Company is, however, in preliminary discussions regarding one or more potential transactions.

 Corporate Communications & Disclosure Infrastructure

 EVERMIND Holdings, Inc. is in the process of developing an updated FINRA-compliant corporate website featuring a dedicated investor relations section. All required documentation has been submitted to OTC Markets, and Company fees are paid in full. Once portal access is granted, BFCH will begin updating public disclosures and corporate information.

 A corporate communications plan is in development to ensure ongoing transparency and alignment with evolving investor expectations.

 In accordance with SEC guidance encouraging issuers to identify their official disclosure channels, BFCH advises investors and media that it uses the following platforms to share material information:

 * Corporate Website: https://evermindholdings.com
* X / Twitter: https://x.com/bfchco
* OTC Markets Disclosure Portal: https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/BFCH/disclosure
