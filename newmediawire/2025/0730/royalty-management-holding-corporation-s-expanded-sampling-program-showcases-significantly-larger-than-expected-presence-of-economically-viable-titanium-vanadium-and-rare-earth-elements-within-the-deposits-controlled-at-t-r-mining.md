# Royalty Management Holding Corporation's Expanded Sampling Program Showcases Significantly Larger Than Expected Presence of Economically Viable Titanium, Vanadium and Rare Earth Elements Within the Deposits Controlled at T.R. Mining

T.R. Mining, a portfolio company of Royalty Management, has previously demonstrated high concentrations of iron ore, titanium and vanadium, coupled with an export permit through an affiliated company

 Expanded sampling program performed by the Company shows the presence of other rare earth elements that can be monetized alongside the other valuable elements

 FISHERS, INDIANA - July 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce that the Company has conducted an expanded sampling program at its T.R. Mining & Equipment portfolio holding company that demonstrates the existence of additional valuable elements within the special exclusive prospecting lease located in Jamaica and containing 213 million tons of raw feedstock. Original resource assessment identified iron ore, titanium, and vanadium and the primary valuable elements within this area controlled by T.R. Mining, but an expanded sampling program and analysis performed on the black sand indicates the existence of valuable rare earth elements as well, which are used in a variety of critical applications, primarily for the production of rare earth magnets, which powers everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to defense equipment, data centers and high-tech consumer electronics.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “With this expanded sampling program and analysis performed of the resource at T.R. Mining, we have identified meaningfully high concentrations of core materials along with additional high-value rare earth and critical minerals that we can extract. Most importantly, we are confident based on the analysis and concentration, coupled with the simple mining method, that this project will showcase some of the lowest cost titanium, magnetite, and vanadium feedstock sources available in the marketplace. T.R. Mining’s prior resource assessment report identified attractive quantities of iron ore, which can be sold as magnetite, titanium, and vanadium elements. With this additional analysis, we can now add rare earth elements to the list of valuable minerals contained within T.R. Mining’s controlled area.”

 Tom continued, “With our mining permit underway, our plan is to soon start hiring and employing local personnel in Jamaica to help separate the valuable iron ore from the rest of the raw feedstock, which in of itself represents nearly half of the resource at this site, and from there separate the other high-value elements such as titanium, vanadium, and now the identified presence of rare earth elements as additional products we can concentrate and sell to refiners. For every sale of products out of T.R. Mining’s licensed area, Royalty Management will receive a royalty for our investment in the company. Through our offtake partner and their refining technology, we have the ability to maximize the value out of this resource, for both our Company and for the country of Jamaica, by being able to monetize greatly more products that exist within this permit.”

 Through its investment in T.R. Mining & Equipment Ltd., the Company holds a royalty on minerals extracted from the permitted site in the amount of 10% of the sales of rare earth and other elements from T.R. Mining. Royalty Management is working closely with its consultants and management of T.R. Mining to complete the mining permit and start production at this site for resource extraction and sales, thereby providing valuable employment opportunities for Jamaica. Royalty Management intends to conduct additional testing of the resource to further define the concentrations and extent of the elements of interest within this controlled area as part of its permit package.
