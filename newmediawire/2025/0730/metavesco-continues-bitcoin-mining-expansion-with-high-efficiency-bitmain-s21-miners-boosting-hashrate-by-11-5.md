 Stacking Smarter: A Dual-Asset Treasury Strategy

 The mining expansion builds on Metavesco’s recently announced Ethereum position, forming a dual-asset digital treasury strategy that prioritizes long-term shareholder value, capital efficiency, and non-dilutive growth.

 “We view Bitcoin as our digital gold and Ethereum as the infrastructure layer of global finance,” said Schadel. “Our strategy is simple: acquire high-conviction digital assets, either by mining or opportunistic buys and do it in a way that builds balance-sheet strength with minimum dilution to shareholders.”
