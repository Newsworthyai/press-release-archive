# Hydromer Reports Strategic Investment by JMEDTECH, and Formation of Its New Board of Directors

CONCORD NC - October 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hydromer, Inc. (OTC: HYDI) (the “Company”), a leader in hydrophilic, thromboresistant, and antimicrobial coating technologies for medical devices for over 44 years, founded in 1980, is pleased to announce a strategic investment in its business, made by jMedtech. Alongside this partnership, Hydromer is strengthened by a refreshed Board of Directors. Michael Torti will continue to serve as CEO & Director, working with Chairman Jacqueline Zhang and the Board to provide strong leadership, deep industry expertise, and vision as Hydromer enters its next phase of growth and innovation. We extend our gratitude to Braeden Lichti and George Kovalyov for their leadership and contributions as they now depart the company.

 Hydromer and jMedtech are joining forces to build a future-oriented global medical device coating platform. This platform integrates UV-curable and thermal-cure coating systems, supported by advanced coating equipment and regionalized coating services, to provide customers worldwide with a comprehensive solution spanning R&D, validation, and mass production.

 This move not only amplifies Hydromer’s technological and brand influence but also marks a critical milestone in jMedtech’s global expansion.

This significantly enhances supply chain resilience and responsiveness, creating greater value for customers.

For over 40 years, Hydromer has been an innovator in the surface conversion coatings industry and now, with the support of one of the most innovative companies in our industry, together we will bring perhaps the broadest range of coating capabilities, including automatic large-scale coating systems, to the Global Medical Device marketplace.
