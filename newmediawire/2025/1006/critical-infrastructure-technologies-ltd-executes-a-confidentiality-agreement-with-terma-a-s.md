# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. Executes a Confidentiality Agreement With Terma A/S

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLOMBIA - October 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to announce the execution of a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with Terma A/S, a leading Danish ence, and security company headquartered in Lystrup, Denmark.

 With a significant increase in the number of unauthorized drones entering EU airspace, particularly around airports, the collaboration between CiTech and Terma aims to deliver a powerful, rapidly deployable solution. CiTech’s fully autonomous 20-metre Nexus tower, capable of being relocated within one hour and fitted with Terma’s advanced surveillance and sensor technologies, will provide a highly effective countermeasure to the aerial threats currently being experienced across the region.

 The NDA establishes a framework for the secure exchange of proprietary and technical information between CiTech and Terma, supporting discussions toward future collaboration opportunities involving CiTech’s advanced technologies and platforms.

 Following the successful signing of the NDA, CiTech and Terma are also in the process of preparing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to consolidate and formalize their growing relationship. The MoU will outline areas of deeper technical cooperation and joint solution development to address emerging defence and security challenges across Europe and globally.

 “This NDA with Terma marks an important step forward in expanding CiTech’s international partnerships with recognised leaders in defence and aerospace technology,” said Brenton Scott, CEO, CiTech. “Terma’s global reputation for engineering excellence and mission-critical solutions complements CiTech’s focus on delivering advanced, integrated platforms for government and industry customers.”

 The agreement underscores CiTech’s growing network of international relationships as part of its ongoing development of the Nexus platform and other advanced solutions that serve defence, government, border security / surveillance and critical infrastructure applications.
