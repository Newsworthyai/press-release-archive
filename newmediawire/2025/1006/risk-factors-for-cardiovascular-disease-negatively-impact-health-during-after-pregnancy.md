# Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease Negatively Impact Health During, After Pregnancy

Research Highlights:

 * In a review of medical records for more than 56,000 pregnancies over a 20-year period, about 15% of pregnancies were impacted by cardiovascular complications like heart attack or stroke, hypertension-related conditions or maternal death.
* The prevalence of complications rose over time, driven by increases in health risk factors for cardiovascular disease like obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
* Experts say engaging with a health care provider before, during and after pregnancy is critical to ensure optimal health for mother and baby.

 DALLAS - October 6, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Cardiovascular-related health problems may occur in as many as 1 out of every 7 pregnancies, even among people who don’t already have heart disease, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal Circulation.

 A review of more than 56,000 pregnancies occurring between 2001 and 2019 within the Mass General Brigham health care system in New England found a steady rise in cardiovascular-related complications during pregnancy. Conditions such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, blood clots, hypertensive disorders, and maternal death affected approximately 15% of pregnancies. The increase was most pronounced among individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, but it was observed across all age groups and even among those without prior health issues.

 These increases were impacted by a rise in health risk factors present before and during pregnancy. Among study participants:

 * Obesity increased from 2% in 2001 to 16% in 2019.
* High blood pressure increased from 3% to 12%.
* High cholesterol increased from 3% to 10%.
* Diabetes increased from 1% to 3%.

 “Most of these health risk factors can be prevented through lifestyle changes or medication. Yet, many of my patients aren’t even aware they have these conditions or that they’re at risk,” said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women’s health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women’s Health of Northwell Health in New York City. “If you're planning to become pregnant, I strongly encourage you to connect with a clinician early to understand your risks and take steps to reduce them. During pregnancy, stay proactive about your health. Listen to your body and your provider to address any concerns that arise. And don’t overlook the postpartum period, which also carries important health considerations. Starting before pregnancy and continuing after birth, there are valuable opportunities to make heart-healthy choices that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and support long-term wellness.”
