# MWG Holdings' VP of Marketing, Nicole Hanratty, to Speak at MJ Unpacked St. Louis on Brand Building vs. Performance Marketing in Cannabis

SACRAMENTO, CA - August 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today that Nicole Hanratty, VP of Marketing at MWG Holdings Group, Inc. will be a featured panelist at this year’s MJ Unpacked, taking place at the historic Union Station Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. Hanratty will join a panel of leading cannabis c-suite professionals to discuss one of the industry’s most pressing challenges: how to balance brand awareness and performance marketing under tight budget constraints.

 MJ Unpacked is the premier national cannabis event exclusively for license holders and accredited investors, offering a highly curated forum for connection, collaboration, and deal-making. The panel, titled “Brand Awareness vs. Performance: Finding the Right Balance on a Budget,” will be held on Wednesday, Sept. 3, from 2:20PM - 3:00PM CDT. This panel will explore how leaders are deploying high-ROI tactics to meet quarterly revenue and EBITDA targets, while simultaneously cultivating brand affinity, sustaining same-store sales growth, and managing cash flow discipline in a constrained capital environment.

 “Vertically integrated companies face a constant challenge: optimizing marketing budgets between demand-generation initiatives that deliver immediate topline revenue and strategic brand-building campaigns that strengthen long-term equity,” said Nicole Hanratty, VP of Marketing at MWG Holdings Group, Inc. “I look forward to collaborating and sharing impactful lessons we have learned while growing our retail chain’s annual revenue with industry partners at MJ Unpacked. Finding the balance between brand building and performance means getting laser-focused on the effectiveness of spend. With the right tools, community outreach, creative campaigns, and strong PR can all be achieved – even on a budget.”

 Hanratty, who previously spoke at MJ Unpacked in St. Louis in 2024 and has been featured on stage in mainstream business forums such as the VIBE Conference earlier this year, brings a unique perspective at the intersection of cannabis, marketing and brand strategy.
