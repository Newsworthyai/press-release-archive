ReElement Technologies and Vulcan Elements ink deal to supply United States with Rare Earth Magnets

 Royalty Management looks forward to working with both parties to source and supply rare earth mined and recycled feedstock from Royalty’s controlled properties and investments to support their production

 FISHERS, IN - August 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, announced today that the Company applauds the recently announced agreement between ReElement Technologies Corporation and Vulcan Elements to be one of the first partnerships in the United States to build a cost focused rare earth magnet supply chain. Royalty Management, through its various portfolio investments and royalty holdings, is well positioned to help source and sell to ReElement Technologies various mined and recycled rare earth mineral feedstock as they work to expand their refining and separation process and need more feedstock.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “We are excited about this new agreement between two leading companies in the rare earth space: ReElement Technologies for refining and processing, and Vulcan Elements for using the ReElement-refined products for rare earth magnet manufacturing. Over the past few years, Royalty Management has been working diligently to find and secure attractive opportunities and investments in the rare earth element industry, in particular by securing various feedstock sources for rare earths, such as our holdings in rare earth mines, NeoRe, SpA and our mined coal sources in eastern Kentucky. This builds on our already existing agreement with ReElement to help provide them with sourced raw materials for their refining.”

 Tom continued, "While Advanced Magnet Lab in Melbourne, Florida, is likely the first company to recently and successfully manufacture the first magnet in the United States utilizing their proprietary and novel magnet technology - which Royalty Management is incredibly excited to be a part of their efforts too - the announcement by ReElement Technologies and Vulcan continues to emphasize the importance of expanding these magnet manufacturing abilities here within the US. We are in active discussions with ReElement Technologies to help their multi-faceted expansion by being one of their suppliers of additional source feedstock for their oxide refining and separation operations, and we are pleased that we have existing feedstock sources for this partnership."

 Through its portfolio of companies and royalties, Royalty Management has the ability to assist ReElement Technologies with source feedstock that will be refined by ReElement for use by Vulcan Elements. Royalty Management is seeking additional investments and expansion in this rare earth feedstock space.
