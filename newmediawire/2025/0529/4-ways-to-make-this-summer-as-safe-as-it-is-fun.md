# 4 ways to make this summer as safe as it is fun

Dallas, TX.- (NewMediaWire) - May 29, 2025  — 350,000 people experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital in the United States each year[1], and only 10% survive. The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is calling on parents and families to make this summer as safe as it is fun by offering four ways to a heart-healthy summer, including learning CPR.

 According to the American Heart Association, more than 23,000 children experience cardiac arrest each year, with nearly 40% related to sports and nearly 20% occurring in infants. If performed immediately, CPR can double or even triple a person’s chance of survival, yet less than half of people actually receive the help they need from someone nearby. With school out for summer, children will be away from teachers and coaches who might be trained in CPR, making it crucial for parents to know this lifesaving skill.

 The Association offers this checklist for a heart-healthy summer and beyond:

 1. Learn CPR and join the Nation of Lifesavers™. Families can take an online CPR course, watch a 60-second video to learn Hands-Only CPR for adults or watch this video to learn how to save an infant or child using CPR with breaths. Travelers can also get trained in Hands-Only CPR in about five minutes while they wait for their flights with a CPR kiosk, located in public spaces and airports across the country. For more information on how to learn CPR, visit heart.org/nation.
2. Pick one healthy habit for you and your family to work on during the week. Staying on track with your family’s health goals during summer can be a challenge. Set manageable goals and choose one aspect of physical or mental health to focus on this summer. The American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8™ are key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health throughout your life: embrace healthy eating, move your body, quit tobacco, sleep well, maintain a healthy weight, control cholesterol, keep blood sugar in check and know the blood pressure basics. There’s even a Life’s Essential 8 for kids.
3. Plan ahead.  Schedule doctors appointments and refill prescriptions to make sure you have enough medication to get home safely if you’re traveling. Check if your summer destination has an emergency plan or cardiac emergency response plan (CERP) in place. A CERP establishes specific steps to reduce death from cardiac arrest in any setting – be it a school, community organization, workplace or sports facility.
4. Get involved. Research shows that civic engagement is good for your community and your heart. Join a Heart Walk. Every walker who joins and every dollar donated, means more people trained in lifesaving CPR, more lifesaving research funded and longer, healthier lives. Learn more and find a Heart Walk near you. You can also become a part of the American Heart Association Heart Powered grassroots advocacy network and join us as we unite to change the future of health.

 “Summer is a time for fun and relaxation. But that also means routines are disrupted,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Employees aren’t at the office as much. Children aren’t in school. So, our colleagues, teachers, coaches and classmates who we would normally rely on to take action in an emergency won’t be there for us. That’s why we at the American Heart Association believe it’s important that our families are knowledgeable and confident to perform CPR.”

 “Health and wellbeing should be top priorities for families during the summer months, from keeping up with medications and sun protection, to being ready for the unexpected,” said Rick Gates, chief pharmacy officer, Walgreens. “One important summer checklist item is CPR preparedness. Walgreens pharmacists are here to support our customers and patients with their everyday health needs, and can also share tools, information and resources that can help in an emergency.”

 Walgreens is a national sponsor of the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers initiative, committed to turning a nation of bystanders into lifesavers. The long-term goal: to ensure that in the face of a cardiac emergency, anyone, anywhere, is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival. Walgreens’ commitment includes an in-store campaign May 19 – June 7, as well as grassroots educational efforts, to help advance CPR preparedness and training and equip communities with tools and resources.
