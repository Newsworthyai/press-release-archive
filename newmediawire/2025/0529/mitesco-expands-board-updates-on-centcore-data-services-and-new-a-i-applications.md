He also has business interests in the commercial and residential real estate area.

 Centcore Data Center Business Unit

 The Centcore data center business has expanded its market approach to include a value-added reseller (VAR) group, with initial participants providing automated remote backup, high-level cyber security and municipal applications. “We see the VAR avenue as a way to attract subject matter expertise apart from our own experiences. This allows us to expand our sales staffing to without increasing our internal overhead and leverages the subject matter expertise and existing client base each reseller brings to the situation," explained Brian Valania, General Manager for Centcore.

 It is in discussions with a number of larger data center users for as many as 20 racks in a single configuration at its current Melbourne, Florida location, and has a plan to develop a network of small, purpose-built locations. These sites are expected to be in the 5,000 to 10,000 square foot area and would be housed in existing structures who already have suitable power, water and HVAC on-site. “To the extent that we a successful in this approach our cap-x would be much less than needed for a full new buildout, and the time to market a fraction of the traditional approach. We would seek to have a single user for around 50% of the capacity and make the remaining space available to new clients, explained Valania.

 Vero Technology Ventures Business Investments

 The recently formed Vero Technology Ventures has a focus on cloud computing software solutions and is evaluating a number of potential investments, in addition to the development of its Robo Agent A.I. based application focused on sales automation.

 “While this is being developed to assist in the sales generally to consumers (B2C) the initial releases will be aimed at the residential real estate market. There are over 3 million real estate agents in the U.S., and there is a significant need for improved productivity. New rules about compensation are putting pressure on reduced income for sales agents, especially on the buyer representation side of transactions. We believe that the Robo Agent approach can improve productivity with better time management and prospect qualifications using the latest voice technology with a psychographic overlay,” said Valania.

 The market for sales automation in residential real estate includes a number of top-listed companies. “We have a testbed with existing leading agents who are helping us develop the specifications and will serve as beta test users,” said Valania. The application set will be offered as a turn-key solution, and also as an accessory to existing CRM applications.

 The Vero Technology Ventures arm is actively seeking candidates for investment, merger or acquisition, with a strong focus on cloud computing solutions. Any candidates are encouraged to contact Brian Valania to schedule an interview by sending an email to bvalania@centcoreusa.com.
