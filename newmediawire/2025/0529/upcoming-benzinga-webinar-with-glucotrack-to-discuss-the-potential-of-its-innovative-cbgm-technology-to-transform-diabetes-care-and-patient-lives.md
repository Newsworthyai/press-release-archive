# Upcoming Benzinga Webinar With Glucotrack To Discuss The Potential Of Its Innovative CBGM Technology To Transform Diabetes Care And Patient Lives

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 * Glucotrack will host a virtual webinar discussing its Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor (CBGM) innovation on May 29 at 11 am ET.
* The current diabetes management tools for glucose monitoring are cumbersome and a relentless reminder of the disease.
* Glucotrack executives will explain how its technology works, provide an update on its clinical trial and give an overview of the future of diabetes management.

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Glucotrack Inc. (NASDAQ: GCTK) will host a virtual webinar on Thursday, May 29, from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET to discuss its Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor (CBGM) technology, a potentially game-changing medical device that could reshape how diabetes is managed.

 Experts from the Rutherford, New Jersey medical technology company will lead the session, providing a deep dive into how CBGM technology works and how it can transform the lives of people suffering from diabetes. Glucotrack experts will also discuss the critical role real-time continuous blood glucose tracking can play and why diabetes patients need a new, innovative solution.

 The Existing Tools Are Too Cumbersome

 When it comes to managing diabetes, historically the main way of tracking a person’s sugar in their blood has been via a glucose meter, which requires the person to prick his or her finger several times a day to get a sample of the blood. The results are generally accurate, granted it is stored properly and the patient remembers to test often.

 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers a less intrusive alternative. With it, a person’s blood glucose level is monitored automatically through a device 24 hours a day. It enables the diabetes patient to review their blood glucose level in real time to make well-informed decisions and adjust behavior on the spot.

 Glucotrack’s Different Approach

 When it comes to CGMs, not all devices are created equally. The duration for which the monitoring lasts, the placement of the device and how often data is received differ from one manufacturer to the next. Plus, the sensors and implantables on the market need to be reapplied or recalibrated every ten to  90 days.

 Glucotrack is different. Glucotrack’s implantable CBGM measures glucose in the blood, without the lag time associated with subcutaneous sensors that measure glucose in interstitial fluid. With it, Glucotrack says users get real-time readings instead of interstitial lag. What’s more, Glucotrack’s implant can last two to three years, compared to less than one year for many of the CGMs on the market. Glucotrack’s CBGM also offers many other benefits, which will be discussed at the webinar.

 The webinar will offer insights into how the technology works, the critical role of continuous blood glucose monitoring and the necessity for innovation in the field.

 Glucotrack is also kicking off a long-term clinical study of its continuous blood glucose monitor in participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A recently completed long-term preclinical study showed a Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 4.7% at day 90, which is considered highly accurate for a continuous glucose monitor, reports Glucotrack. During the webinar, experts from the company will share highlights from its clinical research, and share details of the latest study.

 Rounding Things Off – Live Q&A Session

 Capping off the webinar will be a live Q&A session in which attendees can submit questions directly to Glucotrack about its CBGM device, its trial and where the company sees its device and the diabetes market headed.

 The event is geared toward anybody who wants to learn more about cutting-edge technology being applied to a disease that is projected to impact 643 million people around the globe by 2030, with the number soaring to 783 million by 2045. Click here to register now!
