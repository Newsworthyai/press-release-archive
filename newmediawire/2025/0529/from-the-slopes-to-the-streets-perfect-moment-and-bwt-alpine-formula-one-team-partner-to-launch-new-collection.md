# From The Slopes To The Streets: Perfect Moment And BWT Alpine Formula One Team Partner To Launch New Collection

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - May 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Formula 1 is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world - and that is particularly evident in the United States. Between the 2023 and 2024 seasons, the U.S. fanbase grew by 10.5%, driven by high-impact media exposure and a fresh cultural relevance. The hit Netflix docuseries Drive to Survive has been pivotal in turning F1 drivers into household names, while expanded coverage across ESPN and ABC has brought the thrill of race day to millions of American homes.

 As a result, the U.S. now boasts over 52 million F1 fans, making it the sport’s fastest-growing market - and in some metrics, the largest TV audience globally.

 On a global scale, Formula 1’s fanbase is climbing towards 1 billion, with growth accelerating in key markets like China, Canada, Argentina, and Saudi Arabia. With three U.S.-based races (Miami, Austin, and Las Vegas), blockbuster sponsorship deals, and strong digital engagement, F1 has firmly cemented itself as the most popular annual sporting series worldwide - blending elite competition, luxury lifestyle, and cutting-edge technology into a global cultural phenomenon.

 That hasn’t been lost on Perfect Moment Ltd. (AMEX: PMNT), the luxury ski apparel company that has been outfitting skiers and swimmers for decades and went public on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2024, raising $8 million in gross proceeds. Perfect Moment is teaming up with BWT Alpine Formula One Team to launch a special-edition collection that Perfect Moment says fuses its refined ski lifestyle with the team’s cutting-edge style and racing performance. This collaboration is a three-year deal that will have multiple capsule collections throughout the course of this partnership.

 Two Storied Brands Hailing From The French Alps

 It makes sense that Perfect Moment and BWT Alpine Formula One Team would collaborate. Both hail from the French Alps and share a passion for speed, adventure and French savoir-faire (know-how). BWT Alpine Formula One Team, formerly named Renault F1 Team, is owned by Groupe Renault and the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance. It was rebranded in 2021 to promote Renault's sports car brand Alpine.

 The Alpine F1 Team’s significant transformation in recent years, has attracted a roster of high-profile investors. These include Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney, Michael B. Jordan, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Anthony Joshua and Rory McIlroy, among others — a group that not only brings star power and global reach but also resonates deeply with new generations of fans across sport, entertainment and fashion.

 The team competes in the FIA Formula One World Championship with Grand Prix race winner Pierre Gasly and Formula 1 rookie Jack Doohan, under the leadership of team principal Oliver Oakes and executive advisor Flavio Briatore. The team has won the Formula One World Championship seven times, most recently at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix. BWT Alpine finished the 2024 season with two podium finishes and ended the year sixth place overall in the Constructor’s Championship.

 The Perfect Moment brand was created in 1984 by Thierry Donard, the professional skier and extreme sports filmmaker, who began making apparel for his team of free-ride skiers and surfers. The designs stood out for their quality, style and performance, helping his athletes achieve what he called a perfect skin run, wave ride or otherwise that perfect moment. The designs sought to combine high-end performance with daring, bold prints and colors. Even today the brand draws on its decades-long commitment to using performance garments and statement designs in its ski, swim and lifestyle outerwear and apparel.

 In 2010, British-Swiss entrepreneurial couple Jane and Max Gottschalk took ownership of the brand. Under the creative direction of Jane Gottschalk, Perfect Moment underwent a new style focus, which the company says is about improving fit, performance and the use of best-in-class functional materials.

 “This collaboration is an exciting milestone for Perfect Moment, blending the energy of BWT Alpine Formula One Team with our signature style and technical excellence,” says Jane Gottschalk, co-founder and creative director at Perfect Moment. “We wanted to create something truly special for fans of both worlds - high-performance apparel that looks as good as it performs on the slopes and at the track. The French heritage of BWT Alpine Formula One Team and Perfect Moment is a natural fit, for me, it just made sense and we can’t wait to launch the collection soon.”

 From Streets To The Slopes

 Perfect Moment says the collection, which will launch during the Formula 1 2025 season, will feature a curated selection of technical outerwear and lifestyle pieces including ski jackets, ski suits and performance-driven skin pants that incorporate BWT Alpine Formula One Team’s bold racing colors and design.

 The line will also feature base layers, knitwear, limited-edition hoodies, T-shirts and accessories. The Perfect Moment x BWT Alpine Formula One Team collection captures the high-octane energy and engineering prowess of Formula 1, combining it with the sporting and technical innovation required in skiing apparel, says Perfect Moment. The company believes that collaboration with Alpine will provide it with global visibility across 24 Formula 1 races in more than 20 countries.

 Fans of both companies will be able to purchase the collection online at perfectmoment.com and at pop-up experiences ahead of selected race events. The launch of the collection will be accompanied by what Perfect Moment says will be a high-impact campaign that blends Formula 1 precision and mountain performance to showcase the versatility of the collection.

 “We are excited to join forces with Perfect Moment for this unique collaboration and bring the worlds of Formula 1 and luxury ski wear together. The technical outerwear produced by Perfect Moment resonates with BWT Alpine Formula One Team’s innovative objectives and we are looking forward to launching the collection very soon,” said the BWT Alpine Formula One Team.
