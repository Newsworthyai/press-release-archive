# How The Fed Rate Cut Sparked A Relevancy Boost For The Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF

By JE Insights, Benzinga

 ZINGER KEY POINTS:

 * On Sep. 17, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 while hinting at further adjustments.
* Given the potential dovish policy shift, Infrastructure Capital’s BNDS ETF has gained fundamental prominence.

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - It was the announcement that practically everyone on Wall Street anticipated. On Wednesday, Sep. 17, the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.00%-4.25%, an announcement that investors largely cheered. For example, in the trailing five sessions from the close of the Sep. 22 session, the S&P 500 index gained 1.26%.

 Still, one could make the argument that stakeholders of the Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF (ARCA: BNDS) were especially satisfied. An actively managed exchange-traded fund, BNDS seeks to primarily maximize income, with a secondary objective to extract capital appreciation. Per the fund’s literature, the underlying elevated yield is generated by investing at least 80% of its total assets in fixed-income securities.

 Even prior to the Fed rate cut, the BNDS ETF commanded relevance because of its passive income potential, which is distributed on a monthly basis. Furthermore, the fund’s net investment income (interest and dividends received, minus expenses) had easily exceeded the so-called risk-free yield of 10-year Treasuries.

 However, with the central bank cutting rates – and potentially hinting at a dovish shift in monetary policy – existing debt securities may rise in value due to their higher yield. Plus, investors may eventually pivot away from safe bonds if the yield becomes unsatisfactory, potentially placing the BNDS ETF on firmer ground.

 The Fed Makes A Critical Move

 As mentioned earlier, the Fed’s announcement of its rate cut was largely expected by investors and analysts. Therefore, the headline print itself wasn’t really the main show. Rather, it was commentary about what policymakers anticipate in the forward monetary cycles. For income investors, the projected changes may be significant.

 Based on the central bank’s updated September Summary of Economic Projections, policymakers anticipate a modestly stronger economic outlook than previously expected. At the same time, the Fed may implement a faster pace of interest rate cuts over the next two years.

 Specifically, the federal funds rate at the end of this year could land at 3.6%, down from 3.9% in June. As such, experts anticipate an additional 50-basis-point cut in the pipeline. What’s more, the 2026 projection was dropped to 3.4% from 3.6%, while the 2027 projection calls for a dip to 3.1% (from the prior 3.4%).

 To be sure, the Fed must navigate an increasingly complex economic environment. Heading into the policy announcement, many experts have raised concerns about the weakening job market and persistent inflation. Given these headwinds in combination with the Trump administration’s tariffs, the economy potentially risks stagflation.

 It’s possible that the Fed can navigate monetary policy to facilitate a soft landing for the broader economy. That would generally be favorable for bond market-related investments. Essentially, as the benchmark rate comes down and economic conditions stabilize, investors require less yield to buffer potential risks. This dynamic would make existing debt securities – with their higher yields – much more attractive.

 So, why not just jump into any standard bond fund and call it a day? One key reason, as stated earlier, is that complexities at the current juncture present risks across the board. Therefore, investors need to be extra cautious about their financial exposure. Second, the S&P 500 has a history of struggling following a Fed rate cut.

 As such, it’s time to consider leveraging battle-hardened expertise – and that’s exactly where the Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF comes into the picture.

 Why The BNDS ETF Stands Out From The Crowd

 As an actively managed fund, Infrastructure Capital’s BNDS is geared toward sectors and issuers that feature strong cash flows and pricing power. In theory, individual investors can conduct their own research and build individualized portfolios without incurring an expense ratio. However, such research takes considerable time – a resource that not everyone has to dedicate to rifling through income statements and balance sheets.

 In addition, there are the economies of scale and efficiencies to consider. Essentially, the team at Infrastructure Capital is structured specifically to find and extract asymmetric income-generating opportunities. Because the distribution is monthly, the payouts deliver much-needed convenience. As well, the 30-day SEC Yield of 7.7% may entice investors. And because the financial services provider commands decades of experience, it knows what to look for – and what pitfalls to avoid.

 Moreover, a key mechanical element of the BNDS ETF that distinguishes it from the competition is the use of option-writing strategies to enhance investors’ overall income. While arguably most investors view options as debit-based transactions, it’s possible to sell or write derivative financial products. These credit-based transactions notably start from a credit-influx position – but there’s a catch.

 If the underwritten risk is realized to the extreme ends of the distribution, the option writer may end up owing a significant amount of money. It’s imperative, then, that such enhancements be overseen by truly qualified experts.

 At the helm of BNDS is Jay D. Hatfield, founder, CEO and portfolio manager of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. With nearly three decades of experience across investment banking, hedge fund management and portfolio construction, Hatfield has consistently focused on income-generating securities and companies tied to real assets like energy infrastructure and real estate.

 That deep background matters. Hatfield’s career has been defined by identifying undervalued credit opportunities and structuring strategies to extract reliable cash flows. For BNDS, this translates into a disciplined approach to corporate bond selection, combined with tactical enhancements like option writing. In an environment shaped by rate cuts, inflation risks and potential stagflation, having an active manager with Hatfield’s experience provides an additional layer of prudence that passive funds cannot replicate.

 Lastly, Infrastructure Capital Advisors consistently pushes for new opportunities to add value for its clients. Recently, the team partnered up with white-label platform HANetf to launch an exchange-traded product called Infrastructure Capital Preferred Income UCITS. The new fund invests in U.S. preferred securities - a type of hybrid vehicle that combines features of debt and equity.

 Guided Income Through An Uncertain Cycle

 Ultimately, the Fed’s latest rate cut reshuffles the investment landscape, and few areas stand to benefit more than income-focused strategies. With its monthly distributions and a 7.7% yield profile, BNDS offers investors a straightforward value proposition: consistent cash flow in an uncertain market.

 Yet what sets BNDS apart is not just its income stream but the active oversight that comes with it. Under Jay Hatfield’s leadership, the fund deliberately positions itself to capture yield while managing risk across credit sectors. For investors navigating today’s shifting environment, that combination of steady distributions and experienced management makes BNDS a fund worth monitoring closely.
