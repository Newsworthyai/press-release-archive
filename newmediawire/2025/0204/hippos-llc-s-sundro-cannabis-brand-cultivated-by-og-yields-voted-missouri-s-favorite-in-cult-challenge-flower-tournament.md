# Hippos LLC's Sundro Cannabis Brand, Cultivated by OG Yields, Voted Missouri's Favorite in Cult Challenge Flower Tournament

Ozark-Grown Premium Cannabis Wins 1st Place in 2nd Round of Consumer-Voted Competition

 VIENNA, MO - February 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hippos, LLC, Missouri’s premier cannabis company with retail locations statewide and award-winning brands produced by its OG Yields division, is proud to announce the Company’s beloved brand Sundro received first place in the second round of Cannabis Cult’s Challenge Flower Tournament. Sundro’s Super Buff Cherries strain claimed the top spot.

 The Cannabis Cult Flower Tournament Series ‘Connoisseur Pack’ is an innovative cannabis retail experience that includes four cannabis brands competing with their best products, allowing consumers to rate each submission without knowing which brand is which. Sundro’s Super Buff Cherries was the highest rated strain in the pack. Sundro will now advance to the championship round, with results to be announced in the first quarter of 2025.

 “We are incredibly honored that Sundro’s Super Buff Cherries was voted the favorite in such a respected competition, especially because it’s a blind test where consumers choose purely based on quality,” said Nicholas Rinella, CEO of Hippos, LLC. “This victory reflects our commitment to cultivating premium, Missouri-grown cannabis that stands out for its unique terpene profiles and superior craftsmanship. It’s especially rewarding to know that Missouri consumers recognize and appreciate the care that goes into every strain we produce.”

 Aaron Childs, Creative Director and Founder of Cannabis Cult, said, "As soon as I opened the four jars in this round's Connoisseur Pack, each submission impressed me in different ways. The big, frosty buds with vibrant purple hues, later revealed to be Sundro's Super Buff Cherries, immediately stood out. Its visually striking appearance and fruity aroma gave me the feeling that SBC had a strong chance of taking first place."

 Missouri's cannabis industry ended 2024 on a high note, setting new records for monthly sales in December 2024 and further cementing its status as a leading cannabis market in the United States. December sales totaled $130.89 million, representing a 2.2 percent increase over the previous record of $128.07 million achieved in November. This milestone represents the largest single-month sales figure since the inception of Missouri's cannabis program, as reported by Greenway Magazine.
