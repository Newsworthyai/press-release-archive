# Giant Mining MHB-34 Drilled to 1,963 Feet with Assays Now Pending From MHB-33 at Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project, Nevada

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - May 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (CSE:BFG.WT.A) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that Hole MHB-34 (“MHB-34”) was drilled to 1,963 feet (598.3 meters). MHB-34 is the third of five holes of the 2025 diamond core drilling program (the “Core Program”), currently underway at Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit (“Majuba Hill”) located in Pershing County, Nevada.

 Furthermore, the Company is pleased to announce that all Core from Hole MHB-33 (“MHB-33”) which was drilled to a total depth of 936 feet (285.29 meters) has been sampled and submitted to ALS Global Services (“ALS Labs”) for analysis. A previous news release dated April 8th, 2025 errantly reported a total depth of 950 feet (289.56 meters) vs the actual total depth of 936 feet (285.29 meters).

 The Company further announces Hole MHB-35 (at site PDH-DUH1) was completed to 596 feet (181.66 meters). The primary goal of the Core Program is to expand known copper mineralization at Majuba Hill and advance the project toward a new Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, enthusiastically commented: "We are thrilled with the ongoing progress at Majuba Hill. As previously stated In my entire career, I've never seen drill core like what we saw at MHB-34 which was drilled to a total depth of 1,963 feet. Majuba Hill is rapidly emerging as a world-class copper, silver, and gold discovery, perfectly positioned as a vital American resource. Nevada's incredible infrastructure and mining-friendly environment only amplify this project's immense value. Giant Mining is proud to help secure America's clean energy future and achieve critical mineral supply chain independence."

 Infrastructure Advantage

 The Majuba Hill Project is strategically positioned within a mining-friendly jurisdiction and benefits from an infrastructure setting that is favorable for efficient project advancement. Key elements already in place include well-maintained access roads, nearby power supply, nearby transportation routes (highway and rail), and areas potentially suitable for processing, waste management, and administrative operations.

 As previously reported in the March 17, 2025 news release, the 2025 Core Program has been designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings (Figure 5) .

 The Company will provide regular updates as the drill program progresses, including assay results, geological observations, and any significant developments encountered during drilling. These updates will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed on the advancement of the Majuba Hill project and its potential to support a future resource estimate.

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth or plastic sample bags and are transported from the Majuba Hill to the Giant Mining secure warehouse for core sawing and processing and then samples are delivered to the ALS Labs sample prep facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS then transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 5% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining sample pulps are retrieved from ALS Minerals and retained by the Company for future metallurgical testing.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada, USA - a globally top-ranked mining jurisdiction, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute’s 2022 Annual Survey of Mining Companies.

 Project Size:

9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects

 History:

Historical Producer

 Drilling:

83,930 feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:

Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign

 About Giant Mining Corp.

 Giant Mining is focused on identifying, acquiring, and advancing late-stage copper and copper/silver/gold projects to meet the growing global demand for critical metals. This demand is driven by initiatives like the Green New Deal in the United States and similar climate-focused programs worldwide, which require substantial amounts of copper, silver, and gold for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and the modernization of clean and affordable energy systems.

 The Company’s flagship asset is the Majuba Hill Copper, Silver, and Gold District, located 156 miles (251 km) from Reno, Nevada. Majuba Hill is situated in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations and has the potential to become one of the next major copper deposits, critical for meeting the increasing need for this red metal.
