# Angkor Resources Identifies Third Drill Prospect On Block VIII Oil &amp; Gas License, Cambodia

GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ANGKOR RESOURCES CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” OR “THE COMPANY”) announces the results of our North Bokor seismic program leading to the confirmation of a third anticlinal dome structure buried under the flat valley bottom lands within our Block VIII boundaries.

 After identifying closed anticline structures in both South Bokor and Central Bokor on Block VIII, with potential drilling targets, finding another potentially closed anticline is very positive. Angkor’s subsidiary EnerCam Resources Co. Cambodia Ltd. (‘EnerCam’) has now added a third potential target for oil and gas drilling in the coming year. Finding and proving up a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir will define the first onshore hydrocarbon resource in the nation of Cambodia.

 The North Bokor structure brings another anticline to our proposed targets on the west side of the Block VIII oil and gas license. A noticeable difference from both the Central Bokor and South Bokor structures is that our mapped regional unconformity surface at North Bokor is found at significantly shallower depths. The illustration below shows the crest is located between 150-200ms two-way-time (TWT) below surface, making this some 300-400 metres below the surface of the valley floor.

 The North Bokor seismic does not confirm a closed structure, however management is confident that this anticline structure will prove to be closed based upon the surrounding physical features of the hills to the west and east of the North Bokor valley floor. The illustration above clearly follows the general fold trend of the South and Central Bokor prospects, identified in recent disclosures.

 South Bokor and Central Bokor sub basins have identified significant closed anticline structures with approximately 48 and 60 square kilometres respectively of closure beneath the regionally mapped unconformity surface.

 Keith Edwards, Technical manager for EnerCam, comments on the seismic lines and what they tell readers: “The fact that the regional unconformity surface we have been mapping is so close to the surface here means that we will have an easier time drilling down to some of our deeper targets in this part of our western half of Block VIII.”
