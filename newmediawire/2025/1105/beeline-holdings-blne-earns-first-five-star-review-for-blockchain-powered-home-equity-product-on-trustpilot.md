# Beeline Holdings (BLNE) Earns First Five-Star Review for Blockchain-Powered Home Equity Product on Trustpilot

LOS ANGELES, CA - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Beeline Holdings (NASDAQ: BLNE) has received its first five-star Trustpilot review for BeelineEquity, the company’s blockchain-recorded home equity solution that enables homeowners to unlock liquidity without taking on debt, monthly payments or credit underwriting. The verified customer wrote, “Thank you Beeline for leveraging the blockchain to create liquidity for myself. I sold 17% of my home to generate approximately $200,000 in cash… Very creative Beeline. This product is going to explode.” The reviewer praised Beeline’s “easy” transaction process and “highly recommended” the product for its fairness and innovation.

 Beeline recently completed its first round of blockchain-tracked BeelineEquity transactions, marking a major milestone as the first U.S. platform to tokenize residential home equity at scale. The strong early customer feedback underscores growing demand for transparent, technology-driven alternatives to traditional home equity loans and refinances.
