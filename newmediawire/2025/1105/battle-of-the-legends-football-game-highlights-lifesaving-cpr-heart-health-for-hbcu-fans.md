# Battle of the Legends Football Game Highlights Lifesaving CPR, Heart Health for HBCU Fans

PHILADELPHIA - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death among young athletes, according to the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere.[1] To reach young athletes with important messages about HCM, the Association was at Lincoln Financial Field this past Thursday as former legendary players DeSean Jackson’s Delaware State Hornets and Michael Vick’s Norfolk State Spartans played the Battle of the Legends college football game. Fans in attendance were able to learn about heart health awareness and learn how to save a life with Hands-Only CPR.

 The Heart Association hosted an interactive pregame “Heart Health Zone” at Lincoln Financial Field focused on HCM awareness and Hands-Only CPR education, two critical areas in preventing sudden cardiac death and empowering communities to act in cardiac emergencies.

 HCM is defined by thickening and stiffening of the walls of the heart, which limits the heart’s ability to fill and pump blood properly. It is estimated that as many as 1 in every 500 young people in the United States have HCM, yet it often goes undiagnosed.

 The American Heart Association wants more people to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency, adding more people to the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ movement. The goal --double cardiac arrest survival rates by 2030. At the HBCU event, participants learned the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions in walk-up style CPR education opportunities.

 “Moments like this remind us that heart health belongs everywhere - in our homes, our schools and even at the 50-yard line,” said Jennifer Litchman-Green, executive director of the American Heart Association, Greater Philadelphia. “Conditions like HCM are so prevalent, yet so many people don’t know how widespread the condition is or how to jump into action if a sudden cardiac arrest episode happens. By reaching fans and families where they are, we are helping build stronger, more informed communities that know how to protect and save lives.”

 Throughout the evening, fans received business cards with QR codes that linked them to more information about HCM, Hands-Only CPR and how to start a Heart Club at schools.

 The Association’s presence at the Battle of the Legends game reflects its broader mission to ensure every community, particularly those historically underrepresented in health care, has access to the knowledge and resources needed to live longer, healthier lives. The activation builds on the Association’s ongoing work with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), student-athletes, and community leaders to expand health literacy and improve outcomes for heart disease and stroke across historically underrepresented populations.

 Fans were encouraged to visit Heart.org/HCMStudentAthlete and Heart.org/Nation to continue learning and sharing the resources within their own networks.

 The American Heart Association’s HCM awareness and education in athletes is made possible in part by a grant from the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation.
