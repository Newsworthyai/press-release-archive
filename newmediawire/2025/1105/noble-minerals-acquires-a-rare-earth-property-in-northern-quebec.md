# Noble Minerals Acquires a Rare Earth Property in Northern Quebec

TORONTO, ONTARIO - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Noble Mineral Exploration Inc. (“Noble” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:NOB, FRANKFURT: NB7, OTCQB:NLPXF) is pleased to report acquisition of mining claims on a Rare Earth prospect in Northern Quebec. The 90 claims were acquired by map staking to cover approximately 4,465 hectares and is called the Mehmet Property

 The Mehmet Earth Property

 The Mehmet Property is located about 163 kilometers east of Schefferville on the Quebec-Labrador Border. It forms a circular shaped, magnetic structure about 10 kilometers across and is classed by the Quebec Government as an hyperalkaline rock with associated rare metals. The mineralization is in an alkali feldspar and clinopyroxene syenite containing an abnormally high amount of allanite crystals as well as numerous allanite-filled microfractures. The rock type was described as a fractured, alkali feldspar, syenite with clinopyroxene, allanite, apatite, fluorite and magnetite.

 Rock analyses by the Quebec Government include (Sigeom Sample 1986016233):

 * 2157.1 ppm total rare earth elements (of which 114.4 ppm are heavy ETR).
* 2144.6 ppm Zirconium,
* 392.7 ppm Neodymium,
* 135.3 ppm Yttrium,
* 26.1 ppm Thorium, and
* 71.5 ppm Niobium

 Besides the Quebec government sampling, very little exploration work has been done on the property.

 The Mehmet Property is located about 65 km southwest of the Crater Lake Property where Scandium Canada has defined a rare earth and scandium resource. (See Figure 1)
