# NeuroOne® Receives 180-Day Extension From Nasdaq to Regain Minimum Bid Price Compliance

EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN. - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: NMTC) ("NeuroOne" or the "Company"), a medical technology company focused on improving surgical care options and outcomes for patients suffering from neurological disorders, today announced it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying NeuroOne that it has been granted a 180-day extension, until May 4, 2026, to regain compliance with the requirement for the Company’s common stock, to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).

 The extension has no immediate effect on the continued listing status of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which remains fully effective.

 As previously announced, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days. As provided in such notice, the Company had a 180-day period, until November 3, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. As of the date of this press release, the Company has not yet regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and instead advised Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency within the extension period.

 The Company will continue to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and seek to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within the extension period. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within the extension period, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock will be subject to delisting, at which time the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does need to appeal a Nasdaq delisting determination to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, that such appeal would be successful.
