# Blue Lagoon Resources Selected for PDAC's 2026 Sustainability Award

Joins Prestigious List of Past Recipients Including Teck Resources, The Lundin Foundation and B2Gold

 VANCOUVER, BC - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Blue Lagoon Resources Inc. (“Blue Lagoon” or the “Company”) (CSE: BLLG; OTCQB: BLAGF; FSE: 7BL) is pleased to announce it has been selected to receive the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) 2026 Sustainability Award, recognizing leadership in environmental stewardship and meaningful community relations in mining. The award highlights Blue Lagoon’s sustainability and Indigenous partnership efforts at its Dome Mountain Gold Project in British Columbia.

 Rana Vig, President & CEO, said, “Being recognized by PDAC for sustainability affirms the approach we’ve taken at Dome Mountain: protect the environment, engage early and often, and build long-term partnerships with local communities. We’re grateful to the Lake Babine Nation for their trust and collaboration, and proud of our team for embedding these values into daily operations.”

 Chief Wilfred Adam of the Lake Babine Nation, the Company’s nomination sponsor, said “Blue Lagoon has demonstrated respect for our people and our land. This award reflects a relationship based on listening, learning, and acting with integrity.”

 A PRESTIGIOUS LINEAGE OF PAST RECIPIENTS

 Since 1977, the PDAC Awards have recognized the dedication and ingenuity that drive advancement in communities across Canada and around the world. Recent honourees include Teck Resources, The Lundin Foundation, and B2Gold, underscoring the calibre of sustainability leadership recognized by PDAC. Notably, in the past decade the Sustainability Award has not gone to a B.C. project - making Blue Lagoon the lone B.C. recipient in this period. In a jurisdiction recognized for rigorous permitting, this award recognizes the Company’s transition from exploration to mining while maintaining strong environmental stewardship and respect for Lake Babine Nation values.

 AWARDS PRESENTATION

 The award will be presented at PDAC’s Awards Celebration & Nite Cap during the PDAC Convention in Toronto on March 3, 2026.

 About Blue Lagoon Resources Inc.

 Blue Lagoon Resources Inc. (CSE: BLLG; FSE: 7BL; OTCQB: BLAGF) is a Canadian-based, well-funded, growth-oriented mining company focused on advancing its 100% owned Dome Mountain Gold Project in British Columbia. Led by a team with deep mining and finance experience, the Company operates in one of the world’s most attractive mining jurisdictions.

 In February 2025, Blue Lagoon achieved a major milestone with the granting of a full mining permit - one of only nine issued in British Columbia since 2015 - and has since commenced underground mining operations. Mineralized material from Dome Mountain will be processed under a long-term toll milling agreement with Nicola Mining, with first gold sales targeted for Q4 2025. Beginning in H1 2026, the Company plans to reinvest internally generated cash flow into near-mine and regional exploration to further expand its resource base.

 With a strong commitment to sustainability, community, and First Nation engagement, Blue Lagoon’s objective is to become a profitable, cash-flowing gold producer while creating lasting value for shareholders and stakeholders alike.

 The Company is not basing its production decision at Dome Mountain on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. The production decision is based on having existing mining infrastructure, past bulk sampling and processing activity, and the established mineral resource. The Company understands that there is increased uncertainty, and consequently, a higher risk of failure, when production is undertaken in advance of a feasibility study.

 The CSE has not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
