# Duda Hosts Industry Leaders for Conversion-Focused MegaWebinar Featuring Search Atlas Executive

NEW YORK CITY - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - As artificial intelligence fundamentally reshapes how businesses get found online, Search Atlas Head of Marketing Justin Rondeau will join six other industry experts on November 5th for a five-hour virtual event focused on converting existing traffic into predictable revenue.

 The Duda MegaWebinar comes at a critical time for digital marketers. AI is reducing predictable traffic from traditional search engines, forcing businesses to rethink strategies that have worked for over two decades. Instead of chasing uncertain "AI SEO" tactics, the webinar will present conversion optimization as the fastest and most cost-effective way to protect revenue now.

 The Marketing Landscape is Shifting

 Many marketers are too focused on driving as much traffic as possible from AI search, but this neglects a fundamental part of the marketing funnel - conversion!

 "We're at a point where the old playbook of 'just get more traffic' isn't working the way it used to," said Justin Rondeau. "The businesses that will thrive aren't the ones getting the most visitors, they're the ones converting the visitors they already have.”

 Justin Rondeau brings nearly 15 years of experience in conversion optimization, having driven measurable growth for SaaS companies, agencies, and eCommerce brands. His presentation will provide practical, implementation-ready strategies rather than theoretical frameworks.

 Justin also commented on his upcoming session saying: “In my session, I'll walk through the specific tactics and frameworks we've used to help businesses increase revenue without spending another dollar on traffic. Because at the end of the day, traffic's cute, but revenue is better."

 A chance for anyone interested in getting more out of AI search to get some real answers.

 The webinar is designed for agencies managing client websites, in-house marketing teams responsible for revenue growth, SaaS companies looking to improve lead generation, and business owners who want to maximize ROI from their existing web traffic. According to event organizers, the content will be particularly valuable for professionals who have seen traditional traffic sources become less predictable and need strategies that produce measurable results quickly.

 "If you're still chasing traffic numbers while your competitors are optimizing conversion rates, you're fighting yesterday's battle," Rondeau added. "This event is for people who are ready to shift their focus to what actually matters, turning visitors into customers and customers into revenue."

 Registration and Access

 The webinar takes place November 5, 2025, at 9:00 AM PT. Registration is free, and attendees who cannot participate live will receive access to session recordings. More information is available on Duda’s website.
