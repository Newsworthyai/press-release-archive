# Western Star Resources Announces Acquisition of an Option to Acquire a Past Producing Tungsten Project in Nevada

VANCOUVER, BC - November 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Western Star Resources Inc. (CSE: WSR) (OTC: WSRIF) (the “Company” or “Western Star”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) the past producing Rowland Project (the “Property”) located in the Jarbidge mining district of Nevada.

 Key Highlights from Past Producing Rowland Property:

 - High grade Tungsten project with values of 3.38% WO₃ reported(1)

 - A road accessible past producing mine, located in the historical Jarbidge mining district, located about 6 miles southwest of Jarbidge.

 - Rocks exposed in the area are limestones, shales, and quartzites intruded by a quartz monzonite stock. Adjacent to the intrusive the shales and limestones have been extensively metamorphosed to skarn and hornfels in zones as much as 100 feet wide.

 - Mine workings consist of two shallow shafts and several hundred feet of open cuts.

 - Scheelite occurs as coarse crystals and is also finely disseminated with molybdenite, powellite, pyrite, chalco- pyrite, and limonite in a garnet, epidote, quartz, and calcite skarn.

 - In 1943, W. J. Rowland shipped 4.5 tons of ore containing 3.38 percent WO₃ to Metals Reserve Co.

 - During 1954-56 about 1,000 tons of ore containing 0.5 to 1.0 percent WO₃ was produced.

 Why The Past Producing Rowland Property is a Strategic Asset

 - Critical Mineral Status: Tungsten is indispensable for defense, aerospace, energy, and semiconductor industries. The U.S. currently has no domestic commercial production, making it highly dependent on imports, with ~85% of global supply controlled by China.

 - Exploration Upside: Identified in the 1940s, this project has identifiable mineralization but remain under-explored using Modern exploration techniques,

 - Alignment with U.S. Policy: Recent Executive Orders prioritize fast-tracking domestic tungsten projects, with federal grants and defense-sector support available for qualifying assets.

 “As I stated Previously Securing a domestic source of tungsten is not just a business opportunity, it’s a matter of national importance,” said Blake Morgan, CEO of Western Star. “The acquisition of the Past Producing Rowland Property aligns perfectly with Western Star’s mission to deliver value to shareholders while supporting U.S. government priorities to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical minerals.”

 “The in-depth due diligence exceeded expectations of our view that the past producing Rowland Property represents a unique and timely opportunity,” said Blake Morgan, CEO of Western Star. “This asset not only complements our flagship drill permitted green metals project in Canada but also positions us at the heart of U.S. efforts to rebuild domestic supply chains for critical minerals. We plan to get crews out on the ground as soon as possible to start with Geophysics, channels sampling and mapping. The goal with the first phase of exploration is to get the project to a drill ready stage, ready for its maiden program early next year.”

 The Past Producing Rowland Property directly aligns with recent U.S. government directives to secure a domestic tungsten supply, a resource classified as critical to national security. With no U.S. commercial production since 2015 and global supply dominated by China (~85%), companies like Western Star Resources are poised to benefit from government support, fast-track permitting, and defense-sector demand.
