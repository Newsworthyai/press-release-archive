# MWG Completes Two-Year Remodel, Revolutionizes the Outdated 'Behind-the-Counter' Model With a Customer-Centric Retail Experience

Premier Cannabis Company Completes Service-Focused Remodel Across All Retail Locations; Strategic Marketing Initiatives Deliver 30% Year-over-Year Summer Growth

 SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - September 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today the completion of a two-year remodel of all its retail locations, celebrating the open shop model designed to transform cannabis shopping from restrictive to customer-friendly. The redesign creates a more welcoming, guest-friendly in-store experience. The final updates recently completed at Marysville Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness mark a major milestone in MWG’s commitment to delivering a modernized, community-rooted retail experience.

 “The open shop model is about removing barriers between our guests and products,” said Shawn Samery, VP of Retail at Perfect Union. “Our beautifully merchandised stores allow guests to browse an array of products and enjoy a quicker, streamlined check-out experience. Our friendly team members are on hand to answer questions and guide guests, making the experience relaxed, personal, and aligned with our community-first values.”

 To celebrate, MWG has launched statewide summer marketing campaigns designed to deepen consumer engagement. The Company has released a second round of its popular limited-edition Perfect Union hat pins, each featuring the store’s city name and a distinctive local landmark as a symbol of community pride. For example, the Sacramento pin showcases the city’s iconic yellow bridge, Tower Bridge. These collectible pins, free with purchase, are available exclusively in-store and vary by location. As a free gift with purchase, with a minimum spend requirement that varies by location.

 Additionally, MWG launched its new product, the 3 Buck Buzz Bag, on Sept. 1. The 3 Buck Buzz Bag is an in-store exclusive available while supplies last and limited to one per guest per day. The product delivers a playful twist on shopping by keeping its contents a surprise until purchase. The mystery cannabis products inside the 3 Buck Buzz Bag range in value between $10 and $50.

 These offerings reflect MWG’s data-driven, growth-focused marketing approach that has fueled a 30% year-over-year increase in summer revenue and is driving a strong uptick in customer loyalty.

 Nicole Hanratty, Vice President of Marketing at MWG Holdings, said, “By combining customer-centric localized promotions with a refreshed, open-concept store design, MWG continues to strengthen brand loyalty while attracting new customers across its California footprint.”

 As part of MWG’s broader summer campaign, the Company is also celebrating the expanded distribution of its in-house print publication, smish. Previously available only in-store, smish. will now be stocked at more than 300 dispensaries across California, increasing its visibility and reinforcing MWG’s leadership in cannabis culture and content.

 The most recent edition of smish. features David Polley, founder of Preferred Gardens, on the cover, as well as an in-depth interview with Anna Willey, founder of CAM. This summer edition is a tribute to the growers and cultivators who define California’s reputation for high-quality cannabis, featuring stunning photos of the grow houses of leading brands.

 “This summer we’re doubling down on what makes MWG unique: the loyalty of our customers and the creative energy behind our retail and storytelling efforts,” said Tom Sheridan, Esq., CEO of MWG Holdings. “From improving the retail experience to editorial reach, we’re focused on building deeper, more meaningful connections with cannabis consumers across California.”

 While the Company’s in-store offerings drive engagement, MWG’s recently launched Perfect Union website supports these efforts with a smooth, streamlined online shopping experience, offering location-specific promotions, enhanced mobile usability, and convenient ordering for pickup and delivery.
