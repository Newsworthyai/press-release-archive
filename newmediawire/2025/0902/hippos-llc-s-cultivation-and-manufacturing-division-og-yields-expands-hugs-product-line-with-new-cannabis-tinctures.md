# Hippos, LLC's Cultivation and Manufacturing Division OG Yields Expands Hugs Product Line With New Cannabis Tinctures

Daytime, Stress Relief, and Nighttime Formulations Now Available at All Missouri Dispensary Locations

 VIENNA, MISSOURI - September 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Hippos, Missouri’s premier, modern cannabis company curating fresh experiences at retail locations throughout the state, is proud to announce the expansion of its award-winning Hugs wellness line with three new cannabis tinctures: Daytime Energy Boost, Stress Relief, and Nighttime Sleep Aid. The expanded Hugs product line is available at all Hippos dispensary locations statewide.

 Following the successful launch of the award-winning Hugs Cannabis Salve earlier this year, which earned first place at the Third Annual Missouri Growers Cup, the new tinctures mark the brand’s evolution from topicals to ingestible solutions. Together, these products provide Missouri’s medical and adult-use cannabis community with thoughtfully crafted, plant-based options to support energy, calm, and rest.

 “Hugs Help continues to be our guiding principle,” said Nicholas Rinella, CEO of Hippos Cannabis. “With the addition of these tinctures, we’re offering consumers safe, effective, and responsibly formulated products that meet everyday needs – from energizing the morning to unwinding after a stressful day, or simply getting a restful night’s sleep.”
