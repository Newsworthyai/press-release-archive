LAS VEGAS, NV - March 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) (“Golden Matrix” or the “Company”), a developer and licensor of advanced online gaming platforms and content, today announced that its subsidiary, Meridianbet, through affiliated entity Meridian Gaming Brasil SPE Ltda, has been granted a definitive federal license (No. 0086/2024) by Brazil’s Ministry of Finance Secretariat of Prizes and Betting (SPA/MF). The newly granted license authorizes Meridianbet to operate online and retail fixed-odds betting across the country until December 31, 2029.
