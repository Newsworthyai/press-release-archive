# From Acquisitions To Organic Growth, IQSTEL Gets Closer To $1 Billion Revenue Target For 2027 - Company To Deliver $500K In Dividends This Year

by Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - IQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST), a global connectivity, AI and digital company focused on diversifying its revenue stream, expects double-digit organic revenue growth in 2026, with 26% topline growth.

 The company, which has grown over the years through a combination of 12 strategic acquisitions – it has made 12 since 2018 - and operational excellence, has businesses in telecommunication, fintech and artificial intelligence, all of which it says are seeing rapid, transformational growth. IQSTEL is targeting 2026 organic revenue of $430 million, up 26% from the $340 million it expects to earn this year. Last year, IQSTEL posted revenue of $283 million. The company noted that it has a strong track record of meeting or exceeding its financial forecasts as well as demonstrating consistent execution and disciplined management across its diversified operations and that shouldn’t change.

 Making Buys, Growing Sales

 Since its launch in 2018, IQSTEL has completed 12 strategic acquisitions, shaping a diversified revenue stream that is now approximately 80% telecommunications and 20% fintech. The company also acquired Reality Border, an AI firm that now serves as IQSTEL’s R&D division, focused on developing proprietary AI-driven solutions. IQSTEL’s acquisition strategy is far from over - the company plans to acquire two to three additional accretive businesses as part of its roadmap to achieve $15 million in EBITDA by 2026, while maintaining a strong focus on profitable organic growth.

 "Our forecast reflects the strength of our business platform and our ability to deliver consistent, organic growth while preparing for high-margin expansion," said Leandro Iglesias, CEO of IQSTEL. "We are building toward a balanced model of growth that combines innovation, efficiency, and scale - positioning IQSTEL for sustained profitability and long-term shareholder value." Once the company completes any deals it will update its 2026 revenue target. It is also still on the path to its stated goal of achieving revenue of $1 billion by 2027.

 Getting Into Cybersecurity By Way Of Cycurion

 While acquisitions are a big part of IQSTEL’s growth story, the company is also striking partnerships and alliances that could help it boost sales and get love from Wall Street. One in particular partnership that could do that is a recent deal with AI cybersecurity company Cycurion Inc. (NASDAQ: CYCU), which gives IQSTEL entrance into another red-hot area: cybersecurity. This summer the two teamed up to create and sell AI cybersecurity products and solutions for the global telecommunications and enterprise markets. It marked IQSTEL’s entry into AI cybersecurity and marks a new, potentially high-margin revenue stream for the company.

 As part of the collaboration the two signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to become mutual equity partners following a planned $1 million stock exchange. Both parties also agreed to deliver a $500,000 dividend to their shareholders by December 31, 2025. Each company may satisfy this dividend obligation either in its own stock or in shares received from the stock exchange.

 IQSTEL said the deal is designed to unlock shareholder value, while being strategically timed for both companies as the products and services of IQSTEL and Cycurion are largely insulated from potential disruptions caused by changes in U.S. tariffs and their economic consequences. The deal gives IQSTEL access to Cycurion’s presence in the U.S. market and deep relationships within government and institutional sectors while Cycurion gets access to IQSTEL’s global telecommunications customer base. The goal is for the companies to cross‑sell solutions, penetrate new markets and open revenue streams that neither could fully capture alone.

 "We are very excited to add cybersecurity to our portfolio of products," said Iglesias. "This partnership with Cycurion, whose specialized solutions are trusted by the U.S. government, not only broadens our capabilities but also enhances the trust we bring to our global telecom and enterprise customers. Our plan is to officially launch these new cybersecurity solutions at the largest global telecom event in 2026."

 Wall Street On Board?

 It’s not only IQSTEL and Cycurion that are hopeful about the collaboration. Litchfield Hills, which has a buy rating and $18 price target on IQSTEL, said the structure of the deal ensures that both companies have skin in the game and increases the odds of it being executed meaningfully rather than being just a symbolic arrangement. The Wall Street firm said the Cycurion deal and IQSTEL’s focus on cybersecurity complement its push into fintech with its purchase of Globetopper.

 “By pairing cybersecurity (through Cycurion) with fintech (through GlobeTopper), iQSTEL is broadening its high-margin service suite to telecom partners. That better positions it to increase revenue and EBITDA and deepen partnerships rather than relying solely on connectivity services,” wrote Litchfield Hills analyst Barry Sine in the research report. “We view the iQSTEL–Cycurion alliance as a strategic lever with asymmetric upside, not just another marketing tie-up.”

 IQSTEL takes its goal to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2027 very seriously. It’s already on the path to achieve that with its revenue target set for 2026 and its entrance into cybersecurity thanks to its alliance with Cycurion. With that coming online in 2026 and more acquisitions slated for the New Year, there’s a lot more connections in store for this global connectivity, AI and digital company.
