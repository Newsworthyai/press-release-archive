# Golden Matrix Group Subsidiary Meridianbet Secures 10-Year Online Gaming License Renewal in Serbia

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - February 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: GMGI) (“Golden Matrix Group” or the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative gaming and technology solutions, today announced its subsidiary, Meridianbet, has secured a 10-year renewal for its online gaming license in Serbia. The renewal reinforces the Company’s long-term operational stability in the region, ensures uninterrupted operations and provides an additional 10 years of revenue-stream reliability. The reissuance makes Meridianbet one of the first operators to be granted a license renewal.

 The long-term extension of the Serbian license involved an extensive due diligence process including financial, compliance, operational and software licensing assessments by the Games of Chance Administration under the Serbian Ministry of Finance. Meridianbet cleared the due diligence process without any additional checks or questions.

 “This license renewal strengthens GMGI’s position as a leading global iGaming company while reaffirming its commitment to function within the highest regulatory, governance and compliance standards across the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates,” said Brian Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix Group. “The renewal will enable us to offer Serbian users our multitude of new product innovations, forward-thinking AI technology and stellar operational efficiency.”

 Zoran Milošević, CEO of Meridianbet, commented, “Serbia is a key legacy market for Golden Matrix Group, an established leader in the country’s iGaming sector. GMGI’s continued operations in the country align with its AI-driven expansion and retail network consolidation in Europe and around the world."

 Serbia is one of the oldest regulated online gaming and sports-betting markets in Europe and has been significantly regulated since 2004. According to Statista, revenue in Serbia’s gambling market is projected to reach more than $526 million in 2025[1].
