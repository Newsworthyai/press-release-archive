# PickleJar Announces LOI for Strategic Partnership With Sonicbids to Expand Venue and Artist Subscription Services

PickleJar Adds Monthly Artist Subscription Services and Venue Booking Technology to Its Portfolio

 HOUSTON - February 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - PickleJar Entertainment Group, (OTCMKTS: PKLE), a leading Texas-based music and entertainment software company, today announced a Letter of Intent with Sonicbids and Advance Music Technologies to integrate PickleJar’s payment technology, PickPay, with Sonicbids verified bookings and artist subscription platform. This collaboration will provide venues, particularly those booking stage and streaming events, with a faster, more streamlined path to contracting and paying Artists through PickleJar’s advanced transaction, ticketing and experience platform.

 As part of the partnership, the integration of PickleJar’s PickPay transaction technology will be used to facilitate their monthly recurring subscription plan for Artists. Currently, Sonicbids has over 100,000 actively gigging artists that will be added to the PickleJar Live app. PickleJar will also upgrade the Artist’s Electronic Press Kit with their “tip now” technology to enhance Fan engagement.

 Additionally, the companies plan to integrate Sonicbid’s “gig” booking technology with PickleJar’s Venue portal and the Venue Managed Services (VMS) offering to include Venue-to-Artist payments for bookings that occur on their platform. This will include the roll-out of PickleJar’s smart contract feature to create better transparency and velocity of Artist payments.

 As part of the agreement, Sonicbids will activate their Venue sales team as a Channel Sales Partner to the 1500 Venues using their platform today. This will be an “agent model” and will include a revenue share of VMS services including ticketing, digital signage advertising and broadband services.

 “PickleJar is providing our Artists and Venues with next-generation fan experiences to help them lower the cost of engagement and expand their overall marketing footprint,” said Jeff James, chief executive officer for PickleJar. “This partnership leverages Sonicbid’s innovative approach to end-to-end event booking, complementing other transaction and event management investments we are making as part of our higher returns, greater market penetration strategy.”

 “Our partnership with PickleJar is about more than technology - it’s about empowering independent artists at every stage. By integrating PickPay with Sonicbids, we’re making it easier for artists to get booked, paid, and discovered, while giving venues the tools to build thriving live music communities. We are proud to ally with a partner who is dedicated to co-investing in Sonicbids’ platform functionality and high-performing monthly recurring revenue streams to better support our customers,” commented Bennett Johnson, Head of Corporate Strategy & Product for Advance Music Technologies and Sonicbids.

 This partnership continues to enhance PickleJar’s Venue Managed Services (VMS) offering which includes intelligent ticketing solutions, digital signage, broadband connectivity, live streaming and “skip the line” digital rewards. What sets VMS apart is its seamless integration across its services, leading POS systems, e-commerce platforms, and marketing tools. PickleJar’s Unified Entertainment Ecosystem eliminates implementation hassles and creates a seamless Fan experience, saving Venue Partners time and effort.
