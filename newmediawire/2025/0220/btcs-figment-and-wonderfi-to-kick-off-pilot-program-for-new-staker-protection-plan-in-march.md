# BTCS, Figment And WonderFi To Kick Off Pilot Program For New Staker Protection Plan In March

by Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - February 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BTCS Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCS), the blockchain infrastructure and technology company out to transform the approach to supporting Ethereum validators, announced it is partnering with Figment Inc., a blockchain infrastructure provider, for the launch of its Staker Protection Plan (SPP). As part of the pilot program for this new approach to protecting stakers, digital asset company WonderFi Technologies Inc. will become Figment's first customer.

 Announced in January, the intention of the Staker Protection Plan is to enhance financial stability and operational security for Ethereum blockchain validators and overcome some of the pain points of staking – giving validators predictable staking rewards while also boosting revenue.

 Stable Income And More

 Under the plan, BTCS says validators can gain stable income via pre-sold block space on the Ethereum network and retain as much as 90% of execution layer reward profits, which it says can increase earnings by up to 4%. The pre-sold blocks are built in adherence to regulatory standards, including compliance with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC.

 That is important because it prevents users from sending or receiving funds from individuals or organizations on the OFAC list of sanctioned entities or individuals, which aims to stop the use of cryptocurrency for illegal activities. Businesses and individuals that don’t comply with OFAC regulations on the Ethereum network could face legal repercussions. By building it into BTCS’s Staker Protection Plan, the company says it ensures a secure and legally compliant environment that enhances validators' ability to mitigate risks.

 The Staker Protection Plan also plans to include transaction pre-confirmation capabilities for enhanced predictability for users and dApps on the blockchain. The company said its system, leveraging advanced MEV infrastructure, will be able to signal probable transaction outcomes before final block confirmations. That reduces wait time and the need for frequent re-submissions during periods of high congestion.

 Blockchain congestion occurs when the number of transactions on the network exceeds its capacity, resulting in processing delays. In essence, it’s a digital traffic jam that can cost users time and money.

 BTCS’ Staker Protection Plan also aims to enhance the efficiency of order ﬂow management for both dApps and searchers, promoting smoother transaction experiences and optimizing block space use. BTCS says it plans to facilitate direct monetization of block space by enabling access for dApps and wallets, promoting greater revenue potential and network decentralization.

 “The Staker Protection Plan launch underscores our commitment to empowering blockchain validators with innovative solutions,” said BTCS CEO Charles Allen when the company announced the plan. “This initiative also sets the stage for revenue growth and improved margins, aligning with our strategic vision of sustainable and scalable success.”

 Overcoming Blockchain Pain Points

 BTCS and Figment said the partnership underscores their commitment to addressing the critical challenges that impact the blockchain and advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem. With WonderFi’s pilot, stakers on the WonderFi-owned Bitbuy and Coinsquare platforms will be the first to reap the benefits of this new plan. The pilot program is slated to go live on mainnet in March 2025 in connection with Ethereum’s Pectra update. The Pectra upgrade is designed to boost network speed and lower transaction costs. Figment and BTCS have customer reps standing by for stakers interested in participating in the Staker Protection Plan and users seeking information about transaction execution and enhanced features of the program, the companies report.

 “By partnering with Figment and integrating WonderFi as the first participant, we are laying a strong foundation for staker empowerment and ecosystem growth,” says Allen. “This partnership exemplifies our dedication to delivering solutions that foster revenue growth and operational excellence.”

 Founded in 2014, BTCS pioneered Bitcoin mining as the first U.S. public company in the space. Over the years, BTCS has shifted its focus to Ethereum, leveraging its expertise to drive growth in validator node operations and block building. Since shifting to Ethereum, BTCS has become a key participant in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake ecosystem, operating 522 validator nodes. To learn more about BTCS and its recent partnership, click here.
