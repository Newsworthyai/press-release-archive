# Blackwell 3D Partners With National Human Resource Development Organization of India to Build Affordable Housing Using 3D Printing Technology

DUBAI, UAE - February 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Blackwell 3D Construction Corp. (OTC: BDCC) (“Blackwell 3D” or the “Company”), an innovative 3D house printing technology company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Human Resource Development Organization (NHRDO) of India to develop affordable housing units across the country.

 This collaboration aims to introduce cutting-edge 3D printing technology to the Indian housing sector, enabling the rapid construction of high-quality, cost-effective, and sustainable residential units. By leveraging automated, AI-driven 3D printing techniques, this initiative will help bridge the housing gap and support India’s national mission for affordable housing for all.

 Mitesh Rasaikar, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Blackwell 3D, believes that “this partnership marks a major milestone in revolutionizing the way homes are built in India. Traditional construction methods often struggle to meet the rising demand for affordable housing due to high costs, long timelines, and material inefficiencies. With 3D printing, we can construct durable, customizable, and energy-efficient homes in a fraction of the time and cost. Working with NHRDO will allow us to bring this innovation to the communities that need it most, creating a new era of sustainable and accessible housing solutions.”

 On behalf of NHRDO, Jaffer Khatri added that “we are committed to driving impactful housing solutions across India. Partnering with Blackwell 3D enables us to implement futuristic, technology-driven construction methods that will redefine the affordable housing landscape. Together, we aim to accelerate homeownership opportunities for low- and middle-income families while promoting sustainable urban and rural development.”

 Key Objectives of the Agreement:

 * Deploy 3D-printed construction technology for large-scale affordable housing projects.
* Execute pilot projects to demonstrate the feasibility and durability of 3D-printed homes.
* Enhance local expertise by developing training programs for construction workers and engineers.
* Collaborate on research & development to optimize materials and designs suited to India’s climate and infrastructure needs.
* Engage with government and policymakers to establish national standards for 3D-printed housing solutions.

 By integrating automation, AI, and advanced construction robotics, Blackwell 3D and NHRDO aim to:

 * Reduce construction time by over 50% compared to traditional methods.
* Cut material waste, making housing more eco-friendly and cost-efficient.
* Ensure structural integrity with disaster-resistant, climate-adaptive homes.
* Customize housing designs to fit urban and rural development needs.

 This technology-driven approach is aligned with India’s affordable housing and smart city initiatives, ensuring faster, scalable, and more sustainable housing solutions for millions of people.

 The transaction is and will be subject to a range of conditions, including, but not limited to, Blackwell 3D and NHRDO entering into a definitive agreement (the "Definitive Agreement") containing terms and conditions outlined in the MOU, as well as representations and warranties, conditions, and other provisions all customary for transactions of this nature. The MOU creates a binding obligation on both parties to take reasonable best efforts to complete due diligence and enter into a Definitive Agreement. Updates on the status of the Definitive Agreement will be provided as they become available.
