# Brett Beveridge of T-ROC Global Warns of Long-Lasting Business Impacts if CEOs and Retail Leaders Don't Embrace AI Education for Employees

MIAMI, FL - February 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Brett Beveridge, founder and CEO of The Revenue Optimization Companies (T-ROC Global), the leading provider of people and technology solutions for the global retail market, is signaling the importance of educating employees at every level about the transformative power of AI by warning CEOs to take action this new year, especially in the retail industry. AI is becoming more prevalent than ever and businesses that do not utilize it will fall behind and potentially be unable to recover. The strategic use of AI aids in gathering and analyzing customer data, predicts buying behaviors, automates routine tasks, forecasts trends, and improves the overall customer experience.

 Beveridge has witnessed firsthand that for AI to be truly effective, it requires more than just the availability of the technology. It requires a workforce that understands its potential, its limitations, and how to leverage it to improve processes and drive innovation. He cautions that without proper training, businesses could face long-term disruptions, as employees may struggle to adapt to new technologies or miss opportunities to optimize workflows.

 “The time to act is now. CEOs and retail leaders must prioritize AI education and adoption, or risk being left behind as competitors gain a technological edge,” says Beveridge. “AI is not a trend. It is a fundamental shift in how businesses operate, communicate with customers, and make data-driven decisions. Companies that fail to adopt AI solutions may find themselves at a severe competitive disadvantage before end of 2025.”

 As a leader in the future of retail, T-ROC embraced AI over four years ago during the pandemic with the introduction of VIBA, the world’s first Virtual Interactive Brand Ambassador. It’s first-of-its-kind in-store customer engagement solution that offers a Facetime-like experience for customers while they are at a store. T-ROC employees joined AI training sessions earlier this year which were followed by a 30-day workshop to explore how Generative AI (GenAI) can transform their business operations, uncover new opportunities, and better serve their customers.

 Retail CEOs who embrace AI education for their employees are investing in the future success of their organizations. By fostering an AI-literate workforce, they ensure their company remains competitive, efficient, and innovative, while empowering employees to navigate the complex digital landscape with confidence.
