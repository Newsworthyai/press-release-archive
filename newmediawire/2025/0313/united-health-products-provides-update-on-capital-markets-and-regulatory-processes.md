# United Health Products Provides Update on Capital Markets and Regulatory Processes

MT. LAUREL, NJ - March 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - United Health Products, Inc. (OTCPK: UEEC) today provided an update on the company’s regulatory and capital markets activities.

 As precisely disclosed, UHP has submitted an application to OTC Markets to have its common shares quoted on the OTCQB market, which the company believes will increase the base of potential investors and boost trading liquidity, among other benefits. OTC Markets recently requested certain additional information from the company which it expects to submit by the end of March, allowing OTC Markets to complete its review of the application.

 In order to fund previously announced clinical activities related to its Premarket Approval application, UHP has raised over $500,000 through private placement transactions during the current and most recent fiscal quarters with existing and new investors, and has not relied on its Equity Line of Credit with White Lion Capital. The company expects that it will be able to raise sufficient capital through similar private placements to fund the remaining clinical study and other PMA application.

 As part of its PMA process the company submitted an Investigational Device Exemption application to the FDA. In its most recent discussion with UHP, the FDA has requested certain additional sterilization and biotoxicity tests, the last of which will be completed and submitted by the end of March, allowing the FDA to conduct final review of the IDE application. In parallel with this testing, UHP has completed negotiations of a Clinical Trial Agreement with a national hospital and surgical center operator that has identified three facilities within its network that will conduct the planned 27 surgical procedures requested by the FDA. Additional pre-enrollment tasks are being undertaken concurrently with the IDE application so that patient enrollment can begin as soon as possible following IDE approval.

 Recent actions by the Trump Administration to reduce the federal government workforce have included reductions in force and voluntary resignation packages affecting FDA staff. The company notes certain Administration statements to the effect that FDA employees who review new drug and device applications are excluded from voluntary resignation programs. As of the current date, UHP observes that the FDA response times to its correspondence are generally consistent with past practice.

 There can be no assurance that the Premarket Approval or the OTCQB uplisting applications will be granted.
