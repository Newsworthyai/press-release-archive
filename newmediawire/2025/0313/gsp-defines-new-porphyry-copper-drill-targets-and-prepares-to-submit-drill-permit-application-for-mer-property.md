# GSP Defines New Porphyry Copper Drill Targets and Prepares to Submit Drill Permit Application for Mer Property

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GSP Resource Corp. (TSX-V: GSPR / FSE: 0YD / OTC: GSRCF) (the “Company” or “GSP”) announces that it is nearing completion of a draft 5-year multi-year area based (MYAB) permit application in preparation for submission to the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Metals (“BC MMCM”) and review by relevant First Nation’s groups with respect to the Mer Property in the Highland Valley Copper Camp of British Columbia.

 - Historic exploration work discovered shallow copper mineralization

 - Historic shallow drilling included 30m averaging 0.53% Cu and 21m averaging 0.51% Cu

 - High priority for follow up exploration during upcoming field season

 The Mer Property comprises 185 hectares in the Kamloops Mining Division, located approximately 1.5 km NW of GSP’s Alwin Mine Project and are surrounded by Teck Resource’s Highland Valley Copper claim group directly west and south of the Highland Valley Copper Mine’s active operations[1] (Figure 1).  The Mer Property hosts a copper exploration target zone located NW of the Company’s Alwin Mine High grade copper-silver-gold target zone.

 The permit application is expected to describe the details of an initial year-one diamond drilling program, followed by permitting of sufficient surface disturbance to support anticipated expansion diamond drilling within the following four years of the permit. The Property is well accessed via existing logging roads that traverse the proposed drilling area where prior logging activities and excavator trenching has exposed a zone of copper mineralization at surface (Figure 2).

 About the Mer Claims:

 The Mer Claims were the subject of intensive exploration by the Cleveland Ming & Smelting Co. Ltd. between the years 1965 and 1971.  During that time exploration within the current Mer and surrounding claims now held by Teck Highland Valley Copper Corporation comprised geochemical and IP/resistivity geophysical surveys, geologic mapping, bulldozer trenching, completion of 16 percussion drill holes totaling 610 metres (m), and a single 150 m diamond drill hole targeting the Mer showing.

 Percussion and diamond drilling were reported to define a 70 x 120 metre northeast trending porphyry copper-molybdenum zone characterized by disseminated chalcocite, chalcopyrite, bornite and molybdenite mineralization and associated biotite and sparse potassic alteration.

 At the Mer showing, historical percussion drill holes 1, 3, 15, and 16, forming a 70 x 40 m diamond pattern in plan returned values of 9 m averaging 0.47% copper (Cu); 30 m averaging 0.53% Cu; 15 m averaging 0.50% Cu; and 21 m averaging 0.51% Cu[2] respectively, commencing at downhole depths ranging from 6 to 18 m.

 A single diamond drill hole was centered on the percussion drill holes and intersected a zone of chalcocite mineralization within biotite and potassic altered granodiorite intrusive rocks averaging 0.29% Cu over 24 m from a downhole depth of 9 m.  The zone of mineralization remains open to the north and west.

 No significant exploration has been reported within this project since the initial work programs ending in the early 1970’s. Given the presence of drill confirmed porphyry copper-molybdenum mineralization, a location 6 kilometers west of the Valley Pit at Teck Resource Limited’s Highland Valley Copper Operations, and its position with the Chataway and Guichon granodiorite phases of the Guichon Batholith the Mer Project is a high priority for follow up exploration.
