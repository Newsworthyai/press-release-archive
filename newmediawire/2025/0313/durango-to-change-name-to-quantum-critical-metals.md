 About Critical MetalsCritical metals are essential components in modern technologies, including renewable energy systems, defense applications, and advanced electronics. Both the United States and Canada have identified specific lists of critical minerals vital to their economic and national security. The U.S. Geological Survey’s 2022 list includes 50 critical minerals, while Canada in 2024 has designated 34 minerals as critical.

 Recent geopolitical developments have heightened concerns over the supply chain security of these critical metals. China, which holds a dominant position in the production and processing of several critical minerals, has implemented export bans affecting the West. These actions underscore the strategic importance of diversifying supply chains and developing domestic sources for critical metals to mitigate geo-political risks and ensure the stability of essential industries.

(TSXV: DGO) (OTCQB: ATOXF) (Frankfurt: 86A1) is a Canadian exploration company focused on advancing critical metals projects to support the West’s growing demand for secure and sustainable mineral supply.
