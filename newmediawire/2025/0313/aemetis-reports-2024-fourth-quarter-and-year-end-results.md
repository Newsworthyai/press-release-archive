 CUPERTINO, CA - March 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on low and negative carbon intensity products, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2024.

 “Revenues for the full year of 2024 were $268 million, an increase of $81 million compared to 2023, driven by significant growth in every business segment,” said Todd Waltz, Chief Financial Officer of Aemetis. “Capital expenditures for carbon intensity reduction and the expansion of biogas production capacity were $20.3 million for 2024 as our engineering and construction teams moved forward with low carbon initiatives that we expect to complete this year and next,” added Waltz.

 Aemetis is pleased with the key achievements during 2024, reflecting our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and growth in the renewable energy sector. Notable milestones include:

 * Solar Microgrid Installation: Completed the installation of a $12 million, 1.9 MW solar microgrid with battery storage at our California ethanol plant, resulting in reductions in energy costs and the carbon intensity of our ethanol production.
* California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Credits: Initiated the generation and sale of LCFS credits by our Renewable Natural Gas business.
* Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Renewable Diesel Plant: Received the Authority to Construct air permits needed to develop a 90 million gallon per year sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel production facility at the Riverbank Industrial Complex.
* IRA Section 48C Tax Credit Allocation: Received an allocation of $10.5 million in IRA Section 48C Tax Credits for the installation of a Mechanical Vapor Recompression system at our ethanol plant, in addition to $6 million in California Energy Commission grants and $3.2 million in PG&E grants.
* India Business Expansion: Appointed a new CEO to lead growth initiatives for our India subsidiary, with a focus on advancing toward an initial public offering (IPO) for the India business.
* Biodiesel Production Capacity: Increased biodiesel production capacity in India from 60 million gallons per year to 80 million gallons per year, further enhancing our global renewable energy footprint.
* Biogas Production Increase: Completed construction of four new dairy digesters, which, along with seven already operating digesters and one digester nearing completion, are expected to have a production capacity of 550,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG) per year.

 These accomplishments demonstrate Aemetis’ successful progress in advancing sustainable energy solutions and contributing towards a lower-carbon economy.

 “In addition to achieving important operational milestones during 2024 in all of our business segments, we began generating valuable 45Z tax credits in January 2025, and E15 ethanol blends have already been approved by the EPA for eight states with approval for 49 states expected by the end of 2025,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “Expanding domestic, lower cost energy that provides revenues to farmers and strengthens rural areas is the core of our mission at Aemetis, so we are pleased to see policy support from the White House and Congress for our growth plans.”

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

 We have provided non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the accompanying supplemental data. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest and amortization expense, gain on debt extinguishment, USDA cash grants, income tax expense or benefit, intangible and other amortization expense, accretion expense, depreciation expense, loss on asset disposal and share-based compensation expense.

 Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is a useful performance measure that is widely used within the industry in which we operate. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA for reviewing financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes and as a non-GAAP liquidity measure. Adjusted EBITDA measures are not calculated in the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure for comparison between companies.
