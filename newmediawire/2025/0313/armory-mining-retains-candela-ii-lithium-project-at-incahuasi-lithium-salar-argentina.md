# Armory Mining Retains Candela II Lithium Project at Incahuasi Lithium Salar, Argentina

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - March 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Armory Mining Corp. (CSE: ARMY) (OTC: RMRYF) (FRA: 2JS) (the "Company" or "Armory") reports that American Salars has relinquished its option to develop the Candela II lithium brine project and so the Company now has control of the Candela II property that covers 3,000 Has and has a inferred resource of 457,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate in-situ at Incahuasi Salar (salt lake). This resource estimate was completed by WSP Australia.  The current lithium carbonate price is $10,070 per tonne for 99.5% battery grade.

 Table 1: 86,000 tonnes of lithium metal converts to 457,000 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate insitu.

 A 200 litre sample of brine was collected in September 2022 with a lithium content of 140ppm for Ekosolve Inc, a DLE solvent extraction specialist company in Australia and USA. Ekosolve was able to extract 93.1% of the lithium from the brines that averaged 140ppm in well 4 although an assay of 169ppm was recorded from another sample. Five RC wells have been drilled, TEM geophysics and geochemistry surveys have been completed.

 Ganfeng Lithium (SHE:002460), China’s largest producer of the battery metal has the adjacent concession and Rio Tinto and Power Minerals (PNN) are closeby. Ganfeng have a production well approximately 9.8km from the Candela II concession.

 Fast Track Ekosolve Lithium Processing Facility

 Armory advises they have signed a licence agreement to utilize the Ekosolve™ lithium Solvent Exchange Extraction process that can efficiently manage the processing of the brines to produce lithium carbonate with a grade higher than 99.2% and a recovery of 93% far exceeding any ion exchange or adsorption process available to date. Ekosolve™ is licensed by Ekosolve Inc. USA.

 The key advantage of the Ekosolve system is the high rate of lithium extraction yield at 93% and 99.7% of the solvent is reclaimed (which is biodegradable) making it very environmentally friendly.  Hence the capital and operation expenditure is usually much lower.  There are no ponds required which is a more eco-friendly solution. At the current lithium price Ekosolve advise a 10,000 tonne plant would return about 250% operating margin at current prices.
