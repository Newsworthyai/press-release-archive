# Image Protect Announces New Consumer Products Division and Secures Exclusive Marketing and Distribution Rights for Major Health-Related Products in Multi-Billion Dollar Sectors

Company Announces Global Wellness Products a New Division of Image Protect, Inc.

 TAMPA, FL - March 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Image Protect, Inc. (OTC:IMTL) (ImageProtectCorporation.com) (“Image Protect” or the “Company”), in a major announcement the Company has created Global Wellness Products, a new consumer products division in the health and wellness sector, and has already secured its first of several contracts for the marketing and distribution of cutting-edge light therapy health products, as well as other contracts that are currently under negotiation for several other popular new consumer products to be announced.

 This exclusive contract with Canadian company Therma Bright, Inc. (TSXV:THRM) (OTC:TBRIF), a leading developer specializing in advanced diagnostic and medical device technologies, gives Global Wellness Products the exclusive rights to market and distribute several of their popular and innovative products.

 With this new division, Global Wellness Products expects to penetrate the multi-billion-dollar health and wellness sector and aggressively market its products on many platforms. This new division is up and running, taking orders and shipping products. With a proven track record of over $2 million in sales in the Canadian market, and with the US market being over ten times larger, the InterceptCS(TM) cold sore prevention product, one of the featured items offered on the Global Wellness Products website, will command the top spot in our initial national advertising campaigns, with strong projected direct-to-consumer sales.

 CEO of Global Wellness Products, Frank Casella, stated, “With our new funding partner and initial capital input, we are rapidly expanding the company with this exciting new division. We see great opportunity within the retail marketplace to introduce Therma Bright’s consumer products, including the InterceptCS™ Cold Sore Prevention Device, as this proven medical device addresses the growing global cold sore treatment market*, which in 2024 was estimated at USD$1.02 billion and is expected to grow to USD$1.57 billion over the next 7 years. The InterceptCS™ device fits nicely into this marketplace, which is mainly driven by ointments and creams. With over 5 million chronic cold sore sufferers in the U.S. alone, the potential for this unique, proven product is nothing short of limitless. The technology, efficacy, and pricing are going to be a resounding success for the company, and our excellent working relationship with Therma Bright will continue to produce additional opportunities.”

 President of Therma Bright, Rob Fia, added, “We’re pleased to team up with Global Wellness Products for the sale and delivery of our cutting-edge consumer products, including the successful InterceptCS™ cold sore prevention device, and witness how its consumer-direct marketing expertise and retail partners can help to market and sell our innovative cold sore prevention device and related heat and light therapy products. We anticipate great success and look forward to working with Frank Casella and Global Wellness Products.”

 With over 50 years of combined experience in the direct response consumer sales industry, the management team at Image Protect believes that Global Wellness Products is the perfect opportunity to drive additional revenue and profits to the company. The company is excited about this new division and, because of the potential in the billion-dollar markets, expects Global Wellness Products to quickly become its highest-grossing division.
