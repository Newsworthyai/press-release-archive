# MAX Automation SE Plans to Switch to the General Standard for More Efficient Capital Market Communication and a Sharper Focus on Its Operating Business

* Reduction of administrative requirements and related costs
* Focus on operational development and strategic growth initiatives
* Continuation of quarterly capital market communications

 HAMBURG - December 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MAX Automation SE (ISIN DE000A2DA588), a company listed in the Prime Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, intends to transfer its listing within the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange from the Prime Standard to the General Standard. In making this move, the company intends to make its capital market presence more efficient while maintaining its high standards of transparency and continuity in capital market communications. MAX Automation SE will continue to voluntarily report on its business performance on a quarterly basis and with a view to its shareholder structure in German.

 The planned switch to the General Standard is intended to reduce costs and administrative expenses, thereby freeing up resources that were previously tied up by the additional requirements of the Prime Standard. These resources can then be specifically channelled into the operational development of the Group and strategic growth initiatives in the future.

 In this context, the Supervisory Board of MAX Automation SE will submit an application to the management of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to revoke the admission of the company’s shares to the segment of the Regulated Market with additional post-admission obligations (Prime Standard). The admission of the shares to the Regulated Market (General Standard) will nevertheless be retained.“By making the planned change, we are striking a balance between operational efficiency and the demands of the stock exchange segment we are choosing. We are focusing more strongly on the operational development of our Group and at the same time ensuring reliable and continuous communication with the capital market,” explained Guido Mundt, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of MAX Automation SE.CONTACT:
