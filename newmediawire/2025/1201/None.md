# HeartBeam (BEAT) Outlines Regulatory Strategy After NSE Decision on ECG Synthesis Software

LOS ANGELES, CA - December 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT), a medical technology company developing personalized cardiac-care insights, detailed its strategy following receipt of a Not Substantially Equivalent decision for its 510(k) submission covering its 12-lead ECG Synthesis Software. The Company has been in active discussions with FDA review staff, which have signaled willingness to work toward a constructive resolution. HeartBeam said its VALID-ECG clinical study met endpoints and that remaining FDA concerns may be resolved through revised labeling. To advance the process, the Company plans to pursue multiple parallel paths - including a formal appeal or a 510(k) resubmission - and believes recent interactions indicate a viable path forward under the appeal option, which carries an expected 60-day timeline. HeartBeam will continue providing updates on commercialization and funding plans as regulatory engagement progresses.
