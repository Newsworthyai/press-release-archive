NEW YORK, NY - December 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SmartCard Marketing Systems Inc. (OTC: SMKG), a global PayTech, FinTech and Digital Assets solutions provider, is pleased to present its 2025 Year in Review. This year marked a period of sustainability coming off 2023-24, proofing our accelerated commercialization, expanded global deployments, and strategic entry into high‑growth sectors including mining resources, energy and utilities, and aerospace - further strengthening the company’s position as a leader in payment technology, banking and token‑based digital asset frameworks.

 A Transformative Year for Platform Deployments

 Throughout 2025, SMKG advanced multiple enterprise‑grade deployments across banking, payments, and digital commerce. The company expanded its footprint with clients and partners in North America, Caribbean, India, China, Africa, and LATAM-solidifying its position as a global enabler of financial infrastructure and networks.

* Cloud‑native deployments with enhanced telemetry, monitoring, and operational resilience.
* Integration of digital asset and stablecoin capabilities into select platforms, aligning with global trends in regulated digital finance.

 Strategic Expansion into Mining, Energy/Utilities, and Aerospace

 In 2025, SmartCard expanded into three high‑value, infrastructure‑critical sectors - mining resources, energy/utilities, and aerospace - introducing both payment technology, tokenization and token‑issuing frameworks tailored to the operational and financial needs of these industries.

 This expansion included:

 * Mining & Natural Resources: Tokenized asset models, supply‑chain payment rails, and digital twin frameworks for inground assets.
* Utilities & Energy: Payment orchestration, billing automation, and token‑based credit systems supporting distributed infrastructure.
* Aerospace & Advanced Manufacturing: Secure payment modules, digital certification tokens, and operational telemetry integrations.

 These initiatives broadened SMKG’s commercial reach and validated new proof concept models, accelerating revenue opportunities and positioning the company at the intersection of industrial operations and next‑generation financial technology.

 Strategic Banking Relationships, VISA Collaboration & Core Architecture Advancements

 2025 was also a defining year for SmartCard’s strategic relationships in the financial sector. The company strengthened key banking relationships across the United States, advancing commercial opportunities and expanding access to regulated financial infrastructure. In parallel, SMKG deepened its collaboration with VISA, aligning its platform capabilities with global card‑network standards and enabling next‑generation payment experiences for small and medium banks and enterprise clients.

 These relationships were complemented by major advancements in SMKG’s core payments architecture, middleware and client-facing solutions, which now positions the company as a leader in proprietary, industry‑agnostic payment technology. The unified architecture integrates:

 * Card Processing & Card Issuing under a single orchestration layer
* Alternative Payment Channels including QR, Push2Card, Cash2Atm, Digital Vouchers and Digital Cash Cards
* Cross‑Border Payment Rails with automated FX settlement workflows
* Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins with OTC Desk on-ramp and off-ramp liquidity
* Token‑based transaction models supporting digital assets and sector‑specific token issuance across global Crypto Exchanges

 This unified approach delivers scalable, modular, and globally deployable payments infrastructure - capable of serving any industry or sector, from banking and retail to mining, utilities, aerospace, and beyond. These advancements created significant enterprise value, accelerated commercialization, and reinforced SMKG’s position as a global leader in interoperable financial technology.

 Strengthening the Proprietary Product Portfolio

 SMKG continued to refine and commercialize its suite of 22+ proprietary platforms, focusing on interoperability with cryptocurrencies, vaulted custody, security, treasury with stablecoins, fiat-to-crypto, and enterprise‑grade scalability.

 Notable advancements:
