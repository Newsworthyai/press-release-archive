By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. (OTCPK: DUTV), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Formerly known as Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. and listed under the same name, Easy Environmental Solutions is on a mission to improve food security, promote sustainable forms of agriculture, create access to clean water and renewable energy and work toward a net carbon-neutral future. One way it is doing that is with NanoVoid, Easy Environmental Solutions’ advanced water treatment technology. Customers are using it to get more oil out of the ground and to clean lakes of contamination.

 Then there is its EasyFEN waste-to-fertilizer system, which is under production for Kenya and is expected to ship in November. Aiming to eliminate starvation in Africa, EasyFEN is a fully automatic system that converts waste from each local community into Terreplenish, the company’s organic microbial fertilizer made from recycled food and crop waste and is targeted at lifeless, unproductive soil.

 “Country after country after country is excited,” Gaalswyk told Benzinga. “Millions of people are starving in your country, and you see a solution that solves it…it's causing excitement in many countries across Africa.”
