# Beamr Transforms Live 4K Sports Broadcasting Economics

By Beamr

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Live broadcasting of global sports events face a critical economic bottleneck. While the majority of households in North America now have 4K screens, many broadcasters still capture footage at the field at lower resolutions, such as 720p. The gap between viewer expectations for premium 4K quality and the high costs of delivering it in real-time is a core business problem that causes frustrations among dedicated sports viewers and risks their loyalty and monetization.

 Beamr Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ: BMR) is demonstrating a solution that addresses this economic and technological challenge at the IBC Show 2025 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The demonstration showcases a unified workflow that leverages GPU-accelerated, AI-powered 4K quality enhancement with Beamr’s technology. This allows broadcasters and streamers of live events to elevate low-resolution content to stunning 4K quality, while simultaneously cutting content delivery expenses by up to 50%, making it CDN-friendly.

 Emmy-Winning Technology Meets Sports Broadcasters Challenges

 At the core of Beamr's offering is its Emmy®-winning Content-Adaptive Bitrate (CABR) technology. This patented technology, accelerated by GPUs, enables efficient compression by analyzing each frame to reduce file sizes by up to 50% while preserving quality. This unique capability allows broadcasters to both meet the demand for premium 4K video, even when captured during sport events in low resolution, and deliver it in real-time, all while keeping costs under control.

 Beamr CEO Sharon Carmel highlights the key advantages of this solution: "Broadcasters and streamers have long faced the dilemma of balancing premium quality with cost efficiency for live events. Our demonstration showcases how this challenge can be solved. The optimized, CDN-friendly and low latency 4K live broadcasting can transform live broadcasting for our partners’ customers and enhance the user experience of their viewers.”
