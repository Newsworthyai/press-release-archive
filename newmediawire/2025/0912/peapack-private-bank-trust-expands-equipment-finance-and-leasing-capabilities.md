BEDMINSTER, NJ - September 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select Market: PGC) and Peapack Private Bank & Trust are pleased to announce strategic growth within its equipment finance and leasing subsidiary, Peapack Capital, with the addition of a new team of seasoned specialists.

 Peapack Capital provides asset finance and equipment leasing solutions, specializing in mid- to large-scale transactions that empower businesses to grow and succeed. The subsidiary is now led by Anthony Perettine, Senior Managing Director and President, who is responsible for building and diversifying a portfolio of equipment lease and loan receivables through the development of both intermediary and direct business lines, while also managing the legacy capital markets business.

 “We are excited to join this well-established team,” said Anthony. “Peapack Capital was founded in 2017 and has grown considerably thanks to the dedication of an experienced team focused on entering and expanding in the equipment finance space. By joining now, we are investing in the future and committing to aggressive growth.”

 Anthony will lead efforts to expand products and markets, build strong client relationships, and drive portfolio and revenue growth with a focus on profitability. He joins Peapack Capital from Flagstar Financial, where he served as Executive Vice President and Division Head, growing the business to over $2 billion in assets and overseeing all production metrics, investment decisions, and strategic direction. His prior leadership roles include Managing Director and Senior Vice President at Capital One and Signature Bank, where he launched and led successful de novo equipment finance platforms.

 Joining Anthony is Bruce J. Winter, Senior Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for strategic leadership, client onboarding, risk management, regulatory compliance, and performance metrics. Bruce founded FSG Capital in 1991 and has served the equipment finance industry in numerous leadership roles, including:

 * Executive Board Member, Equipment Leasing and Finance Association
* 2024 Chair, LeasePAC
* Executive Board Member, Lutheran Church Extension Fund

 Also joining Peapack Capital from Flagstar Financial are Leslie Roberts, Lori Gresko, Kevin Kitson, and Nicholas L. Cremonese, Jr., who will support Anthony and Bruce in expanding the subsidiary’s capabilities.

 * Leslie Roberts, Senior Managing Director and Senior Client Relationship Manager, will oversee intermediary relationships, client satisfaction, and portfolio performance. With over 20 years of experience, Leslie is an expert in complex deal negotiation, account management, and strategic portfolio oversight.
* Lori Gresko, Senior Vice President and Senior Underwriter, leads the Peapack Capital underwriting department, developing credit policies, defining risk criteria, and managing portfolio performance. Lori is a graduate of St. John’s University and brings over 15 years of credit and underwriting experience.
* Kevin Kitson, Vice President and Senior Underwriter, supports transaction underwriting and risk management, with expertise in transportation, construction, and manufacturing sectors.
* Nicholas L. Cremonese, Jr., Managing Director and Relationship Manager, will manage intermediary client relationships, portfolio performance, and new business development, with a focus on national third-party intermediaries.

 “Our goal is to take the next step by more broadly developing an intermediary equipment finance and leasing program at Peapack Capital,” said Bruce. “We see this as additive to the current platform and believe that by combining it with our legacy business, Peapack Capital will be better positioned to compete with larger institutions in the space.”

 Working alongside Anthony, Bruce and the new team members, the legacy business, led by Lisa Chalkan, Lori Moylan, Richard Johnston and Lisa Fitzgerald, will continue to dedicate time and resources to offering best in class asset finance and equipment leasing solutions to a broad spectrum of industries and assets.

 * Lisa Chalkan, Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, is responsible for directing the Bank’s credit professionals and quality assurance teams to efficiently manage the high growth of the Bank’s loan originations and ensure continued high asset quality.
