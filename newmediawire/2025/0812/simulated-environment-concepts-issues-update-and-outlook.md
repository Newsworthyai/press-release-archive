# Simulated Environment Concepts Issues Update and Outlook

NEW BERN, NC - August 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. (OTC Pink: SMEV), a frontrunner in innovative livestock, crop, and aqua tech solutions that encompass transformative technology and sustainable livestock production, has released an Update and Outlook.

 SMEV is focused on not only expanding its current farm operations but, with the addition of Noah Wagler, is advancing three significant disruptive technologies within the livestock sector.

 In this context, SMEV is pleased to announce the completion of an 8-week trial involving a herd of 320 cattle, with 160 cattle raised under conventional conditions and the remaining 160 cattle provided with structured water. "Structured Water" is water with a specific molecular arrangement, often claimed to offer enhanced hydration and various health benefits for both humans and animals. These benefits are linked to the water's potential to hydrate cells more efficiently, aid in detoxification, and support overall well-being.

 Noah Wagler, the new director of SMEV, remarked, "The results were remarkable, with the cattle receiving structured water showing a 7.9% increase in protein growth, a substantial decrease in antibiotic usage, and only a 1% loss of cattle during the trial. What makes this test particularly significant is that all calves entering the trial were ill at the start, yet by the end, all cattle were healthy, and the cows appeared the most uniform they have ever looked."

 This represents a significant breakthrough, and while there are a few challenges to overcome before achieving widespread commercialization of the product, SMEV is highly optimistic about the prospects of structured water and two other patented technologies that could revolutionize livestock production. This development comes at a critical juncture for the industry, facing soaring beef prices and the risk of a collapse in cattle futures.

 At the start of the year, the cattle population in the United States had fallen to 86.7 million, the lowest figure for this period since 1951, according to US government statistics. "With a severe shortage in beef production, US ranchers must either begin rebuilding their herds as beef prices continue to rise or seek alternatives," stated Noah Wagler.

 At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, both live and feeder cattle prices experienced a significant increase, bolstered by the recent strength in boxed beef, in anticipation of widespread direct business.

 Beef cattle futures have surged by 27% this year, achieving a new peak for the industry. Cattle prices are optimistic in the futures market, as climate change has impacted U.S. cattle supplies, resulting in the largest shortage of cattle herds in the United States since 1951. Investors focused on raw materials are wagering that cattle prices will continue to rise.

 Following the successful outcomes and the initiation of a new 26-week test, SMEV is now set to accelerate the development of the other livestock patented technologies while also pursuing a direct-to-consumer beef business model, inspired by the crawfish farm, for livestock production.

 We will keep you informed as contracts are finalized for these upcoming projects. These agreements are anticipated to yield significant revenues for Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc, with the first contract expected to be signed within the week.
