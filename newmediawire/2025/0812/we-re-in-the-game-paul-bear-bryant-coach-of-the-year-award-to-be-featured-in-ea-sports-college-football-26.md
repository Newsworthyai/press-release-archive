 Coach Bryant’s journey to the top of college football began on September 11, 1913, in Moro Bottom, Arkansas. He started his playing career at Fordyce High School Redbugs and played in college for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He began his head coaching career at the University of Maryland in 1945, and after successful stints at Kentucky (1946-53) and Texas A&M (Agricultural and Mechanical University) (1954-57), coach Bryant took over the Alabama program in 1958 and led the Crimson Tide through the 1982 season. He won 323 games against just 85 losses and 17 ties, capturing six national championships, 14 SEC Championships, and one Southwest Conference championship. A three-time American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) Coach of the Year and 12-time Southeastern Conference (SEC) Coach of the Year, coach Bryant passed away from a heart attack on January 26, 1983 – just under a month after coaching his final game.

 The American Heart Association worked with the Bryant family after Coach Bryant’s death from a heart attack in 1983 to honor his legacy while advancing its mission to fight heart disease and stroke. Through this collaboration, the Association established the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards, which celebrate coaching excellence and raise vital funds for cardiovascular research and awareness.

 After his passing from a heart attack in 1983, the Bryant Family felt moved to educate and impact awareness around heart disease and stroke and approached the American Heart Association to create a meaningful collaboration to keep his legacy alive while raising funds to support the fight against cardiovascular disease and stroke.
