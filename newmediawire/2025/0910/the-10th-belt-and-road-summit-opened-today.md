 HONG KONG - September 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Belt and Road Summit, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR) and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), opened today at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. This year marks a significant milestone as the Summit celebrates its 10th edition under the theme Collaborate for Change • Shape a Shared Future. The Summit has convened over 90 key officials and business leaders from 16 Belt and Road countries and regions, aiming to explore new opportunities for collaboration and forge a win-win future.

 The Summit is dedicated to advancing multilateral cooperation, successfully signing 33 MoU on the first day, involving countries and regions such as Australia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Qatar and the UAE covering multiple sectors including finance, infrastructure and technology. On the second day, the Summit will continue to showcase the signing of more MoUs, fostering even greater collaboration and tangible results.

 The Opening Session featured opening remarks by John Lee, Chief Executive of the HKSAR, and welcome remarks by Professor Frederick Ma, Chairman of the HKTDC. Special addresses were delivered by Yan Dong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, Li Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Xiao Weiming, Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China. Keynote address was delivered by Sun Chanthol, Deputy Prime Minister and First Vice Chairman of the Council for the Development of Cambodia.

 John Lee said during his opening remarks: “Hong Kong is the ideal Belt and Road hub. As the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. We are a "super connector" and "super value-adder" for high-quality collaborations worldwide. Our "dual superpower" of connecting and value-adding means Hong Kong is more than a link between capital and projects. We also inject vigour, innovation and sustainability, adding strategic value to everything we do. Hong Kong will continue to drive high-quality development along the Belt and Road.”

 Professor Ma said: “We are proud to celebrate the 10th edition this year. The Summit has become a cornerstone event supporting the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the past decade, it has been gathering key voices in government and business from across the Belt and Road and beyond for dialogue and collaboration. Vital partnerships have been forged, impactful projects have been launched, and cross-border ties have been strengthened. And this year is no different. Collaboration opportunities once again take centre stage.”

 Yan Dong said during his special address: “The Ministry of Commerce will continue to strengthen economic and trade cooperation with all partners along the Belt and Road. First, we will continue to support Hong Kong in deepening its connectivity with the Mainland and the rest of the world. We will implement the revisions on the Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to CEPA Agreement on Trade in Services, which took effect in March this year, further expand mainland China's opening-up in areas such as finance, telecommunications, construction, and tourism, and explore the establishment of a single free-trade zone among mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Second, we will support Hong Kong in building functional platforms and in consolidating and enhancing its status as an international financial, shipping, and trade centre, enabling it to play a bridging role in facilitating connectivity in infrastructure, trade and finance under the Belt and Road Initiative, and expanding trade scale with participating countries.”

 Li Zhen said during his special address: “State-owned enterprises stand ready to join hands with all sectors in Hong Kong to explore opportunities and forge a shared future through reinforcing connectivity. We need to seize this Summit as an opportunity to leverage Hong Kong's unique blend of Chinese and Western cultures and its strengths in international communication, and lay a solid foundation for the Belt and Road Initiative.”

 Xiao Weiming said during his special address: “We have witnessed Hong Kong’s contribution to the Belt and Road Initiative by fully leveraging its role as a financial, trade, and innovation and technology hub. With the continuous expansion of trade cooperation networks among partner countries and the establishment of professional platforms such as Core Climate and the International Organization for Mediation, Hong Kong has achieved two-way development in both domestic and international trade. Hong Kong's future participation in the Belt and Road Initiative will be even more important and promising.”

 Sun Chanthol said during his keynote address: “Over the past decade, Cambodia has achieved remarkable progress with the support from China under the Belt and Road Initiative framework. Together, we have built over 3,000 kilometers of national roads and 16 major bridges, transforming the daily lives of millions of Cambodians. It has boosted tourism, reduced costs and enhanced Cambodian's role as a regional trade hub.”

This is where Hong Kong's leadership in sustainable finance is invaluable. By joining forces with Hong Kong, we can channel trillions of dollars of green capital into Belt and Road projects that are profitable and sustainable.”
