# Angkor Resources Receives Approval to Incorporate Mussel Basin Into Block VIII Oil and Gas License, Cambodia

GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA - September 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ANGKOR RESOURCES CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” OR “THE COMPANY”) announces its subsidiary, EnerCam Resources Co. Ltd. (Cambodia) (“EnerCam”) has received approval from government authorities of Ministry of Mines and Energy for an additional 220 square kilometers added within the Block VIII boundaries, referred to as the Mussel Basin.

 With the added area, Block VIII now is 4277 square kilometers in size, having removed all parks and protected area from development. Mike Weeks, President of EnerCam, comments, “We are very happy to add the Mussel Basin area to be part of Block VIII. This is a significant area with strong indications as an added sub-basin for exploration and development of oil and gas in Cambodia.”

 Figure 1: The active areas of Block VIII with seismic lines shown in red, the vintage 2008 seismic line in blue. Seismic is completed on the large west side of the area, now proceeding in the northwest corner. Proposed seismic for the Mussel Basin are shown on the NE section of the license.

 Justin Snelling, senior geologist and reservoir specialist for EnerCam describes the basin and its potential, “Mussel Basin is a self contained, Cenozoic age sedimentary basin. Our additional land parcel brings all prospective sedimentary zones of interest fully into Permit Block VIII and allows us to properly evaluate it with new 2-D seismic lines acquired during our current field seismic operations. A review of the two 2008 vintage Accelerated Weight Drop (AWD) 2-D seismic lines has identified interesting potential stratigraphic trapping anomalies that together with the known legacy surface oil seeps documented here making this basin a prospective target for early exploratory drilling.”
