# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. and Babcock International Group Execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications platforms, is pleased to announce it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Babcock International Group (“Babcock”) to co-develop and build a rapidly deployable platform integrating 5G communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) capabilities for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

 The agreement, signed at the DSEI (Defence and Security Equipment International) expo in London, will see both companies working exclusively on the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence request to supply 50 of CiTech’s Nexus 20 platforms.

 A New Standard in Rapid Deployment

 The solution will be delivered in a 20-foot containerised format, transportable by truck. Once deployed, the system will:

 - Provide 5G communications, counter-UAS, and ISR capability

 - Self-unload and adapt to sloping or uneven terrain

 - Deploy a 20m cyclone-rated tower to support mission-critical operations

 In addition, the MOU includes plans to explore the development of a Nexus 20 assembly hub in Eastern Europe and further opportunities across NATO’s Eastern Flank.

 Leadership Statements

 Mark Goldsack, Babcock’s International Director, said:“We are steadfast in our commitment to supporting Ukraine and in this new partnership with CiTech, we can deliver a rapidly deployable communications, counter-UAS and ISR capability as well as expanding our Eastern Europe footprint with a dedicated assembly hub.”

 Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech, added:“As an Australian defence industry SME, partnering with Babcock International unlocks a pathway for the Nexus 20 to be rapidly scaled across Ukraine and Eastern Europe. This isn’t a single deployment; it’s the beginning of a regional expansion that positions CiTech’s Nexus 20 as a benchmark capability across NATO’s Eastern Flank.”
