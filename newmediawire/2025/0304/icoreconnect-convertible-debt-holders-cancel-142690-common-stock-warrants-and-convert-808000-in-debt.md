# iCoreConnect Convertible Debt Holders Cancel 142,690 Common Stock Warrants and Convert $808,000 in Debt

OCOEE, FL - March 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - iCoreConnect Inc. (NASDAQ: ICCT), a leading provider of cloud-based software and technology solutions, announced that certain convertible debt holders converted $808,000 of debt into equity in February. This conversion strengthens the company’s shareholders’ equity and reduces future cash outflows.

 Additionally, these debt holders, who collectively owned 142,690 common stock warrants, agreed to cancel them immediately without consideration. The canceled warrants included anti-dilution provisions that could have led to an increase in the number of warrants and a reduction in the exercise price if new shares were issued at a lower price. By eliminating these warrants, iCoreConnect enhances its ability to raise future capital while minimizing potential shareholder dilution from such warrants, further supporting its growth strategy.
