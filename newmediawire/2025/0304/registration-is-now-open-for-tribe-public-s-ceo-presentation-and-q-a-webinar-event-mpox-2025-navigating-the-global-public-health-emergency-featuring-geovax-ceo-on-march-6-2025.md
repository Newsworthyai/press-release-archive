# Registration is Now Open For Tribe Public's CEO Presentation and Q&A Webinar Event MPOX 2025: Navigating the Global Public Health Emergency Featuring GeoVax CEO On March 6, 2025

* Mpox remains a global public health crisis in 2025, with Clade 1b exhibiting higher transmissibility and severity than Clade 2.
* The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the epicenter, with over 60,000 suspected cases and 1,300 deaths in 2024 alone.
* The virus has now spread to multiple countries, including the U.S., Canada, and Europe, raising concerns about global containment.
* The U.S. has confirmed four Clade 1b cases (California, Georgia, New Hampshire, and New York), prompting the need for urgent action.
* The current vaccine supply chain is inadequate, relying heavily on a single non-U.S. manufacturer.
* Delays in vaccine distribution, high costs, and limited production capacity have exacerbated the crisis, particularly in Africa, where vaccine stockpiles remain largely unused due to logistical and political challenges.
* GEO-MVA, the GeoVax Mpox vaccine candidate is advancing to clinical evaluation, anticipated for H2 ’25.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world's most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company's lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin(R), having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin(R) combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
