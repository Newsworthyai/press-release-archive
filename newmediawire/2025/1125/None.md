With anticipated attendance of more than 1,500 participants, the two-day event offers unlimited one-on-one meetings, company presentations, expert panel discussions, and extensive networking opportunities.

 As part of the collaboration, B2i Digital will share key updates about the conference with its community of 1.4 million participants across the U.S. capital markets. As the roster of companies and sponsors continues to grow, B2i Digital will ensure its audience remains informed and engaged.

 The conference maintains its commitment to facilitating connections through a concierge-style approach to one-on-one meetings, with onsite staff available to assist with introductions and scheduling.
