(NewMediaWire) - June 11, 2025 - Glendale, CA — The drums roared, lions danced, and history came alive as the Martial Arts History Museum celebrated its official grand opening in the heart of Glendale, California. Though its doors have been open for some time, it was the unveiling of its iconic new signage that signaled the true beginning—a moment a full year in the making.

 More than 150 guests filled the streets as a traditional Chinese Lion Dance led a vibrant procession to the entrance, where young martial artists gave thrilling demonstrations that drew cheers and awe. What began as a dream has now transformed into a living monument of culture, resilience, and legacy.

 Now celebrating its 26th year, the Martial Arts History Museum stands proudly as the only museum of its kind in the world—a place where centuries of tradition meet modern appreciation. Founded by 60-year martial arts veteran and historian Michael Matsuda, the museum is more than a collection of artifacts; it is a heartbeat for a global community.

 “This is a great day for martial artists everywhere,” said Matsuda. “This museum gives our community a home. An official hall of fame. A voice. Without it, so much of our rich history would simply disappear.”

 Inside the museum, visitors discovered two brand-new cultural exhibits—Armenian and Native American sections—further expanding the museum’s diverse representation of global martial traditions. On display were the legendary uniforms of martial arts pioneers: Jhoon Rhee, the father of American Tae Kwon Do; Ed Parker, the founder of American Kenpo; and Steve Sanders Muhammad, a tournament champion and key figure in the Black Karate.

 The celebration reached its peak with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by the museum’s Funakoshi Award winners: Art Camacho, Robin Price, Lady Lallaine Reed, David Reed, and Jacquelyn Egger—individuals recognized not only for their mastery of the arts but for their enduring contributions to the museum.

 The Martial Arts History Museum is not just a space—it's a sanctuary of stories, spirit, and strength. And now, it’s officially open to inspire the next generation.
