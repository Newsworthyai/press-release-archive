# SC Codeworks Launches CODI, Its AI-Powered Assistant, in Beta to Help Warehouse Operators Unlock Instant Insights From Their Data

COLUMBUS, OH - June 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SC Codeworks, a leading provider of flexible warehouse management solutions, today announced the beta release of “CODI”, its new AI-powered data retrieval and conversational command agent, built directly into the SC Codeworks platform. Designed to help warehouse operators and decision-makers instantly access insights from their data, “CODI” is now live in beta for internal users, with a full rollout expected in the coming weeks.

 CODI acts as a built-in expert on users’ own warehouse operations. It allows users to ask complex, targeted questions in conversational style and receive fast, accurate answers based on real-time system data. Examples of common inquiries include identifying which clients are behind on billing or inventory discrepancy analysis can be accessed via conversational phrases such as “Which customers are behind on billing?” or “Where are my inventory discrepancies this month?”. The innovation marks a significant advancement for the Codeworks platform and a powerful tool for warehouse operators.

 “Warehouse professionals are under constant pressure to make smarter decisions that drive profitability faster, and this tool takes interacting with your WMS to an entirely new place,” said Suresh Chappidi, President and CEO of SC Codeworks. “CODI enables teams to instantly access the answers they need, using the data they already have, without extensive input or filtering of reports. Think of it as having a built-in data analyst inside your WMS - always available, always responsive. CODI empowers operators to move from reactive to proactive decision-making, helping them stay ahead of issues, improve efficiency, and ultimately run a more resilient supply chain.”

 While next-gen tech has been a “buzzy” topic in the logistics field, SC Codeworks understood that while these technologies can innovate supply chains, they must be functional in today’s environment. “At our latest conference, many warehouse operators told us they were fatigued by AI hype and overpromises of useability,” said Amy Dean, Director of Operations at SC Codeworks. “We wanted to show them that when implemented correctly, AI can solve real problems that operators face each day, like surfacing unpaid invoices or flagging stalled orders, without becoming another cumbersome add-on expense.”

 CODI Beta offers a range of powerful capabilities designed to streamline warehouse intelligence. It can answer natural language questions using real-time system data, making it easy for users to get insights without technical know-how. CODI also flags operational risks, such as aging accounts receivable or low inventory levels, helping teams stay proactive. It understands context from uploaded documents - currently supporting Word files, with PDF and additional formats coming soon. Most importantly, CODI enables faster, more confident decision-making by eliminating the need to manually sift through dashboards or export reports.
