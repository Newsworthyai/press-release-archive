# Metrospaces, Inc. Announces Transformational Agreement Marking Its Corporate Rebirth

NEW YORK, NY - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metrospaces, Inc. (OTC: MSPC), a PropTech company focused on AI-based property management and real estate tokenization, today announced the signing of a Letter of Intent with Genesis Holdings, Inc. (OTC: GNIS), to sell two of its valuable assets - MetroCrowd, our blockchain-based real estate tokenization platform, and MetroHouse, our AI-powered property management software - to Genesis Holdings, Inc. In return, Metrospaces will receive $1 million in convertible preferred stock from Genesis, establishing the first true value-based path to rebuilding the company. The letter of intent is subject to the successful negotiation and closing of a definitive agreement.

 These two platforms, long envisioned but never launched due to financial constraints, will now be activated under the Genesis umbrella. Genesis is a dynamic entrepreneurial company that will now house and relaunch MetroCrowd and MetroHouse in the coming weeks, serving as a publicly traded operational partner aligned with Metrospaces in rebuilding these extraordinary assets.

 Metrospaces, meanwhile, retains its flagship project - Abode Stays - a premium hospitality platform focused on high-end short-term residences across Europe and the Americas.

 Metrospaces is now positioned to reemerge with real access to funding, a real business plan, and a real path to full relaunch.

 In alignment with this strategy, Metrospaces CEO Oscar Brito will be named CEO of Genesis Holdings once the transaction closes, ensuring full transparency and synergy across both companies. This structure creates operational clarity, cost efficiency, and a united front in executing on both Metrospaces’ and Genesis’ missions.

 The Road Ahead

 We thank our long-standing shareholders for their resilience and belief. This has not been an easy journey. But we never gave up. And now, with fire at our back and structure beneath our feet, we are walking forward again.

 Expect more. Expect better..
