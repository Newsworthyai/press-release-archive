# Angkor Resources Identifies Second Drill Target for Oil &amp; Gas on Its Block VIII, Cambodia

GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ANGKOR RESOURCES CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” OR “THE COMPANY”) announces its subsidiary, EnerCam Resources Co. Ltd. (Cambodia) (“EnerCam”) has a second drill target from an identified second anticline on Central Bokor Basin based on the 2-D seismic program recently completed on Block VIII (“Project”).

 EnerCam’s management team has reviewed several more seismic lines, and they have identified a second anticline in the Central Bokor area. The new Central Bokor Lead, circled in Figure 1 below, like the South Bokor lead, has clear four-way closure and a rough depth of 900-1200 meters.

 Keith Edwards, Technical Manager for EnerCam, comments on the second targeted site, “The Central Bokor structure is very similar to the South Bokor structure with hints of some East West faulting and possibly three separate high points on the overall structure. Currently, our seismic coverage gives us confidence of a four-way closure of approximately 60 square kilometres (see below Figure 2).”

 Delayne Weeks, CEO of the Company adds her comments, “When we began the seismic we were hopeful to find at least one clear drill target from the seismic program. So to have identified two anticlines with clear drilling targets, while still waiting for processing and interpretation from a number of the other lines of the seismic program is extremely positive for EnerCam. The size of both South Bokor and Central Bokor are both significant, up to 48 square kilometers and 60 square kilometers of closure respectively. “

 The Company will continue to build a drilling plan based on each segment of seismic being processed and coming to the team, thus adding scope to the interpretation. Additional processing and interpretation is ongoing across the entire 24 lines of completed seismic.
