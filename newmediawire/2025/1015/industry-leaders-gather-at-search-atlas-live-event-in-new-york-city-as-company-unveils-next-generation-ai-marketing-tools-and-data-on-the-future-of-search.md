# Industry Leaders Gather at Search Atlas Live Event in New York City as Company Unveils Next-Generation AI Marketing Tools and Data on the Future of Search

Search Atlas Live Event Showcases Revolutionary AI-Powered Marketing Platform Updates, Pioneering the Future of Search

 NEW YORK, NY - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Search Atlas Group successfully concluded its flagship Search Atlas Live event in September, unveiling a comprehensive suite of groundbreaking product updates and features that position the company at the forefront of the AI-driven marketing revolution.

 With the global AI in marketing market projected to reach $107.5 billion by 2028, the event demonstrated the growing demand for AI solutions in a constantly evolving search landscape.

 Revolutionary Product Updates Transform Digital Marketing Landscape

 The event highlighted major technological breakthroughs across Search Atlas’s platform, with OTTO and Content Genius now featuring Universal CMS support across 14 different content management systems.

 “The launch of pixel-less, server-side OTTO installation represents a fundamental shift in how businesses deploy SEO automation,” Manick Bhan, Founder, CEO and CTO of Search Atlas announced during the event. “The new installation method eliminates JavaScript dependencies, making implementation significantly easier while ensuring permanent site changes.”

 Perhaps most significantly, Search Atlas unveiled the OTTO Agent, marking what the company calls “the start of the SEO Agentic Revolution.” This conversational AI agent will allow users to communicate directly with OTTO to deploy changes, with full deployment expected within weeks.

 Additional product launches included the Search Atlas MCP integration with over 20 tools available through popular AI interfaces like ChatGPT and Perplexity, a universal search box for navigating the platform’s 72-tool suite, and OTTO PPC for advanced retargeting campaigns. The GBP Galactic update now supports service area management for local businesses and automated posting across multiple social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.

 Manick Bhan Champions “Vibe SEO” as the Future of Digital Marketing

 During the event Manick Bhan delivered a compelling keynote presentation outlining his vision for the future of search, introducing the concept of “Vibe SEO” as the next evolutionary step in digital marketing. Drawing parallels to how “vibe coding” has revolutionized software development by making programming more intuitive and accessible, Bhan explained how Vibe SEO will transform how marketers approach search optimization.

 “Just as vibe coding has made developers faster and more efficient by reducing friction in the development process, Vibe SEO will enable marketers to deploy strategies with unprecedented speed and precision,” said Bhan during his presentation. “We’re moving beyond traditional, manual SEO processes toward an intuitive, AI-driven approach that feels natural and responsive to market changes.”

 The event featured prominent industry speakers, including Arman Advani, who shared insights on Building an 8-Figure Agency, and Justin Rondeau, who presented “CRO in Practice.” Both talks highlighted how AI and the future of marketing need to be married with evergreen marketing principles to actually be successful.

 Search Atlas Live stands as clear evidence that marketing continues evolving to meet fundamental shifts in user behavior and emerging search technologies, from AI overviews to LLM-based search interactions. The company’s dedication to providing businesses with the right tools for this new landscape was demonstrated throughout the event.
