# Genesis Holdings, Inc. Signs Strategic Letter of Intent With Metrospaces, Inc., Marking Its Entry Into Real Estate Tokenization

NEW YORK, NY - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Genesis Holdings, Inc. (OTC: GNIS) today announced the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Metrospaces, Inc. (OTC: MSPC), signaling the company’s evolution into a next-generation PropTech and tokenization platform.

 A Vision for Tokenized Real Estate Growth

 Under the LOI, Genesis will acquire Metrospaces’ intellectual property assets in exchange for $1 million in Preferred Stock, convertible at a 15% discount to market and carrying a 5% annual yield. Additionally, once the transaction closes, Mr. Oscar Brito will be named CEO of Genesis.

 These assets will serve as the technological foundation for Genesis’ upcoming tokenized real estate ecosystem, designed to enable transparent, compliant, and liquid investment structures that bridge traditional real estate with digital capital markets.

 The global Security Token Offering (STO) market is projected to exceed $20 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 50%, as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek regulated digital alternatives to traditional securities. With this agreement, Genesis positions itself as an early and credible entrant in a market still in its infancy - one that could reshape how real estate funding and ownership are structured for decades to come.

 Oscar Brito, stated:

 “We see tokenized real estate as the next frontier of financial innovation. Through this acquisition, Genesis will combine the power of blockchain transparency, AI efficiency, and real-asset backing to create steady, scalable growth. We’re entering this space early - with a clear strategy, a disciplined approach, and an ambitious goal to make real estate investing as simple, liquid, and borderless as trading any other asset class.”

 Mr. Brito brings over two decades of international experience in luxury and hospitality real estate, having co-founded and participated in the development of globally recognized projects such as the London Bvlgari Hotel and other landmark ventures. Over his career, he has been directly involved - whether as founder, co-founder, or board member - in more than $900 million in real estate funding, transactions, and dispositions across the Americas and Europe. His record of executing complex, high-value developments positions Genesis to scale confidently into the next generation of real-estate technology and investment.

 Following closing, Genesis intends to finalize the relaunch of both MetroCrowd and MetroHouse, onboard new partners, and prepare the platforms for phased rollout. The company also anticipates introducing innovative tokenized financing modelsdesigned to align investor interests with transparent, asset-backed structures and provide a sustainable foundation for long-term value creation.
