Rebranding Reflects the Company’s Expansion From Nucleic Acid Manufacturing to a Broader Platform Integrating Digital Asset Management

 As a Featured Company, Applied DNA Will Leverage B2i Digital’s 1.4M+ Investor Network to Amplify Awareness of Its Strategic Pivot and Growth Initiatives

 NEW YORK, NY - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - B2i Digital is pleased to announce that Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNBX) ("Applied DNA" or the "Company"), a biotechnology company advancing a yield focused BNB digital asset treasury strategy and commercializing nucleic acid production solutions, announced today that is has been named a B2i Digital Featured Company. Applied DNA is completing its strategic rebrand to reflect a yield-focused BNB digital asset treasury strategy designed to enhance shareholder value, while continuing to leverage its proprietary nucleic acid production expertise as a supporting technology platform.

 “We are excited to feature Applied DNA Sciences as it enters a new phase in its evolution,” said David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital. “The company’s shift toward a BNB-centric digital asset treasury underscores its commitment to innovation in corporate finance and shareholder alignment. This rebrand signals a strategic move toward greater capital efficiency and digital integration.”

 “Partnering with B2i Digital enables us to share our transformation and long-term vision with a much wider investor audience,” said Clay Shorrock, CEO of Applied DNA Sciences. “As we execute on our BNB treasury strategy, we believe this collaboration will help investors understand how our approach to digital asset management supports both growth and balance-sheet strength.”

 Applied DNA previously announced approximately $27 million in aggregate gross proceeds to implement its BNB treasury strategy, managed under a five-year Strategic Digital Assets Services Agreement with Cypress LLC and a five-year Strategic Advisor Agreement with Cypress Management LLC. The company changed its ticker from “APDN” to “BNBX” effective October 7, 2025, reflecting its digital asset treasury strategy.

 Through its LineaRx subsidiary, Applied DNA continues to commercialize its LineaDNA™, LineaRNAP™, and LineaIVT™ platforms, which enable cell-free manufacturing of DNA and RNA for therapeutics and diagnostics. This dual approach is designed to generate yield and token accumulation within the Binance ecosystem while maintaining a foundation of operational technology expertise.

 As a B2i Digital Featured Company, Applied DNA will be introduced to retail and institutional investors across B2i Digital’s multi-channel network, including LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Threads, Reddit, and Stocktwits.
