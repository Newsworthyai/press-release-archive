# Aura Systems Inc. to Present at Spartan Capital Securities' Second Annual Investor Conference

Premier Event Showcases Innovative Growth Companies and Connects Them With Leading Institutional Investors

 NEW YORK, NY - October 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Aura Systems Inc. (OTC: AUSI) announced that it will present at the Spartan Capital Securities Second Annual Investor Conference on November 3, 2025, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.

 Participation by Aura Systems Inc. underscores the conference’s mission to spotlight innovative companies and emerging market leaders positioned for long-term growth.

 Aura Systems, Inc. (“Aura”), innovated and commercialized the technology for Axial Flux Induction (no permanent magnets) for electric motors and generators. There are basically two ways in which electric machines can be made to work, (i) Radial Flux machines (traditional and currently the majority of industrial and commercial machines) and (ii) Axial Flux machines. Aura’s Axial Flux Induction technology is the culmination of decades of cutting-edge electromagnetic research and more than $150 million in development. Aura’s Axial Flux Induction Machines have inherited advantages over tradional radial flux designs and rare earth permananet magnet designs such as (i) no rare earth or any other kind of permanent magnets (no dependent on China), (ii) significantly less copper (60% less) than equivalent traditional radial flux induction motors, (iii) higher energy density, (iv) fewer overall materials, (v) higher efficiency than tradional radial flux designs and equal effieicncy to the very best rare earth permanent magnet (“PM”) machines and, of course, (vi) lower cost than radial flux and PM machines. Due to their flat shape, lower weight and compact construction, Aura’s axial flux motors are ideal for pumps, compressors, HVHC, fans, food processors power generation turbines and of course electric vehicles, boats, and plans.

 "We are excited to share our company’s story with such a distinguished audience of investors and peers," said Cipora Lavut, President and chair of Aura Systems Inc. "The Spartan Capital Conference offers an unparalleled platform to highlight our progress, connect with new investors, and strengthen relationships within the capital markets community."
