Purpose-built AI Subsidiary Accelerates Growth, Unlocks Value, and Positions HCTI as a Next-generation Leader in Gen AI-powered Healthcare Technology

 PLEASANTON, CALIF. - May 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCTI) (“HCTI” or the "Company"), a visionary leader in digital transformation solutions for the healthcare and life sciences industries, today announced a transformative expansion with the launch of QuantumNexis, Inc. (“QuantumNexis”), a new subsidiary focused on AI-powered SaaS solutions for the global healthcare market. This strategic move will be executed through the simultaneous acquisitions by QuantumNexis of Niyama Healthcare, a pioneer in AI-driven digital mental wellness, and Ezovion Solutions, a leading provider of smart hospital and EHR management platforms.

 QuantumNexis will serve as the innovation engine for HCTI’s recurring revenue business lines. By integrating Niyama’s personalized Gen AI mental health technology with Ezovion’s hospital intelligence platform, the new subsidiary is poised to address urgent global demands in clinical efficiency, mental health accessibility, and healthcare automation.

 Niyama Healthcare: Transforming Mental Health with Gen AI & Clinical Intelligence

 Niyama Healthcare delivers a fully digital, evidence-based mental wellness platform that integrates holistic medicine. At its core is a proprietary Generative AI engine that personalizes treatment using 360-degree analytics across psychological, physical, and behavioral data. The platform supports psychiatry, clinical psychology, medical yoga, and nutrition - all accessible via mobile or desktop and currently has piloted over 5000 clients. This scalable approach meets the rising demand for flexible, AI-assisted mental healthcare. (www.niyama.ai).

 Ezovion Solutions: Smarter AI-based Hospital Information System

 Ezovion Solutions offers a modular, cloud based AI-powered hospital information system (HIS) that connects care workflows across diagnostics, medications, EHR, and revenue cycle management (RCM). Built on FHIR/HL7-compliant infrastructure, Ezovion empowers hospitals to deliver smarter, real-time care through advanced analytics, AI-driven decision support, and enhanced operational visibility across clinical and administrative functions. Ezovion solutions are deployed over 325 hospitals across Asia and MEA (www.ezovion.com).

 “QuantumNexis marks a pivotal step in our growth strategy by separating our Gen AI SaaS innovation from traditional services,” said Sujatha Ramesh, Chief Operating Officer of HCTI. “With Niyama and Ezovion, we’re launching an intelligent, global healthcare platform that delivers measurable impact at scale.”

 “This structure unlocks significant valuation upside,” added David Ayanoglou, Chief Financial Officer. “By isolating our fastest-growing business into QuantumNexis, we are improving transparency, enhancing capital strategy, and positioning HCTI for long-term shareholder value creation.”

 The launch of QuantumNexis establishes HCTI as a focused player in Gen AI healthcare SaaS, delivering powerful solutions to underserved markets while enabling margin expansion through automation and product-led growth. This move reaffirms the company’s commitment to innovation, financial discipline, and sustainable market leadership.
