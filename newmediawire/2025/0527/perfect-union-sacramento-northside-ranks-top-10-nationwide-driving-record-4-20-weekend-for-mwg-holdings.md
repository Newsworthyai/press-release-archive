# Perfect Union Sacramento-Northside Ranks Top 10 Nationwide, Driving Record 4/20 Weekend for MWG Holdings

Flagship Brand Perfect Union Reports Year-Over-Year Growth Across All Retail Locations; Expands Community Outreach Efforts Across Northern California

 SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - May 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - MWG Holdings Group, Inc. (“MWG Holdings”), a leading purpose-driven, locally-focused cannabis company with award-winning roots in the California medical and recreational markets, announced today that its flagship retail brand, Perfect Union, closed out April with record-setting results during its 420 celebrations, bolstering a strong start to the second quarter of 2025.

 Perfect Union’s Northside Sacramento location ranked among the top 10 recreational dispensaries in the United States during the 420 weekend, demonstrating MWG Holdings’ growing market position arising from its community-first approach in an increasingly competitive California cannabis market. Touted as the biggest cannabis holiday of the year, the 420 weekend (April 19-20) showcased the strength of Perfect Union’s customer loyalty, with nearly 95% of customers identified as loyal return visitors.

 “Our performance over the 420 weekend is a direct reflection of the strength of our customer relationships, our strong partnerships with brands, and the stellar efforts of our retail, distribution, marketing, and purchasing teams,” said Tom Sheridan, CEO of MWG Holdings. “In a market that continues to challenge operators, achieving double-digit year-over-year sales growth and securing top-tier national rankings reinforces the strength of our community-first business model and Perfect Union’s position as a leading cannabis retailer in California.”

 Record-Setting Sales Weekend

 Key achievements for Perfect Union Northside Sacramento during the 420 weekend include:

 * Ranked No. 10 nationally and No. 5 in California for net sales among Treez-powered retailers from April 18-20. On April 20 alone, the location maintained its top-10 national ranking and secured the No. 1 position in net sales within the greater Sacramento region.
* Ranked No. 3 nationally and No. 4 in California for ticket volume across the three-day period, processing just 4% fewer transactions than the No. 1 location in Venice, California.
* Ranked No. 4 nationwide for total units sold.
* Reported 22 percent year-over-year growth in net sales during the 420 weekend, marking its third consecutive year of growth during the cannabis industry’s largest retail holiday.

 "At Treez, we work with retailers across the nation to help them unlock their full potential through data-driven insights and technology," said Zak Kronick, Senior Customer Success Manager at Treez. "Perfect Union’s performance over the 420 weekend is a testament to their strong retail execution and deep connection with their community. Their ability to consistently rank among the top performers across our platform reflects the strength of their operations and their commitment to delivering exceptional customer experiences."

 Deepening Roots in Local Communities

 Perfect Union continues to deepen its community involvement across California through year-round outreach, donations, and sponsorships. Since its founding in 2011, MWG Holdings has made community benefit a core part of its business model - fostering trust, building partnerships, and reinforcing customer loyalty in every region it serves.

 In Woodland, Perfect Union gives back 2% of its gross annual receipts to local nonprofits. That’s not a token gesture - it’s a meaningful investment in the people around them. Their donations have helped fund mentorship and scholarships for young women through Soroptimist, supported breast cancer survivors through Thriving Pink, and uplifted foster youth with the Myndz Resources Foundation. They’ve also helped Meals on Wheels Yolo County serve homebound seniors through the Big Day of Giving.

 In Marysville, the team leads year-round food drives benefiting the Yuba-Sutter Food Bank and actively volunteers their time. They sponsor the city’s largest community events, including the Peach Festival, Fourth of July celebration, Christmas Parade, and high school Grad Night.

 In Sacramento, Perfect Union helped raise over $35,000 in LGBTQ+ student scholarships through the Rainbow Chamber Foundation. The team also supports the Sacramento Food Bank’s annual Turkey Drive and organizes toy donations for Toys for Tots and the Boys & Girls Clubs.

 “This kind of giving isn’t performative,” Sheridan added. “It’s consistent, responsive, and rooted in real relationships. It’s not just about writing checks - it’s about showing up, listening, and following through. That’s what sets MWG apart.”
