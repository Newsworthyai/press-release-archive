# Over $1 Million in Revenue With Continued Profitability Projected in the First Half of 2025 for High Demand Product in the Homebuilding Sector from Innovative Designs, Inc. (IVDN)

IVDN’s Leading Distributor, Built Link Solutions, is Delivering Increasing Order Flow for Superior Evacuated Cell Home Insulation Product

 PITTSBURGH, PA - April 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative Designs, Inc. (OTC Pink: IVDN) is now able to project that the company will hit another revenue growth milestone, reaching over $1 million in sales revenue for the first two quarters of its fiscal 2025 year which ends on April 30th. This successful trend is also projected to continue the Innovative Designs status as a profitable company which was achieved for the first time at the end of the 2024 fiscal year.

 Sharply rising demand for the superior and patented Innovative Designs Insultex House Wrap®, is being fueled by new government building codes calling for continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements. For new construction, Insultex House Wrap®, adds an R-6 moisture barrier membrane that does not need additional insulation boards or other support as with other products from our competitors. This makes Insultex House Wrap®, the best overall insulation house wrap choice available on the market today. For full details be sure to visit: http://www.insultexhousewrap.com.

 Much of the rapidly growing sales success Innovative Designs is now receiving can be credited to our leading Distributor, Built Link Solutions, LLC.  As part of their active and very effective marketing program, the Built Link Solutions team has exhibited at multiple trade show events in the past months, presenting Insultex House Wrap® to a wide range of homebuilding professions and building materials suppliers at every level. Randy Kimbler of Built Link Solutions stated, “We are receiving daily calls and emails from builders and materials suppliers looking for a solution to the new R-5 Continuous Insulation requirement for many states. We can now resolve this increasingly important issue with Insultex House Wrap®”.

 Joseph A. Riccelli Jr., CEO of Innovative Designs, commented, “We have 2025 off to unprecedented growth in the entire history of our Company. We are extremely pleased with the escalating order flow for our superior performance vacuum cell Insultex House Wrap® product and, of course, must extend our acknowledgement to Built Link Solutions for becoming our leading product distributor. With about one month to go in our fiscal 2nd quarter we are now able to project reaching the impressive $1 million revenue tier for the first half of our fiscal 2025 year and continued profitability for the three trailing quarters.
