# Gold, Antimony And The New Push For American Resource Dominance

By JE Insights, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Although President Donald Trump’s recent address to Congress may be best known for the partisan fireworks that erupted, from an investment perspective, his administration signaled a critical paradigm shift, particularly for the resource industry. Under this new framework, Nova Minerals Ltd (NASDAQ: NVA) – an emerging gold and critical mineral exploration company – may potentially attract a brighter spotlight.

 Currently, Nova Minerals is focused on the Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project, located in Alaska. Cutting across a 35-kilometer-long mineralized corridor of over 20 identified gold prospects, with six prospects also coincident with the critical mineral antimony, Nova’s flagship project is situated on the Estelle Gold Trend, part of Alaska’s prolific Tintina Gold Belt. Commanding year-round operations accessible via air and a winter road, and with the first stage of the all-weather West Susitna Access Road due to commence construction this year, Estelle delivers some logistical advantages that many mining projects lack.

 Notably, the project includes two already-defined multi-million-ounce gold resources across four deposits. Recently, Nova’s team discovered antimony in the mining area’s surface sampling. With its key properties of heat and flame resistance, anti-corrosion and its ability to harden and strengthen certain materials and metals, antimony is a strategic mineral used in all manner of civil and defense applications, including the electronics industry, to develop certain semiconductor devices, particularly infrared detectors and diodes. Given that antimony is a critical resource, Nova may be in a position to contribute to the U.S. supply chain for the in-demand element.

 The timing couldn’t be more fortuitous as President Trump, in his speech, articulated the theme of energy independence; specifically, a dramatic expansion of domestic mineral production. Liquid Gold And The Push For Domestic Mining

 Aside from the political drama of President Trump’s recent address to Congress, his vision sees the nation taking the initiative, especially in the avenue of critical resource extraction and development. The president laid out a blueprint for U.S. leadership in the mining space. “As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth and by far. And now I’ve fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.”

 However, President Trump wasn’t exclusively focused on hydrocarbons. Instead, he recognized the diverse needs of industrial and technological sectors. During his speech, Trump declared that he would take “historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.”

 While the president did not go into the granularity of the critical resource directive, his administration effectively laid the foundation for a pro-mining stance via a favorable regulatory environment.

 Still, context is crucial. While the Trump administration has vocally supported energy and resource independence, he’s not operating within an ideological vacuum. Instead, there is growing bipartisan consensus regarding mineral resilience. Perhaps most notably, the House Oversight Committee recently held a hearing stressing the urgent need for domestic critical mineral production.Mining Development And The Alaskan Edge

 Nicknamed the Last Frontier, the beauty of the Alaskan landscape is unparalleled. As the White House stated earlier this year, though, the great state is also known for another key attribute: its resource potential.

 Along with a national mandate under the Trump administration, Alaska brings several potential advantages for Nova Minerals. First is political expediency. The region’s mining regulations are managed by the state, making permitting faster and often more efficient compared to projects on federal land. With less bureaucracy to contend with, Nova can concentrate on its core strengths.

 Another potential advantage that the mining specialist levers is the Estelle Project’s existing infrastructure and support. As stated earlier, Estelle conducts year-round operations. By deduction, then, it benefits from winterized facilities. Furthermore, the project promotes logistical flexibility with a 4,000-foot airstrip. Combined with the West Susitna Access Road – of which the first stage is due to commence construction this year – the company’s management anticipates improvements in transportation costs and supply chain resilience.

 Finally, while Nova Minerals is classified as an emerging resource explorer, it’s not conducting a wild goose chase. Rather, the Estelle Project – as part of the Tintina Gold Belt – hosts some of North America’s largest gold mines, including the Donlin Creek Project under Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: GOLD) and Fort Knox Mine under Kinross Gold Corp.

 Fundamentally, Nova’s 9.9 million-ounce gold resource at Estelle is comparable in scale to other large gold projects in the same region, enhancing the company’s appeal to certain investors.The Potential Advantages Of A Dual-Commodity Company

 While President Trump’s mandate has represented a catalyst for the wider resource industry, it cannot be ignored that his policies have also contributed to a cynical paradox: inflationary fears tied to the administration’s tariffs have also contributed to the rise in gold with prices currently at all-time highs over $3,000 per oz.

 Here, miners could potentially benefit either way. On a more productive level, the president’s emphasis on energy independence, resource extraction and deregulation represents a possible victory for mining specialists. Still, the cynical route can be just as effective. In fact, gold demand is so strong that some of the biggest banks in the world are flying physical bullion aboard commercial jets for their top clients. With such interest in the yellow metal, prices are likely to continue to rise. If so, mining companies could potentially ride the underlying asset’s coattails.

 Of course, a distinguishing factor spotlighting Nova is its dual-commodity business. Rather than just operating as a gold explorer, Nova is also looking at working with antimony. This critical mineral is not only integrated into semiconductor products but is also utilized in defense applications and battery technology.

 As noted in the House Oversight Report, China dominates the global resource supply chain. Specifically, research indicates that the U.S. relies on China for 60% of its critical mineral supply. Antimony is a contentious resource, not only because of its utility but also due to China recently banning its export. This could possibly yield a fast-track production strategy, with Nova management targeting funding from the U.S. Department of Defense.Industry Comparisons And Competitive Positioning

 Amid a rapidly evolving economic environment, it’s not enough for nations to possess advanced technologies. Instead, it’s just as crucial to strive for supply chain resilience of key resources. Not surprisingly, then, Nova Minerals doesn’t operate in an exclusive silo.

 One notable peer is Perpetua Resources Corp, which is advancing the Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho. Like Nova, Perpetua is positioning itself as a dual-commodity player, aiming to produce both gold and antimony. The company has received three lots of funding totaling $74.9 million from the Defense Department, underscoring the government’s interest in securing domestic antimony supply.

 While this funding pipeline suggests strong federal endorsement for domestic mineral projects, Nova may hold an advantage in permitting efficiency. That’s due to Nova conducting its operations on state-controlled Alaskan land rather than federal claims, which tend to involve longer regulatory processes.

 Another key player in the space is United States Antimony Corporation, one of the few companies in North America currently producing antimony. Unlike Nova, U.S. Antimony is primarily focused on the namesake asset. Moreover, its operations are more fragmented, with processing facilities spread across multiple locations. Nova, on the other hand, offers a dual-commodity approach, providing exposure to both gold – considered a historically stable store of value – and antimony, a critical resource for contemporary and emerging applications.

 Nova Minerals may be at the crossroads of shifting U.S. policy and rising demand for strategic resources. The Trump administration’s pro-mining stance, combined with bipartisan concerns over supply chain vulnerabilities, has placed domestic producers in the spotlight.

 With significant gold resources and newly identified antimony prospects, Nova is leveraging both economic and national security trends. As gold prices seem likely to rise and the need for critical minerals intensifies, the company’s operations appear to align with broader industry movements.
