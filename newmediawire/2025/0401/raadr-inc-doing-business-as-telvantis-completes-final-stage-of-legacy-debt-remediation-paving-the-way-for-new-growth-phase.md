# Raadr Inc., Doing Business as Telvantis, Completes Final Stage of Legacy Debt Remediation, Paving the Way for New Growth Phase

NEW YORK - April 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc. (OTC: $RDAR), doing business as Telvantis (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), today announced the completion of its final round of debt remediation and legacy clean-up efforts that began in late 2024. This marks a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing transformation and sets the foundation for the next phase of strategic growth.

 Since taking operational control of RDAR in 2024, the current management team has been focused on rebuilding the company with a clear goal: to transform RDAR into a high-growth technology and communications platform under the Telvantis brand. That transformation required addressing years of legacy debt, broken agreements, toxic funders, and outdated contracts - issues that prevented meaningful forward progress.

 Today’s structural change reflects the final stage of that cleanup process.

 A Necessary Step Toward the Future

 “This was the last chapter of an old book,” said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “We inherited a broken structure and made it our responsibility to fix it from the ground up. We delivered the contractual resolution to all these issues within weeks of taking control, and now the last investor has exercised his conversion right. Now that this last portion of legacy obligations is complete, we can fully shift our focus to growth, value creation, and the execution of our long-term roadmap.”

 What’s Been Done Since Taking Over

 * Corporate Rebranding & Vision Shift – Transitioned from Raadr to Telvantis, a telecom-technology hybrid company focused on CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service), global connectivity, and AI-driven communications.
* Resolved Outstanding Liabilities – Settled or remediated toxic and restrictive legacy debt instruments that weighed on the company’s operations and market reputation.
* Filed Updated Disclosures – Improved transparency and made strategic filings to align with uplisting goals.
* Built a $300M+ Revenue Platform – As outlined in the Investor Education Series, Telvantis has developed a multi-stream revenue model and a clear plan to scale toward $1B in annual revenues.
* Announced Buyback Intentions – Confirmed intent to pursue buybacks when appropriate and aligned with shareholder value.
* Secured Global Partnerships – Built a global telecom and enterprise customer base with over 300 carrier relationships and growing software licensing deals.

 Addressing Recent Shareholder Concerns

 The Company acknowledges that recent updates to its share structure have raised questions among shareholders. To be clear, the latest changes reflect the final settlement actions tied to legacy note obligations, many of which were carried over from prior management. These settlements were necessary to clean the balance sheet and position the company for a stronger financial future.

 With that chapter now closed, the Company confirms that there are no additional legacy liabilities outstanding. This unlocks a new level of operational freedom and strategic execution.

 Looking Ahead

 Telvantis now enters its next phase, focused on operational growth, technology advancement, deeper market penetration, and increasing shareholder value. Future milestones include:

 * Completion of financial audits and uplisting eligibility
* Launch of new enterprise products and AI-integrated offerings
* Additional partnerships and customer acquisitions
* Execution of the previously discussed share buyback strategy when market conditions align

 “We understand shareholder concerns - we’ve read the comments, emails, and message boards,” added Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. “But the facts are this: We are a $300M+ revenue business, with global partnerships and the infrastructure to scale to $1B+ in annual sales. The past is now officially behind us, and what comes next will speak for itself.”
