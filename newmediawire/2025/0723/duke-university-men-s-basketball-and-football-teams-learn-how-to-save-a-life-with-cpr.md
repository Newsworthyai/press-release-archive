# Duke University men s basketball and football teams learn how to save a life with CPR

(NewMediaWire) - July 23, 2025 - DURHAM, N.C. — On Tuesday, July 22, members of the Duke University men’s basketball and football teams participated in American Heart Association Hands-Only CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) trainings to learn the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency. According to American Heart Association data, nearly 9 out of every 10 of people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Every year, hundreds of thousands of cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals — often with no warning and no time to spare. In those critical moments, knowing how to perform CPR and use an AED can mean the difference between life and death,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “That’s why we’re working tirelessly with organizations like Duke University and their men's basketball and football teams to empower more people with the skills, confidence, and courage to step in and save a life using CPR.”

 The Duke student-athletes are the newest members of the American Heart Association’s Nation of LifesaversTM. The Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, began the initiative in 2023 to make CPR and AED (automated external defibrillator) awareness and education a permanent fixture in all communities across the country. The initiative will ensure teens and adults can learn about CPR and AED use, share that knowledge with friends and family and engage employers, policymakers, philanthropists and others to create support for a nation of lifesavers.

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance of a positive recovery increases for the community.

 “Providing Hands-Only CPR training to our student-athletes through the Nation of Lifesavers campaign has been an incredibly valuable experience for the Duke football program. The sessions led by the American Heart Association were not only engaging but also empowering—equipping our team with the knowledge and confidence to act in an emergency. We’re proud to support this life-saving initiative and look forward to continuing our partnership with the American Heart Association,” said Kevin Siesel, head football athletic trainer at Duke University.

 Compression-only CPR known as Hands-Only CPR can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.
