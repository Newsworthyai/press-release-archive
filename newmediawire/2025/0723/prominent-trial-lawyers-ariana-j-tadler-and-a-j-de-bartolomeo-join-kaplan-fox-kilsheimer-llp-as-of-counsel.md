# Prominent Trial Lawyers Ariana J. Tadler and A.J. de Bartolomeo Join Kaplan Fox &amp; Kilsheimer LLP as Of Counsel

NEW YORK - July 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP announced today that distinguished trial lawyers, Ariana J. Tadler and A.J. de Bartolomeo, have joined the firm as Of Counsel. The move marks a notable homecoming for Tadler, whose legal career began at Kaplan Fox as a summer associate, while she attended Fordham Law School; she officially joined the firm post-graduation in 1992 as a full-time associate and practiced closely with renowned partners, Robert N. Kaplan, Fred Fox, and the late Richard Kilsheimer, for five years. Even after launching her own firm, Tadler continued to maintain close professional relationships with Kaplan Fox’s partners.

 de Bartolomeo also shares deep professional ties with Kaplan Fox, having served as co-counsel and co-lead counsel alongside senior Kaplan Fox partners for over two decades. Together, de Bartolomeo and Kaplan Fox attorneys have successfully prosecuted high-profile, complex consumer, antitrust, securities class actions, as well as securities opt-out cases.

 Both Tadler and de Bartolomeo bring extensive experience and thought leadership, particularly in trial advocacy and strategic litigation management. Their recognized skills and insights, especially in advanced eDiscovery best practices, will further strengthen Kaplan Fox’s ability to deliver top-tier legal representation. Tadler and de Bartolomeo are also eager to work with and mentor Kaplan Fox’s junior attorneys, to further enrich their professional development.

 Kaplan Fox Senior Partner Fred Fox said, “We are extremely excited to have Ariana and A.J. join – and in Ariana’s case - rejoin - the Kaplan Fox team. Their skill and tenacity as litigators are well known among all who have worked alongside them as co-counsel or against them as adversaries.”

 “In addition to adding two outstanding lawyers, we are particularly pleased to add another senior litigator in A.J. de Bartolomeo to our growing California team,” added Kaplan Fox West Coast Managing Partner Larry King.

 “The Kaplan Fox team is widely respected for its legal excellence and proven record of significant client victories, having recovered more than $10 billion over the past five decades,” Tadler stated. “Returning to Kaplan Fox is both professionally and personally rewarding. A.J. and I are excited to work with Kaplan Fox’s talented attorneys to deliver exceptional service and foster firm growth through new business opportunities and expanded legal portfolios. We are confident that combining our collective experience and reputations with Kaplan Fox’s expansive resources will deliver unparalleled value to clients nationwide.”

 Tadler and de Bartolomeo added, “We remain exceptionally proud of Tadler Law, the firm that we built together. The continuous recognition of the firm and our lawyers by prominent ranking organizations and referral services over the past six years is a testament to our skills and our partnership. Our ongoing leadership at Tadler Law will enable us to continue to optimize our WBENC and WOSB women-owned status.”
