# GeoVax to Showcase Innovative COVID 19 Vaccine Data at the Keystone Symposia on Vaccinology

Data from Two Key Studies Highlight Cross‑Reactivity and Broad‑Spectrum Immunity of GEO-CM04S1 and GeoVax Multi-Antigen Vaccine Technology

 ATLANTA, GA - June 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced that members of its scientific team and academic collaborators will present two pivotal poster presentations at the upcoming Keystone Symposia on Vaccinology: Horizons Across Disease, Demography and Technology, June 4-7, 2025, in Washington DC. These presentations, sharing data advancing GeoVax’s portfolio in the battle against COVID‑19 and emerging variants, will be featured in the following sessions:

 * Poster Session 1 – Pratima Kumari, PhD, GeoVax ScientistPoster Number: 1050Title: “MVA‑vectored multi‑antigen COVID‑19 vaccines induce protective immunity against SARS‑CoV‑2 variants spanning Alpha to Omicron in preclinical animal models.”When: June 5, 2025 at 12:00 p.m.

 * Poster Session 2 – Amany Elsharkawy, PhD, Georgia State University ScientistPoster Number: 2047Title: “GEO‑CM04S1 vaccine candidate maintains potent cross‑reactivity against original SARS‑CoV‑2 B.1 and Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5.”When: June 6, 2025 at 7:30 p.m.

 “These presentations underscore our commitment to advancing innovative MVA-vaccine vector-based strategies to optimally target the continually evolving SARS-CoV2 virus,” said Mark Newman, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at GeoVax. “The data we are sharing at the Keystone conference showcase the importance of inducing broadly specific immune responses, specifically T-cell responses to both the Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins. We envision use of this type of vaccine in populations where first-generation products have failed to induce optimally efficacious responses, including multiple types of immunocompromised patients.”

 GeoVax’s participation at Keystone further demonstrates its leadership in leveraging next‑generation technologies to combat infectious diseases and reinforce preparedness against emerging variants. The event will bring together experts and innovators from across the globe to discuss the latest advancements in the field.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The Company is also developing GEO-MVA, a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
