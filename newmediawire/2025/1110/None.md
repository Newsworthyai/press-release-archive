# Houston-based Medical Technology Company Wins Overall Global Health Tech Competition At Scientific Sessions 2025

DALLAS, TX - November 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Despite major advances in care, nearly half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease or stroke, according to the American Heart Association®, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere. To close this gap, innovative health solutions must reach people where they live, work and play. At its Scientific Sessions 2025, the Association recognized two pioneering companies whose health technologies could help do just that.

 Houston-based PolyVascular was named the overall winner of the American Heart Association’s annual Health Tech Competition, earning top honors in the business category. Brainomix of Oxford, England was awarded best in the science category. Both companies will be invited to join the Association’s Center for Health Technology & Innovation Innovators’ Network, a consortium that connects entrepreneurs, providers, researchers and payers to share and advance innovation in cardiovascular and brain health.

 The Health Tech Competition is a live forum for health care innovators to present digital solutions for treating or preventing cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Finalists addressed clinical problems such as heart failure, hypertension, congenital heart defects and other pressing issues in cardiovascular, brain and metabolic health.

 “The Health Tech Competition is like our own version of Shark Tank, showcasing groundbreaking innovations that have the potential to transform care. What excites me most is seeing science come to life in ways that reach people where they live, work and play,” said Star Jones, attorney, TV personality and American Heart Association national volunteer, who served as one of this year’s judges. “These technologies aren’t just promising - they’re poised to make a real impact.”

 Solutions were evaluated based on three key criteria:

 * Validity: How well is the working prototype or product functioning in the market with customers?
* Scientific Rigor: How well does validation research use evidence-based health research?
* Impact: To what extent does the product improve patient outcomes through innovative technology?

 This year’s finalists included:

 * PolyVascular (Houston): Developing minimally invasive solutions for children with congenital heart disease, aiming to reduce the need for repeated open-heart surgeries.
* Brainomix (Oxford, England): Creating AI-powered software to improve stroke diagnosis and treatment decisions.
* Lumia (Boston): Delivering wearable solutions for people with orthostatic intolerance and chronic blood flow disorders.
* Noah Labs (Berlin): Transforming voice into a digital biomarker to enable earlier intervention for cardiometabolic diseases.
* Cambrian Health (San Francisco): Building an AI-powered platform that ensures clinical best practices are seamlessly executed at the point of care.

 The winning company, PolyVascular, is advancing minimally invasive technology to help children with congenital heart disease avoid repeated open-heart surgeries so they can enjoy healthier, more carefree lives.

 “This is a tremendous honor for PolyVascular - we’re especially proud to bring hope to families and children living with congenital heart defects. Our technology - a minimally invasive valve that can be expanded over time to grow with the child - has the potential to dramatically reduce the need for repeated open-heart surgeries,” said Henri Justino, M.D., co-founder of PolyVascular. “The American Heart Association plays a pivotal role in advancing innovative care pathways, and we’re excited that our solution aligns with its guidelines and mission. It’s time these life-changing technologies reach the youngest patients, just as they already do for adults.”

 A panel of expert volunteer judges also selected Brainomix as the best science pitch, opening opportunities for the company to connect with scientific and business leaders after Scientific Sessions. Brainomix develops cutting-edge AI software that supports precision medicine, helping doctors make faster, more accurate treatment decisions for stroke and lung fibrosis.

 Judges include:

 * Eric D. Peterson, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center
* Lee Shapiro, J.D., volunteer chairman of the board of the American Heart Association and co-founder and managing partner of 7WireVentures
* Lisa Suennen, managing partner at American Heart Association Ventures
* Ken Nelson, partner at the Med Tech Innovators Advantage Fund
* Craig Beam, president of Beam & Associates
* Tim Benner, chief strategy officer and chief marketing officer of Masimo
* Henry Peck, chief business officer of LSI
* Star Jones, lawyer/TV personality, Divorce Court, and American Heart Association national volunteer
* Lee H. Schwamm, M.D., FAHA, associate dean of digital strategy and transformation at Yale School of Medicine
* Joseph C. Wu, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, volunteer past president (2023-24) of the American Heart Association, professor and director at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and co-founder of Greenstone Biosciences
* Michael V. McConnell, M.D., MSEE, clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine
* Asif Ali, M.D., clinical associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston and director at Cena Research Institute
* Jessica Golbus, M.D., M.S., FAHA, assistant professor at the University of Michigan
* Ashoo Tandon, M.D., M.S., FAHA, FAAP, FACC, pediatric cardiologist, director of cardiovascular innovation and associate staff at Cleveland Clinic Children’s
* Dave Albert, M.D., founder of AliveCor
* Daniel Cantillon, M.D., chief medical officer of Masimo

 Finalist presentations took place November 8–9 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans during Scientific Sessions 2025 - the American Heart Association’s premier global event for advancements in cardiovascular science and medicine.
