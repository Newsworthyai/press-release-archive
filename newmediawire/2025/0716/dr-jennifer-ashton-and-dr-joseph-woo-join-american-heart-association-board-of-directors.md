# Dr. Jennifer Ashton and Dr. Joseph Woo join American Heart Association Board of Directors

(NewMediaWire) - July 16, 2025 - DALLAS — The American Heart Association, the world’s leading nonprofit organization focused on heart and brain health for all, announces the appointment of two leading health and science leaders, Jennifer Ashton, M.D., M.S. and Joseph Woo, M.D., FAHA, to its volunteer Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2025.

 Dr. Ashton and Dr. Woo bring clinical leadership, health media influence and scientific innovation to the Association as it enters its second century, intensifying its efforts to change the future of health and improve cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health outcomes, which continue to be leading causes of death in the United States.

 Double board-certified in Ob-Gyn and obesity medicine, Dr. Jennifer Ashton is a nationally recognized women’s health advocate known for communicating complex medical topics in an accessible way. As ABC News’ Chief Medical Correspondent, she became a nationally trusted voice during major public health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A Columbia duPont and Emmy Award-winning journalist, a bestselling author and champion of preventive health and mental wellness, Dr. Ashton has volunteered with the American Heart Association for more than a decade, frequently speaking at local Go Red for Women® events. She has received numerous honors from the Association, including the 2024 Heart Saver Hero Award, the 2023 “Woman Changing the World Award” and the Go Red for Women Award in 2018. These accolades reflect her tireless advocacy for women’s cardiovascular health and her leadership in advancing the Association’s mission through education and action.

 “As the obesity and maternal mortality epidemics are two of the most pressing issues affecting women in the U.S., and since both have cardiovascular associations, I hope that my experience and expertise in these fields can assist the American Heart Association’s efforts,” Ashton said. “And, as the daughter of a cardiologist, I am honored to be the first OB-GYN appointed to the Board in the history of the Association.”

 As a board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiovascular surgeon and transplant surgeon, Dr. Joseph Woo is a nationally recognized leader and educator in cardiac surgery innovation. He is professor and chair of the Stanford Medicine Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, associate director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and the Norman E. Shumway Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery. He has pioneered advanced surgical research on multiple studies and clinical trials, including numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant projects, as well as American Heart Association grants to study ways to treat heart failure through cellular repair. In 2021, he received the Association’s Clinical Research Prize for his groundbreaking work in minimally invasive heart valve repair. Earlier in his career, he received the Vivien Thomas Young Investigator Award (1997) for postdoctoral research on molecular strategies to reduce myocardial ischemic injury. Dr. Woo holds patents for several heart-related medical devices and surgical techniques and has co-authored over 490 peer-reviewed papers. Beyond his research, he is deeply committed to mentorship, global collaboration and advancing medical education in cardiovascular health.

 “As a physician-scientist, I have been a daily witness to the tragedy of cardiovascular disease on human life, and also to the triumph of improving health and saving lives through scientific discovery,” Woo said. “The American Heart Association is a global leader in supporting vital research and establishing the best evidenced-based approaches to cardiovascular health and treatment grounded in basic science, engineering, translational and clinical investigation. I look forward to continuing to support the Association as we continue our bold endeavors toward a healthier world for all.”

 “We are honored to welcome Dr. Jen Ashton and Dr. Joe Woo to our Board of Directors,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “Dr. Ashton’s national media profile, influence and dedication to preventive health, alongside Dr. Woo’s groundbreaking work in cardiovascular surgery and academic leadership, uniquely position them to help us change the future of health and drive forward our mission. Their perspectives will be instrumental as we continue our work to bring health and hope to everyone, everywhere.”

 These appointments reflect the American Heart Association’s continued commitment to science-based solutions, community-centered approaches and bold leadership in the fight against heart disease and stroke.

 The American Heart Association’s Board of Directors is the organization’s top volunteer governing body, working closely with CEO Nancy Brown to provide strategic oversight and financial stewardship to advance the organization’s mission of longer, healthier lives for all. Board members also serve as ambassadors, leveraging their individual professional expertise and networks of influence to further extend, accelerate and elevate the Association’s visibility, impact and collaborations.
