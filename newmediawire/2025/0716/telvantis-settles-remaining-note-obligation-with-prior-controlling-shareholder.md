# Telvantis Settles Remaining Note Obligation With Prior Controlling Shareholder

NEW YORK - July 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Telvantis Inc. (OTC: $RDAR) (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), today announced that it has settled the entire note balance with JanBella Group, LLC (“JanBella”), the prior controlling shareholder of RDAR. As announced in May 2025, the original obligation was first reduced and has now been paid in full. Consequently, no further obligations are due to debtors related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in RDAR by Mexedia SPA last year.

 “This is the final step to close all remaining obligations from the acquisition of RDAR last year,” said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “With the recently announced binding LOI to acquire AmeriCrew and the tremendous commercial momentum in June 2025, closing this chapter is a great start to the second half of the year,” Mr. Contreras added.

 “This milestone confirms our strong commitment to this company and to its shareholders. We remain very excited about our prospects and will continue building this company with relentless focus,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. Mr. Gilcher extended his comments by expressing the Company’s gratitude to JanBella, for working to a mutually beneficial outcome.
