# Policy Crossroads: How Infrastructure Capital's ICAP ETF Could Be Well-Positioned Amid A Highly Public Power Struggle

By JE Insights, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - It may very well be the one hot macro topic that is on top of every investor’s mind at the moment: the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the potentially rising probability of benchmark interest rate cuts. Recently, betting markets revealed an anticipation of a dovish policy adjustment in September, prompting the President to apply pressure on the Fed chair. As the high-level conflict simmers, investors will want to pay close attention to Infrastructure Capital Equity Income ETF (ARCA: ICAP).

 Throughout this year, the president has repeatedly pushed for lower interest rates, under the basic theory that lower borrowing costs should help bolster consumption and commercial investments and endeavors. Following multiple calls for the central bank to implement a dovish monetary policy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been tasked with leading the search for a new Fed chair.

 Federal Reserve Chairman's term is set to expire in May 2025 and based on the current political trajectory, it’s highly unlikely that he will serve another term. Still, many critics - including “Shark Tank” investor - believe that Powell should be able to serve out his current term without political interference lest global trust in U.S. financial markets be undermined.

 Subsequently, the clash in Washington shines a spotlight on the ICAP vehicle. Structured as an exchange-traded fund, ICAP represents a financial product that seeks to maximize income and pursue total return opportunities. Broadly speaking, a holistic portfolio combines capital gains potential with passive income opportunities.

 In the post-pandemic paradigm, strength in the former element has been obvious to see, given the trailing five-year performance of the S&P 500 index. However, as the macro environment shifts, the latter component may rise to prominence.

 Why The ICAP ETF May Lose A Vexing Competitor

 In a capital-gains-heavy environment, growth companies are essentially competing with each other to vie for the most investor dollars. Obviously, there are limited resources and only the hottest, highest-perceived-potential enterprises have a shot at consistently accumulating a disproportionate share of said resources. It’s a brutal game but it’s also one of the fundamentally meritocratic concepts of free-market capitalism.

 However, when it comes to an income-oriented ecosystem, the calculus isn’t quite as clear-cut. To be sure, dividend-paying companies certainly compete among themselves to attract investor dollars. Still, yield alone isn’t necessarily the main trigger point that convinces market participants to take a risk. The reality is that if a company offers too generous a yield, that is more often a fiscal red flag than it is a confidence-inspiring invitation.

 Furthermore, what makes the investment narrative rather unique in an income-focused paradigm is that the government may impose significant competition on yield-generating assets, depending on the Fed’s monetary policy.

 Essentially, government-backed debt securities - particularly the 10-Year U.S. Treasuries - generate risk-free yield. Technically, no financial security is absolutely devoid of downside threats. However, Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam. By logical deduction, when this risk-free yield becomes excessively elevated relative to prior norms, there is a reduced incentive to acquire passive income from the commercial market.

 As it stands, the ICAP ETF offers an alternative mechanism for passive income, which many investors may find appealing - even with the historically high yield of 10-Year Treasuries. Overseen by financial services provider Infrastructure Capital, ICAP maximizes income by investing at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying equity securities.

 Unlike passive ETFs that merely track benchmark indices, ICAP’s fund management team expertly navigates complex market ecosystems. Informed by fundamental analysis and macroeconomic factors, the fund seeks out holistically robust opportunities while sidestepping the pitfalls that passive ETFs may blindly fall into.

 As of this writing, the 30 Day Sec Yield - Infrastructure Capital’s standardized yield measure for its income fund - stands at 6.28%. That is competitive with the current yield of 10-Year Treasuries. However, government bonds enjoy the risk-free label, which investors often figure into their calculations.

 Of course, the political drama is what shines a relevant spotlight on the ICAP ETF. What has undergirded a major source of friction is that, according to some experts, Federal Reserve Chairman has broadcast a greater magnitude of hawkishness than many expected. Likely, this matter has only amplified the current administration’s unrest toward Fed policy.

 Should the White House get its wishes, though, the pivot may spark renewed interest in higher-yielding commercial debt securities. A dovish monetary policy would imply a lower risk-free yield. At some point, the yield may fall too low, potentially inspiring a more speculative posture among income investors.

 With its active management and competitive yield, the ICAP ETF may make a pronounced case for itself.

 Getting Underneath The Hood Of The ICAP Income Fund

 From a structural and strategic standpoint, the ICAP ETF sets itself apart through its emphasis on high-yield equity income while maintaining diversified exposure. As mentioned earlier, the actively managed fund invests at least 80% of its funds in dividend-paying stocks. Within this framework, holdings span multiple market capitalizations, incorporating real estate investment trusts, financials, energy infrastructure and other income-generating equities to balance stability with opportunity.

 A central component of the ICAP ETF’s mechanics is its flexible toolkit, which includes the potential use of options and modest leverage to enhance distributable income. Option strategies can serve as an additional income stream, though they require a disciplined approach to manage the inherent tail risks. The fund structure itself offers tax and cost efficiencies by meeting redemptions through in-kind transfers rather than security sales, helping to preserve capital gains and reduce turnover costs for investors.

 Steering these strategies is Jay D. Hatfield, founder, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. With nearly three decades of capital markets experience spanning equity research, fixed income trading, energy infrastructure and real estate, Hatfield applies both macroeconomic insight and sector-level expertise to fund oversight. His management philosophy is rooted in a deep understanding of free cash flow generation from tangible assets, which he views as the backbone of sustainable income investing.

 Beyond the ICAP ETF, Hatfield also manages the Virtus InfraCap U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (NYSE: PFFA), where his disciplined focus on yield generation and risk-adjusted returns has earned broad attention. His cross-sector vantage point and prior work in both investment banking and hedge fund management give him the ability to position portfolios not just to react to prevailing market currents but to anticipate them.

 Moreover, under Hatfield’s leadership, the ICAP ETF reflects a deliberate blend of income optimization, capital preservation and opportunistic growth potential - all framed within an active strategy that remains nimble in a shifting economic landscape.

 A Monetary Paradigm Shift Potentially Emerges

 While the ongoing tension between the White House and the Federal Reserve may offer media fodder, it underscores a deeper debate over the direction of monetary policy. With the administration openly pushing for lower interest rates, the clash extends beyond economic theory into questions of institutional independence and political influence. This dynamic introduces a layer of uncertainty for investors, as policy decisions could be shaped by both market conditions and the political calendar.

 Should the pressure result in a pivot toward more accommodative policy, the effects could be far-reaching. Lower benchmark rates would reduce the yield advantage of government debt, potentially prompting investors to reassess the balance between risk-free securities and other income-generating assets. In such a scenario, the competitive landscape for yield would shift, altering the relative appeal of equity-based income strategies.

 For ICAP, the intersection of these political and monetary forces could be significant. A dovish turn from the Fed would not only change the backdrop against which dividend-focused portfolios operate but could also influence how investors weigh yield, diversification and market exposure in the broader context of a recalibrated rate environment.
