# CannaCard and Dispensify Announce Strategic Partnership to Help Dispensaries Cut Costs, Quicken Transactions, and Deliver Legal, Transparent Cannabis Payments Nationwide

CHICAGO, IL - August 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CC Technology Corporation, the creator of CannaCard® - the cannabis industry's trusted, fully compliant payment platform - today announced a strategic partnership with Dispensify, a technology solutions provider dedicated to transforming the cannabis retail experience, specializing in self-service kiosks, digital infrastructure, and a complete technology stack. Together, the two companies aim to transform cannabis payments through fully legal, transparent, and cashless payments eliminating the need for cumbersome crypto-workarounds and legally questionable PIN/debit transactions.

 The collaboration provides dispensary owners a powerful, all-in-one solution to modernize their retail operations. With CannaCard’s trusted payment system embedded directly into Dispensify’s kiosks, customers now have a seamless and secure way to shop and pay, while the dispensary benefits from streamlined operations and improved cashflow.

 “With this integration, we’re streamlining the cannabis retail experience for consumers and dispensary operators alike,” said Edwin Sochacki, Chief Marketing Officer of CannaCard. “We’re proud to partner with Dispensify to provide a payment alternative that is not only legally sound but also user-friendly and financially beneficial for all parties involved.”

 “Dispensify is committed to giving our clients options that improve both operations and the customer experience. By integrating CannaCard into our platform, we’re adding another powerful tool that enables dispensaries to offer secure payments while maintaining the flexibility their business demands." - Ryan Lagace, Co-Founder, Dispensify

 Key Benefits of the Partnership Include:

 * Seamless kiosk payments using the CannaCard mobile app
* 24-hour settlement: Funds from consumer purchases can be transferred to a dispensary’s bank of record as quickly as one business day
* Lower costs for both consumers and dispensary owners by avoiding third-party ATM fees and PIN/debit workarounds
* A unified, compliant platform that supports a smoother retail experience while adhering to financial regulations at both state and federal levels
* POS-agnostic kiosks and payment, with direct API integration available to leading cannabis point-of-sales systems upon request

 The partnership also aligns both companies on future growth initiatives. As Dispensify continues its rapid national expansion, CannaCard’s platform is poised to become the payment standard across hundreds of new retail locations, offering a scalable and compliant infrastructure for cannabis transactions.

 This collaboration underscores a shared commitment to innovation, compliance, and operational efficiency in the evolving cannabis industry.
