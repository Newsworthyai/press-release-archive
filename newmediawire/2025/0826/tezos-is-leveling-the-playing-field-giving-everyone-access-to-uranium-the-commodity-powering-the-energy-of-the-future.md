# Tezos Is Leveling The Playing Field Giving Everyone Access To Uranium, The Commodity Powering The Energy Of The Future

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Arthur Breitman, Co-founder of Tezos/Trilitech Design Limited, was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Tezos/Trilitech Design Limited is powering Uranium.io, the first platform that enables everyday investors to buy, own and trade physical uranium. Through a partnership with Tezos, Uranium.io acquired a tradable lot of uranium, stored and tokenized it - enabling average investors to purchase fractional shares of uranium ore concentrate (U3O8) or yellowcake in the form of a smart contract ledger known as an xU308.

 With Uranium.io “you can hold a real asset in your wallet, one that's powering the future of energy,” Breitman told Benzing during the interview, noting the asset is tokenized on top of Tezos, an open-source blockchain platform. “That’s quite exciting.”

 Uranium.io is all about providing investors, both retail and institutional, with access, something the uranium market is lacking. As it stands, the uranium market trades over-the-counter and is very illiquid, says Breitman, noting that often investors overpay for the uranium and sometimes have to sell it for a discount. There are ETFs, managed funds and mining stocks, but investors don’t get direct exposure to the underlying commodity through these investment vehicles. “It's an important commodity that is lacking a market, and that’s what Uranium.io is making happen,” Breitman said.

 Timing is everything and Uranium.io couldn’t have come on the scene at a better time. The market for uranium is booming, driven by demand for nuclear power plants, which depend on uranium. Right now there is not a lot of new supply of uranium, but at the same time, there is a lot of demand, which isn’t expected to abate in the foreseeable future.
