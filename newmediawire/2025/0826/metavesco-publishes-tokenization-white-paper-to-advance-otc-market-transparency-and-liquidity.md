# Metavesco Publishes Tokenization White Paper to Advance OTC Market Transparency and Liquidity

CUMMING, GA - August 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced the release of its position paper, “Tokenizing the OTC: A Vision for Transparency, Liquidity, and Growth.” The white paper outlines Metavesco’s proposed framework for bringing OTC equities on-chain, with the goal of unlocking global liquidity and reducing structural barriers for small public companies.

 Introduction

 The over-the-counter (OTC) markets are home to thousands of small public companies. These issuers represent real businesses with real potential, but they are held back by systemic barriers: lack of liquidity, limited access to growth capital, and an ecosystem too often dominated by toxic financing and bad actors.

 At Metavesco, we believe tokenization can change this. By bringing OTC equities on-chain, we can create a future where small-cap companies enjoy transparency, access to global liquidity, and a lower cost of capital, while investors gain fairness, visibility, and opportunity.

 The Problem: Why the OTC is Broken

 * Liquidity Trap: Most OTC tickers trade with little volume, leaving shareholders stuck and issuers unable to raise growth capital.
* Toxic Financing: Convertible note lenders prey on illiquid companies, flooding markets with cheap paper and using retail as exit liquidity.
* Lack of Transparency: Market makers, naked shorting, and manipulative schemes thrive in the shadows, where investors have little visibility.
* No Analyst Coverage: The OTC is ignored by Wall Street research desks, leaving investors blind and undervaluing promising businesses.

 The Solution: Tokenization of OTC Equities

 Tokenization brings OTC issuers and investors into the light of blockchain technology.

 * Global Liquidity: Tokenized shares can trade across borders, unlocking new pools of capital beyond U.S. broker-dealers.
* On-Chain Transparency: Every trade, every issuance, every wallet is visible on-chain. Naked shorting and hidden dilution become impossible.
* Lower Barriers to Reward Shareholders: Blockchain offers much lower costs and efficiency for issuers to send dividends and other token-based rewards to loyal shareholders.
* Lower Cost of Capital: Tokenization opens new fundraising tools such as on-chain raises, smart contracts, and global retail access, reducing dependence on toxic funders.
* Community-Driven Analysis: While no analyst covers OTC, thousands of investors already track on-chain metrics daily. The blockchain turns the public into the analyst.

 Metavesco’s Role

 Metavesco is a public company actively engaged in digital assets and Web3 innovation. We’ve built a Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury, operate mining infrastructure, and are committed to building in public.

 Now, we are stepping forward to champion tokenization for OTC issuers.

 * Our Vision: A marketplace where every small public company has fair access to liquidity and capital
* Our Mission: To work with regulators, innovators, and investors to create frameworks that bring OTC securities on-chain responsibly.
* Our Crusade: To make the OTC great again; transparent, liquid, and legitimate.

 The Road Ahead

 On September 4, 2025, Metavesco will participate in an SEC roundtable with Commissioner Hester Peirce to discuss regulatory barriers and opportunities in the digital asset space. Our focus: advocating for tokenization as the path forward for OTC issuers and their investors.

 We believe tokenization is not just innovation, it is necessity. The future of capital markets must be transparent, fair, and global.

 Conclusion

 The OTC has long been dismissed as the “Wild West” of capital markets. We believe tokenization can change that perception forever. By putting shares on-chain, we can deliver transparency, unlock liquidity, and level the playing field for small public companies and investors alike.

 Metavesco is proud to lead this conversation, not just for ourselves, but for every issuer and investor who believes the OTC deserves better.
