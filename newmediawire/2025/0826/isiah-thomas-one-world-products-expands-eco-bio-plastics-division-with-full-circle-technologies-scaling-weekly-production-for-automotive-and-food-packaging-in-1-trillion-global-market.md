# Isiah Thomas' One World Products Expands Eco Bio Plastics Division With Full Circle Technologies, Scaling Weekly Production for Automotive and Food Packaging in $1 Trillion Global Market

MIDLAND, MI - August 26, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - One World Products, Inc. (OTCQB: OWPC), soon to be renamed Isiah Enterprises, today announced a major expansion of its Eco Bio Plastics division through a toll compounding agreement with Full Circle Technologies. The partnership enables the company to process tens of thousands of pounds of renewable materials each week - including rubber, cellulose, hemp, and other bio-feedstocks - using advanced pelletizing, pulverizing, and micronizing technologies.

 This milestone builds on the company’s October 2024 achievement of securing its first order of 1,400 hemp-based reusable containers to Flex-N-Gate, in collaboration with ORBIS Corporation and West Michigan Compounding (WMC). That order validated One World Products’ ability to integrate renewable solutions into mainstream automotive supply chains. With this expansion, the company is positioned to enter the broader global packaging industry - valued at more than $1 trillion annually - including both automotive and food packaging markets.

 Through the Full Circle agreement, Eco Bio Plastics Michigan will begin processing approximately 40,000 pounds per week, doubling to 80,000 pounds within two months and ultimately reaching up to 160,000 pounds weekly as production scales.

 Unlike companies tied to a single feedstock, Eco Bio Plastics offers multi-material flexibility, processing rubber, cellulose, hemp, and other inputs into advanced composites that meet demand across automotive, industrial, and food packaging. These capabilities directly address mounting regulatory and market pressure to replace petroleum-based plastics with renewable alternatives.

 This expansion further strengthens Isiah Enterprises’ network of partners, which includes Stellantis, Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS Corporation, and West Michigan Compounding - all recognized leaders in advancing a circular economy where waste streams are transformed into sustainable resources.

 “We are strategically positioned at the intersection of two massive markets - automotive and food packaging,” says Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of One World Products. “The global packaging industry exceeds $1 trillion annually, and our ability to pelletize, pulverize, and micronize thousands of pounds of material each week gives us a unique competitive edge. Together with our partners, we are scaling solutions that deliver value for shareholders, customers, and communities.”

 Under the leadership of Isiah Thomas, Hall of Famer, entrepreneur, and proven turnaround executive, the company has emerged as a first-mover in renewable packaging innovation. By combining technical capacity, OEM and supplier relationships, and global brand credibility, the company occupies a unique position in one of the world’s fastest-growing industries.
