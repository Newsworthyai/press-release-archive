# World Heart Federation honors American Heart Association CEO for lifetime of impact

(NewMediaWire) - August 26, 2025 - DALLAS and MADRID — The World Heart Federation (WHF) is set to honor Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association, with its prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award on Friday, August 29, at the opening ceremony of the European Society of Cardiology Congress together with the World Congress of Cardiology in Madrid. The award is bestowed in recognition of her extraordinary leadership and lifelong commitment to transforming cardiovascular health on a global scale.

 The World Heart Federation is a leader and convener in global cardiovascular health. The members of WHF consist of more than 200 heart foundations, scientific societies and patient organizations spanning more than 100 countries. The American Heart Association is a founding member of the World Heart Federation.

 Brown has served as CEO of the Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for everyone, everywhere, since 2008. Under her leadership, the organization has advanced lifesaving science, innovation and advocacy across more than 100 countries through groundbreaking quality improvement initiatives, scientific collaboration and community-based interventions. Brown started with the organization in 1986 and served in many leadership roles before her tenure as CEO, including chief operating officer.

 “It’s a tremendous honor to receive this recognition from the World Heart Federation,” said Brown. “These accolades reflect the dedication of our volunteers, supporters and staff around the world who power the American Heart Association’s mission every day. I’m grateful for the opportunity to celebrate the advancements and impact we’ve made to improve cardiovascular health and transform lives.”

 The World Heart Federation cited Brown’s “visionary leadership, global partnerships and unwavering commitment to improving the future of health” as transformative in the fight against cardiovascular disease—the world’s leading cause of death.

 “Nancy is a leader known around the world for her courage to face even the most dynamic challenges in health care through a combination of evidence, compassion and a focus on impact,” said Jagat Narula, M.D., Ph.D., president of the World Heart Federation. “Nancy embodies the organization’s mission to be a relentless force for longer, healthier lives and personally shows that she believes everyone, everywhere deserves access to quality health care.”

 Among her many accomplishments:

 * Launched global quality improvement programs from a concept in the late 1990s to the robust Get With The Guidelines and American Heart Association certification program in the United States, Mexico, Latin America, India and part of Asia. These programs help to measure and ensure consistent, evidence-based care in time-sensitive medical situations like heart attack, stroke and cardiac arrest.

 * Accelerated research and innovation, including the Go Red for Women Venture Fund®, investing $75 million in companies that address gaps in women’s heart and brain health. Overall, the Heart Association has invested $6.1 billion in research since 1949.

 * Mobilized lifesaving campaigns, including the Association’s CPR education effort known as the Nation of Lifesavers™, which aims to double survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest by 2030. The Heart Association trains approximately 22 million people annually in CPR and develops first aid and resuscitation guidelines that are used globally.
