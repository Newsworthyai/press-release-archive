# New funding to support food security, economic resiliency

(NewMediaWire) - February 19, 2025 - DALLAS — The conditions in which we are born, live, learn, work, play and age — the social drivers of health — are better predictors of health and life expectancy than our genetic code. In communities nationwide, people living in locations just a handful of miles apart can have a dramatic difference in life expectancy.

 To help level the playing field, the Grubhub Community Fund awarded the American Heart Association® Social Impact Funds a $2 million grant to support food security, technology innovation and economic resiliency in New York City and Chicago.

 “We are grateful for this generous support, which will help fill a critical resource gap and help communities overcome barriers to high-quality, accessible health care, food security and economic empowerment,” said Regina Benjamin, M.D., MBA, chair of the Social Impact Funds Impact Investment Committee and 18th U.S. Surgeon General. “With support from the Grubhub Community Fund and other generous funding, American Heart Association Ventures offers a unique opportunity to turn philanthropy into action that makes a real and exponential difference in peoples’ lives.”

 The American Heart Association Social Impact Funds will use this new support to help up to 12 organizations and entrepreneurs with significant efforts focused in Chicago and New York City through proprietary sourcing, investment and performance management processes. Four focused on Chicago have already been identified:

 * CareYaya, based in North Carolina, an on-demand marketplace connecting families with more than 25,000 students in pre-health programs to be caregivers for affordable, flexible in-home care access, while helping to expand the care workforce amidst a critical caregiver shortage;
* Farm Generations Corporation, based in New York, a farmer-owned cooperative that supports farm viability, food access and regenerative agriculture through technological innovation and community building. Its flagship product, GrownBy, is a SNAP-eligible, direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform connecting growers and consumers across America;
* Nectar, based in Chicago, a platform that drives innovation in food security by delivering food as medicine in partnership with charitable food organizations; and
* RiseKit, based in Chicago, a software platform that empowers untapped talent to find jobs and improve their economic well-being and address social drivers of health through community-based organizations and job training programs

 “At Grubhub, we are committed to creating meaningful change in the communities where we operate, with a focus on supporting our largest market, New York City, and hometown, Chicago. With the American Heart Association being equally committed as us in advancing food security, technology innovation, and economic resiliency, Grubhub is proud of this ongoing work, made possible by the Grubhub Community Fund, to support organizations advancing equitable health in New York City and Chicago,” said Brianna Morris, senior manager, community impact for Grubhub. “We are excited for the four organizations that have received financial support thus far, and we look forward to seeing how their communities are positively impacted.”

 Organizations are selected for funding by the Social Impact Funds based on their promising solutions to address social drivers of health and local barriers to achieving equitable health. The Funds evaluate opportunities to identify innovative, evidence-based candidates that align with the American Heart Association's mission and demonstrate the potential for lasting community impact.
