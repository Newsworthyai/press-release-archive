# Mpox Clade 1 in the U.S. Highlights the Need for Vaccine Supply Diversification

GeoVax Advances GEO-MVA to Strengthen U.S. and Global Readiness

 ATLANTA, GA - February 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The confirmation of a fourth case of Clade 1 Mpox in New York underscores the urgent need for a stronger and more diversified vaccine supply chain. GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a leader in developing vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, is calling for immediate action to expand vaccine production and ensure timely distribution.

 The spread of Clade 1 Mpox, a highly virulent and transmissible strain with a fatality rate ranging from 3% - 10%, is raising alarms across the public health community. While the virus has been a persistent threat in Africa, its increasing presence in Europe and the United States signals a critical moment in the fight against the disease. Over the last 4 months, confirmed cases of Clade 1 Mpox have been reported in California, Georgia, New Hampshire, and New York. However, the nation remains heavily dependent on a single non-U.S. vaccine manufacturer of the preferred Mpox vaccine, based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), leaving the U.S. and global markets vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, limited accessibility, and potential vaccine shortages at a time when demand is surging.

 Current Supply Chain Inadequate for Global Mpox Response

 The current reliance on a single supplier for the preferred Mpox vaccine presents numerous challenges, particularly as the outbreak grows:

 * Supply chain instability – Depending on a single foreign manufacturer introduces geopolitical and logistical risks that could delay vaccine availability during critical outbreaks.
* Insufficient production capacity – African health agencies have requested 20 million doses in 2025 to curb the spread of the virus, yet only 2–5 million doses are expected to be available.
* High costs and limited access – At as much as $270 per dose in the U.S., the preferred product for vaccination against Mpox can be prohibitively expensive for many, creating a barrier to widespread vaccination efforts.
* Inability to respond swiftly to emerging strains – Current stockpiles, which were depleted during the 2022 outbreak, are likely inadequate to combat the increasing spread of Clade 1, leaving public health officials struggling to contain the outbreak.

 GeoVax’s GEO-MVA: A Critical Additional-Source Solution

 In response to these pressing concerns, GeoVax is advancing development of GEO-MVA, an alternative MVA based vaccine in the fight against Mpox. GeoVax is also further addressing vaccine availability with plans to transition manufacturing of GEO-MVA, once authorized, to an advanced MVA manufacturing platform with the potential to offer significant advantages over the currently utilized Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) manufacturing platform, a complicated manufacturing process highly dependent on the availability of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) chicken eggs. GEO-MVA’s innovative MVA production process, once implemented, should enable:

 * Scalability for global demand - Rapid, high-volume manufacturing to meet urgent vaccination needs.
* Flexibility to utilize existing vaccine manufacturing facilities vs need to construct new ones.
* Lower cost and increased accessibility – The advanced technology behind GeoVax’s MVA manufacturing platform should help reduce production costs, making vaccination programs more affordable worldwide.
* Eliminate the need for SPF eggs whose availability can be negatively impacted by supply disruptions such as those related to avian flu outbreaks.
* Strengthening U.S. biosecurity – Unlike the current MVA vaccine, which is produced overseas, GEO-MVA can be manufactured within the U.S., reducing reliance on foreign supply chains.
* Enhanced pandemic preparedness – A diversified vaccine supply ensures greater resilience in response to future outbreaks, preventing disruptions in availability.

 GeoVax has established strategic partnerships with OXB (France) and ProBioGen (Berlin) to support production scale up, while also actively engaging with U.S. and international health agencies to potentially expedite regulatory approvals and secure funding to bring GEO-MVA to market and eventually transition production to the next generation MVA manufacturing process. GeoVax recently completed cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) manufacturing of the GEO-MVA drug substance and is currently in the process of fill-finish, with anticipated availability of clinical vialed material by mid-year.

 A Call to Action: Strengthening the Global Response

 With the growing threat of Clade 1 Mpox, it is imperative to diversify vaccine manufacturing capabilities and ensure the U.S. and global health agencies have access to multiple suppliers. GeoVax urges policymakers and regulators to take decisive action:

 * Increase federal funding and policy support to expedite the availability of GEO-MVA as an alternative Mpox vaccine.
* Expedite regulatory approvals to bring GEO-MVA to market as quickly as possible.
* Enhance collaboration with global health organizations to ensure equitable vaccine distribution, particularly in underserved regions.

 “We cannot afford to wait for another pandemic-level crisis before addressing vaccine shortages and supply chain vulnerabilities,” said David Dodd, Chairman & CEO of GeoVax. “The emergence of Clade 1 Mpox in the U.S. is a clear warning sign. Immediate action is needed to strengthen vaccine supply and access.  GEO-MVA, along with our efforts towards establishing our next generation MVA manufacturing platform, represents critical solutions to ensure we are better prepared for future outbreaks.”

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
