# Driving Timely Diagnosis And Treatment For Heart Valve Disease To Save Lives

DALLAS, TX - November 9, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - More than 28 million people worldwide are living with heart valve disease, and the numbers are climbing. In the U.S., the condition contributes to more than 60,000 deaths each year1. Yet many people are unaware of the symptoms or delay treatment. The American Heart Association intends to close that gap.[1]

 To address the growing and deadly impact of heart valve disease, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone, everywhere, is establishing heart valve disease as a critical focus area by launching a nationwide initiative to improve patient outcomes and health care quality through science and education. The Heart Valve Initiative will harmonize the Association’s efforts in patient education, professional education, systems of care and quality improvement to make a greater impact for patients and clinical outcomes.

 The new Heart Valve Initiative will expand efforts to help health systems and clinicians identify patients affected by heart valve disease earlier, treat them faster and deliver care aligned with the latest evidence-based guidelines. By integrating new hospital certification programs, health care professional education and patient engagement tools, the initiative is designed to drive improvement across the full continuum of care.

 “The American Heart Association is uniquely positioned to lead a comprehensive initiative that can help ensure timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment and hopefully a longer, healthier life for those living with valve disease,” said Mariell Jessup, M.D., FAHA, chief science and medical officer of the American Heart Association. “It is a priority to ensure patients with valve disease have a system of care supporting their needs from diagnosis to treatment without unnecessary delays. We encourage health care professionals to take action by listening closely, diagnosing swiftly and treating proactively.”

 The Heart Valve Initiative is made possible from founding sponsor, Edwards Lifesciences, building on the current work around aortic stenosis (AS), one of the most common and serious heart valve diseases. The Target: Aortic Stenosis™ program uses a data registry to enhance the patient experience from symptom onset to appropriate diagnosis and follow-through, to timely treatment and disease management. Edwards Lifesciences is also the founding sponsor of Target: Aortic Stenosis™.

 One in 40 people in the U.S. have heart valve disease and the risk increases with age, especially if you are over 65.[2]

 “Over our more than six decades creating treatments for patients with structural heart disease, we know that sadly too many patients with valve disease go undiagnosed until it’s too late. We’re committed to changing that by transforming care for patients through our innovations and sponsoring efforts like Target: Aortic Stenosis and now this broader Heart Valve Initiative,” said Todd J. Brinton, chief scientific officer and corporate vice president of advanced innovation and technology at Edwards Lifesciences. “This initiative aims to equip healthcare professionals and patients with the tools to recognize symptoms earlier, engage in timely care and ultimately save lives."

 Over the next five years, the initiative will:

 * Improve adherence to guideline-based care for heart valve diseases, with an initial focus on AS and intent for expansion into other forms of heart valve disease;
* Expand data collection in the existing Target: Aortic Stenosis registry to include enhanced measurement of asymptomatic and moderate AS cases;
* Build a guideline-based heart valve certification program for hospitals;
* Advance public reporting and expand hospital recognition to drive high-quality care;
* Provide multimedia education for both health care professionals and patients; and
* Launch a national awareness campaign to educate people about heart valve disease and make informed care decisions.

 Key clinical metrics for improvement will include timely diagnosis and management of severe and asymptomatic aortic stenosis, quality of echocardiographic assessment for heart valve diseases and appropriate referral to follow-up cardiac care.

 In addition to Edwards Lifesciences foundational support, the Heart Valve Initiative is supported in part by Kardigan.
