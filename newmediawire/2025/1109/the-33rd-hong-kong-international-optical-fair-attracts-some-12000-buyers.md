Overseas Sales Manager Helen Zhuang stated: “We received inquiries from buyers in Italy, Germany, the US, India, among others, and are currently negotiating a collaboration with an Italian buyer with an expected order value of US$500,000.”

 In response to the rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, many eyewear brands have launched sustainable glasses featuring recycled materials. Hong Kong exhibitor Winky International Limited offers collections of eco-friendly sunglasses and optical frames made from biodegradable materials. Founder and Creative Director Kevin Ching said that the fair's three thematic labels, including the "Green Solutions Suppliers" label, helped attract buyers to their booth to examine products and learn about the company's sustainability vision. He said they have connected with 20 buyers from Indonesia, Vietnam, South Africa, and the Chinese Mainland, including a potential order of US$1 million from an Israeli agent with 260 retail points.

 The Optical Fair attracted buyers from around the world, including prominent international buyers such as the Mondottica Group representative for Australia, Brazil's VISTA IMPORT, leading European industry players like the Asia-Pacific representative of France's Kering Eyewear, Germany's Fielmann Group, and the Asia representative of UK's Specsavers, India's eyewear giant Lenskart, Indonesia's Grand Optik, Singapore's Capitol Optical, and the United States' Euro Vision International.

 Caitlin Northup, Vice President of Operations for US-based wholesale distributor Eyenavision, said “We aim to explore new suppliers and strengthen relationships with existing suppliers by attending the Optical Fair. We met with 20 exhibitors and have already placed onsite orders totaling US$500,000 with two exhibitors from the Chinese Mainland for lenses.”

This year, we connected with 20 potential suppliers at the fair. Our overall sourcing budget for suppliers we met at the fair will be around EUR2 million annually.”

 Eyewear Design Competition showcases new design talents

 The HKTDC and the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association co-organised “The 25th Hong Kong Eyewear Design Competition”, to promote the diversification and internationalisation of local eyewear designs. The competition aimed to identify promising and emerging design talents and promote innovative design and technology within the local eyewear industry. Themed “Blending Tradition and Technology”, the competition featured an Open Group as well as a Student Group. The award ceremony was held on the first day of the fair, with winning and shortlisted entries displayed throughout the event. The Open Group champion, “Be With You,” designed by Fung Wai-kuen, automatically alerts family members via bluetooth-connected smartphones when the wearer falls or presses the emergency button, significantly reducing accident risks for the elderly. This design also won the “Made-to-Sell Award”. In the Student Group, Shum Chui-shan's "Unique Perspectives" won first place. The design incorporates the auspicious butterfly symbol from traditional Chinese culture, utilising tie-dye techniques and a detachable structure which enhances the design’s three-dimensional effect and functionality.

 The fair continues to adopt the EXHIBITION+ hybrid model which seamlessly integrates online and offline elements to extend business opportunities. Exhibitors and buyers can connect and arrange meetings through the Click2Match online smart business-matching platform until 14 November. During the physical event, buyers can also use the Scan2Match function on the HKTDC Marketplace App to scan exhibitors’ QR codes to bookmark favourite suppliers, access product details and interactive floor plans, and make product enquiries - enabling engagement with exhibitors before and after the fair to continue their sourcing journey.
