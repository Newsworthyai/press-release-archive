# Woodside Credit Expands Exclusive Barrett-Jackson Partnership, Defining the Future of Financing at Collector Car Auctions

With Unmatched Experience and Reach, Woodside Credit Continues to Lead the Growth of Specialty Finance Across the Collector and Exotic Car Marketplace

 NEWPORT BEACH, CA - October 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Woodside Credit, America’s go-to lender specializing in classic and collector car financing, announced the renewal of its exclusive partnership with Barrett-Jackson, the purveyor of The World’s Greatest Collector Car Auctions. Now in its 14th year, the partnership builds upon a longstanding collaboration between the two industry leaders - making it even easier for Barrett-Jackson bidders to finance their winning vehicles through Woodside Credit’s streamlined process.

 Following Barrett-Jackson’s Fall Auction at WestWorld of Scottsdale, Woodside Credit once again celebrated the success of its exclusive partnership with The World’s Greatest Collector Car Auctions. The long-standing relationship continues to thrive, with the Scottsdale Fall Auction drawing tens of thousands of attendees and bidders and resulting in over a million dollars in collector car loans financed through Woodside Credit.

 “We’re proud to be part of Barrett-Jackson’s positive momentum,” said Mitch Shatzen, President and Chief Operating Officer of Woodside Credit. “Our industry-leading loan program is at its best when paired with events that represent the heart of the enthusiast community. Together, we make financing easy, straightforward, and an exceptional experience for our clients.”

 Woodside Credit has a full team of underwriters, loan experts, and support staff located in the Auction Office at every Barrett-Jackson auction. The company’s comprehensive onsite services include vehicle verifications, loan processing, and coordination of gate releases - allowing buyers to complete steps of their purchase from one convenient location. Woodside Credit will return to WestWorld of Scottsdale for Barrett-Jackson’s flagship auction, January 17-25, 2026, continuing its support of both new and returning bidders. Bidders can now start their Woodside Credit pre-approval directly within the BarrettJackson bidder registration process, with early registration pricing available through December 1, 2025, at Barrett-Jackson.com.
