DUBAI, UAE - October 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BMP AI Technologies Inc. (OTC: BMPA) (the "Company"), today issued a statement regarding the Caveat Emptor designation applied by OTC Markets Group on October 22, 2025.

 The Company has been in active communication with OTC Markets to understand the basis for the designation. OTC Markets has indicated that the designation relates to its review of the Companyâ€™s publicly available financial information and the recent market activity in its securities. OTC Markets has provided the Company with a detailed list of supplemental information that it has requested from the Company. The Company intends to furnish all such information promptly and expects to complete its response within the week.

 The Company reiterates that it has not authorized or engaged any third parties to conduct promotional, marketing, or investor relations campaigns on its behalf.
