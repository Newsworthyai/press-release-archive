# D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Expands European Presence With 10M Quantum Computing Initiative in Italy

LOS ANGELES, CA - October 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a global leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, announced it is hosting a series of seminars in Italy starting this week, aimed at advancing annealing quantum computing awareness and adoption among leading universities in the region as part of the Q-Alliance. Revealed at last week’s Digital Innovation Forum in Como, Italy, the Q-Alliance has been created to support the Italian government’s strategic framework for digital and quantum technologies.

 In support of the Q-Alliance, D-Wave announced a €10M contract for a D-Wave Advantage2(TM) annealing quantum computer in the region, ensuring accessibility for Italy’s scientific community, academia, and industry. In partnership with the Italian government and the Q-Alliance, the agreement includes acquisition of 50% capacity of an Advantage2 system for five years with the option to purchase the full system.

 “As a founding member of the Q-Alliance, D-Wave is committed to fast-tracking efforts to establish Italy as a global hub of quantum innovation,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “Through the placement of a D-Wave system in the region as well as ongoing hands-on workshops and training for Italy’s researchers and academic community, we’re providing access to D-Wave’s powerful, commercial-grade quantum technologies and our team of experts to help usher in Italy’s era of quantum-fueled progress.”

 With the initial workshops held at the Universita dell’Insubria and the Universita della Svizzera Italiana, the seminars are designed to accelerate education and awareness of quantum computing among Italy’s growing ecosystem of young researchers through scholarships, internships, and training programs.
