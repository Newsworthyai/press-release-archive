# Mike Leach Honored With Paul "Bear" Bryant Heart of a Champion Award

HOUSTON - October 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mike Leach, one of the most innovative minds in the history of college football, will be honored as the American Heart Association’s 2026 Paul “Bear” Bryant Heart of a Champion Award, presented by Houston (Texas)-St. Luke’s Health, honoring his exceptional contributions to college football and the community. Leach, who passed away in December 2022 at the age of 61 after suffering a heart attack, will be recognized posthumously for his larger-than-life impact on the game, his players and the communities he touched throughout his coaching career.

 The American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, presents the Bear Bryant Awards annually to celebrate excellence in coaching, to honor coach Bryant’s legacy, and to raise awareness and critical funds for its mission. The coaching legend died from a heart attack in 1983, just 28 days after his final victory and retirement.

 “Coach Leach’s impact transcended the game he loved,” said Nancy Brown, American Heart Association chief executive officer. “He inspired generations with his innovative spirit, authenticity and fearless leadership - qualities that embody the enduring legacy of Coach Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant and the American Heart Association. Honoring him with the Heart of a Champion Award celebrates not only his contributions to college football, but also the way he challenged us all to think differently and live fully.”

 The Heart of a Champion Award recognizes individuals whose notable contributions and positive influence have helped define the way we experience sports; and who exemplified characteristics for which Coach Bryant was known, including integrity, perseverance, determination and grit. Now in its seventh year, the Heart of a Champion Award is selected by the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards Executive Leadership Team.

 Coach Leach’s widow, Sharon will receive the award in honor of her husband’s legacy.

 “Our family is truly honored that Mike will be receiving the Heart of a Champion award,” said Sharon Leach. “We’re grateful to the American Heart Association and the Bear Bryant Awards for this recognition of Mike’s contribution to college football and look forward to being in Houston on January 21st for the event.”

 Some of the most accomplished figures in the history of college football have previously been recognized with the Heart of a Champion Award, including Mark Richt (2025), Olivia and Archie Manning (2024), Mark Dantonio (2023), David Shaw (2022), Sylvester Croom (2021) and Lee Corso (2020).

 Leach revolutionized offensive football with his development of the air raid system, transforming passing attacks across the college landscape. He fine-tuned an offensive system that he would use to shatter records during his head coaching tenures at Texas Tech University, Washington State University and Mississippi State University. Two of Leach’s quarterbacks were selected in the NFL draft, with Tim Couch of the University of Kentucky being picked No. 1 overall in 1999 and current Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury taken as a sixth-round pick in 2003.

 Throughout his career, Leach’s teams consistently produced record-breaking offenses and thrilling performances that reshaped how the game is played. His teams posted a combined 158-106 record and won 18 games over AP-ranked teams while his own team was unranked - the most since the AP poll was introduced in 1998.

 After a 2008 season that saw his Red Raiders post an 11-2 record and secure a berth in the Cotton Bowl, Leach was honored as Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year and the recipient of both the Woody Hayes Trophy and the George Munger Award.

 A graduate of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, Leach brought an unconventional background to college football and turned it into a career that produced more than 150 victories across 21 seasons as a head coach. His teams not only competed in bowl games nearly every year but also broke barriers by proving that innovation and adaptability could outmatch tradition and resources.

 The Heart of a Champion Award is one of five honors presented annually during the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards Ceremony presented by Memorial Hermann Health System. This year’s ceremony will be held on Wednesday, January 21, 2026 in Houston and will air on CBS Sports Network. In addition to Leach’s selection as Heart of a Champion, legendary former Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer will be the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award, while, Fan Favorite, the Newcomer Coach of the Year, and the 2025 Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year will also be awarded.
