 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - October 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The technology markets are undergoing rapid change, driven by the convergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing and a host of other technologies. Tech companies that don’t embrace these changes risk being left behind. The ones that do, face the challenge of figuring out how to implement new technologies that support the company's business objectives and growth strategies.

 “Technology markets are evolving at breakneck speed, and companies that fail to embrace AI, cloud and other innovations risk falling behind. At CohnReznick, we help tech leaders navigate this complexity and align transformation with business growth.” - Asael Meir, Partner and Technology Industry Leader at CohnReznick

 Navigating it alone can be daunting for technology companies big and small, and that’s where CohnReznick comes in. The accounting, risk management and digital transformation services company is helping tech companies optimize their business performances, manage risk and maximize value through the use of AI and other cutting-edge technology, seeking to turn the consulting industry on its head with a tech-first approach.

 CohnReznick knows a thing or two about leveraging technology to drive tech company growth. CohnReznick professionals have decades of extensive technology industry experience, serving a wide array of technology sectors including software, cloud, mobility and data analytics. They bring their expertise to tech companies across the industry spectrum from startups to established companies, helping them implement AI, automate data, roll out cloud applications, secure their systems and manage their technology risk. CohnReznick says it has deep relationships in the industry and offers full life cycle support from early-stage strategy to transaction readiness.

 Take one case study in which CohnReznick helped a portfolio company assess the investment thesis behind acquiring a startup to overhaul its legacy software business. Upon due diligence and a deep analysis of the target business, CohnReznick discovered the startup's platform lacked the necessary systems to scale. It would require a substantial investment to bring it up to even the level of the buyer’s offering. Instead of walking away from the deal, CohnReznick’s client used that information to negotiate an offer price that was one-fifth of the original estimated price.

 From fighting cybercrime to implementing AI, CohnReznick does it all. Click here to learn more.

 At The Forefront Of Fighting Cybercrime

 While CohnReznick is product agnostic when it comes to implementing AI and other technology for its clients, it is also developing its own products and services. Its Digital Forensics Lab, launched late last year, is a great example of those efforts.

 When it comes to fighting cybercrime, digital forensics is an important weapon in the arsenal. Threats are coming at businesses from everywhere, costing them hundreds of millions of dollars. Small businesses in particular are often just one data breach away from ruin. But just as cyber attacks have evolved, so too have the cybersecurity tools to fight them. CohnReznick is on the cutting edge of that with its Digital Forensics Lab.

 Through the field of digital forensics, investigators work to collect and analyze digital evidence to pinpoint the cause of a cyberattack. It requires a ton of computing power and storage, which is why cloud services are so popular with organizations of all types and sizes.

 Furthermore, the company also helps clients comply with breach notification mandates and regulations and recover lost or compromised data. The company stands with clients throughout the process, including providing expert witness testimony if the breach results in litigation.

 CohnReznick’s Digital Forensics Lab outside Washington, D.C., acts as the central hub for its cyber incident response solutions, enabling the company’s professionals to assess the full scope of cyber incidents, gather and secure digital evidence and establish protections against future cyber threats.

 Through the use of advanced tools, the lab works to quickly uncover the nature and extent of the incident – whether it’s a data breach, malware infection, unauthorized access attempt or something else – working to catch the bad actors and restore systems to their original state. Professionals in the Digital Forensics Lab also provide companies with security assessments to identify vulnerabilities, can monitor companies' networks for threats and prepare companies for cyberattacks through trial runs and test plans.

 AI To Make Life Better

 Then there is CohnReznick’s focus on AI. As an early adopter of AI, CohnReznick is leveraging AI to help clients streamline operations. Clients are coming to CohnReznick to figure out how they can use AI in their businesses and what processes and procedures they need to put in place. CohnReznick advises a slow and steady approach, implementing AI only where it will improve the business.

 Whether it's helping companies stop cyberattacks in their tracks or rolling out AI that boosts productivity and streamlines operations, you’ll find CohnReznick at the center of it. This firm consulting for tech companies both big and small is changing how consulting works with a tech-first approach perfectly suited for the 21st century and beyond.
