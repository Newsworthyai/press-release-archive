# UNLOCKD Inc. (OTCID: BFCH) - From Reset to Execution: Building the Public Platform for High-Growth Consumer Brands

LANCASTER, PA - October 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTCID: BFCH), doing business as UNLOCKD Inc., today released a shareholder update from Chairman and CEO Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, outlining its execution roadmap for the remainder of Q4 2025 and the Company’s strategy to establish a next-generation public platform for scaling high-growth consumer brands.

 Corporate Name Transition

 During its restructuring period, the Company temporarily operated under the name “EVERMIND Holdings, Inc.” as an unofficial d/b/a - a functional placeholder keeping the platform operational while legacy cleanup activities occurred. Following this period of stabilization, the Company solidified its corporate identity as UNLOCKD Inc., a name that embodies its broader mission: unlocking potential, unlocking performance, and unlocking brands. The corporate name change was formally approved by the Wyoming Secretary of State on September 29, 2025, marking the completion of the Company’s structural transformation and the beginning of its next phase of growth as a multi-brand public platform.

 Q3 2025 - A Disciplined Reset with Purpose

 UNLOCKD began Q3 as a distressed micro-cap issuer and exited the quarter as a structured, investible public platform. Key milestones included:

 * Convertible-debt elimination. Legacy variable-rate notes were fully retired and restructured into fixed-rate, capped instruments at $0.01 per share - a 2,400% premium to market at the time. This permanently removed the dilution engine that limits most OTC issuers and restored predictability to the Company’s equity base, a prerequisite for attracting future institutional or Reg A-level capital.
* Anticipated Q3 liability reduction exceeding 85% (pending CPA review), materially improving balance-sheet strength and flexibility for acquisition financing.
* Capital-structure integrity restored. Over 235 million unsupported or non-beneficial shares were invalidated, removing noise from the share count and aligning ownership with real corporate value creation.
* Initiation of equity seed fundraising. Management opened discussions with strategic investors for a $150K common-equity raise, holding firm against convertible or toxic funding to protect long-term shareholder value.

 “Q3 was about earning back trust through discipline,” said Dr. Balencic. “We eliminated structural risk, simplified the balance sheet, and positioned UNLOCKD to fund growth through clean, responsible equity. That foundation now allows us to execute.”

 Q4 2025 - Execution and Inflection

 UNLOCKD entered Q4 with a defined execution roadmap and clear milestones in progress.

 1. Advance and finalize the $150K equity seed round. Management is in the final stages of its equity seed raise, prioritizing strategic investors and valuation discipline, raising only the capital needed to execute at the current stage.
2. Finalize and close the EVERMIND™ acquisition. The Company is re-establishing operations for a physician-formulated, commercial-ready cognitive-health beverage platform that management believes represents “the next CELH of brain health.
3. Advance key partnership initiatives. Management is continuing to advance its partnership strategy, identifying opportunities that could expand brand reach and enhance market credibility. These initiatives remain part of UNLOCKD’s broader roadmap and will be disclosed as they are finalized.
4. Secure a post-revenue, synergistic brand under LOI. UNLOCKD is evaluating multiple high-potential consumer brands with established revenue streams and distribution footprints. The Company’s clean structure and governance discipline have made it an attractive partner for founders seeking scalable growth through a public platform.
5. Prepare the Regulation A offering. UNLOCKD has received preliminary, non-binding expressions of interest totaling approximately $2 million from prospective investors. Management is finalizing legal counsel selection and will determine timing, structure, and valuation to ensure the offering is executed responsibly and aligned with long-term shareholder interests.

 Each milestone reinforces the Company’s core principle of executing first and capitalizing later - allowing valuation growth before raising additional funds.

 Why Consumer Brands and Why Now

 Consumer-health and functional-wellness products have demonstrated resilience across market cycles, sustaining demand even during economic slowdowns. This makes the category both defensive and growth-oriented.

 UNLOCKD’s model targets post-proof-of-concept brands acquired at less than one times revenue and scales them using shared infrastructure. Most CPG exits occur between four and ten times revenue, providing a clear arbitrage opportunity for disciplined operators. The platform aggregates manufacturing, compliance, marketing, and finance to convert fragmented start-ups into efficient, margin-positive divisions.

 For shareholders, this means diversified exposure, public-market liquidity, and the upside of venture-stage growth without venture-capital opacity.

 Capital Markets Are Catching Up

 In September 2025, Bloomberg reported that Robinhood Markets Inc. plans a fund granting retail investors exposure to private companies - a clear signal that capital markets are moving toward democratized access to growth assets. UNLOCKD is the consumer-sector counterpart to that trend: a transparent, regulated public vehicle giving investors early exposure to scalable, high-potential brands.

 The macro backdrop is favorable: the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut cycle is reducing the cost of capital (Reuters, Sept 17 2025); private-market valuations in wellness and beverage remain 20-40 percent below 2021 peaks (Reuters, Aug 25 2025); and strategic acquirers are redirecting portfolios toward functional categories. With its reset complete and balance sheet stabilized, UNLOCKD is positioned to capitalize on these tailwinds.

 Infrastructure and Brand Buildout

 UNLOCKD has engaged a creative agency to develop its full brand ecosystem, including a new corporate website, investor pitch deck, and communications platform scheduled to debut in Q4. These initiatives will modernize the Company’s public presence and support investor engagement as it scales.

 Modernizing Ownership and Access

 UNLOCKD’s long-term vision extends beyond acquisitions and revenue - it’s about modernizing how investors, consumers, and founders participate in shared success.

 Management is evaluating a suite of alignment initiatives, including tokenized-equity frameworks and profit-linked share-buyback programs, each designed to increase transparency, broaden participation, and reinforce long-term value creation.

 Tokenization represents a future pathway to make ownership more inclusive and dynamic. By digitizing equity, UNLOCKD could one day enable global retail access, fractional participation, and the integration of consumer-based rewards and loyalty benefits - transforming customers into stakeholders through perks, early access, or brand experiences that strengthen engagement and brand equity.

 In parallel, the Company is exploring a cash-flow-driven share-buyback program that would activate once UNLOCKD achieves sustainable positive cash flow. Under such a framework, a defined portion of available cash could be allocated toward repurchasing BFCH common shares in the open market, linking operational performance directly to shareholder alignment.

 While these initiatives remain exploratory and subject to regulatory review, they reflect UNLOCKD’s forward-thinking approach to ownership, accountability, and value creation within a modern public-market framework.

 “We built UNLOCKD to demonstrate that public markets can be a source of smart capital for emerging consumer innovation. The cleanup phase is done; what follows is execution, revenue, and measurable value creation,” - Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, Chairman & CEO, UNLOCKD Inc.
