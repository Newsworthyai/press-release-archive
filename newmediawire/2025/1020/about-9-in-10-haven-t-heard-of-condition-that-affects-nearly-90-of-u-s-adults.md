 DALLAS - October 20, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - About 9 in 10 U.S. adults have not heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a newly defined health condition affecting nearly 90% of adults that includes heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity, according to a new survey from the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere. However, many are interested in learning more about it.

 Nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome[1], including high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone. For most of them, CKM syndrome is reversible with changes to their eating pattern, physical activity and appropriate treatment.[2],[3]

 “We want people to know that it’s really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more,” said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association’s chief medical officer for prevention.

 CKM health includes the heart, kidneys and metabolic system (responsible for creating, using and storing energy, which affects weight and blood glucose level). These systems are connected and function together. When one system is functioning poorly, it can make the others worse. This creates a cycle that puts your health at serious risk for CKM syndrome. The Association will issue the first ever guidelines on CKM syndrome in early 2026.

 Key findings from the new survey:

 * 12% of U.S. adults had never heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome
* 79% agreed that it is important that they understand more about CKM health and 72% said they are interested in learning more about it
* People are most interested in learning about how CKM syndrome is treated (72%) and diagnosed (71%)
* 68% of U.S. adults incorrectly believe it’s best to manage individual conditions one at a time or weren’t sure of the best way to manage them
* 42% believed that a healthy heart would not likely be damaged by other organ systems or weren’t sure

 “The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way,” Sanchez said. "These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care.”

 The American Heart Association’s CKM Health Initiative™ is providing a website and educational resources to help people understand how heart, kidney and metabolic health are connected and take action early to prevent a heart attack, heart failure or stroke. The Association is also working with healthcare teams across the country to improve collaboration among health care professionals who care for patients living with multiple health conditions.

 A new video helps by clarifying “2 truths” about heart health with a simplified visual and explanation (watch the video here):

 1. The heart pumps blood to the body
2. The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) from the blood into energy
3. The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood
4. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure
5. Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood into the body

 “CKM health is about your overall health,” said Sanchez. “It’s a full circle. You can take care of your overall health with regular checks of your blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, blood sugar and kidney function.”

 The Harris Poll conducted a survey in August 2025 on behalf of the Heart Association to gauge public awareness of CKM syndrome and CKM health. About 4,000 U.S. adults were surveyed. Health care professionals can access resources on interdisciplinary care and information about joining the CKM Health Initiative at heart.org/CKMtools. The American Heart Association’s Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health Initiative is made possible by Founding Sponsors Novo Nordisk® and Boehringer Ingelheim,Supporting Sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and Champion Sponsor DaVita®.

 The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association receives funding primarily from individuals; foundations and corporations (including pharmaceutical, device manufacturers and other companies) also make donations and fund specific Association programs and events. The Association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.

 Research Methodology

 The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association among 4,007 US adults aged 18+. The survey was conducted 8/6 - 8/22/2025.

 Data are weighted where necessary by education, age by gender, race/ethnicity, region, household income, size of household, marital status, employment, and smoking status to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys.

 The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within ± 2.0 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest. All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.
