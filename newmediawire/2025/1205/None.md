# Beeline Holdings (BLNE) Aims to Close Homeownership Gap With Cutting-Edge Platform

LOS ANGELES, CA - December 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Beeline Holdings (NASDAQ: BLNE) was featured in a recent article that discussed its fast-growing digital mortgage platform and the company’s efforts to redefine the path to homeownership. The piece reads, “Its AI-enabled proprietary platform can scale loan processing volumes rapidly while maintaining operational efficiency. By automating much of the underwriting and documentation process, Beeline can approve loans within minutes and close them in as few as 14 to 21 days, less than half the industry average. The platform’s design also caters to a changing borrower demographic. According to National Mortgage Professional, only 26.1% of Gen Z and 54.9% of Millennials owned homes in 2024, reflecting limited access to affordable mortgages. Beeline’s tools, including its AI decision engine and chatbot ‘Bob,’ aim to close that gap, giving buyers near-instant certainty about mortgage eligibility.”
