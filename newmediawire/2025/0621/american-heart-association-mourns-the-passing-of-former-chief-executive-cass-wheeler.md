# American Heart Association mourns the passing of former chief executive Cass Wheeler

(NewMediaWire) - June 21, 2025 - Dallas, TX — The American Heart Association is deeply saddened to announce the passing of its former Chief Executive Officer, Cass Wheeler, who led the Association professional staff for more than three decades with extraordinary commitment and compassion. Wheeler, a long-time Georgetown, Texas resident, passed away peacefully following a neurodegenerative illness. He was 84.

 Cass Wheeler served as CEO of the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, from 1998 until his retirement in 2008, capping a 35-year tenure with the organization. His leadership marked a transformational era for the Heart Association, guiding the nonprofit into the 21st century and dramatically expanding its global influence in public health, cardiovascular science, fundraising and community engagement.

 “Cass Wheeler was more than a leader — he was a mentor, a dear friend, and a relentless champion for every person at risk of cardiovascular disease,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “He believed deeply in the power of purpose, and he inspired generations of staff and volunteers to push beyond boundaries. I would not be where I am today without his guidance and belief in me. His legacy lives in the millions of lives touched by the work he helped build.”

 Among his many accomplishments, Wheeler completed the organizational consolidation of individual state and metropolitan affiliates into 15 streamlined geographic operating affiliates, adopting a more contemporary and efficient, unified corporate structure that enhanced the Association’s effectiveness and impact. Under Wheeler’s leadership, the Association launched the groundbreaking “Go Red for Women™” campaign, raising worldwide awareness of the impact of heart disease on women and began the American Stroke Association, a division started in 1998 dedicated to reducing disability and death from stroke. He also led the charge to develop the Get With The Guidelines® initiative to improve the overall quality of cardiovascular care in hospitals, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in partnership with the William J. Clinton Foundation to combat childhood obesity, and the Association’s school-based programs teaching children the importance of heart health and philanthropy -- all initiatives that continue to this day as cornerstones of the Association’s community impact. He also personally played a pivotal role in expanding research funding, strengthening stroke awareness, and advancing access to healthcare for everyone, everywhere, long before the topic became a national conversation.

 Wheeler was instrumental in sharpening the Association’s focus on public policy and advocacy, in the process helping secure landmark public health legislation across the country — including stronger tobacco control laws and improved nutrition labeling.

 A native Texan, he graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a business degree. Immediately after graduation, he joined the American Cancer Society, gaining valuable non-profit healthcare experience. He then transitioned into finance, working as a stockbroker in Dallas for two New York Stock Exchange firms.

 Wheeler joined what was then the Texas Affiliate of American Heart Association in 1973 and steadily rose through the staff ranks. Known for his humility and hands-on leadership style, he always put mission and people first. After retiring, he remained active as a speaker, consultant and author, sharing lessons from his career in his book You’ve Got to Have Heart: Achieving Purpose Beyond Profit in the Social Sector. Despite recent health challenges, Wheeler remained deeply engaged with Association leadership. One year ago, he helped ring in the Association’s centennial in Chicago, sharing his legacy and leadership.

 Wheeler was a leader on many nonprofit boards and commissions during his tenure with the Heart Association. He was the co-convener of the Panel on the Nonprofit Sector, formed by the Senate Finance Committee to enhance governance in charities, a member of the Commission on Improving Economic Opportunity in Communities Dependent on Tobacco Production appointed by then President William B. Clinton, and served on boards of National Human Services Assembly, Partnership for Prevention, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Research!America, National Health Council, American Legacy Foundation, National Council on Aging, Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance, and more. He was also an active consultant and university guest lecturer following his professional career.

 He is survived by his children Kevin Wheeler, Kristen Wheeler, grandchildren Trinity Wheeler, Cash Wheeler, stepchildren Austin Schonfeld and Chloe Schonfeld, and a wide circle of colleagues and friends who cherished his integrity, warmth and wisdom. A memorial service is being planned, and details will be shared by the family in the coming days. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the American Heart Association in honor of Cass Wheeler’s lifelong dedication to building health and hope, for everyone everywhere.
