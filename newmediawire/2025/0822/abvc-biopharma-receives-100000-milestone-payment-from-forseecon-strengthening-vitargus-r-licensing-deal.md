 Unlocking Market Potential

 Vitargus® is believed to be the world’s first biodegradable vitreous substitute designed to replace the gel-like substance in the eye during retinal detachment surgery. Unlike current silicone oil or gas bubble solutions, Vitargus® is naturally absorbed and allows patients to maintain upright vision during recovery, eliminating the need for prolonged face-down positioning.

 According to Verified Market Reports, the global vitreous substitute market was valued at approximately US$2.5 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$4.1 billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 6.3%.[1] Meanwhile, the broader retinal surgery devices market - where Vitargus® would be positioned - was estimated at US$2.82 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to US$4.76 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 9.2%.[2] These figures highlight the substantial commercial opportunity for Vitargus® as a disruptive innovation in ophthalmic surgery.

 Management Commentary

 Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, stated:“This milestone payment from ForSeeCon highlights the continued progress of our Vitargus® licensing collaboration. With $495,000 already received in cash, over $3 million still available to receive and equity holdings in ForSeeCon, we believe ABVC is strategically positioned to capture both near-term financial benefits and long-term commercial upside. Vitargus® is a pioneering solution in ophthalmic surgery, and we are confident that our partnership with ForSeeCon will accelerate its path toward global commercialization.”

 Jerry Chang, CEO of ForSeeCon Eye Corporation, added:

 “Vitargus continues to generate interest globally. Our milestone payment reflects confidence in the product’s regulatory and commercial trajectory.”

 Forward-Looking Outlook

 This agreement with ForSeeCon further strengthens ABVC’s financial and strategic foundation in ophthalmology. By combining upfront equity, milestone cash payments and substantial royalty opportunities, ABVC has secured a licensing deal with a total potential value of $63.5 million. With both immediate cash flows and long-term revenue streams, we believe ABVC is positioning itself to deliver transformational shareholder value while advancing Vitargus® to address the multi-billion-dollar global market for retinal disease treatments.[3]
