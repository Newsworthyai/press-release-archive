 The Museum takes a step forward in battling Dementia (NewMediaWire) - August 14, 2025 - Glendale, CA — Museums serve as invaluable bridges between the past and the future, offering a window into history through artifacts, stories, and visual media. But one institution in Glendale, the Martial Arts History Museum, is distinguished by an extraordinary commitment that goes beyond its collections: a deep-seated devotion to humanity. This museum is not just a repository of historical artifacts; it is an active force for good in the community, hosting a variety of humanitarian programs.

 Founded in 1999 and relocated to Glendale in 2023, the museum's mission is rooted in the belief that while education and preserving artifacts are crucial, their humanitarian efforts truly set them apart. "This is what it's about, the people we serve," says museum president Michael Matsuda. "We have been offering free tours and visits for the last 17 years, both at our previous Burbank facility and now in Glendale. I feel we need to be a part of this community, be a part of this city by doing more. Oh, it's not a requirement, but I think it's necessary that we provide opportunities and perhaps we can help someone through this."

 Michael Matsuda The museum frequently welcomes groups of all ages, including seniors with dementia and individuals facing mental health challenges. These visits are provided completely free of charge. Matsuda recalls a particularly moving moment with a 95-year-old visitor who saw a photo of his childhood teacher on the wall. "Something clicked, and he was talking about his experience the whole time. Now, that was exciting," Matsuda explains. "If we can provide a spark, we did something special."

 While their passion lies in the history, art, and culture of martial arts—making them the only institution in the world dedicated to such a rich history of martial arts and Asian culture—the museum is equally dedicated to making learning accessible and engaging for everyone. "We help kids learn about art, music, culture, and more, not just the punch and kick," says Matsuda, a former Disney artist. "We provide education but we make it fun and interesting. We design this place for both little kids and adults to learn and enjoy."

 The museum fully absorbs the costs of these impactful visits. To continue their mission of making a difference in the fight against dementia and mental health challenges, they have established a GoFundMe page. The museum encourages the community to consider a contribution to support their ongoing efforts.  Gofundme link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/fund-free-museum-visits-for-senior-groups-with-dementia
