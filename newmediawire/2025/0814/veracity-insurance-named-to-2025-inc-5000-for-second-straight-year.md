 PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH - August 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Veracity Insurance Solutions has again been recognized among the fastest-growing private companies in America, earning a place on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list with 95% growth over the past three years.

 “Our growth is fueled by a team committed to simplifying the way small businesses and independent professionals buy insurance,” said Daryle Stafford, CEO of Veracity Insurance. “We’re building tools and products that help customers get covered faster, with options that fit the way they work today. Making the Inc. 5000 again shows that we’re on the right track and delivering value where it matters most.”

 Veracity serves more than 200 classes of businesses nationwide through its portfolio of specialty brands and custom partner programs. These include:

 * Insurance Canopy – tailored policies for more than 20 industries
* Food Liability Insurance Program (FLIP) - coverage for food and beverage operators, from food trucks to caterers
* Artists, Crafters, and Tradesmen (ACT) Insurance - protection for creative professionals and vendors

 Over the past year, the company expanded into new product lines, including additional coverage for event-based businesses and gig-economy professionals. Veracity also launched instant integrations with online booking platforms, making it possible for customers to secure coverage as part of the registration or vendor application process. Real-time policy delivery now allows most clients to get proof of coverage within minutes, removing traditional delays tied to underwriting and broker communications.

 Since its founding, Veracity has blended technology with specialty underwriting to meet the needs of small business owners who often face limited options from traditional carriers. More entrepreneurs are choosing flexible coverage they can secure online, paired with personal service when it matters most - fueling the company’s continued growth.

 Alongside the Inc. 5000 recognition, Veracity was also named to CNBC’s 2025 list of the Top 30 InsurTech Companies in the World, compiled in partnership with Statista.
