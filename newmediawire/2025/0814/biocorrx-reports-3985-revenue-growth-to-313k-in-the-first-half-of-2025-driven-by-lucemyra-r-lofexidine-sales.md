 ANAHEIM, CA - August 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BioCorRx Inc. (OTCQB: BICX) (the “Company”), a developer and provider of innovative treatment programs for substance abuse and related disorders, today provided a business update for the three months ended June 30, 2025, and reported on recent corporate developments.

 Lourdes Felix, CEO, CFO, and Director of BioCorRx Inc., commented, “In the last quarter, through our subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., we completed the strategic acquisition of LUCEMYRA® (lofexidine) from USWM, LLC - the first and only FDA-approved non-opioid treatment for opioid withdrawal symptoms. This milestone acquisition has already begun to pay off, fueling significant revenue growth in 2025. For the first half of 2025, total revenue increased 3,985% to $313K, while second quarter revenue increased 4,306% to $178K. We also strengthened our bottom line, reducing net loss by $242,419 to $2.2 million, a nearly 10% year-over-year improvement, with net loss per share narrowing to $0.13 from $0.27 in the prior year. Looking ahead, we expect LUCEMYRA® to continue growing as a key revenue driver, and we believe its sustained performance will further enhance shareholder value.”

 BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. also continues the development of sustained-release naltrexone products, with ongoing research supported by a significant grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant is designated for the development of BICX104, a subcutaneous, long-duration naltrexone implantable pellet intended for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder (MUD), either as a standalone therapy or in combination with bupropion. MUD is a significant public health challenge, affecting individuals, families, and communities across the nation. With no approved medications currently available specifically for MUD, and an expanding demographic at risk of methamphetamine-related overdose deaths, this funding will greatly accelerate our research efforts to develop BICX104 as a potential treatment. The Company looks forward to sharing updates on the initiation of the MUD Phase 1b clinical study in Q3 2025 and sharing an update for BICX104 for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).

 A copy of the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on the Company’s website at https://ir.biocorrx.com/.

 Important Safety Information

 What is LUCEMYRA?

 LUCEMYRA is a non-opioid prescription medicine used in adults to help with the symptoms of opioid withdrawal that may happen when you stop taking an opioid suddenly. LUCEMYRA will not completely prevent the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is not a treatment for opioid use disorder.

 Important Safety Information

 LUCEMYRA can cause serious side effects, including low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and fainting. Watch for symptoms of low blood pressure or heart rate, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint at rest or when quickly standing up; if you experience these symptoms, call your healthcare provider right away and do not take your next dose of LUCEMYRA until you have talked to your healthcare provider. Avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated and be careful not to stand up too suddenly from lying or sitting, as these may increase your risk of low blood pressure and fainting. When your treatment is complete, you will need to stop taking LUCEMYRA gradually, or your blood pressure could increase. After a period of not using opioid drugs, you can become more sensitive to the effects of opioids if you start using them again. This may increase your risk of overdose and death. Before taking LUCEMYRA, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you have low blood pressure, slow heart rate, any heart problems including history of heart attack or a condition called long QT syndrome, liver or kidney problems, or if you drink alcohol.
