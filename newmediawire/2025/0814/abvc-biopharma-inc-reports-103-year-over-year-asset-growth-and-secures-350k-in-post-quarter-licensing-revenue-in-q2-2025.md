# ABVC BioPharma, Inc. Reports 103% Year-Over-Year Asset Growth and Secures $350K in Post-Quarter Licensing Revenue in Q2 2025

SILICON VALLEY, CA - August 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and oncology/hematology, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. The Company continues to advance strategic initiatives aimed at stabilizing operations, strengthening its balance sheet, and building long-term shareholder value across its global platform.

 Q2 2025 Highlights: Laying the Foundation for Scalable Growth

 * Total Assets More Than Doubled: The Company reported total consolidated assets of $16.2 million, a 103% increase from $8.0 million in Q2 2024, driven by stronger affiliate equity positioning and improved asset allocation.
* Shareholders’ Equity Increased: Shareholders’ equity rose to $9.5 million from $8.0 million in the same period last year, reflecting disciplined strategic consolidation and improved capital structure.

 Disciplined EPS Management Shows Downward Trend in Losses

 ABVC reported a diluted loss per share of $(0.13) for the second quarter of 2025, showing a significant improvement compared to the full-year diluted loss per share of $(0.42) in 2024. The narrowing loss underscores the Company’s continued focus on streamlining operations, reducing non-core expenditures, and prioritizing high-value growth initiatives.

 Strategic Land Acquisition in Asia to Support R&D and GMP Expansion

 Following the close of Q2, ABVC completed the acquisition of farmland in Taiwan valued at approximately $3.3 million. Although this asset will be recognized in the Company’s third-quarter balance sheet, the transaction was finalized in Q2 and will be disclosed as a subsequent event to its quarterly report.

 The land will serve as a strategic base for botanical ingredient cultivation, modular R&D facilities, and GMP-compliant pilot-scale manufacturing, supporting the Company’s long-term expansion plans in Asia. The Company believes the plans for this land will enhance vertical integration, reduce external supply dependency, and lay the foundation for operational efficiency and shareholder value creation.

 $350K in Licensing Revenue Collected in July Boosts Q3 Outlook

 In July 2025, ABVC received a total of $350,000 in licensing revenue from three licensing partners: $150,000 from AiBtl BioPharma, Inc., $100,000 from OncoX BioPharma, Inc., and $100,000 from ForSeeCon Eye Corporation. These payments, that will be recognized in Q3 of 2025, highlight the continued execution of the Company’s monetization strategy and reinforce momentum in licensing-based revenue streams.

 “Our second-quarter results reflect the strategic discipline we’ve applied across our business,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer. “From doubling our asset base to acquiring physical infrastructure in Asia and securing non-dilutive licensing revenue, we’re working to position ABVC for sustainable long-term growth while creating tangible value for our shareholders.”
