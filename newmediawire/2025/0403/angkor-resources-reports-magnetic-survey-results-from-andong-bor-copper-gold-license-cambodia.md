# Angkor Resources Reports Magnetic Survey Results From Andong Bor Copper Gold License, Cambodia

GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA - April 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ANGKOR RESOURCES CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” OR “THE COMPANY”) announces its summary report on the Andong Bor ground magnetic survey on the Andong Bor license.

 The technical team of Angkor has summarized the results of the ground magnetic survey completed on Andong Bor license during early 2025. The survey analysis identified features with existing geochemical anomalies and cross referenced with previous core logging that shows mineralized zones are also identifiable by significant magnetic anomalies.

 Dennis Ouellette, VP Exploration for Angkor comments, “This is some of the best magnetic data I have encountered in my career.   The mag data reflects the existing geochemical data; they are a match, which implies if we use this magnetic data carefully, that should also correlate with identifying additional mineralization.  The wall rocks adjacent to the intrusions are mineralized and have abundant secondary magnetite.  For instance, hole-008 was collared in mineralized wall rock and drilled at -65 to the south out of mineralization and into poorly mineralized granodiorite. If this is the case, then the magnetic anomaly is showing the mineralized wall rock outside of the intrusive rocks.”

 The images below provide an illustration of the results highlighting where previous drill holes (marked with ABDDH16 xxx) with mineralization were located; the magnetic highs were also significant.  The map on the right shows the location of the lines over raw magnetic data.   The map on the left is referred to as ‘RTP’ or Reduction to Pole which more accurately places the anomaly over the geology. In this case, for Thmei North, which is the prospect with holes 008, 007 and 005, it shows a ring-like structure with lower mag in the center.  Results indicate that Zone C, which includes these three previously drilled holes on the property, is the highest priority to concentrate drilling efforts.

 Dennis Ouellette continues, “Zone C, with its multiple magnetic features modelled near holes ADBDDH16-005, 007, and 008 represents a first order drill target and should be managed in conjunction with geochemical anomalies.”   Earlier holes were verified  in 2022 ANGKOR CONFIRMS 108 METRES OF 0.53% COPPER EQUIVALENT AT ANDONG BOR, CAMBODIA | Angkor Resources Corp.

 Just south of Zone C, Zone A2 represents the second highest rank targets and dictates that several drill holes should be completed to check the coincident magnetic and geochemical features.

 This ground magnetic survey was conducted in early 2025 and had 49 lines between 2200m and 2700m long, spaced 100m apart. The data was collected on 45 west to east lines and four north to south tie lines. The west to east lines are 100 meters apart; data is collected every 1.5 to 2.5 meters.

 The 2D Models of the survey suggest the magnetic features are 300 to 500m in area and range in depth from 100 to 150 metres in Zone C.

 Zone A1 and A2 are in an area of higher magnetic response and seem disrupted by many faults. They are complex and sharper features and likely shallower (less than 100m) and with clean breaks between materials. Bore ADBDDH16 -006 results suggest these are also mineralized porphyry however Bore ADBDH16- 006 is not in the core part of the structure. Zone B, D and E are in an area with lower amplitude features and are generally rounded outlines. The major features are interpreted as greater than 250m depth.

 Angkor holds a 20% carried interest on the license and its Canadian partner, CanBodia Copper Corp. funds the activities to advance the potential for a large copper gold discovery.

 Additional analysis is pending.
