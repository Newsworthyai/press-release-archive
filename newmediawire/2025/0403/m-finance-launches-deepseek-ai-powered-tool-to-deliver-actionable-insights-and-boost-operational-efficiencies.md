# m-FINANCE Launches DeepSeek AI-Powered Tool To Deliver Actionable Insights And Boost Operational Efficiencies

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - April 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing advanced online trading platforms by automating complex analysis and enhancing operational efficiencies, empowering traders and brokers to focus on making money.

 That is exactly what m-FINANCE Limited., a wholly owned subsidiary of mF International Limited (NASDAQ: MFI) and a provider of forex and bullion trading solutions in Asia, is aiming to do with the launch of its AI-Commentary solution, an advanced analytical suite integrated into its mF4 trading platform. The company’s first foray into AI, the tool combines m-FINANCE's institutional expertise with DeepSeek's large language models (LLMs), enabling brokers to obtain actionable insights while improving operational efficiency.

 The AI-Commentary tool aggregates real-time market data, including forex rates, bullion prices and macroeconomic indicators and analyzes patterns across multiple timeframes and asset classes to provide actionable information to brokers. m-FINANCE says by leveraging DeepSeek's leading models fine-tuned with financial datasets, AI-Commentary is able to translate complex data into clear, easily readable insights that meet industry standards. For brokers, the result is a scalable solution that gives them new ways to engage with clients.

 Leveraging DeepSeek’s Power

 It’s not surprising that m-FINANCE is leveraging DeepSeek for the launch of this new product. DeepSeek is getting a lot of attention in the marketplace because it is designed to be more efficient than other LLMs, requiring less time to work and lower developmental costs. DeepSeek is also open-source, which means researchers and developers can run and build upon the model for free. What’s more, the AI’s reasoning approach – through which the system generates answers similar to how humans solve problems – is thought to result in more accurate responses and a critical advantage in fast-paced financial markets.

 m-FINANCE’s sweet spot is developing online trading platforms and software as a service or SaaS solutions to empower brokers across Asia. It doesn’t hurt that the company is an expert in the forex and bullion markets and has already developed a variety of products and services including its mF4 trading platform and Forex white label and liquidity solution.

 The company says AI-Commentary builds on that, providing brokers with a way to improve operational efficiency and client retention. The latter is important given the competitiveness of the marketplace. By automating analytical tasks, the AI tool reduces manual workloads, allowing teams to focus on strategic client interactions.

 For end-clients, m-FINANCE says AI-Commentary identifies emerging opportunities and risks, delivering timely insights directly within the mF4 Platform interface with embedded TradingView charts and smart indicators. AI-Commentary comes in Basic and Advanced tiers across multiple languages while maintaining robust security and giving brokers full editorial control to ensure regulatory compliance, reports m-FINANCE.

 "Our AI Commentary feature will transform how brokers provide value to clients. By automating complex analysis while maintaining institutional-grade quality, we help our partners boost client engagement and operational efficiency, allowing them to prioritize what matters most in their own client interactions,” said Chi Weng (Dick) Tam, Executive Director and CEO of m-FINANCE. “This launch represents our first significant step in integrating AI technology into our ecosystem, laying the foundation for upcoming projects including our AI-Agent which will further enhance the trading experience. These developments reinforce our two-decade commitment to continuous innovation in forex and bullion trading solutions."

 More AI-Powered Tools In The Works

 AI-Commentary is just the beginning of m-FINANCE’s foray into AI and underscores the company’s commitment to providing brokers with innovative solutions designed to help them perform better. m-FINANCE reports it is currently developing its next tool – AI-Agent which is being designed to analyze traders' risk appetites and trading styles, recommend optimal signals and eventually automate trade execution.

 AI is transforming the way brokers analyze complex data sets and improving operational efficiencies, giving them an edge in a highly competitive marketplace. m-FINANCE, with the launch of its first AI-driven tool, is embracing that transformation with the help of DeepSeek. The company is confident that AI-Commentary and the upcoming AI-Agent tools only scratch the surface of what m-FINANCE has in store for its broker clients.
