# Wytec Prepares for 1st AI Gunshot Detection Pilot

SAN ANTONIO, TX - April 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Wytec International (“Wytec”), OTCQB: WYTC, is preparing for its first of many Pilot demonstrations of its integrated solution consisting of in-building cellular, private LTE and gunshot detection solution requested by 46 Texas ISDs initiated through form request. The Pilot introduces a “phased” approach utilizing the FCC’s Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), designed to provide a private, secure wireless connection that eliminates interference from detecting multiple types of gunshot threats already becoming an epidemic in America’s cities and schools. This Pilot Program comes in conjunction with Wytec’s recent multi-state government (MSA) award in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued by the TXShare Cooperative Purchasing Program directed by the North Central Texas Council of Governments. The MSA includes Wytec’s AI-integrated smart sensors to be utilized in more than 170 US Cities, 50 Counties, and over 40 Special Districts, including Transit Authorities, Water Utility Boards, Bridge and Highway Authorities, Police Departments, School Districts, Hospitals, and many more.

 Wytec has amassed a team of industry experts with Defense industry experience. The advanced solutions are supported by more than 75 global patents and patent-pending solutions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), smart sensors, wireless connectivity, and cloud management. Wytec’s integrated solution includes two key partnerships:  Nextivity Inc., headquartered in San Diego, California, and the Lemko Corporation, headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois. Both companies possess significant expertise in the development of wireless technologies that incorporate AI/ML, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Transportation, and Environmental Informatics.
