# Giant Mining Adds AI-Driven Fifth Drill Hole to 2025 Majuba Hill Program in Collaboration With ExploreTech

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that Hole MHB-32 (“MHB-32”) has been successfully drilled to a total depth of 889.5 feet (271.1 meters). MHB-32 is the first hole of the 2025 diamond core drilling program (the “Core Program”), currently underway at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada.

 Following the encouraging visual results from Hole MHB-32, a fifth hole has been added to the 2025 diamond core drilling program. This new hole was designed by Exploration Technologies (“ExploreTech”) to specifically target a high-potential southern resistivity anomaly identified by its proprietary AI program.

 As previously stated, the primary objective of the Core Program is to expand the known zones of copper mineralization at Majuba Hill and advance the project toward a new Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, commented: "We are thrilled with the continued success of the 2025 drill program and encouraged by our team’s recommendation to add an additional hole to the plan—another key step toward advancing Majuba Hill to a new NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate. This hole, designed in collaboration with ExploreTech, will test a high-potential southern resistivity anomaly identified by the ExploreTech AI program. The scale and potential of this system continue to impress, and this phase of drilling is critical to unlocking further value for our shareholders. With copper prices near all-time highs and growing urgency to develop domestic U.S. copper sources, the timing has never been better. The entire team at Giant Mining has never had more conviction in advancing Majuba Hill toward its true potential.”

 Big Sky Exploration, LLC (“Big Sky”) of Eureka, Nevada, successfully completed drilling of Hole MHB-32 and mobilized the drill rig to a new pad where Hole MHB-33 is scheduled to be drilled. MHB-32 was quick-logged and tagged for sampling on-site by Giant Mining geologists (Figure 2), as part of the Company’s efforts to efficiently advance the 2025 Core Program at Majuba Hill.

 About Exploration Technologies Inc.

 ExploreTech’s AI approach is specifically designed to combine surface geology and drilling results with computationally intensive remodeling of existing geophysical datasets to optimize targeting of covered targets. The process quickly generates thousands of solutions that cluster on the best fits between the geological and geophysical data and then generates drillhole trajectories designed to cut those clusters most effectively.

 ExploreTech first combines the geological concept with AI geophysical simulation to identify and locate where the source of a geophysical anomaly actually lies. This is done by testing thousands of possible explanations (models) for anomalies measured at the surface and selecting only those that closely match the real-world geophysics. The selected models of the combined geology and geophysics cluster around the most likely location of the anomaly. The program then evaluates the clusters in three dimensions to determine the optimal drilling trajectory to pierce as many of the target anomalies as possible. The entire process can be rerun as drill results for specific targets, or additional geophysical surveying, adds new information allowing improved vectoring to the best mineralized parts of a given ore system. This use of AI to reveal and reinforce target anomalies in existing geophysical datasets is a significant new exploration tool and has already been applied in several cases, some are viewable at www.exploretech.ai.

 The core samples from MHB-32 will be securely transported to Giant Mining’s secured warehouse facility in Elko, Nevada. At this location, the cores will undergo systematic sawing. Following this, the processed samples will be sent to ALS Group USA, Corp. ("ALS Labs") in Elko, Nevada. At ALS Labs, the samples will undergo rigorous analyses, including assays for copper, silver, gold, and other trace elements, to accurately assess the mineral content and support ongoing exploration efforts at Majuba Hill.​

 As previously reported in the March 17, 2025 news release, the 2025 Core Program has been designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings (Figure 3).

 The Company will provide regular updates as the drill program progresses, including assay results, geological observations, and any significant developments encountered during drilling. These updates will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed on the advancement of the Majuba Hill project and its potential to support a future resource estimate.

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth or plastic sample bags and are transported from the Majuba Hill to the Giant Mining secure warehouse for core sawing and processing and then samples are delivered to the ALS Labs sample prep facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS then transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 5% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining sample pulps are retrieved from ALS Minerals and retained by the Company for future metallurgical testing.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada, USA — a globally top-ranked mining jurisdiction, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute’s 2022 Annual Survey of Mining Companies.

 Project Size:

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects
