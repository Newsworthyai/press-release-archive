# ABVC's Subsidiary AiBtl Signs Share-for-Land Agreement in Asia With Deal Valued at USD $7.67 Million

FREMONT, CA - April 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on innovative treatments in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous system), and oncology/hematology, today announced that its majority-owned subsidiary, AiBtl BioPharma Inc., has signed a strategic share-based land acquisition agreement with local landholders in central Taiwan. The transaction, valued at $7,666,667, involved the exchange of AiBtl shares priced at $5.00[1] per share and secured exclusive rights to agricultural land for future pharmaceutical production.

 The acquired land will be designated for the cultivation and extraction of Polygala tenuifolia (Yuan Zhi), a central ingredient in AiBtl’s botanical drug candidates for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The Company believes this move is key to reducing sourcing risk and supporting large-scale, high-quality production of active botanical compounds.

 “This agreement is a long-term investment into securing the future of botanical drug innovation,” said Uttam Patil, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of ABVC. “By locking in upstream resources in Asia, we are strengthening AiBtl’s infrastructure from seed to formulation - giving our neuroscience pipeline a sustainable foundation.”

 The transaction also reflects ABVC’s continuing efforts to expand its physical and operational footprint in the Asia-Pacific region while enhancing value for global shareholders.

 Strategic Context

 Over the past year, AiBtl has continued to make steady progress in its business development involving its botanical drug candidates for MDD and ADHD—two neurological conditions with multi-billion-dollar global market potential and substantial unmet medical needs. With these developments, the announcement underscores ABVC’s long-term commitment to securing upstream agricultural resources and establishing a vertically integrated supply chain from cultivation to clinical application.

 Market Significance of AiBtl’s CNS Drug Pipeline

 MDD Drug Candidate: The MDD therapeutics market is projected to reach $14 billion by 2027, with antidepressant drug sales growing at a CAGR of 6.2%.[2] Current treatment drugs face issues like delayed onset, significant side effects, and poor compliance.[3] AiBtl’s MDD candidate, based on Polygala tenuifolia extract, falls under the Botanical NDA pathway.[4] It offers a safer, long-term option with potential neuroprotective effects via NGF-related pathways, positioning it as a differentiated, high-potential out-licensing target.[5]

 ADHD Drug Candidate: The ADHD market is expected to exceed $24 billion by 2032, fueled by increasing diagnoses and demand for innovative treatment solutions.[6] Existing stimulants carry addiction and misuse risks.[7] AiBtl’s ADHD candidate leverages natural, non-stimulant mechanisms for neurological regulation, with strong safety profile and pediatric suitability.[8] This product holds particular appeal in Asia, where parental demand for plant-based alternatives is high.[9]
