 HONG KONG - October 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and co-organised by the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association, the 33rd Hong Kong International Optical Fair will be held from 5 to 7 November 2025 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The fair will bring together more than 660 exhibitors from 19 countries and regions, and present a one-stop showcase of innovative and high-tech eyewear designs and products.

 Jenny Koo, Acting Executive Director of the HKTDC, said: "This year’s Hong Kong International Optical Fair, themed ‘Bright Eyes - New Horizons’, showcases a wide array of products encompassing smart technology, healthcare, senior-oriented designs and sustainable elements. It demonstrates breakthroughs in function and aesthetics, reflecting global eyewear market trends and reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as an international trading hub.”

 Industry development drives new opportunities

 Hong Kong’s total exports of spectacles, lenses and frames reached HK$13.7 billion in the first eight months of 2025. The European Union, the United States, and Chinese Mainland are Hong Kong’s top three export markets respectively, with exports to the mainland surging 23% year-on-year. Despite intense global competition, Hong Kong’s eyewear industry continues to maintain its strengths in design, technology and quality.

 This year’s fair brings together exhibitors from around the world, including first-time participants from Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, alongside representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States across Europe and the Americas; and Japan, Korea, Singapore and Thailand within Asia. The fair will also feature exhibitors from Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Ten group pavilions - including the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association (HKOMA), Chinese Mainland (with delegations from Danyang, Zhejiang and Yingtan), Taiwan, Japan and Korea, as well as “Visionaries of Style” showcasing creative and trendy designs - will showcase international brands and leading local enterprises to demonstrate optical fashions and manufacturing innovation.

 The ASEAN Pavilion will make its debut this year, with an Indonesian exhibitor presenting Halal-certified eyewear products, demonstrating the industry’s awareness of cultural sensitivity and market diversity. The signature “Brand Name Gallery” will feature over 200 international brands which encompass designer eyewear, trendsetting collections and high-technology eyewear and provide buyers with a one-stop sourcing platform.

 Events to showcase industry expertise and creativity

 A series of seminars, eyewear parades and other events will highlight the creative thinking and technological achievements of the optical industry. The 23rd Hong Kong International Optometric Symposium - themed “Age Well, See Well: Redefining Eye Care for the Golden Age” organised by the HKTDC and co-organised by The Hong Kong Optometric Association and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University will be held on 6 November. Sessions will focus on vision care for the ageing community and feature six experts and academics from Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. They will share insights on topics such as age-related visual challenges, diabetic retinopathy, and optometric care for patients with cognitive impairment, and provide attendees with international perspectives and the latest clinical research trends. The symposium is accredited by the Optometrists Board of Hong Kong, and participants attending the full-day conference may be eligible for up to six Continuing Professional Development (CPD) hours.

 The 25th Hong Kong Eyewear Design Competition, co-organised by HKTDC and the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers Association, will present the theme “Blending Tradition and Technology”. It is aimed at fostering local design and manufacturing innovation and will include an Open Group as well as a Student Group. The award presentation will be held on 5 November, and shortlisted entries will be exhibited onsite at Brand Name Gallery (BNG) Rendezvous, Grand Hall during the fair, giving visitors an opportunity to appreciate the creativity and flair of Hong Kong eyewear design.

 The fair will continue to adopt the EXHIBITION+ hybrid model which seamlessly integrates online and offline elements to extend business opportunities. Exhibitors and buyers can connect and arrange meetings through the Click2Match online smart business-matching platform until 14 November. During the physical event, buyers can also use the Scan2Match function on the HKTDC Marketplace App to scan exhibitors’ QR codes to bookmark favourite suppliers, access product details and interactive floor plans, and make product enquiries - enabling engagement with exhibitors before and after the fair to continue their sourcing journey.
