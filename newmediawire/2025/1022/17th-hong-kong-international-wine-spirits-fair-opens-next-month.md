 HONG KONG - October 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The 17th edition of the Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair (the Wine & Spirits Fair), organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), will be held on 6-8 November at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The event will showcase beer, sake, spirits, wines, low- and non- alcoholic beverages to industry professionals and buyers. This year, 620 exhibitors from 21 countries and regions will participate, with a significant increase in Chinese baijiu exhibitors. The rise of homegrown brands, combined with fine wines from around the world, highlights Hong Kong’s role as a hub for the wine and spirits trade and meets the market’s demand for diverse alcoholic beverages.

 With a growing market demand for spirits and the HKSAR Chief Executive’s announcement in last year’s Policy Address regarding the reduction in liquor duty, Hong Kong continues to strengthen its role as an international trade platform, helping spirits brands go global.

 Jenny Koo, Deputy Executive Director of HKTDC, said: “The reduction of duty on high end liquor had a positive impact on the industry and encouraged diversified development in the spirits market. At this year’s Wine & Spirits Fair, there is a new World of Spirits zone where buyers and visitors can explore the rich variety of flavours of spirits from around the world. Some 20 activities will further promote the diverse development of the spirits market.”

 Strong exhibitor line-up with global selections

 Exhibitors represent Hong Kong and various provinces and cities on the Chinese Mainland, including Fujian, Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang (Zhuji) as well as Taiwan. International exhibitors include those from Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Czechia, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain and the United States.

 The inaugural “World of Spirits” zone features spirits from 13 countries and regions, including Chinese baijiu, brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka and whisky.

Wuliangye and Yanghe demonstrate the trend of integrating innovative technologies into the baijiu industry, aiming for younger and more diverse markets, injecting new energy into the sector.

 With rising demand for low-alcohol beverages, Punch Club OÜ, an Estonian craft cocktail brand, specialises in organic, low-sugar, ready-to-drink cocktails for health-conscious consumers.

 The Wine & Spirits Fair also features the “Friends of Wine” zone, which showcases gourmet foods designed to complement alcoholic beverages.
