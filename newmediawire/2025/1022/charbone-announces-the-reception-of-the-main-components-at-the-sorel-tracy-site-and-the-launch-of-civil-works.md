# CHARBONE Announces the Reception of the Main Components at the Sorel-Tracy Site and the Launch of Civil Works

BROSSARD, QUEBEC - October 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CHARBONE CORPORATION (TSXV: CH; OTCQB: CHHYF; FSE: K47) (“CHARBONE” or the “Company”), a North American producer and distributor specializing in clean Ultra High Purity (“UHP”) hydrogen and strategic industrial gases, is pleased to announce the safe and incident-free reception of all major components of its production equipment at the Sorel-Tracy site.

 This delivery marks a decisive step in the progress of the project: the mobilization of the site teams will continue this week to allow the official launch of civil works on Monday, October 27, 2025, the first phase of operations leading to the complete reinstallation of the equipment, connection and commissioning scheduled for November 2025.

 This step is a continuation of the strategic transaction announced on October 7, 2025, through which CHARBONE secured hydrogen production assets. This acquisition allows the Company to significantly reduce its capital costs, while accelerating its time to market through the integration of already proven and efficient equipment.
