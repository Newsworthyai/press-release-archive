# BetterLife Pharma Appoints Doug Drysdale as Corporate Advisor

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, - October 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BetterLife Pharma Inc. (“BetterLife” or the “Company”) (CSE: BETR / OTCQB : BETRF / FRA: NPAU), an emerging biotech company, has announced that it has appointed Doug Drysdale, former CEO of Cybin Inc. (“Cybin”) as Corporate Advisor to advance BetterLife’s product BETR-001’s non psychiatric indications with focus on cluster headache and migraine.

 At Cybin, Mr. Drysdale led the company’s strategy and team build-out, taking it from molecule inception to Phase 3 trials in just three years. Mr. Drysdale is known as a vocal advocate for revolutionizing mental healthcare through numerous speaking engagements, panel participations, and media interviews.

 Earlier in his career, as Founding CEO of Alvogen, Mr. Drysdale grew the company from inception to $500 million in revenues across 35 countries in 5.5 years, establishing research and development (“R&D”) in New Jersey, a CRO in India, and a 50-product U.S. pipeline. In 2008, he transformed Norwich Pharmaceuticals, enhancing its manufacturing and R&D. In 2014, as Chairman and CEO of Pernix Therapeutics, Mr. Drysdale recapitalized the company with $65 million, rebuilt its leadership, and grew its enterprise value from $80 million to $800 million, raising $465 million to support the turnaround. From 2017–2020, as CEO of Tedor Pharma, he achieved 60% revenue growth in 2019, landing it on the 2020 Inc 5000 list.

 Dr. Ahmad Doroudian, CEO of BetterLife, commented, “We are excited to welcome Doug to our advisory team. He is a globally recognized leader and strategist with over 35 years experience delivering multiple successful transactions in various different markets and indications. We look forward to working with Doug to develop BETR-001 for treatment of cluster headache, migraine and neuropathic pain. BETR-001 is BetterLife’s patented stereoisomer of 2-bromo-LSD, a non-hallucinogenic derivative of LSD. Previous forms of 2-bromo-LSD have been shown to be non-hallucinogenic, safe and tolerable in man, and in a small clinical study, to cause meaningful reduction in cluster headache frequency (Karst et al, Cephalgia 2010).

 About BetterLife Pharma

 BetterLife Pharma Inc. is an emerging biotechnology company primarily focused on developing and commercializing BETR-001 to treat various neurological disorders. BETR-001, which is in preclinical and IND-enabling studies, is a non-hallucinogenic and non-controlled LSD derivative in development and it is unique in that it is unregulated and therefore can be self-administered. BetterLife’s synthesis patent for BETR-001 eliminates regulatory hurdles and its pending patent, for composition and method of use, covers treatment of various neurological disorders, until around 2042.

 BetterLife also owns a drug candidate for the treatment of viral infections and is in the process of seeking strategic alternatives for further development.
