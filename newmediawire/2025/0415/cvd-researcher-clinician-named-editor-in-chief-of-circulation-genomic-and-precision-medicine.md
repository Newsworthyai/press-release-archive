# CVD researcher/clinician named Editor-in-Chief of Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine

(NewMediaWire) - April 15, 2025 - DALLAS — Ferhaan Ahmad, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, is the new editor-in-chief of Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine, a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Heart Association, effective with the journal’s April issue, published today. Ahmad is the founding director of the Cardiovascular Genomics Program and associate professor of internal medicine-cardiovascular medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City, Iowa. He takes the helm leading Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine from Kiran Musunuru, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H, FAHA, who served as interim editor-in-chief since April 2024.

 “Dr. Ahmad’s extensive cardiology expertise and leadership in the field of cardiovascular genomics, his commitment to innovation and drive for scientific advances will guide Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine to new heights as the specialty continues to evolve,” said Eldrin F. Lewis, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, volunteer chair of the American Heart Association’s Scientific Publishing Committee, which oversees the Association’s 14 peer-reviewed scientific journals. Lewis is the Simon H. Stertzer, M.D., Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University in Stanford, California.

 Ahmad most recently served as an associate editor and senior associate editor of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) for the past 10 years. He stepped down from JAHA to assume his new role with Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine. “Thank you to Dr. Ahmad for his integral role in advancing JAHA’s impact and reputation for scientific excellence over the last decade,” said Lewis.

 Ahmad’s additional roles at the University of Iowa include associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics, associate professor of radiology and director of the Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship Training Program. He also leads a laboratory conducting basic and translational research into the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying inherited cardiovascular disorders, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, glycogen storage cardiomyopathy, inherited arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension, and the mechanisms by which the SGLT1 protein contributes to heritable and acquired heart failure. Ahmad’s clinical expertise includes coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and other inherited cardiovascular conditions, and he continues to mentor countless postdoctoral fellows and medical, graduate and undergraduate students.

 “Cardiovascular genetics combined with genomics is a quickly evolving field that is highly dependent on the contributions of many professionals from various disciplines, and advances are emerging quickly,” said Ahmad. “In my new role as editor-in-chief, I am excited to build on the journal’s success while elevating the inclusion of studies that advance implementation science, community-engaged/community-based participatory research, as well as papers highlighting equitable health and social drivers of health. These are critical areas to understanding the genetic and genomic basis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Translating these findings to practice is key to improving care and outcomes for patients,” said Ahmad.

 Ahmad also plans to champion initiatives that strengthen the journal’s position within the specialty, such as:

 * encouraging dialogue and collaborative engagement in emerging areas of cardiovascular science and genomic medicine that accelerate progress;
* broadening the journal’s published research to include physicians and scientists in other specialties, other health care professionals, early career professionals and those from communities under-represented in the sciences;
* incorporating perspectives from patients and families to foster well-rounded scientific dialogue and approaches; and
* increasing representation within the editorial team to include professionals outside the United States.

 Ahmad earned his doctor of medicine degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, followed by postgraduate clinical training at McGill University, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. He subsequently earned a Ph.D. in human genetics from Baylor College of Medicine and completed a Howard Hughes Medical Institute postdoctoral fellowship in mouse genetics at Harvard Medical School.

 In addition to his role with JAHA, Ahmad has served in several leadership roles in the American Heart Association’s Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and the Committee for Scientific Sessions Programming. He also serves on the Association’s Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Science Advisory Group.

 Ahmad has received numerous research grants and is active in several clinical trials of novel therapies for heritable cardiomyopathies. He has co-authored more than 60 published, peer-reviewed research articles including serving as the chair of the writing group for the 2019 American Heart Association Scientific Statement, "Establishment of Specialized Clinical Cardiovascular Genetics Programs: Recognizing the Need and Meeting Standards.” He also authored the chapter on cardiovascular genetics in the American College of Cardiology Self-Assessment Program (ACCSAP).

 Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine, which launched in 2008, is the leading scientific journal for original research detailing mechanistic, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic advances in genetics and genomics, including studies in human subjects, laboratory animals, in vitro and in silico, focused on relevance to human cardiovascular biology and disease. Areas of interest include investigations of clinical genetics as applied to cardiovascular disorders, the molecular basis of complex cardiovascular disorders, and novel applications of precision medicine. The online-only journal publishes six issues per year, and accepted articles are published online ahead of issue.

 Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine is part of the American Heart Association’s portfolio of 14 peer-reviewed scientific journals: Circulation; Stroke; Hypertension; Journal of the American Heart Association; Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology; Circulation Research; Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology; Circulation: Heart Failure; Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging; Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions; Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes; Stroke: Vascular and Interventional Neurology; and Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases. Each journal is editorially independent of one another and the Association in support of open dialogue and discourse, which are essential to the dynamic nature of scientific discovery. Editors-in-chief are selected by the Association’s volunteer-led Scientific Publishing Committee, and each editor-in-chief assembles and manages the editorial board, vision and strategy for their journal. The Association is the publisher of the journals; however, the Association has no oversight on the science content published.

 Studies published in the American Heart Association’s scientific journals are peer-reviewed. The statements and conclusions in each manuscript are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect the Association’s policy or position. The Association makes no representation or guarantee as to their accuracy or reliability.
