# Jaguars Foundation Provide CPR Resources to 12 Duval County Public Schools

(NewMediaWire) - April 15, 2025 - Jacksonville, Fla. — In a train the trainer format, staff from a dozen Duval County, Florida public schools are prepared to bring the lifesaving skill of CPR back to their campuses so faculty, staff and coaches can be ready to save a life. The American Heart Association and the Jaguars Foundation gathered representatives from 12 local schools for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training on April 10 at Mandarin Oaks Elementary School in Jacksonville, Fl. According to American Heart Association data, nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with Jacksonville Jaguars is helping to support that critical link in the community,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “We know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 The Duval County Public Schools receiving CPR in Schools kits are:

 * Andrew Robinson Elementary School
* Biscayne Elementary School
* Central Riverside Elementary School
* Chets Creek Elementary School
* Chimney Lakes Elementary School
* Crystal Springs Elementary School
* Enterprise Elementary School
* G.W. Carver Elementary School
* Jacksonville Heights Elementary
* Mandarin Oaks Elementary School
* Oceanway Elementary School
* Rufus Payne Elementary School

 In addition to the training, the Jacksonville Jaguars are donating resources for schools to bring these lifesaving skills back to their campuses to continue to build confidence and capabilities to respond in a cardiac emergency. Each of the 12 schools received a CPR in Schools kit and three of the schools attending received an AED. The CPR in Schools kits include 10 Hands-Only CPR manikins and 10 AED training tools and curriculum to train additional students, faculty, staff and parents. The attending representatives learned the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use their new resources.

 “Ensuring the safety of young athletes is central to the Jaguars Foundation’s mission of fostering youth development through sports,” said Michael Carnahan, Jaguars senior manager of community impact. “Through our partnership with the American Heart Association, the Jaguars are proud to contribute resources and hands-on training opportunities to help ensure that everyone in the Jacksonville region — especially those involved in youth sports — has the knowledge and practical skills to save lives.”

 In 2023, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.
