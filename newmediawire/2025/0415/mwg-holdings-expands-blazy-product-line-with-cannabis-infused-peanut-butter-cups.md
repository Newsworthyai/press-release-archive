"Featuring Blazy’s brand new product for this year’s 4/19 and 4/20 sale highlights Blazy's rapid sales growth, solidifying its position as a top 10 brand on shelf at Perfect Union. Consumer demand for this fun, cheeky brand continues to fuel our expansion of product offerings. With Blazy heating up, we recently launched Ask Blazy, an AI-powered site that dishes out answers with the same flavor and fun as the brand itself.”

 The new Blazy cannabis-infused chocolate peanut butter cups deliver a high-quality, gourmet-tasting edible experience, catering to guests seeking precise dosing or smokeless consumption. With 4/20 approaching, this launch aligns perfectly with customer demand for premium edibles.

Designed for both taste and precision, each package includes a dosing wheel for easy portioning into 10-milligram servings, ensuring a customizable experience for every consumer.
