# Golden Cariboo Resources Intersects New Visible Gold Mineralization at Halo Zone

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 15, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE:GCC) (OTC:GCCFF) (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ) announces that the current drill hole QGQ24-21 on the Halo zone at the Quesnelle Gold Quartz property (“the Project”),  intersected a zone of strong persistent gold mineralization including multiple occurrences of visible gold (“VG”) starting from 257 m (843.2 ft) downhole. This makes the current drillhole the ninth consecutive hole with visible gold since the initial discovery of the Halo zone in July, 2024 (July 18, 2024 News Release).

 Similar to mineralization intersected in previous drilling at Halo zone, the visible gold was found in a stockwork of quartz-carbonate-pyrite veins hosted in an intensely sericite and iron-carbonate altered greenstone package of intermediate to mafic volcanics (see pictures at https://goldencariboo.com/latest-news). QGQ24-21 drilled 257 m (843.2 ft) of carbonaceous argillites in the hanging wall before intersecting the greenstones. The mineralization, similar to that in the previous drill hole QGQ24-20, lies in close spatial relation with shear zones at the contact (February 25, 2025 News Release).

 Drill hole QGQ24-21 was set up at an azimuth of 355° and inclination of -45° to intersect veins of several different directions and lithological contacts at favourable angles. It was started in December 2024 and now continues in April 2025, currently underway at 285.3 m (936 ft) without intersecting the lower boundary of the mineralized zone.

 Golden Cariboo’s President and CEO, Frank Callaghan, stated, “Building on the success of last year’s exceptional discovery at our Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property, the whole crew couldn’t wait to resume drilling in 2025. To kick off with yet another strike of visible gold is nothing short of thrilling. It’s the perfect start into what we believe will be a standout season. We are looking forward to more fantastic intercepts as we keep expanding our Halo Zone discovery along strike and towards depth.”

 Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. is rediscovering the Cariboo Gold Rush by proceeding with highly targeted drilling and trenching programs on its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property, which is bordered by Osisko Development Corp. and partly intertwined at the north end of the Cariboo Gold Project, and located along a favorable corridor adjacent to the Spanish and Eureka thrust faults over a 94,889 hectare (234,501 acre) area. Historically, over 101 placer gold creeks on the 90 km (56 mile) trend from the Cariboo Hudson mine north to the Project have recorded production and successful placer mining continues to this day.

 Golden Cariboo’s Project is 4 km (2.5 miles) northeast of, and road accessible from, Hixon in central British Columbia. It includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 in conjunction with placer mining activities. Hixon Creek, which dissects the old workings, is a placer creek which has seen small-scale placer production since the mid 1860s.
