# ProtoSpace Mfg Named Title Sponsor of 2025 Canadian International Rover Challenge

Empowering the Next Generation of Planetary Robotics Engineers With Hands-On Support and Manufacturing Resources

 SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - August 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ProtoSpace Mfg, the advanced manufacturing division for aerospace and defense of the Protocase Companies, is proud to announce its title sponsorship of the 2025 Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC), an international university-level robotics competition simulating real-world Mars exploration challenges.

 Held August 8–11 in the strikingly Mars-like badlands of Drumheller, Alberta, CIRC brings together top engineering students from around the world - Canada, the United States, Poland, and beyond - to test their custom-built planetary rovers in a rigorous series of terrain, dexterity, and environmental analysis tasks. Now celebrating its ninth year, the event is organized by the Canadian Space Technology Advancement Group (CSTAG), a not-for-profit formed by alumni of the University of Saskatchewan’s Space Design Team.

 As 2025 Title Sponsor, ProtoSpace Mfg is providing meaningful, hands-on support to student innovators at every stage of the competition:

 * $2,000 USD in manufacturing credit for every CIRC-registered team to fabricate custom enclosures, panels, and components for their rovers or support infrastructure
* Precision-manufactured equipment for one of the competition’s most demanding tasks: the Arm Dexterity challenge
* On-the-ground support from ProtoSpace Mfg staff, including account manager Louise Viva and engineering lead Sam Maxwell, who will be onsite throughout the event to offer technical guidance and connect with students
* Ongoing mentorship and encouragement to push the boundaries of design thinking, fabrication, and systems integration

 The CIRC’s unique multi-day format includes robotic navigation, sample collection, excavation, autonomous and manual control trials, and the only nighttime rover challenge of its kind: the rugged overnight “Traversal.” In a demanding environment that mimics the surface of Mars, participants must account for strict weight limits, weather variability, and autonomy standards while ensuring their rovers perform mission-critical tasks under pressure.

 “For us, supporting the Canadian International Rover Challenge isn’t just about manufacturing parts, it’s about manufacturing opportunity,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, Chairman of the Protocase Companies. “We want students to go beyond theoretical knowledge and gain real-world experience designing, building, and iterating at the edge of what’s possible. CIRC represents exactly the kind of bold, imaginative engineering we believe in at ProtoSpace Mfg.”

 In addition to ProtoSpace Mfg, sponsors of the 2025 event include Nordspace and Birchcliff Energy, helping to ensure the continued growth of Canada’s most compelling space engineering challenge. With its roots in student-led innovation and a legacy of global participation, CIRC is not just preparing future space scientists, it’s giving them the tools, resources, and mentorship to lead.
