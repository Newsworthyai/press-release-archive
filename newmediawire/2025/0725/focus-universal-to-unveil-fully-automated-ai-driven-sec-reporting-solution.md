# Focus Universal to Unveil Fully Automated AI-Driven SEC Reporting Solution

ONTARIO, CA - July 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Focus Universal Inc. (NASDAQ: FCUV) (“Focus” or the “Company”), a provider of patented hardware and software design technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and SEC Financial Reporting proprietary AI-Driven Automation Software, is pleased to unveil its fully automated SEC reporting solution in comparison to competing products. The Company also plans to launch a technology-focused roadshow to showcase their groundbreaking platform. Interested clients, partners, corporate filers, and investors are invited to contact Focus Universal directly at info@focusuniversal.com or ir@focusuniversal.com for meetings and product demonstrations.

 A Breakthrough in SEC Financial Reporting

 SEC financial reporting has traditionally been a complex, costly, and time-intensive process, often involving:

 * Preparation of consolidated financial statements,
* Drafting of SEC reports using Microsoft Word and Excel,
* Converting documents into SEC-compliant HTML (edgarization), and
* Embedding XBRL tags for regulatory filing.

 This multi-step process can take thousands of person-days for large organizations, and several weeks even for small public companies. Delays can lead to SEC reviews, enforcement actions, and significant penalties.

 While some companies, including multi-billion-dollar market cap firms - offer semi-automated solutions that cover only parts of this process, Focus Universal has developed a fully automated, end-to-end solution powered entirely by AI.

 One-Click, End-to-End Automation

 With just a single click, Focus Universal’s software can:

 * Retrieve financial data directly from accounting platforms, such as Oracle and QuickBooks,
* Reformat and consolidate data in Excel,
* Automatically generate consolidated financial statements,
* Populate Word documents for SEC filings,
* Convert reports into SEC-compliant HTML through edgarization, and
* Embed accurate XBRL tags - without human intervention.

 The software also features built-in validation checks for internal consistency and XBRL compliance, virtually eliminating the risk of human error. What used to take weeks of manual work can now be completed in minutes.

 “I’m incredibly proud of our team’s achievement,” said Desheng Wang, CEO of Focus Universal. “This milestone represents a new era in SEC financial reporting. When turnaround time is reduced to just minutes, reporting is no longer a burden. Our software allows computers to handle the most tedious, repetitive tasks, freeing humans to focus on creative and strategic work.”

 Unlike Focus’ competitors, who typically require 2–3 weeks for initial setup, Focus’ software is ready to use immediately - no setup needed. For regular, repeat filers, preparing an SEC financial report can take up to a week, not including the time required to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Focus’ solution reduces that entire process - including consolidation - from weeks to minutes. When factoring in consolidation time, Focus’ software is even more significantly faster than competing products.

 For first-time filers, competing solutions still require a largely manual process due to the lack of roll-forward data from prior reports. In contrast, Focus’ software delivers nearly the same level of efficiency for first-time filers as it does for repeat filers - because it doesn’t rely on prior data to function.

 First-time users can focus entirely on the content of their filings. Consolidated financial statements and footnotes are seamlessly transferred into a Word document, and once the content is complete, Focus’ software automatically performs edgarization and applies XBRL tagging - all without manual intervention. The software is intuitive, ready to use out of the box, and designed for immediate productivity.

 Focus’ solution is a single-click solution. While competitors may require several days of training and hundreds of tutorial videos, Focus’ software is intuitive and can be used effectively with little to no learning time and no need for extensive training.

 Focus’ software isn’t just for reporting companies - filing agents can also use it to dramatically accelerate the edgarization and XBRL tagging process, which are key components of SEC financial reporting.

 Thanks to its simplicity and efficiency, many reporting companies can handle a significant portion of their SEC compliance filings in-house, reducing their reliance on third-party providers. This shift can result in substantial cost savings. By eliminating manual data entry, Focus’ software removes the risk of human typing errors throughout the SEC reporting process, significantly reducing the need for time-consuming proofreading and review.

 Any updates made to the consolidated financial statements are instantly reflected throughout the entire SEC report, including XBRL tagging. This eliminates the risk of errors during manual updates and enables reporting companies to respond to auditor comments quickly and confidently.The more complex the SEC financial reporting task, the greater the efficiency advantage of the Focus software over competing products. Large reporting companies often require teams of professionals working together for up to a week to complete a single filing. The actual effort involved is the combined time of multiple individuals. In contrast, Focus’ software product requires only a single user to complete the entire process - often in just minutes. When factoring in total labor hours, the Company believes platform is not just faster - it is multiples faster for large organizations. As a result, complexity increases, so does the Focus performance advantage.

 According to recent industry analysis, the Financial Reporting Software Market was valued at US $13.9 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to US $36.6 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.8%. The surge is driven by the increasing complexity of financial data, the high cost of compliance, and the need for scalable, efficient, and intelligent reporting tools. Focus believes this innovation does not replace the SEC-required review process but removes much of the labor-intensive, manual work, dramatically cutting preparation and revision time for public companies. As mentioned, Focus Universal cordially invites investors, industry experts, and public companies to explore potential collaborations or schedule a live demonstration during the upcoming roadshow.
