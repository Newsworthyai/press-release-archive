HONG KONG - September 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Galaxy Payroll Group Limited (Nasdaq: GLXG) ("Galaxy" or the "Company"), a leading global payroll provider, today announced that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq").

 On March 17, 2025, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff, informing the Company that its ordinary shares had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the previous 30 consecutive business days as required by the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

 Since then, the Company has taken active measures to address this issue and has successfully regained compliance. Specifically, for the last 10 consecutive business days, from September 8 through September 19, 2025, the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares has been at $1.00 per share or greater.
