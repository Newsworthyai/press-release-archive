# NRx Pharmaceuticals (NRXP) Receives FDA Approval of Suitability Petition for Preservative-Free Ketamine Product

LOS ANGELES, CA - September 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted its Suitability Petition for KETAFREE(TM), a planned single-patient, preservative-free ketamine product. Unlike current ketamine offerings in multi-dose vials containing the toxic preservative Benzethonium Chloride, KETAFREE(TM) is designed to eliminate such additives. The approval enables immediate re-filing of the Company’s Abbreviated New Drug Application. NRx noted the product supports federal priorities of re-shoring sterile drug manufacturing and removing harmful preservatives, with the ketamine market estimated at $750 million. The Company is also advancing NRX-100, a non-generic ketamine formulation under development for suicidal depression and PTSD.
