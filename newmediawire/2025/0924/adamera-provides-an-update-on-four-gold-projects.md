# Adamera Provides an Update on Four Gold Projects

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Adamera Minerals Corp. (TSX-V: ADZ; OTC: DDNFF) ("Adamera" or the "Company") provides a summary of its gold projects in Washington State and British Columbia. Over the past 12 years the Company has conducted grassroots exploration on numerous projects and has assembled a portfolio of properties in proven gold districts.

 Highlights

 - South Hedley Gold (BC): skarn related and vein-hosted gold potential in an underexplored portion of a district with a significant production history.

 - Flag Hill and Flag Hill South Gold (Washington): Recent drilling of gold-silver epithermal veins within a significant past producing camp.

 - Empire Creek Gold (Washington): Drill ready epithermal targets near past producing mines.

 - Buckhorn 2.0 (Washington): A large land position surrounding the high-grade Buckhorn Mine. Massive database defines multiple skarn-hosted gold-copper targets.

 “Over the past decade, Adamera has focused on grassroots exploration to define drill targets. Drilling follow up has been limited due to funding limitations. Many compelling targets are drill-ready such that Adamera can offer a balanced mix of both grassroots and brownfield discoveries in established mining jurisdictions,” says Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO.

 South Hedley Property (British Columbia)

 The 18,714-hectare property covers prospective ground south of Hedley, a district with a long history of mining high-grade skarn-hosted gold deposits. Adamera’s work has established that South Hedley hosts multiple structural corridors containing skarn-related and quartz-carbonate vein occurrences, some of which are similar to those at the Mascot mine and Barrick Gold Corp’s historic Nickel Plate mines (reported production +2.5 million ounces of gold.) (1) Successive field campaigns are discovering new gold occurrences and alteration/structural trends devoid of any evidence of past exploration.

 Through systematic soil and rock sampling and prospecting, the Company has outlined several areas with gold potential. Most recently, as a result of detailed follow up of previous results, Adamera has identified and advanced the Max and Glix prospects. The quality and scale of these prospects coupled with known historic production in the district suggests potential for Nickel Plate and Mascot Mine style mineralization.

 The Max Prospect (see News Releases August 7 and 14, 2025) was originally identified by a reconnaissance soil sample containing 1340 ppb gold that was collected by the Company and analyzed by fire assay at Activation Laboratory. Since verification of the gold content at this sample site using the detectORE(TM) method, the prospect has been expanded significantly and is now defined by a zone with highly anomalous gold, copper and arsenic in soil and rock samples. The Max Prospect is exposed in an area that is topographically below an extensive younger rock unit that appears to obscure any geochemical signs of mineralization in this area. The prospect is underlain by a partially coincident discrete 500 m long magnetic target. The top of the target is estimated to lie at a depth of about 30 to 50m. There is no evidence of previous exploration activity at this site. The Company is currently initiating permits for drilling.

 The Glix Prospect (see News Release September 4 and 16, 2025) is located 15 kilometres (“km”) from the Max Prospect. It was originally identified by widely spaced regional sampling conducted by Adamera. Soil samples with 25 and 45 ppb gold determined by fire assay by Activation Laboratory were followed up using the detectORE(TM) method of analysis. Several low-level gold values were confirmed in the area with one soil sample of 419 ppb*. Follow up sampling has defined a coherent zone with soil and rock samples consistently anomalous in gold, arsenic and zinc. Highly anomalous soil and rock samples ranging from 100 to 4,282 ppb* gold elevate the anomaly to a high priority status. There is no evidence of previous exploration activity immediately over the site, the nearest known previous work which was conducted in the 1990s is more than 200m to the north.

 As Glix is a very recent geochemical discovery, no geophysical data has yet been collected over the area to assist with targeting. The Company is initiating permitting for drilling. While the permitting process is underway, Adamera is planning to conduct ground magnetic and VLF-EM surveying and additional soil sampling and prospecting beyond the immediate Glix Prospect area.

 Flag Hill South and Flag Hill Property (Washington State)

 The Flag Hill and Flag Hill South Gold-Silver Properties are situated in the Republic Gold District and are considered part of a larger epithermal gold-silver vein system. An area 1 to 2 km to the north was mined mainly by Hecla Mining. This camp is estimated to have produced more than 2.8 million ounces of gold and more than 15 million ounces of silver. (2)

 Drilling by Adamera on Flag Hill South in late 2024 intersected epithermal veins at shallow depths with zones containing 3.0 g/t gold and 70 g/t silver over 2m intervals (see News Release Dated February 27, 2025). Only three short holes were drilled from two closely spaced sites. The holes strongly suggest vein thickness and gold-silver grades increase with depth and to the south.

 Combined ground magnetic data and surface soil geochemistry demonstrate potential for numerous untested veins on the property. In addition, a pronounced magnetic anomaly at depth may represent an intrusive centre driving mineralization. The Company is planning to drill several deeper holes later in 2025 to test the veins intersected in 2024 at greater depth, including the deep broad magnetic feature. Several magnetic features with coincident gold and/or silver soil anomalies are interpreted to be veins.

 Empire Creek Property (Washington State)

 The Empire Creek Property is located on the same structural corridor as the historic K2 and Granny Mines (3) approximately 6 km to the north. These mines were initially operated by Echo Bay and later by Kinross Gold Corp. Recent exploration by Kinross at the K2 site has resulted in discovery zones of high-grade epithermal gold mineralization.

 At the Empire Creek project, historic drilling intercepted 10.5 g/t gold and 183.3 g/t silver over 15.24m starting at a depth of 54m. The prospect is within 1 km of the Republic graben margin. Adamera has conducted several geophysical and geochemical surveys on the property and through surface prospecting and shallow trenching and drilling has developed multiple exploration targets. The property is drill-ready.

 Buckhorn 2.0 Property (Washington State)

 The Buckhorn 2.0 Property is a key project for the company. The property encompasses a large land package surrounding Kinross Gold Corp’s past producing Buckhorn Mine (4). Existing infrastructure in the district associated with the former mine includes haul roads, power transmission lines and a nearby mill for processing ore.

 Adamera acquired the surrounding lands to explore for satellite discoveries suggested by a large historic database.

 In addition to the large database, Adamera has completed several high value geophysical surveys and geochemical prospecting programs on the property. More than 30 exploration targets have been modeled based on geological characteristics of the Buckhorn Mine. That mine developed a structurally controlled skarn/carbonate replacement gold system.

 To date, Adamera has only tested 4 of 40 targets on the property. Shallow zones of gold mineralization have been intersected but not yet followed up. This project is drill ready.

 *Soil samples were analyzed in-house using the detectORE(TM) method for gold, a proprietary process developed by Portable PPB in Australia that allows for rapid gold analysis at ppb levels using a pXRF. The method uses a rigorous QA/QC process whereby a standard rock sample of known gold content is inserted every 30 to 45 samples at the preparation step. This sample is later analysed by the pXRF along with additional control samples that are tested every 20 analyses. The pXRF is fully automated and can analyse up to 180 samples per run. Each sample run using the pXRF is initiated by testing 5 control samples, if any samples do not pass the standard’s specifications, the XRF is immediately calibrated. Samples analyzed using the detectORE(TM) method report gold content in detectORE units which represents a calculated ppb value. Selected samples may be followed up with fire-assay as a means of calibrating the detectORE(TM) results, therefore the Company considers detectORE(TM) gold results to be a semi-quantitative providing highly effective exploration advantage. The gold content of the discovery soil sample with 419 ppb* gold was a direct follow up of widely spaced soil samples with 25 to 45 ppb gold determined by fire assay of a 30-gram sample with atomic absorption finish at the Activation Laboratory in Kamloops.

 Historic data used by the Company has not been verified; however, it appears to be of acceptable quality consistent with the time period during which it was collected.
