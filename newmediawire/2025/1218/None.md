# With Deals And Contracts In Place, Birchtech Makes A Splash With Its Water Business

By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - December 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Birchtech Corp. (OTC: BCHT), the clean tech company focused on sustainable air and water treatment, is open for business when it comes to taking contaminants out of America’s water supply.

 After three years of hard work and innovation, Birchtech’s water treatment solutions business is up and running with purchase orders totaling $0.9 million from a mid-Atlantic power utility. The company also inked a deal with Civil & Environmental Consultants Inc. (CEC) to provide testing to its utility customers and said it has a pipeline full of potential water treatment solutions projects with utilities.

 A Need To Fill

 Birchtech’s entrance into the water treatment industry comes at a time when water utilities are in need of more effective and cheaper ways to remove contaminants from water sources. That’s particularly true of the ones found to be harmful, including so-called “forever chemicals” like PFAS. These contaminants are linked to low birth rates, increased cancer risks and high blood pressure in pregnant women, among many other things.

 As a result, Environmental Protection Agency regulations now require water to be treated for these chemicals. By 2027, public water systems are required to begin monitoring for "forever chemicals," and by 2029, Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) limits must be in place. The Federal government has allocated $1 billion in federal funding for water monitoring systems.

 These regulations create an addressable market for Birchtech. A big one, according to the company, which says $1.5 billion is spent annually by water utilities to meet the EPA’s water purification standards. Birchtech is standing by to help with its solutions.

 Commercialization Underway

 In its first order of business, Birchtech’s water treatment solutions business is providing the mid-Atlantic utility filtration system media replacement services for the removal of contaminants from wastewater at two locations. Birchtech says its media-agnostic approach enables it to use the best products for the job instead of being limited to a single corporate-sponsored product line. That enables it to keep costs down.

 “The analysis of multiple options, technologies, and media products allows for the selection of the best water treatment solutions that will yield optimal performance and the lowest cost for our utility customers,” said John Pavlish, Birchtech’s Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer.

 Then there’s its deal with CEC, a national engineering and environmental consulting firm, to provide Rapid Small-Scale Column Testing (RSSCT) for CEC water utility customers at its 34 offices nationwide. RSSCT is a specialized testing methodology that simulates full-scale filter bed conditions in a fraction of the time, enabling utilities to make decisions on granular activated carbon performance and devise compliance strategies quickly, reports the company.

 Quicker, Cheaper With Lab Testing

 Birchtech said it will provide RSSCTs for CEC’s water utility customers at its Analytical Design Center in Grand Forks, ND. That facility provides utilities and industries with comprehensive testing, analysis and expert guidance to tackle complex water treatment challenges. Birchtech says it can do it at a speed and cost that is unmatched by rival RSSCT labs in the U.S.

 “This collaboration is also a critical step for our ‘Clean Water’ business, providing a specialized test to CEC’s water utility customers, both large and small,” said Richard MacPherson, CEO of Birchtech. “We currently have numerous potential water treatment solutions projects with utilities in our pipeline and many of these utilities currently work with CEC. I look forward to continued expansion of our water treatment technologies across this industry in the months ahead as we strive to generate sustainable, long-term value for my fellow shareholders.”

 Birchtech is inking deals and signing contracts as it builds its water treatment solutions business. With regulation deadlines nearing and Birchtech’s speed and low costs, its goal to be a key player in keeping the nation’s water clean may just pan out.
