# Forward Industries (FWDI) Enables SEC-Registered Equity to Be Used in DeFi via Solana

LOS ANGELES, CA - December 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FWDI) announced that its SEC-registered shares are now live on the Solana blockchain through Superstate’s Opening Bell platform, marking the first time a public company’s equity can be used directly within decentralized finance, with tokenized FWDI shares available for eligible ex-U.S. holders to post as collateral on Kamino, a leading Solana-based lending protocol. The company said the integration allows investors to borrow stablecoins against their equity while maintaining exposure to FWDI stock, supported by real-time price feeds from Pyth, and distinguishes itself from synthetic tokenized stock models by directly tokenizing Forward’s Class A Common Stock through Superstate, a registered SEC transfer agent. Forward said the collaboration establishes a foundation for expanded onchain equity functionality as regulatory guidance evolves and provides existing shareholders the option to hold their shares on Solana via Superstate’s platform.
