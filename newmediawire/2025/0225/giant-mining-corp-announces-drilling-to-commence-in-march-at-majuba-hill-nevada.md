# Giant Mining Corp. Announces Drilling to Commence in March at Majuba Hill, Nevada

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - February 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”)  is pleased to announce that Big Sky Exploration, LLC (“Big Sky”) will commence drilling on or about March 24th, 2025 for the previously announced diamond core drilling (the “Core Program”) at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper Deposit (“Majuba Hill”), a copper, silver, and gold project located in Pershing County, Nevada.

 The Company plans to drill 4 holes totaling 4,400 feet (1,340 meters) of core drilling within the existing exploration target area. A minimum of 2,600 feet will be completed and the contract does not have a maximum drilling requirement, allowing for flexibility in the execution of the project. If the holes are in mineralization beyond the contemplated 1,100 feet (335 meters) per hole the company has allowed for drilling to continue up to 1,600 feet (487 meters).

 Blue Sky will be using a track mounted LF90D surface diamond coring drill which features a telescopic dump mast making it ideal site conditions at Majuba Hill. The modular layout of components on the drill makes it easy to replace worn components in the field, minimizing downtime, and enabling more flexible usage. The LF90D has a total depth capacity of up to 3,915 feet. (1,193 meters).

 "We now have a firm start date to commence drilling in Majuba Hill, Nevada. We look forward to an exciting 2025 following our best results to date in 2024," said David Greenway, chief executive officer of Giant Mining. "The company is fully funded for an active year of exploration and development drilling and the entire Giant Mining team has a mandate of making 2025 Giant Mining's most productive year yet.”

 This maiden 2025 drill program is a key component of Giant Mining Corp.'s ongoing initiative to advance exploration efforts at Majuba Hill. The planned drill program will target the Southern Breccia Corridor with holes oriented to intersect the high-grade mineralized breccia. Drilling will focus on the deeper portions of the breccia and the extensions of the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings.

 Some of Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location: Nevada – The #1 mining jurisdiction on the planet according to the Fraser Institute

 Project Size: 9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:  The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects.

 History: Historical Producer

 Drilling: 82,614  feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization: The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability: The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed: Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign

 The Company’s flagship asset is the Majuba Hill Copper, Silver, and Gold District, located 156 miles (251 km) from Reno, Nevada. Majuba Hill is situated in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations and has the potential to become one of the next major copper deposits, critical for meeting the increasing need for this red metal.
