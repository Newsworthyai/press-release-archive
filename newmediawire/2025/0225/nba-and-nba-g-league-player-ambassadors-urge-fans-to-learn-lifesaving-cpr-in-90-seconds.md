# NBA and NBA G League Player Ambassadors urge fans to learn lifesaving CPR in 90 seconds

(NewMediaWire) - February 25, 2025 - DALLAS — More than half of people who experience sudden cardiac arrest out of hospital don’t receive immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), contributing to a high death rate. As many as 9 out of 10 people who experience sudden cardiac arrest die[1]. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival. To save more lives, the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, and National Basketball Association/NBA G League players are working to educate about the lifesaving skill.

 More Americans than ever say they are ready to perform CPR in emergencies, according to survey data from the American Heart Association[2]. Recent efforts by the Association and partners like the National Football League have boosted CPR readiness. The percentage of surveyed adults in the U.S. who say they now feel they have the confidence to perform CPR increased from 30% to 35% from 2021 to 2023[3]. As part of American Heart Month which takes place each February, the Association is unveiling the 2025 Nation of Lifesaver NBA/G League Ambassador Class, made up of current NBA and NBA G league players, which will continue to support positive steps in CPR. Ambassadors will support the call to action to learn CPR through public service announcements (PSA) and social media content. These athletes join the NFL Nation of Lifesavers Ambassadors announced last October.

 The American Heart Association launched the Nation of Lifesavers™ movement in 2023 following the sudden cardiac arrest of National Football League player Damar Hamlin on national television during Monday Night Football. As the global leader in resuscitation science, education and training, this campaign has a goal to double survival rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by 2030[4]. With more than 60 years of CPR education experience, the Association publishes the official guidelines for CPR.

 “At the American Heart Association, we are committed to changing the future of health for everyone everywhere. CPR education is crucial to saving lives and improving outcomes in a cardiac emergency,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Together with the NBA and NBA G League ambassador class, we are proud to empower communities to act fast and be ready and able to respond with the lifesaving skill of CPR. It only takes 90 seconds to learn how to save a life.”

 Members of the 2025 NBA and NBA G League Nation of Lifesaver Ambassador Class are:

 * Collin Sexton – Utah Jazz
* Jared Butler – Philadelphia 76ers
* Jeremy Sochan – San Antonio Spurs
* Keita Bates-Diop – NBA player
* Keyontae Johnson – Greensboro Swarm
* Larry Nance Jr.- Atlanta Hawks
* Onyeka Okongwu – Atlanta Hawks
* Robert Williams III – Portland Trail Blazers
* Shake Milton – Los Angeles Lakers

 The American Heart Association is a founding member of the Smart Heart Sports Coalition established by the NFL in 2023. The coalition is advocating for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies that will prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. According to the American Heart Association, as many as 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac outside of a hospital annually, and about 40% of those occur among student-athletes. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes.

 With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. If a teen or adult collapses, witnesses should immediately call 9-1-1 emergency services and begin chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 beats per minute and a depth of approximately two inches. Hands-Only CPR is chest compression-only CPR. It takes just 90 seconds to learn the basics of Hands-Only CPR and save a life Learn CPR today, visit www.heart.org/nation.
