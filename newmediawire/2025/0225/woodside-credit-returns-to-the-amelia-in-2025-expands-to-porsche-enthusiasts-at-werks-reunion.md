# Woodside Credit Returns to The Amelia in 2025, Expands to Porsche Enthusiasts at Werks Reunion

NEWPORT BEACH, CA - February 25, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Woodside Credit, America’s leader in low payment financing, is excited to return as a sponsor of The Amelia, the most prestigious concours event on the East Coast as it celebrates the 30th annual “racer’s concours” in 2025. Attendees can explore Woodside Credit’s purpose-built loan program, which offers loans up to $1,000,000.

 This year, Woodside Credit will showcase a 1933 Packard Standard Eight, a stunning piece of automotive history that embodies the craftsmanship and legacy of pre-war vehicles. As the go-to lender in the collector car space, Woodside Credit will once again have a large presence at The Amelia, engaging with attendees and providing the loan program with the lowest payments in America.

 Expanding Reach to Porsche Enthusiasts at Werks Reunion

 For the first time, Woodside Credit will also exhibit at Werks Reunion Amelia Island, a beloved gathering hosted by the Porsche Club of America (PCA) that brings together enthusiasts celebrating Porsche’s heritage. With judged spots already sold out and registration closed, this highly anticipated gathering is set to showcase some of the finest and most exciting Porsches in the country.

 “The Amelia is a cornerstone event in the collector car world, and we’re thrilled to return,” said Mitch Shatzen, President and COO of Woodside Credit. “At the same time, our presence at Werks Reunion allows us to connect directly with Porsche enthusiasts and reinforce why we’re the go-to lender for these iconic vehicles.”

 The Amelia Concours d’Elegance will showcase 275 historically significant vehicles, while Werks Reunion will celebrate PCA’s 70th anniversary with a remarkable display of Porsche 912 and Targa models.
