 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Cboe Global Markets will host a virtual webinar on Thursday, July 17, from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET, focused on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. Traders and investors wanting to explore the crypto space or enhance their learning will gain insights about the market and what’s shaping the digital asset space today and into the future.

 Nishank Modi, Senior Director of Cboe Labs, and Gianni Di Poce, Analyst at The Mercator LLC, will lead the session, giving investors an up-close look at the digital assets market and Cboe's suite of cryptocurrency products, including trading and data solutions designed to support institutional and retail participation in this growing market.

 Cryptocurrency Market Heating Up

 Ever since President Donald Trump took office, the cryptocurrency market has been heating up. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has hit multiple all-time highs this year - with the most recent one in May - and it's not the only digital coin to see gains.

 Increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrency from the likes of Fidelity, BlackRock, endowments, pension funds and even sovereign wealth funds has contributed to this growth. Other factors driving the market include the introduction of stablecoins – a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, typically the U.S. dollar – more clarity on the regulatory front and growth in decentralized finance or DeFi.

 The White House has signaled its support for cryptocurrency, which has helped the market take off in 2025. President Trump has called for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. Meanwhile, in June, Congress passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act or GENIUS Act, which establishes rules around stablecoins. Mode and Di Poce will explain all this and much more.

 Opportunities Within The Cryptocurrency Market

 The webinar will provide an overview of the current cryptocurrency landscape, recent market movements and regulatory updates as well as provide a deep dive into Cboe’s approach to digital assets and discuss its broad product offering.

 Investors will learn how Cboe’s products work, including its Cash-Settled Bitcoin and Ether Margin Futures, Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index Options (CBTX), Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index Options (MBTX), Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index FLEX Options and Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Investors will also learn how Cboe supports transparency, reliability and innovation in the crypto space, something welcome in an industry that has been marred by scams and fly-by-night exchanges.

 Live Q&A Session

 Capping off the webinar will be a live Q&A session in which attendees can submit questions directly to Mode and Di Poce about the current state of cryptocurrency and Cboe’s broad product offering, why Cboe stands out from the pack and how investors can take advantage of this growing market. Traders and investors will learn what the regulatory environment looks like now and in the future, all with an eye toward managing risk.

 The event is geared toward both veteran cryptocurrency investors as well as those starting out or anyone looking for ways to get in on the cryptocurrency craze – without losing their investment dollars. Click here to register now!
