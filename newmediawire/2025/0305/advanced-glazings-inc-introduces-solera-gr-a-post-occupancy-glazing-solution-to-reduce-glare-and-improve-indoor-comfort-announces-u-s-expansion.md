# Advanced Glazings, Inc. Introduces Solera GR, A Post-Occupancy Glazing Solution to Reduce Glare and Improve Indoor Comfort; Announces U.S. Expansion

WILMINGTON, NC - March 5, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Advanced Glazings, Inc., the leading provider of thermal insulated translucent glazing solutions, today announces the launch of Solera GR(TM), a post-occupancy glazing product designed to mitigate glare and thermal discomfort in buildings. Solera GR(TM) - short for Solera Glare Repair(TM) - offers a practical and cost-effective solution for improving natural light diffusion and energy efficiency in existing structures.

 Product Design and Functionality

 Solera GR(TM) is a single pane of glass that attaches to the interior of any insulated glass unit (IGU) within a curtain wall, storefront, or window frame. The product can be installed without removing the existing glass, making it a convenient option for retrofitting buildings. Unlike traditional window films, Solera GR(TM) is designed for long-term performance and improved light diffusion, reducing glare while maintaining natural daylight.

 By dispersing sunlight more evenly, Solera GR(TM) eliminates the need for traditional blinds, which often remain closed and prevent natural light from entering a space. This results in improved daylight utilization, reduced reliance on artificial lighting, and more stable indoor temperatures. The product also enhances glazing thermal performance by approximately R1, providing a modest improvement in insulation.

 Solera GR(TM) is designed for straightforward installation with minimal disruption to building occupants. It can be implemented during off-hours to avoid interference with normal operations. The product is priced at approximately $22 to $26 per square foot, aligning with the cost of traditional blinds while offering a long-term alternative with reduced maintenance requirements. Additionally, Solera GR(TM) provides privacy benefits without fully obstructing natural light.

 “The launch of Glare Repair(TM) is a game-changer for buildings struggling with glare and thermal discomfort,” said Joe Menchefski, Head of Corporate Sales at Advanced Glazings, Ltd. “By offering a simple yet highly effective post-occupancy glazing solution, we are making it easier than ever for architects and facility managers to enhance comfort and energy efficiency without major renovations.”

 Comparison to Existing Solutions

 Compared to blinds, which require manual adjustment and maintenance, Solera GR(TM) offers a fixed solution that preserves natural daylight while controlling glare. Window films, another common alternative, may degrade over time and are less effective at diffusing light. Solera GR(TM) is designed to address these shortcomings, making it a practical option for architects, facility managers, and building owners seeking to optimize indoor environments.

 Expansion into the U.S. Market

 Advanced Glazings, Inc. has recently expanded its operations into the United States with the establishment of a facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. This location will serve as a sales and distribution hub to support the growing demand for the company’s products across North America. Future plans include the potential development of a manufacturing facility to enhance local production capabilities.

 “Expanding to Wilmington marks an exciting new chapter for Advanced Glazings,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, Chairman and Co-Founder of Advanced Glazings, Ltd. “This expansion allows us to better serve our customers in the U.S. and reinforces our commitment to delivering cutting-edge daylighting solutions that promote healthier, more energy-efficient buildings.”
