# Secure your future and maximize impact: Free webinar on charitable giving strategies

(NewMediaWire) - March 05, 2025 - DALLAS — Many individuals are unaware that strategic charitable giving can provide both financial security and a lasting impact. A free webinar from the American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, will help donors explore how charitable gift annuities (CGA) and qualified charitable distributions (QCD) can maximize giving potential while ensuring a reliable income stream. Research suggests that charitable giving is associated with lower levels of stress and improved well-being, while also providing financial benefits[1]. The event will take place virtually on Wednesday, March 19 at 2 p.m. (EDT) / 1 p.m. (CDT) / 11 a.m. (PDT).

 This interactive webinar will explore the benefits of charitable gift annuities, how they work, and how they can be factored into plans for retirement. Attendees will also gain insights into how to maximize their financial security while supporting causes close to the heart. Featured speakers include Pamela Leonard, CFRE, CAP®, CGPP, national executive lead of charitable estate planning, and Andrew Fussner, Esq., national vice president of estate settlement for the American Heart Association. Participants will have the opportunity to ask the experts questions and receive complimentary resources to help with plans, including a personalized illustration of potential benefits of charitable giving.

 “Planned giving offers a unique opportunity to secure your financial future while creating a lasting legacy for the causes that matter most,” said Marsha Jones, American Heart Association volunteer board chair and retired financial executive for The PNC Financial Services Group. “This webinar will provide essential knowledge to help individuals maximize their giving potential while ensuring long-term financial stability for themselves and their loved ones.”

 According to the American Heart Association’s 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. The Association remains relentlessly focused on saving and improving lives through groundbreaking scientific research, public health and public policy education. Planned giving can have a remarkable impact on saving lives. Donations contributed from planned gifts allow the Association to support the organization’s 2028 Impact Goal which will drive breakthroughs and implement proven solutions in science, policy and care for healthier people and communities. American Heart Association donors who choose to give a legacy gift through charitable financial planning are recognized for their leadership as members of the Paul Dudley White Legacy Circle within the Cor Vitae Society. The group was named in honor of one of the American Heart Association founders who today is widely regarded as the father of preventative cardiology. Dr. White’s vision of a world with better research, treatment and education helped the Association emerge as the world-renowned leader in cardiovascular care. His vision continues to advance health and transform lives every day.
