# Sigyn Therapeutics Appoints Dr. Christoph Zaba to Its Scientific Advisory Board

SAN DIEGO, CA. - September 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: SIGY), a developer of dialysis-like therapies to address cardiovascular disease and cancer, today announced the appointment of Dr. Christoph Zaba to its Scientific Advisory Board.

 Dr. Zaba is an innovation and business development leader with extensive experience in medical technology, extracorporeal therapies, and international product management. During his tenure at Fresenius Medical Care, he directed global product management in the field of therapeutic apheresis, advancing treatments in nephrology, dermatology, neurology, and cardiovascular medicine. His work included immunoadsorption therapies for autoimmune diseases and lipoprotein apheresis for the removal of pathogenic lipoproteins from the blood.

 Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is an extracorporeal treatment methodology to reduce the presence of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] in the bloodstream. In the treatment of cardiovascular disease (leading cause of global deaths), studies of lipoprotein apheresis have reported 55% to 98% reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

 Sigyn Therapy™ is a whole blood adsorption technology being advanced to reduce the bloodstream presence of both Lp(a) and LDL-C while simultaneously targeting inflammatory molecules that fuel cardiovascular disease progression. On September 3rd, the Company disclosed plans to commence a multi-site clinical feasibility study of Sigyn Therapy™ in high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD) subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The successful completion of the feasibility study could set the stage for a pivotal efficacy study necessary to obtain potential market clearance to treat cardiovascular disease.

 While the therapeutic benefit of lipoprotein apheresis has been well established, treatment access is limited to fewer than 60 specialized apheresis centers in the United States. Whereas Sigyn Therapy™ is designed for use on dialysis machines already located in approximately 7,500 U.S. dialysis clinics.

 About Sigyn Therapeutics™

 Sigyn Therapeutics is developing dialysis-like therapies to address cardiovascular disease and cancer. Sigyn Therapy™ is a first-in-class whole blood adsorption technology being advanced to treat cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of global deaths. The technology is designed to reduce the circulating presence of inflammatory molecules that drive cardiovascular disease progression while simultaneously targeting cholesterol transporting lipoproteins that contribute to heart attacks, strokes, and other major adverse cardiovascular events. The extracorporeal removal of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] from the bloodstream (commercially known as lipoprotein apheresis) is clinically reported to reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events by 55% to 98%.

 Sigyn Therapeutics is also developing dialysis-like cancer therapies comprised of ImmunePrep(TM) to optimize the delivery of immunotherapeutic antibodies; ChemoPrep(TM) to enhance the targeted delivery of chemotherapy; and ChemoPure(TM) to reduce chemotherapy toxicity. The Company plans to advance its cancer treatment candidates through joint venture development relationships.
