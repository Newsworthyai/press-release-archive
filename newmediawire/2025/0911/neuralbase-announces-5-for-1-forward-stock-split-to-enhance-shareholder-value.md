# NeuralBase Announces 5-for-1 Forward Stock Split to Enhance Shareholder Value

LAS VEGAS, NV - September 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI and recognized as a fast-growing innovator in enterprise artificial intelligence, today announced that its Board of Directors approved on September 9, 2025, a 5-for-1 forward split of its common stock. The stock split is intended to increase the number of shares in circulation, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors and improving market liquidity.

 Upon completion of the split, shareholders of record at the close of business on the anticipated record date of September 26, 2025 will receive four additional shares for each share of common stock they own. The new shares will be distributed on the payment date to be set by FINRA following the completion of their review of this corporate action.

 The Company is expected to submit the required notification with FINRA pursuant to Rule 6490 and will file a Form 8-K with the Securities & Exchange Commission within four business days regarding this corporate action. The Company's transfer agent will handle the distribution of new shares to shareholders of record, and shareholders holding physical certificates will not be required to surrender their existing certificates as the split will be processed automatically.

 Benefits of the Forward Stock Split

 The 5-for-1 forward stock split is designed to provide several key benefits to shareholders and the broader investment community:

 * Enhanced Accessibility - The lower nominal share price following the split will make NeuralBase AI shares more accessible to retail investors and broaden the potential investor base.
* Improved Liquidity - Increasing the number of shares outstanding is expected to enhance trading liquidity and reduce bid-ask spreads, benefiting all shareholders.
* Market Positioning - The split positions the company's shares in a more optimal trading range, potentially attracting increased institutional and retail investor interest.
* No Dilution - Shareholders will maintain their proportional ownership in the company, as the split does not change the underlying value of their investment.
* Strategic Flexibility - The increased share count provides greater flexibility for future corporate actions, including potential strategic partnerships and equity-based compensation programs.

 "This 5-for-1 forward stock split is a testament to our confidence in NeuralBase AI's long-term growth prospects and our unwavering commitment to enhancing shareholder value," stated Vighnesh Dobale, CEO of NeuralBase AI Ltd. "By making our shares more accessible to a wider audience of investors, we aim to increase liquidity and broaden our shareholder base. This strategic move will positively impact our shareholders and better position us for continued growth and success in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. We believe this action, combined with our continued focus on innovation and the development of our BMP AI platform, will drive long-term value creation for our company and our investors."
