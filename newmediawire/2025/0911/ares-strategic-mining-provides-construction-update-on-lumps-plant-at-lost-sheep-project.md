# Ares Strategic Mining Provides Construction Update on Lumps Plant at Lost Sheep Project

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Ares Strategic Mining Inc. (CSE: ARS) (OTC: ARSMF) (FRA: N8I1) is pleased to provide a major construction update on the Company’s Lumps Plant being built at its Fluorspar Project in Utah. This marks a major milestone in the development of the only domestic fluorspar processing operation in the United States.

 Construction Progress: From Foundations to Framework

 Following months of mobilization and site preparation, construction of the Lumps Plant has now reached an advanced stage:

 - All concrete foundations and pads have been poured and completed

 - Steel frame structures are being erected across multiple areas of the plant

 - Major vessels have been fabricated and welded into place, forming part of the plant’s core processing infrastructure

 - Conveyor systems are being assembled and mounted, with visible segments installed across the site

 - Additional structural supports are being bolted into position to accommodate heavy mechanical systems

 Welding, assembly and plant construction proceeds at pace

 James Walker, CEO of Ares Strategic Mining, commented: “This is a pivotal moment in our construction timeline. With the plant now physically taking shape, we are progressing from concept to reality. Every welded beam and poured foundation brings us one step closer to production. We remain firmly on track to become the first fluorspar producer in the country.”

 Concrete Pads and Structural Supports Being Erected

 Building the Backbone of Domestic Fluorspar Supply

 The Lumps Plant is a key component in Ares’ strategy to produce high-purity fluorspar for North American markets, including:

 - Steel and aluminum manufacturing

 - Refrigerants and fluoropolymers

 - Critical minerals supply for nuclear fuel and semiconductors

 As part of its ramp-up strategy, Ares is building a modular, scalable infrastructure that will allow for increased throughput and processing control.

 Fabricated Steel Components Being Fitted To Expanded Plant Structures.

 Looking Ahead: Toward Commissioning and Production

 The construction efforts currently underway are expected to lead to:

 - Completion of structural assembly and installation of conveyors

 - Initiation of equipment fit-out and wiring

 - Testing and commissioning of plant systems

 - On-site ore stockpiling and initial feed into processing systems

 With ongoing support from engineering partners and construction contractors, the Company remains committed to achieving its production and revenue targets in line with market demand for critical minerals.

 DISCLOSURE AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

 Companies typically rely on comprehensive feasibility reports on mineral reserve estimates to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with a production decision. Historically, situations where the issuer decides to put a mineral project into production without first establishing mineral reserves supported by a technical report and completing a feasibility study have a higher risk of economic or technical failure, though some industrial mineral ventures are relatively simple operations with low levels of investment and risk, where the operating entity has determined that a formal prefeasibility or feasibility study in conformance with NI 43-101 and 43-101 CP is not required for a production decision. Based on historical engineering work, geological reports, historical production data and current engineering work completed or in the process by Ares, the Company intends to move forward with the development of its Utah asset.
