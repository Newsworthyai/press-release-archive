# PowerBank (SUUN) Updates on Skaneateles Community Solar Projects

LOS ANGELES, CA - September 11, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Disseminated on behalf of PowerBank Corporation

 PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103), a leader in North American energy infrastructure development and asset ownership, announced it has secured all required municipal approvals for two community solar projects on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, New York, located in Onondaga County. With variances, site plan approval and a special use permit in place, the projects will now pursue approval from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation ahead of construction. Once operational, the projects will deliver clean energy to the local grid, allowing renters and homeowners to subscribe and earn bill credits without installing panels on their properties. Supported by PowerBank’s track record of more than 100 MW of completed projects and a 1 GW development pipeline, the Skaneateles projects will advance New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal of 6 GW of solar capacity by 2025.
