# Share Buybacks And New Crypto Infrastructure: Thumzup Media Is Evolving Its Business Model

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - October 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Thumzup Media Corporation (NASDAQ: TZUP), a digital asset accumulator and advertising industry disruptor with a growing cryptocurrency portfolio, just announced its board approved a $10 million share repurchase program, underscoring the confidence the company has in its business evolution. The stock buybacks, which last through December 31, 2026, come on the heels of a previously announced $1 million share buyback program, which was completed in September 2025.

 As of mid-September, Thumzup Media had repurchased 212,432 shares of its stock for about $1 million at a weighted average price of $4.71 per share. On Sept. 26, the stock opened at $5.39 per share.

 "Our decision to implement a $10 million share repurchase program reflects confidence in Thumzup's long-term strategy and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders," said Robert Steele, chief executive officer of Thumzup, when announcing the share buyback program. "We believe our balanced approach, combining strategic accumulation of digital assets with investment in its underlying infrastructure, positions us well for sustained growth."

 Acquiring More Than Bitcoin

 Thumzup Media has been on an evolution in recent months. The company completed a $50 million all common stock offering at $10 per share. It currently operates a social media marketing platform coupled with a consumer-facing app that enables consumers to get paid cash for posting about participating advertisers on major social media outlets through the Thumzup App. Its easy-to-use dashboard allows advertisers to programmatically customize their campaigns to reach consumers. Cash payments are made to app users/creators through PayPal and other digital payment systems.

 In parallel with its AdTech platform, the company has begun to acquire digital assets. Thumzup also recently closed a $50 million offering, with the proceeds earmarked for digital asset accumulation and mining expansion.

 Timing The Market

 Thumzup’s expansion in digital assets comes as the cryptocurrency market is becoming increasingly mainstream, thanks in part to growing institutional participation and anticipated regulatory clarity. Investor interest has also been fueled by diversification strategies, inflation hedging and speculation around potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

 "As the U.S. federal government moves toward more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity, Thumzup is committed to remaining at the forefront of this transformative technology," said Steele. "By diversifying our portfolio of cryptocurrencies to gain wider exposure to the market as a whole, we believe Thumzup is optimally positioned to create significant value for TZUP shareholders."

 Dogehash Technologies Deal Could Be Transformative

 Thumzup is taking that commitment to crypto even further, recently announcing a definitive agreement to acquire Dogehash Technologies, Inc., a Dogecoin mining firm with roughly 3,500 mining rigs and the ability to expand beyond that. The combined company, the result of an all-stock deal, remains subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholder approval.

 Today, Thumzup announced it has provided DogeHash Technologies Inc. with a $2.5 million loan. The funds are expected to expand DogeHash’s Dogecoin mining capacity and accelerate deployment of its next-generation ASIC miners. The financing, which comes ahead of Thumzup’s pending acquisition of DogeHash, is anticipated to support the addition of more than 500 new ASIC miners, which could bring the total rigs in operation to more than 4,000 later this year. Company executives said the move underscores Thumzup’s broader strategic push into the cryptocurrency ecosystem and strengthens its position as a fast-scaling Dogecoin mining venture.

 Many companies are going after DOGE because it is a popular cryptocurrency – with the DOGE ETF seeing record inflows on its first trading day– thanks to fast block times, low transaction fees and an inflationary but predictable issuance that resembles global fiat currency supply dynamics. It ranks among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and consistently records billions of dollars in daily trading volume.

 If completed, the acquisition accelerates Thumzup’s strategy to evolve from a digital advertising company to a digital asset infrastructure and treasury company. “Our vision is not only to mine Dogecoin and Litecoin efficiently but also to explore utility‑driven use cases that leverage Dogecoin's fast settlement and low fees for everyday payments and rewards,” said Steele.

 From buying back shares to acquiring Dogecoin miners, Thumzup is busy expanding and evolving its business. With a growing treasury of cryptocurrencies and the backing and firepower to acquire more, Thumzup is becoming a force to watch in the digital asset marketplace.
