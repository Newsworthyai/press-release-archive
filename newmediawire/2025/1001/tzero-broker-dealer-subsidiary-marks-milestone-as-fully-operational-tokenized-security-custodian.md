# tZERO Broker-Dealer Subsidiary Marks Milestone as Fully Operational Tokenized Security Custodian

Completion of Inaugural Regulatory Exam Affirms Company’s Focus on Transparency, Compliance, and Investor Protection

 NEW YORK, NY - October 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - tZERO Group, Inc. (“tZERO”), a pioneer in blockchain and tokenization for capital markets, today announced that its subsidiary, tZERO Digital Asset Securities, LLC, has reached a key milestone in its role as a Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD) permitted to custody tokenized securities. One year after securing SPBD approval, the firm has successfully completed its first regulatory exam without exception - underscoring tZERO’s commitment to compliance, transparency, and investor protection as it advances the digital asset securities market.

 An SPBD is an SEC-registered broker-dealer authorized to custody, clear and facilitate trading in digital asset securities. tZERO Digital Asset Securities is one of only two firms nationwide to hold this unique status. It is also approved to offer these correspondent custody and clearing services to other broker-dealers who lack this approval as an effective alternative to non-broker-dealer-led custody for digital asset securities.

 Since its designation, the company has provided custody, clearing, and trading of tokenized securities through infrastructure that mirrors the safeguards of traditional capital markets while leveraging blockchain technology to increase efficiency and transparency. This unique status underscores tZERO’s leadership in building trusted, regulated infrastructure for digital assets.

 “This milestone reflects the strength of our operational framework and our commitment to building trust through compliance,” said Alan Konevsky, Chief Executive Officer of tZERO. “At tZERO Digital Asset Securities, we are proving every day that digital securities can be transacted and custodied with the same rigor as traditional instruments. Completing our first exam without exception is further validation that we are on the right path - delivering innovation responsibly within the regulatory framework. While we expect the regulatory landscape to continue to liberalize, and similar activities becoming available to other market participants, we have a leading edge in terms of experience and market presence - which is also available to other broker-dealers who are not currently permitted to custody tokenized securities directly, and can elect to use our correspondent custody and clearing services.”

 “Reaching this one-year milestone is more than just proof of our operational readiness, it’s the foundation for what’s next,” added Alex Vlastakis, President of tZERO Digital Asset Securities. “We’ve established the foundational infrastructure needed to scale, simplify adoption, and, most importantly, add value for issuers and investors. We are not just participating in this market - we are building the secure, compliant pathways that will define it.”

 Since launching in September 2024, tZERO Digital Asset Securities has actively custodied and supported tokenized securities trading. This achievement underscores its role in bridging blockchain innovation with regulatory standards - and advancing tZERO’s strategic priorities of building trusted partnerships, expanding multi-asset capabilities, and driving transparency and institutional engagement across global markets.
