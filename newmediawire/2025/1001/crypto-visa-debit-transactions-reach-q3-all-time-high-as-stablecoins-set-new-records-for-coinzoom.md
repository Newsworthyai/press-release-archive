# Crypto Visa Debit Transactions Reach Q3 All-Time High as Stablecoins Set New Records for CoinZoom

SALT LAKE CITY, UT - September 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CoinZoom, a U.S.-based fintech platform, today announced a major milestone: for the third quarter of 2025, 60% of all CoinZoom Visa Debit Card transactions were made using cryptocurrency - the highest share in the company’s history. The number one cryptocurrency spent during the quarter was the stablecoin Tether (USDT), a strong indicator of the appeal of stablecoins in everyday finances.

 On average, customers earned $78.59 in crypto rewards on their Visa spending during July, the highest rewards month since CoinZoom launched its international program with Visa in November 2024.

 This milestone reflects a broader global trend toward stablecoin and crypto adoption across fintech and retail ecosystems. Every major U.S. consumer-facing wallet with wide adoption has either integrated crypto or announced plans to launch stablecoin functionality, following the passage of the Genius Act.

 Leading retailers such as Amazon and Walmart are exploring proprietary stablecoins to reduce cash-handling costs and deepen customer loyalty programs, while several of the largest U.S. banks have jointly announced plans for a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin initiative.

 “Reaching a point where the majority of our debit card transactions are in crypto is not just a milestone - it is a leading indicator of where the market is headed,” said Todd Crosland, founder and CEO of CoinZoom. “The Genius Act has certainly been a catalyst. As more consumers and businesses adopt stablecoins, we are forecasting higher transaction volumes, deeper customer engagement as their rewards grow, and stronger revenue streams.”

 Crosland added: “Our Visa debit cards are regularly used for crypto transactions in 45 to 50 countries per month. People choose crypto to pay for morning coffee at Starbucks, pizzas and burgers, or more considered purchases like airline tickets and travel. They even use crypto for high-ticket, one-off purchases like jewelry and furniture. When customers can choose any way to pay, they increasingly select stablecoins and crypto - now nearly two-thirds of all our monthly transactions.”
