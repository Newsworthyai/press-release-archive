# Mitesco Expands A.I. Based Sales Automation to Include Mortgage, Insurance Integration

VERO BEACH, FL - October 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mitesco, Inc. (OTC-QB: MITI, www.mitescoinc.com, the “Company”), noting the trend toward vertical integration of the residential real estate agency business to include financial products such as mortgage and insurance, said it has begun development on a version of its upcoming Robo Agent application set specifically supporting the unique needs in the residential mortgage and insurance industries.

 Consolidation Driving the Need for Improved Efficiency for Sales

 Mr. Mack Leath, Chairman and CEO, today commented, “The latest merger between Compass and Anywhere, two of the largest residential real estate agencies, signals a move toward consolidation that we had anticipated when designing the Robo Agent product set. Clearly, compensation changes as a result of the NAR settlement, and the general trends in residential real estate, are putting pressure on all players to improve their efficiency and reduce their overhead. Further signaling changes are the recent acquisition of real estate agency entities by those providing follow-on financial products to real estate owners. Both mortgage and homeowners’ insurance are longer term products with an extended opportunity for profit beyond the momentary income from sales commissions. Combinations like the Rocket and Redfin transaction, we believe, will become necessary for real estate businesses to survive and grow. Given this, it was a natural follow-on for us to make the extensive client data gathered in the real estate agent version more readily available to mortgage and insurance providers.”

 Expanding Centcore Data Center Through Robo Agent Processing

 “The development of the Robo Agent sales force automation solution gives the Centcore data center a significant value proposition when compared to the “Big 3” metacenter providers”, explained Brian Valania, General Manager for Centcore. He added, “Because of our size, we can quickly customize a solution for any client, especially important in the highly competitive residential real estate, mortgage provider or insurance agency industries with significant savings for all of their processing and backup needs. Add to those applications like Robo Agent for Mortgage, or Insurance, and we become a start-to-finish, one stop solution unlike any others in the market today.” There are over 6,000 mortgage companies operating in the USA. This includes a mix of large national lenders, regional banks, and smaller local firms, and over 3 million real estate agents, including 1.5 million affiliated with the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The Company said it expects first versions of Robo Agent for Realtors to be available in Q4 FY2025, and the Mortgage version during Q1 FY2026. Both will be available exclusively in the Centcore Data Center, based in Melbourne, Florida with eight (8) backup sites worldwide.

 A Continued Focus on Return to Investors and Growth Into Expanding Markets

 “The moves we announce today demonstrate our commitment to our shareholders and investors that Mitesco remains determined to build a successful growth-oriented business centered on the digital markets of today and tomorrow. We will continue to be active in its acquisition strategy, targeting complementary businesses in software, data center services, and emerging tech verticals that enhance scale and support long-term margin expansion. We will continue to make additions to our staff and Board that support our goals and believe that with any reasonable combination of our current businesses, and newly identified targets for acquisition or merger, we expect to move our share listing to a senior exchange, and possibly an international exchange, during FY2026. All these plans and objectives come with unique risks and requirements, and any potential success will be subject to the availability of growth capital at attractive terms, along with our own internal performance and an acceptance in the market for our potential," said Leath.
