# iMD Companies, Inc. Announces Exploring Cloud Mining to Expand Cryptocurrency Ventures

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - October 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC: ICBU) is thrilled to announce its strategic initiative to engage in cloud mining, a cutting-edge approach to cryptocurrency mining that positions the company to capitalize on the growing digital asset market without the complexities of managing physical hardware.

 What is Cloud Mining?

 Cloud mining enables iMD Companies, Inc. to lease computational power, or "hash rate," from advanced data centers operated by specialized providers. These providers manage all aspects of mining operations, including hardware, electricity, cooling, and maintenance, allowing iMD to focus on earning mining rewards. When the leased hardware contributes to successfully mining a block on the blockchain, iMD receives a proportional share of the rewards, primarily in Bitcoin, based on the allocated hash rate.

 This innovative model, often described as "mining as a service," eliminates the need for costly equipment or technical expertise, making it an accessible entry point into cryptocurrency mining. By leveraging cloud mining, iMD bypasses the high barriers of traditional mining, which have intensified due to Bitcoin’s escalating mining difficulty and competition from large-scale operations.

 How iMD is Implementing Cloud Mining

 iMD Companies is actively exploring partnerships with leading cloud mining platforms to secure contracts tailored to its strategic goals. These contracts, such as leasing 10 TH/s of hash rate for 30 days, will specify the computational power, contract duration, and associated fees. This approach allows iMD to efficiently participate in mining Bitcoin and potentially other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, aligning with its vision to diversify revenue streams in the digital asset space.

 Strategic Importance for iMD

 "Cloud mining represents a significant opportunity for iMD to enter the cryptocurrency market with minimal overhead while maximizing potential returns," said Rick Wilson, CEO for iMD Companies, Inc. "This initiative aligns with our mission to innovate and expand our portfolio in high-growth sectors like blockchain technology."
