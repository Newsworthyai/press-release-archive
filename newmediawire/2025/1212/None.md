# Arctic Plunge to Bring Sub-zero Temps and Snow; Take Extra Care to Stay Heart Healthy

DALLAS - December 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - A significant Arctic blast expected to hit the U.S. starting later this week will bring the coldest air of the season, dangerous wind, heavy snow - and the risk of heart issues - to those living in communities from the Great Plains to the Great Lakes. The exertion of shoveling snow in extreme cold can be deadly. According to the American Heart Association, the world’s leading nonprofit organization focused on heart and brain health for all, research shows that the exertion of shoveling snow may lead to an increased risk of a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest.

 The American Heart Association’s 2020 scientific statement, Exercise-Related Acute Cardiovascular Events and Potential Deleterious Adaptations Following Long-Term Exercise Training: Placing the Risks Into Perspective–An Update, notes snow shoveling among the physical activities that may place extra stress on the heart, especially among people who aren’t used to regular exercise. Numerous scientific research studies over the years have identified the dangers of shoveling snow for people with and without known heart disease.

 “If you’ve ever taken a treadmill stress test or seen one on TV, imagine that same strain on your heart while you are trying to clear your driveway of heavy snow,” said, Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women’s health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women’s Health of Northwell Health in New York City. “That strain combined with the arctic cold expected this winter could lead to a heart-related emergency - especially for those who aren’t physically fit or people with existing heart conditions.”

 Rosen says someone who’s not as active during the year and then picks up a snow shovel in the winter may not realize the extreme cold and exertion forces your heart to work harder, sometimes dangerously harder.

 * Shoveling is primarily arm work, which is harder on the heart than leg work.
* Lifting heavy loads often causes people to hold their breath without realizing it, spiking heart rate and blood pressure.
* Cold air constricts blood vessels throughout the body, raising blood pressure and tightening coronary arteries.

 The risk is even greater for people with cardiovascular concerns such as a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking history, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or a prior heart attack, stroke or other cardiac condition. Talk to your doctor about any limitations on your winter activities based on your heart health.

 Tips to reduce increased risk from snow shoveling:

 * If you have known or suspected heart disease or risk factors for heart disease, get someone else to do your snow removal for you!
* If you must shovel the snow, start gradually and pace yourself. Always cover your mouth and nose, wear layered clothing, as well as a hat and gloves.
* Ideally, push or sweep the snow rather than lifting and throwing it, that action involves a little less exertion.
* Be extra careful when the wind is blowing, the wind makes the temperature feel even colder than it is and will increase the effects of the cold on your body.
* If you are able, use an automated snow blower rather than shoveling. While you should still proceed with caution and be mindful of how your body is feeling, research shows that using a snow blower doesn’t raise your heart rate quite as high as shoveling.

 The American Heart Association urges everyone to learn the common signs of a heart attack and stroke. If you experience chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or heart palpitations or irregular heart rhythms, stop the activity immediately. Call 9-1-1 if symptoms don’t subside shortly after you stop shoveling or snow blowing. If you see someone collapse while shoveling snow, call for help and start Hands-Only CPR if they are unresponsive with no pulse.
