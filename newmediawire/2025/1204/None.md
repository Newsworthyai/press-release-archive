# AdipoLABs Opens New Regional Office, Signs Two MoUs With University of Cyberjaya to Advance Healthcare Innovation

Partnership Drives Clinical Research, Hands-on Student Training, and Access to Cutting-edge Medical Technologies

 PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA - December 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - AdipoLABs Co., Ltd. and Red & Blue Co., Ltd. from Korea, together with their Malaysian subsidiary, AdipoLABs Healthcare (M) Sdn Bhd, today officially opened the new AdipoLABs regional office for Asia-Pacific, marking a strategic expansion to strengthen its leadership in non-invasive healthcare and build a robust MedTech ecosystem in Malaysia and across ASEAN.

 As a research and development-focused medical company, its presence is expected to drive knowledge transfer, foster R&D collaboration, provide industry-standard training, and enhance the country’s preventive healthcare capabilities. To commemorate this milestone, the company also signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the University of Cyberjaya (UoC), formalising a partnership to advance healthcare innovation, clinical research, and talent development.

 “By uniting our hyperthermia technology with local expertise and academic rigour, we’ll expedite the adoption of advanced solutions and improve patient outcomes worldwide. We envision this collaboration as a blueprint for international healthcare partnerships,” said Mr. Han Sung-ho, CEO of AdipoLABs Co., Ltd.

 A cornerstone of the first MoU is a comprehensive internship programme with UoC’s Physiotherapy programmes under the Faculty of Health, offering six-month placements and potential job opportunities to give students invaluable real-world experience. Students from the Faculty of Health will gain hands-on expertise with AdipoLABs’ Pain Bot device, enhancing their skills in pain detection and treatment, while students from the School of Biomedical Engineering will support AdipoLABs’ technical operations, strengthening after-sales service and device maintenance.

 As part of the partnership, AdipoLABs will implement a strategic client engagement initiative, where interns may be placed at client facilities to demonstrate device effectiveness and provide on-site support. This initiative highlights the interns’ value, encourages potential permanent employment, and ensures optimal use of the technology. The collaboration also extends to clinical research, with UoC professors and students conducting studies on various AdipoLABs medical devices, generating evidence-based insights to be published in reputable journals and scientifically validating the technologies.

 “We’re thrilled to collaborate with the University of Cyberjaya to cultivate local talent and drive Malaysian healthcare innovation. This partnership offers UoC students invaluable hands-on experience with technologies like Pain Bot. It also expands our clinical research, enhancing pain management solutions for patients across Malaysia and ASEAN. We are dedicated to empowering future healthcare leaders,” said Dr. Isaac R. Joseph, Director of AdipoLABs Healthcare (M) Sdn Bhd.

 In a parallel effort to advance physiotherapy education, AdipoLABs Malaysia, Red & Blue Co., Ltd., and UoC signed a second MoU focused on knowledge transfer and medical device donation. Under this agreement, AdipoLABs Malaysia will donate a Pain Bot unit to UoC, giving students access to cutting-edge pain detection and treatment technology and enhancing their knowledge and skills in innovative musculoskeletal pain management methods.

 AdipoLABs, a Ministry of Health (MOH)-registered medical-device establishment under the Medical Device Authority(MDA), anchors this collaboration with proven regulatory credibility and a strong commitment to quality and innovation. Their certified standing reinforces UoC’s ambition to accelerate evidence-based research and industry-ready healthcare solutions.

 “AdipoLABs’ partnership with the University of Cyberjaya is more than a collaboration, it is a direct investment in the next generation of healthcare professionals. With the introduction of advanced rehabilitative technologies, our students gain access to international-standard tools and real-world innovation that will shape their confidence, competence, and future careers,” said Professor Dr. David Whitford, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cyberjaya.

 Further strengthening this collaboration, Professor Dr. Yoo Seung-mo from South Korea, the inventor of the Pain Bot, will serve as an Adjunct Professor at UoC. Dr. Yoo will provide on-site training and ongoing remote mentorship, ensuring students receive the highest level of expertise in utilising the Pain Bot technology and applying advanced pain detection and treatment techniques.

 Together, UoC and AdipoLABs are positioned to drive forward Malaysia’s healthcare innovation agenda with greater confidence and impact.
