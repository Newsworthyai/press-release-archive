# URZ3 Energy Initiates Exploration at Dry Fork Uranium Project (Wyoming)

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - URZ3 Energy Corp. (“URZ3” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: URZ; OTCQB: URZEF) is pleased to announce the initiation of an exploration program on its Dry Fork Uranium Project, located in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, USA. Dry Fork is strategically located 10 km (6 mi) from the Nichols Ranch Uranium Project in the Powder River Basin, one of the most important uranium-producing regions in the United States.

 The program is designed to assess the property’s potential for in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium and to establish priority areas for exploration drilling.

 The first objective at Dry Fork is to identify areas on the property with uranium-bearing groundwater that could indicate zones of ISR-compatible uranium mineralization in the subsurface.

 The first phase of the program will focus on areas around known water springs, where sampling will be conducted to test for anomalous uranium. A second phase will extend the search using hand-held spectrometers to locate additional springs and surface seeps carrying uranium that may have formed concentrated zones at the surface. The spectrometer survey will be carried out over a systematic ground grid to refine exploration targets and help guide future drilling plans.

 “The Dry Fork program is an important step in advancing our first uranium property in Wyoming,” stated Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO of URZ3 Energy Corp. “By focusing first on hydrogeological indicators, we are taking a cost-effective and scientific approach to prioritizing drill targets for ISR uranium potential. Dry Fork is expected to be one of a portfolio of properties in Wyoming and the southwestern United States, where we see renewed momentum and growth opportunities due to U.S. governmental incentives and pathways to expedited exploration and production of uranium and other critical metals. Our team has had tremendous success in advancing uranium assets from exploration to production scenarios.”

 In a September 15th interview with Bloomberg, U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright emphasized the need to strengthen the U.S. strategic uranium reserve to reduce reliance on foreign supply and support nuclear energy growth. The Strategic Uranium Reserve program, initiated in 2020, has already led to U.S. government purchases of one million pounds of U₃O₈ at prices above prevailing market levels, underscoring federal commitment to domestic supply. More recently, on August 22, 2025, the Department of Energy announced the creation of a Defense Production Act Consortium to expand domestic fuel availability, enhance power reliability, and accelerate America’s path toward nuclear energy independence.

 Jim Ebisch (P. Geol) will be the QP as defined by National Instrument 43-101 reviewing data on the project.
