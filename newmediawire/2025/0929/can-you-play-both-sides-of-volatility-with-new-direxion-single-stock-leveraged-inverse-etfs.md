# Can You Play Both Sides of Volatility With New Direxion Single Stock Leveraged &amp; Inverse ETFs?

By Kyle Anthony, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - September 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in LMT or SHOP.

 Direxion recently launched four new single-stock daily leveraged and inverse ETF offerings that provide investors with exposure to two distinct companies, namely Shopify Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corporation Each company has a different business focus, and risk-hungry traders can use Direxion’s Single Stock Leveraged & Inverse ETFs to gain tactical exposure to each and potentially benefit from their directional movements in either direction.

 Gaining Comprehensive Exposure To Shopify And Lockheed Martin With Direxion

 For short-term traders looking to gain leveraged or inverse exposure to Shopify, the Direxion Daily SHOP Bull 2X ETF (NASDAQ: SHPU) and Direxion Daily SHOP Bear 1X ETF (NASDAQ: SHPD) offer enhanced, pure-play exposure for both bulls and bears. Similarly, risk traders interested in gaining holistic exposure to Lockheed Martin can utilize the Direxion Daily LMT Bull 2X ETF (NASDAQ: LMTL) and Direxion Daily LMT Bear 1X ETF (NASDAQ: LMTS).

 These Single Stock Leveraged & Inverse ETFs are designed to emulate the daily performance of the company's common shares, enabling tactical traders to gain exposure to the index’s movements with returns of 200% on its rise for the bull fund or 100% of the inverse for the bear fund. It is important to note that these solutions are intended to take advantage of short-term trends and should not be held for more than a day.

 Whether bullish or bearish on the respective companies, these ETFs can help traders easily engage with the firm’s growth patterns. However, it's crucial to approach these leveraged products with a clear understanding of their risks. While the amplified exposure can translate to significant gains, it can also lead to substantial losses. These ETFs are best suited for those who can actively manage the inherent risks of leverage and are looking to capitalize on short-term trends occurring with the stocks. Be sure to conduct thorough research before you answer the siren call of magnified profits!
