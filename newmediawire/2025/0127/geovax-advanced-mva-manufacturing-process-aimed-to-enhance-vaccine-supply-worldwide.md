# GeoVax Advanced MVA Manufacturing Process: Aimed to Enhance Vaccine Supply Worldwide

Process Expected to Increase Production Yield, Flexibility at Lower Cost

 ATLANTA, GA - January 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in vaccines and immunotherapies, has shared updates about its development-stage advanced Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine manufacturing process. This anticipated process provides the potential to not only address today’s pressing health challenges but also paves the way for more efficient, flexible and lower-cost MVA-vaccine manufacturing.

 The Power and Versatility of the MVA Platform

 The MVA platform is uniquely designed to incorporate multiple antigens into a single vaccine. This versatility allows GeoVax to develop vaccines targeting multiple aspects of a single pathogen or several pathogens simultaneously. Originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine, the MVA platform offers distinct advantages, including:

 * Protection against diseases such as Mpox and smallpox.
* Multi-antigen vaccines like GEO-CM04S1, which targets both the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) antigens of SARS-CoV-2.
* Stability under minimal refrigeration and the potential for freeze-drying (lyophilization), simplifying distribution in resource-limited settings.

 Advancing MVA Manufacturing

 Current vaccine manufacturing methods rely on Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) cells, requiring pathogen-free eggs. This process is costly, time-consuming, and dependent on limited egg supplies, providing barriers to rapid, real-time MVA manufacturing, as well as hindering the flexibility necessary to establish local MVA manufacturing of critically important vaccines.  GeoVax is addressing these barriers through an advanced MVA Manufacturing process utilizing an avian cell line licensed from ProBioGen AG (Berlin). Key features include:

 * A continuous avian suspension cell line process that eliminates the need for pathogen-free eggs.
* Compatibility with standard manufacturing equipment, reducing setup time, simplifying the MVA manufacturing process, increasing scalability and lowering manufacturing costs.

 This advanced MVA manufacturing process is expected to significantly simplify vaccine production, particularly in middle- and low-income regions where supply chain issues often hinder access to critical vaccines.

 Addressing Global Health Needs

 "Our advanced MVA manufacturing process represents not only a transformative manufacturing advance but also addresses a public health imperative," said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. "By tackling disease protection, logistical hurdles, and manufacturing challenges, we aim to empower regions like Africa with the tools needed to combat current and future health crises."

 GeoVax’s MVA vaccines have demonstrated robust performance in clinical trials, with ongoing Phase 2 studies for GEO-CM04S1, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, showing broad and durable immune responses. Supported by its BARDA Project NextGen Award and partnerships with leading manufacturing and development organizations, GeoVax is positioned to enhance vaccine access and delivery on a global scale.

 Recent Conference Presentations

 GeoVax CEO David Dodd recently presented the company’s strategic initiatives and the potential of GEO-MVA at:

 * Biotech Showcase: January 14, 2025
* Emerging Growth Conference: January 16, 2025

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned to initiate in mid-2025. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
