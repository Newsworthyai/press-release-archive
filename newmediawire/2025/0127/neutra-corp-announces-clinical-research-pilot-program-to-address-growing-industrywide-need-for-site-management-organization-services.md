# Neutra Corp Announces Clinical Research Pilot Program to Address Growing Industrywide Need for Site Management Organization Services

HOUSTON, TX - January 27, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neutra Corp, Neutra Corporation (OTC PINK:NTRR), an emerging health and wellness research and development company, announces today it will expand its services into the Life Sciences sector of Clinical Research. Neutra Corp’s pilot program introduces a patient-centric Site Management Organization (SMO) model, which integrates technology, standardized processes, expert oversight, and patient experience to address common challenges faced by clinical trial sites, sponsors, and contract research organizations (CROs). The company has pursued several opportunities in developing this line of business as a growing market opportunity with an established client base.

 As the clinical research industry continues to grow, an effective site management organization has become critical to ensuring timely and successful trial outcomes. To meet this demand, Neutra launched its Site Management Organization (SMO) pilot program in August 2024 in an effort to transition away from consulting in the industry to partnering and operating private practice research site.

 “By adding the SMO Services, we are unlocking additional revenue drivers from partners and expanding to new opportunities internationally,” said Sydney Jim, CEO of Neutra Corp. “We have a proven track record of providing corporate services in this market, and now we’re excited to introduce our own program that integrates the patient-first approach with advanced technology, standardized processes, and quality data to clinical research.”

 Key Features of the Pilot Program include:

 * Comprehensive Site Support: The program offers full-spectrum support for clinical trial sites, including staff training, regulatory compliance guidance, and patient recruitment strategies.
* Technology Integration: Neutra Corp’s pilot program utilizes multiple digital platforms that give the ability to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to optimize workflow management, real-time data tracking, and seamless communication.
* Standardized Processes: By implementing consistent procedures across all participating sites, the program aims to reduce variability, improve data quality, and enhance protocol adherence.
* Patient-Centric Approach: The pilot program prioritizes patient engagement and retention through tailored outreach initiatives and improved accessibility to trial resources.
* Patient-Centric Clinical Research: Neutra Corp is committed to transforming clinical research experience by putting patients at the center of the process. The program emphasizes patient education, transparent communication, and personalized support to ensure a positive and empowering trial journey for every participant.

 The pilot program has already demonstrated success at a research site in Richmond, Texas, United States, delivering measurable improvements in trial efficiency and patient satisfaction.  The goal for 2025 is to have a full-scale launch of Neutra Corp’s Site Management Organization division.
