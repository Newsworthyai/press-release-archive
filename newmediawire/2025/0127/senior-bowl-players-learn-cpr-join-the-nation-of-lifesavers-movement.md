# Senior Bowl players learn CPR, join the Nation of Lifesavers movement

(NewMediaWire) - January 27, 2025 - MOBILE, Ala. — The American Heart Association and the Reese’s Senior Bowl™ teamed up to ensure more people are confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency. On Senior Bowl Community Service Day, Jan. 27, the potential NFL Draft prospects who have completed their college eligibility and coaches learned Hands-Only CPR and how to use an automatic external defibrillators (AED) to respond in a cardiac emergency. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 of people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Senior Bowl football players and coaches is helping to support that critical link in the communities where players and fans live work and play” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “We know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 On Jan. 27, known as Senior Bowl Community Service Day, one of the festivities leading up to the Reese’s Senior Bowl game on Saturday, Feb. 1, players and coaches use manikins to learn the correct rate and depth of compressions. Compression-only CPR known as Hands-Only CPR can be equally effective as traditional CPR for adults and teens in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 The Reese’s Senior Bowl which will be held at Hancock Whitney Stadium located on the campus of the University of South Alabama in Mobile is widely regarded as the preeminent college football all-star game and the first stage in the NFL Draft process.

 “This opportunity for our players with the American Heart Association is very meaningful for the Reese’s Senior Bowl.  Our players leave Mobile every year as better football players after receiving NFL coaching for the first time and now providing them with CPR training will give them a valuable life skill beyond the game of football,” says Reese’s Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy.

 The Nation of Lifesavers movement initiative’s national ambassador is cardiac arrest survivor, Senior Bowl alumni (2021) and Buffalo Bills safety, Damar Hamlin. Hamlin suffered sudden cardiac arrest in January 2023 on Monday Night Football. He received CPR and AED live on television as in-stadium attendees and viewers at home watched those very first links in the chain of survival working.

 Other Senior Bowl alumni serving as members of the 2024 Nation of Lifesaver Ambassador Class, comprised of current NFL players who support efforts to build awareness of lifesaving CPR, include Cincinnati Bengals running back Chris Evans (2021) and Chicago Bears tight end Gerald Everett (2017).

 Last year, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the American Heart Association, NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt specific evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school student-athletes. The American Heart Association reports that more than 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.

 The American Heart Association, publisher of the official scientific guidelines for CPR,  is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. When more bystanders know CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 In addition to the CPR education, the American Heart Association had the Association’s Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award on display for players and coaches to view. Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award annually recognizes the country’s top college football coach for their contributions both on and off the field, as well as efforts to make the sport better for athletes and fans alike by demonstrating grit, integrity and a winning approach to coaching and life. The Coach of the Year award is voted on by the National Sports Media Association, current NCAA College football coaches, former Coach of the Year Award winners, the Paul “Bear” Bryant Awards’ Executive Leadership Team and the Bryant family.
