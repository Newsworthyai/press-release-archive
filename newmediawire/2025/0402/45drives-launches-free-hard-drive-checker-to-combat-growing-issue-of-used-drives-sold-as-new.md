# 45Drives Launches Free Hard Drive Checker to Combat Growing Issue of Used Drives Sold as New

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - April 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 45Drives, the leader in big, strong, fast enterprise data storage solutions, has launched a free Hard Drive Checker tool to help businesses and consumers verify the authenticity and condition of their hard drives. This initiative comes in response to alarming reports of fraudsters passing off used and potentially compromised hard drives as new.

 A recent investigation by TechRadar outlines a troubling trend that is threatening the integrity of the storage industry: counterfeiters are manipulating used Seagate hard drives to appear brand new by altering firmware and serial numbers. These deceptive practices not only put unsuspecting buyers at risk of early drive failure, data loss, and security vulnerabilities, but also damage the reputation of trusted manufacturers. As these scams become more sophisticated, it is more important than ever to source storage from manufacturer-authorized distributors to ensure genuine, factory-fresh drives and protect both your data and your investment.

 45Drives’ Hard Drive Checker offers a straightforward and effective solution. The tool allows users to scan drives once they’ve been purchased, helping detect signs of prior use, wear, or tampering; ensuring that both consumers and organizations can trust the integrity of their storage devices. It leverages S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data to analyze critical health indicators such as power-on hours, reallocated sectors, and write cycles. Unlike traditional diagnostic tools, 45Drives’ solution simplifies the process, making it accessible even to non-technical users.

 “We saw the problem proliferating and knew we had to act,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives. “Storage integrity is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. The last thing anyone wants is to unknowingly store critical data on a drive that has already been through years of use. Our Hard Drive Checker is completely free and empowers users to take control of their data security.”

 Available on the 45Drives website, the tool works seamlessly with a wide range of hard drives and provides detailed reports on key attributes such as power-on hours, write cycles, and potential signs of tampering. Users simply connect their drive to a computer, run the diagnostic check, and receive an easy-to-understand report on its condition. This enables IT professionals, businesses, and everyday consumers to make informed decisions before deploying or purchasing drives.

 As concerns over data integrity continue to rise, 45Drives' motivation for this initiative highlights its commitment to transparency and reliability in the storage market. As a major drive vendor with a strong track record of delivering enterprise grade, open source storage solutions, the company aims to protect customers from costly scams while reinforcing trust in the industry.
