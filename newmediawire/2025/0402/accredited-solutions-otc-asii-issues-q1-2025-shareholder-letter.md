# Accredited Solutions (OTC:ASII) Issues Q1 2025 Shareholder Letter

NEW YORK, NY - April 2, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) (“Accredited Solutions” or the “Company”), a technology-driven fintech company, is pleased to provide this shareholder update, building upon the momentum of 2024 and announcing a major step forward in its path to becoming a publicly traded Nasdaq company.

 Dear Shareholders,

 As we move through the first quarter of 2025, I’m proud to share the continued progress and strategic milestones that are propelling Accredited Solutions to the next level. Our momentum is strong, and recent developments further solidify our mission to become a dominant force in the fintech sector.

 LOI Executed for Nasdaq Listing via SPAC Merger

 The execution of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Everest Consolidator Acquisition Corporation (now EVCO) marks a pivotal moment for our company. This agreement sets us on an accelerated path to a Nasdaq listing- an essential step that aligns directly with our strategy to scale rapidly and cost-effectively through both organic growth and acquisitions.

 A Nasdaq listing enhances our credibility, expands our access to institutional capital, and increases our visibility in global markets. These advantages are critical in executing large-scale acquisitions and rolling out next generation fintech infrastructure with speed and efficiency. We expect the uplisting to serve as a catalyst, enabling ASII to become a market leader in two of the fastest-growing sectors in financial technology: e-gift cards and blockchain-based payments.

 All pieces are in place for a very timely process. The fact that this structure does not need a reverse stock split, reduces the expected time to list on NASDAQ by at least 50%. As initial terms are set, ASII would be the surviving entity, retaining both our name and ticker symbol. This is not just a listing milestone- it is the gateway to transforming our competitive position.

 Positioned to Lead a $700B+ E-Gift Card Market with Blockchain Innovation

 Our recent MOU to acquire ItsBChain, a blockchain infrastructure company, is a strategic move to revolutionize how e-gift cards are issued, tracked, and redeemed.

 The global gift card market surpassed $500 billion in 2023 and is projected to exceed $700 billion by 2027, driven by the continued shift to digital gifting, embedded finance, and e-commerce. At the same time, blockchain payments are expected to grow from a $10 billion market in 2024 to over $60 billion by 2030, with rising demand for transparency, security, and real-time settlement.

 Despite this growth, the space remains fragmented-with no clear dominant player offering a unified, blockchain-powered e-gift solution. This presents a rare opportunity. ASII is uniquely positioned to fill that leadership vacuum by leveraging ItsBChain’s scalable technology, our existing fintech distribution channels, and the enhanced capital access afforded by our Nasdaq listing.

 Together, these elements create a powerful platform capable of consolidating market share and delivering embedded payment solutions across gift cards, loyalty, and cross-border e-commerce use cases. The Nasdaq listing amplifies our ability to act quickly and decisively to capture this whitespace before competitors catch up.

 Balance Sheet Transformation & Responsible Capital Management

 We understand shareholder concerns around dilution, particularly from convertible debt. However, cleaning up the balance sheet has been a deliberate and necessary step to position ASII for scalable growth. By resolving short-term liabilities, we unlock long-term value and qualify for institutional-grade financing that would otherwise be inaccessible.

 Even now, on a fully diluted basis, we believe ASII is significantly undervalued relative to our fintech peers. This disconnect creates a compelling entry point for investors ahead of what we expect to be a major re-rating upon Nasdaq listing and post-acquisition integration.

 Notably, our revenue per share has grown 10x year-over-year, from $0.0011 in 2023 to $0.0119 in 2024, demonstrating our ability to grow responsibly while increasing profitability. We anticipate booking more than $2.5 million in net earnings for FY2024, a major milestone that underscores the success of our capital strategy.

 Revenue Forecast in Line with Nasdaq Listing Offering Significant Upside

 We continue to forecast $85 million in revenue for 2025, driven by a balanced mix of organic growth and targeted acquisitions. However, with the added momentum and capital efficiency of a Nasdaq listing, we believe this estimate could prove conservative. The enhanced visibility, brand credibility, and acquisition capacity that come with being a Nasdaq-listed company give us a significant edge in executing our expansion plan.

 Ultimately, the Nasdaq uplisting is not an isolated milestone- it is the strategic enabler of our long-term vision: to lead the e-gift card and blockchain fintech markets with scale, speed, and innovation. We are not just building a company- we are defining a new category.

 We remain focused, confident, and committed to building long-term value for our shareholders.

 We will issue final revenue number in the coming days, confirming our current path and proof our continued execution in our business plan.

 Thank you for your continued trust and support.

 Warm regards,

 Eduardo Brito Chief Executive Officer
