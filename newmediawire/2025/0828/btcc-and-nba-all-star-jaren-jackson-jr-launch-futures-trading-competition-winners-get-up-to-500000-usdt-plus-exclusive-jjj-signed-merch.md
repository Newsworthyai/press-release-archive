 The BTCC and Jaren Jackson Jr. Trading Competition represents a new chapter for the exchange, combining sports, strategy and trading innovation. But it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since coming on the scene in June 2011, BTCC has had to innovate to remain one of the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchanges, offering perpetual futures on over 300 cryptocurrencies and spot trading on more than 200 currencies, including BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP and SHIB.

 With a half-million USDT prize pool, exclusive signed memorabilia and gamified achievements, the campaign brings together community engagement and competitive trading at scale. It also enables BTCC to show off its cryptocurrency trading platform to newcomers who want to get in on the action because of the competition or because they are NBA fans.

 The Secret Sauce Behind BTCC’s History

 There’s a reason BTCC has been around for over 14 years. The cryptocurrency exchange adopted industry-leading security standards early on, which it credits with zero security incidents since its inception. As of April, BTCC has over 7.04 million registered users around the world. For the first quarter, BTCC reported volume of $815 billion and a 71% surge in futures trading. It also had a total reserve ratio of 132% for July, marking the fourth month in a row in which it maintained reserves well above 100%.

 With BTCC, users get up to 500 times leverage for major coins including BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL and XRP, and up to 50 times leverage on other lesser-known coins. This is among the highest leverage ratios in the industry, reports BTCC. New users are also given 10,055 USDT in welcome rewards.

 One of the popular features on BTCC is copy trading, which lets customers mirror the trades of a professional or experienced trader on the platform simply by linking their account to the trade and allocating capital to the copied strategy, all in real time. This lets users who are starting out trade crypto without years of knowledge and experience. To minimize the risk, users get 50 USDT loss coverage for their first copy trade.

 A Month Of Competing

 The BTCC and Jaren Jackson Jr. Trading Competition runs from August 21 through September 21, giving traders an entire month to test out strategies across BTCC’s futures markets.

 To take part in the competition, users must first click the "Register Now" button. Once they are signed up, participants are automatically entered to compete on both futures trading volume

 and profit rate. Of the 500,000 pool, 400,000 USDT is allocated for the futures trading volume competition, and 100,000 USDT is for the profit rate competition.

 What makes the Futures Trading Volume Competition so unique is that the prize pool grows alongside the overall community engagement. Higher trading activity unlocks higher prize tiers, creating a collective incentive for participants to both compete and encourage others to join. The starting prize pool is 2,000 USDT, with a ceiling of 400,000 USDT.

 To enter a draw for one of six signed jerseys, participants have to reach 100 million in USDT futures trading volume. Three winners will be drawn from the trading volume leaderboard participants, and three winners will be drawn from the profit rate leaderboard participants. BTCC and Jackson are also giving away up to 200 JJJ Glory Badges to those who land in the top 100 on both the trading volume and profit rate leaderboards.

 Cryptocurrency is hot, and so is JJJ. What better way to celebrate both than with a futures trading competition? Think you have what it takes to land on the leaderboard?
