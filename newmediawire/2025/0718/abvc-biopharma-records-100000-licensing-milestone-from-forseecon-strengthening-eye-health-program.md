# ABVC BioPharma Records $100,000 Licensing Milestone From ForSeeCon, Strengthening Eye Health Program

With Total Milestone Payments Reaching $946,000, ABVC Deepens Its Ophthalmology Focus Through a High-potential Partnership With ForSeeCon

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - July 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today announced the receipt of a $100,000 milestone licensing payment from ForSeeCon Eye Corporation. The milestone marks continued progress under the licensing agreement to develop and commercialize drugs for ophthalmic indications.

 This payment adds to ABVC’s cumulative licensing revenue, which now totals $946,000 across its strategic partnerships with AiBtl, OncoX, and ForSeeCon. Combining the third-party valuation of the products at issue, with the potential equity, royalties, and performance-based payouts available under the applicable agreements, the overall value of this arrangement could reach up to $1.0 billion.

 “Our collaboration with ForSeeCon reflects our commitment to addressing unmet needs in ophthalmology through both innovation and advanced biologic solutions like Vitargus®,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer. “This milestone payment signals continued commercial interest in our platform and provides important non-dilutive capital to support the next phases of development. At the same time, we’re seeing growing enthusiasm around Vitargus® from international partners, particularly in Europe and Japan, which we believe could pave the way for future strategic collaborations in those regions.”

 “We are proud to continue our collaboration with ABVC to advance Vitargus® into pivotal trials,” said Mr. Jerry Chang, CEO of ForSeeCon Eye Corporation. “The global response to Vitargus has been extremely encouraging, particularly from strategic partners in Europe and Japan. We believe this innovative solution has the potential to redefine retinal surgery outcomes and are excited about the international momentum building around it.”

 Targeting a $110B Global Eye Care Market:(1)

 The ForSeeCon agreement covers Vitargus®, a next-generation vitreous substitute developed from ABVC’s proprietary IP portfolio, and targets a rapidly expanding segment of the global eye care market. Together, ABVC and ForSeeCon plan to initiate pivotal clinical trials in key international markets in 2025.

 Looking Ahead:

 This latest payment supports ABVC’s strategic roadmap and reflects momentum following:- Multiple late-stage CNS licensing deals (AiBtl BioPharma, $350K to date)- Expansion into oncology with OncoX ($200K milestone to date)- Strong revenue and EPS growth in 2024

 With licensing income expected to continue into the second half of 2025, ABVC reaffirms its focus on capital-efficient innovation and unlocking value through global co-development partnerships.

 Management believes the Company's product pipeline has excellent market potential. According to a Grand View Research report, the global eye care market is projected to reach USD 110.3 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9 % from 2024 to 2030.(2)
