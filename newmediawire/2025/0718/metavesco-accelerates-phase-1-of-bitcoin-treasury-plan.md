# Metavesco Accelerates Phase 1 of Bitcoin Treasury Plan

CUMMING, GA - July 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced it has accelerated its Bitcoin Treasury Plan with the installation of new Bitmain Antminer S21+ units (235 TH/s each), lifting the Company’s aggregate hashing capacity to roughly 26 petahash per second (PH/s). At the current network difficulty, the expanded fleet is expected to stack ≈ 0.0124 BTC per day. The new S21 units produce fresh Bitcoin at an all-in mining cost of ~$55,000 per Bitcoin, a > 50 % discount to spot prices hovering near $118K.

 “We’re literally printing future balance-sheet strength at half the market cost with these new miners,” said Ryan Schadel, President & CEO. “Many Bitcoin treasury companies are only able to stack Bitcoin by diluting shareholders. Metavesco is locking in $55K production when spot trades near $120K. This lets Metavesco turn every watt of power into long-term shareholder value with no dilution, just compounding Bitcoin.”

 Upgrade Impact

 * Hash-power leap: +30 % versus the legacy fleet, pushing Metavesco into the 25 PH/s+ club.
* Ultra-low production cost: $55 K vs. a Q2-2025 industry median above $70 K. (AInvest)
* Balance-sheet boost: At 0.0124 BTC/day, Metavesco can add ~1 BTC every 80 days
* Treasury tailwind: Over 250 public & private organizations now hold BTC on their books, validating Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. (Cointelegraph) MicroStrategy alone has amassed > 600,000 BTC as of July 14 2025. (Bitcoin Treasuries)
