# $6.8 million grant to expand stroke care in Hawaii

(NewMediaWire) - April 10, 2025 - HONOLULU – Cardiovascular disease, including heart and stroke conditions, is the leading cause of death in Hawaii.[1] The American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, is leading a statewide initiative to strengthen the full spectrum of stroke care across Hawaii with a new multi-million dollar commitment for its Mission: Lifeline Stroke supported by a $5.8 million grant from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust and a commitment of $1 million from the American Heart Association.

 Stroke is the No. 3 cause of death in Hawaii and is the number one cause of disability across the islands.[2] The acute nature of strokes is particularly deadly and requires time-sensitive treatment to save lives and reduce lasting disability. Mission: Lifeline Stroke focuses on connecting all components of acute stroke care into a smoothly integrated system that reinforces the use of evidence-based guidelines to timely and effectively treat stroke patients. It brings together hospitals, emergency medical services and first responders, rehabilitation facilities, communications and regulatory agencies, and state and local government to forge a proactive system of stroke care that saves and improves lives.

 “When it comes to stroke, every second counts,” stated Governor Josh Green, M.D. “As governor and a physician, I am deeply committed to improving healthcare for all our residents. This initiative is a transformative step in ensuring that even our most rural communities have access to lifesaving stroke care. By enhancing coordination among emergency responders, hospitals, and healthcare providers, we can deliver timely and effective treatment to every stroke patient, including rehabilitation and access to post-acute care facilities, no matter where they live.”

 This is the latest in a series of Helmsley grants in Mission: Lifeline’s system of care model for cardiac and stroke care.

 “We believe this program is the best way to significantly enhance stroke care, especially in underserved rural communities,” said Walter Panzirer, a trustee for the Helmsley Charitable Trust.

 The stroke program in Hawaii builds upon the success of similar initiatives funded by the Helmsley Charitable Trust across the country. Since 2010, Helmsley has committed more than $96.7 million to the American Heart Association's mission, playing a foundational role in strengthening statewide systems of care. Their support has advanced Mission: Lifeline STEMI and Stroke projects in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota and Iowa. These efforts are strengthening statewide networks and implementing quality standards in post-acute facilities, ultimately improving patient outcomes and access to lifesaving care for rural and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.

 “The Mission: Lifeline Stroke initiative is a groundbreaking effort to enhance stroke care across the Hawaiian Islands, reinforcing our commitment to advancing equitable health for all,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “We are proud to lead this initiative in collaboration with Hawaii’s leaders, ensuring that patients—regardless of where they live—have access to timely, high-quality stroke care.”

 As a key component to Mission: Lifeline Stroke Hawaii, the Association will increase coordination among 24 hospitals across Hawaii, including the seven certified stroke centers, six additional community hospitals and nine critical access hospitals. Additionally, 18 facilities will implement Post-Acute Stroke Care Quality Standards to improve recovery outcomes. The initiative also focuses on increasing awareness of hypertension and stroke through culturally authentic education resources, addressing higher stroke mortality rates among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.

 Mission: Lifeline Stroke will further strengthen the collaboration with diverse stakeholders across the state representing local hospitals, the Hawaii Stroke Coalition, the Hawaii Department of Health and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) champions to guide a statewide stroke system of care, including:

 * Improved public awareness of the risk factors and symptoms of a stroke and the need to call 911, with focused attention on diverse ethnic populations disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular risk factors and disease
* A coordinated EMS network, well-trained to identify and treat suspected stroke patients quickly and transport them to the most appropriate facility, and early activation of downstream care teams;
* Well-trained hospital staff who are prepared to properly treat stroke patients and transfer, when appropriate, to higher levels of care and high-quality rehabilitation services;
* Coordination and collaboration among hospitals across the islands;
* Seamless discharge to high-quality, post-acute stroke rehabilitation and recovery care;
* Guideline-directed, standardized care in post-acute stroke care facilities to improve recovery and quality of life and skilled nursing facilities certified in post-acute stroke care;
* A sustainable statewide quality improvement data system to monitor patient care, identify successes and areas in need of further improvement and support;
* Robust, collaborative infrastructure for long-term attention to stroke outcomes across the state; and a report to guide future stroke efforts for key stakeholders across the state.
