# Raadr, Doing Business as Telvantis, Transitions From Restructuring to Execution; Launches Phase 2 of Growth Plan

NEW YORK, NY - April 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Raadr Inc. (OTC: $RDAR), doing business as Telvantis (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), today announced the official launch of Phase 2 of its 2025 growth strategy. With the final stage of debt remediation now complete, the company is shifting into full execution mode, prioritizing revenue generation, strategic acquisitions, and sustainable shareholder value creation.

 This milestone marks a turning point in the Telvantis story. Phase 1 focused on stabilizing the company by cleaning up legacy debt, removing shell risk designations, and completing foundational integrations. With those goals accomplished, Telvantis is now entering a new chapter of aggressive expansion and market execution.

 “Phase 2 is all about momentum, discipline, and strategic scaling,” said Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis. “We’ve done the hard work of repositioning the company. Now, we’re building on that foundation by accelerating real revenue, strengthening our operations, and moving closer to our uplisting objectives.”

 Phase 2 priorities

 * Enterprise Revenue Acceleration: Expanding Telvantis’s CPaaS services across fintech, e-commerce, and healthcare sectors with customers already in active onboarding.
* Strategic Acquisitions: Advancing talks with select U.S.-based and international companies that align with Telvantis’s growth and margin expansion objectives.
* Audit Completion & Transparency: Finalizing financial audits to support future filings and uplisting efforts.
* Operational Execution: Optimizing internal systems, processes, and leadership structures for long-term scalability.
* Market Visibility: Delivering more frequent shareholder updates, investor engagement content, and performance milestones.

 “This is the Telvantis we’ve been building toward, streamlined, focused, and ready to scale,” said Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis. “We are executing on a detailed plan and will continue demonstrating results in revenue, operational strength, and shareholder alignment.”

 What’s next

 Following the successful completion of Phase 1 and this week’s announcement of Phase 2, Telvantis will soon share additional financial performance updates, commercial wins, and acquisition progress. This includes the upcoming release of revenue data from February and March and a Q1 2025 performance summary in the coming weeks.
