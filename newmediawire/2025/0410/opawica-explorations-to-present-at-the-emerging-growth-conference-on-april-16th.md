 Of the ten drill holes collected, our team has successfully intersected the iconic Cadillac-Larder fault multiple times, revealing promising mineralization which underscores local understanding of mineralization patterns. The Cadillac-Larder Lake fault is a major structural element in the Abitibi greenstone belt, known for its rich mineralization and geological backbone supporting dozens of commercial mines in the region.

 Sample drill hole OP-25-27 was completed at a depth of 171 m. Between 114 and 156.5 m, we intersected a fine-grained greenish-olive-grey rock. Serecite formation is present throughout, with localized occurrences containing fuschite and silicification pulses, slightly fractured except for a small area between 145.5 and 148.0 m, likely ultramafic, where two small shear zones are observed. Arsenopyrite is present at 1-2% up to 132 m, decreasing to trace levels beyond this depth. Fine pyrite occurs at 1-2% from 148 m onward, with local vein stockwork increasing to 15% from 152 m to 156 m. (see table below).

 The Company undertook XRF readings at the following points

 Conversion factor-1 Part per million (ppm ) = 1 Gram/ton( g/ton )

 * 118.50 m As 2.20%; Au 190 ppm; Ni 1,061 ppm; Cr 4,117 ppm
* 130.50 m As 795 ppm; Au 11 ppm ; Ni 643 ppm; Cr 2,475  ppm
* 143.95 m As 828 ppm ; Au 16 ppm; Ni 1,127 ppm; Cr 1,564 ppm
* 156.00 m As 354 ppm ; Au 8 ppm; Ni 458 ppm ; Cr 109 ppm

 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials such as drill core. XRF analyzers determine the chemistry of a sample by measuring the fluorescent (or secondary) X-ray emitted from a sample when it is excited by a primary X-ray source. The results only provide an indication of the amount of minerals present. Certified assaying of the core samples is still required to accurately determine the amount of base metal and precious metal mineralization.
