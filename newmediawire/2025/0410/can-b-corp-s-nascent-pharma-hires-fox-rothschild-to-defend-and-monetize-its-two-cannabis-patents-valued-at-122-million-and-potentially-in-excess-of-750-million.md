# Can B Corp.'s Nascent Pharma Hires Fox Rothschild to Defend and Monetize Its Two Cannabis Patents Valued at $122 Million and Potentially in Excess of $750 Million

HICKSVILLE, NY - April 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Can B Corp. (OTCQB: CANB) (“Can B” or the “Company”), through Nascent Pharma Holdings, Inc., is a forward-thinking pharmaceutical Intellectual Property (IP) company focused on maximizing the value of its cannabis patent portfolios, today announced it has retained Fox Rothschild, a U.S. based law firm with 30 offices and 1,000 attorneys.

 James Smedley, a Partner at Fox Rothschild, will lead the efforts in monetizing the two cannabis patents owned and controlled by Nascent Pharma.

 The patents were valued at $122 million in December 2020 by an independent third-party valuation team, which used a 90% discount rate due to the emerging nature of the industry. The valuation of the patents included only CBD claims and only in the U.S. Since the date of the valuation, the patents have become effective in several foreign countries and have received one or more additional patents in the U.S. It is believed that if the global THC and CBD markets were added to the valuation, then the value of the patents is potentially up to $750 million.

 Of significance, the patents survived an earlier invalidity challenge in Federal Court. The defendants claim that the patent formulation was a naturally occurring substance (which is not patentable), but the court ruled that it was “UCANN’s handiwork” thereby denying the objection.

 The patents relate to the extraction of pharmaceutically active components from plant materials, and more particularly to the preparation of a botanical drug substance for incorporation into a medicament and for use in pharmaceutical formulations, in particular comprising cannabinoids obtained from cannabis.

 The patents include both a composition of matter patent and a method of use patent. The composition of matter patent covers liquid formulations of cannabis where the present cannabinoids are more than 95% CBD, THC, CBN, CBDa, THCa, or several combinations thereof. This patent covers beverages, tinctures, vape pen liquids and liquid filled capsules. This constitutes a considerable portion of the hemp and cannabis industry, potentially up to 50%.

 The “method-of-use” patent uses some of the composition of matter combinations to potentially manage many debilitating conditions. These include cancer, IBS, chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, sleep disorders and opioid dependencies.
