# Los Angeles Rams add lifesavers to the chain of survival in 22 schools

(NewMediaWire) - April 10, 2025 - LOS ANGELES — The American Heart Association and the Los Angeles Rams gathered representatives from 22 local schools for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training on April 9 in the Rams locker room at SoFi Stadium. According to American Heart Association data, nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning CPR. This event with the Los Angeles Rams is helping to support that critical link in the community,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “As we celebrate 100 years of lifesaving work, we know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 In addition to the training, the Rams are donating resources for schools to bring these lifesaving skills back to their campuses and continue to build confidence and capabilities to respond in cardiac emergency. Nearly two dozen schools received an American Heart Association CPR in Schools kit and five of the schools attending received an AED. The CPR in Schools kits include 10 Hands-Only CPR manikins and 10 AED training tools and curriculum to train additional students, faculty, staff and parents. The attending representatives learned the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use their new resources.

 The Los Angeles area schools receiving CPR in Schools kits are:

 * Alliance Renee & Meyer Luskin Academy
* Animo City of Champions
* Ánimo Leadership High School
* Cabrillo High School
* Cathedral High School
* Eagle Rock Jr-Sr High School
* Fairfax High School
* George Washington Preparatory High School
* Hawthorne High School
* Hawthorne Math And Science Academy
* Highland Elementary School
* Inglewood High School
* John Bosco High School
* John Marshall High School
* John Muir High School
* Kelso Elementary School
* Lennox Academy
* Long Beach Polytechnic High School
* Montebello High School
* Morningside High School
* San Marino High School
* Woodrow Wilson Classical High School

 Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “Providing proper training and equipment to local high school students expands on the Rams commitment to furthering the NFL’s initiative to promote CPR education at all levels of football,” said Johnathan Franklin, Rams senior director of social justice and football development. “With the support of the American Heart Association, the Rams are able to equip more members of the community with lifesaving education and resources. With these tools, we can better respond to emergencies. We are grateful to continue our partnership with the American Heart Association to provide local schools with AED and CPR essentials.”

 In 2023, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.
