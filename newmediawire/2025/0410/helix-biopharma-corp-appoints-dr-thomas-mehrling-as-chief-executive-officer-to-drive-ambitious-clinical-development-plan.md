# Helix BioPharma Corp. Appoints Dr. Thomas Mehrling as Chief Executive Officer to Drive Ambitious Clinical Development Plan

TORONTO, ONTARIO - April 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Helix BioPharma Corp. (TSX: “HBP”, OTC PINK: “HBPCD”, FRANKFURT: “HBP0”) (“Helix” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage oncology company shaping a near future where today’s hard-to-treat cancers are vincible, today announced the appointment of Thomas Mehrling, MD, PhD as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. A sharpening of Helix’s leadership structure, outgoing CEO, Jacek Antas, will dedicate his focus to his role as Chairman of the Company, and Dr. Mehrling, who has shaped Helix’s clinical strategy in his capacity as Chief Medical Officer (“CMO”), takes the helm to deliver on the Company’s ambitious clinical milestones planned for 2025 and beyond.

 A distinguished Hemato-Oncologist and Pharmacologist with over 20 years of experience in pharmaceutical oncology, Dr. Mehrling has a proven track record of building successful, global oncology businesses and delivering transformative therapies to the market. As a key architect of Mundipharma International Ltd.’s European oncology business, Dr. Mehrling served as Head of Business Development (2000–2004), European Director of Oncology (2004-2011), and International Director of Oncology Strategy (2011-2013), introducing groundbreaking cancer drugs across Europe that achieved sales nearing USD 1 billion (DepoCyte® and Levact®, Ribomustin® and Treanda®). In 2013, he led the establishment and took the helm of Mundipharma EDO GmbH, a Swiss-based start-up within the Mundipharma Group dedicated to the development of highly selective inhibitors and targeted medicines for hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In 2019, he founded Laevoroc Medical AG, a privately held, Swiss oncology company, whose asset acquisition by Helix laid the foundations for a broader strategic collaboration between Dr. Mehrling and the Company. Prior to his tenure at Mundipharma, Dr. Mehrling served as Senior Vice President of global CRO Medical Affairs at Staticon International, and as Medical Leader at Takeda European R&D Center. Before his transition to the pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Mehrling spent 13 years as an MD at the University Hospital in Frankfurt, where he earned his MD degree from the Department of Internal Medicine (Hemato-oncology and Cardiology) and his PhD in Pharmacology.

 Dr. Mehrling, CEO of Helix, said, “It’s something I’ve said before, and it’s worth repeating: Helix’s commitment to confronting cancer’s most urgent challenges, with smart innovation and rapid decision-making, is a cause I am deeply aligned with - and one I am honored to now lead as CEO. We plan to enter L-DOS47 with pembrolizumab into a Phase II study this year for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, with other clinical milestones to follow in 2026. We are currently preparing to close a financing deal that will enable us to launch the execution of this plan and to add top minds to our growing world-class team. It’s ambitious, and we are determined to deliver- patients have waited long enough.”

 Chairman Jacek Antas added, “As Helix moves into its next phase of growth, we are laser-focused on building a resilient and agile internal organization to deliver on our ambitious roadmap. Thomas’ leadership and experience are exactly what the Company needs at this important juncture, and I look forward to working closely with him and the rest of our team to achieve our shared goals.”
