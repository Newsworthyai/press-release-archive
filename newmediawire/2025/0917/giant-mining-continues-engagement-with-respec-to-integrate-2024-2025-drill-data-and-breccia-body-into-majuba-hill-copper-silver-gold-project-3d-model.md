# Giant Mining Continues Engagement With RESPEC to Integrate 2024-2025 Drill Data and Breccia Body Into Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project 3D Model

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5 | CSE: BFG.WT.A | CSE: BFG.WT.B) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has continued its engagement with RESPEC Company LLC (“RESPEC”) of Reno, Nevada. RESPEC will incorporate drilling data from the Company’s 2024 diamond core program and the 2025 spring diamond core drilling program (together, the “Core Program”) at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Project (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada.

 This information will be integrated into the Majuba Hill Copper Project 3D Model.

 David Greenway, President and CEO of Giant Mining, commented, “Continuing our engagement with RESPEC is a critical step in advancing Majuba Hill. By integrating the latest core data into the model, we are not only refining the geological model but also strengthening the project’s potential. This work provides a clear path for future drilling, metallurgical studies, and the evaluation of new targets, all of which are essential to unlocking Majuba Hill’s full potential as a significant copper-silver-gold asset in Nevada.”

 Purpose of Engagement

 Building on its mandate, RESPEC’s updated interpretation and technical review of the Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project will incorporate results from the Company’s most recent drill program, including core data from drill holes MHB-30 through MHB-36. This work will refine the geometry of breccia bodies, evaluate the impact of new findings on project potential, and help advance the geologic controls for copper mineralization. In addition, the review will guide the Company’s strategy for further drilling, determine the timing of metallurgical studies, and support the evaluation of new target zones.

 Over the next 3 to 5 weeks, RESPEC will:

 - Consider what changes the new improved model and data will provide for economic potential

 - Integrate recent drilling into the 3D model

 - Improve breccia body geometry in the 3D model.

 - Incorporate silver into the exploration model

 - Evaluate additional target zones, including the Northern Breccia, Ball Park Breccia, and 789 Resistivity Target.

 Strategic Impact

 The updated interpretation will provide Giant Mining with a stronger technical foundation for future economic potential while highlighting the potential of new target zones across the Majuba Hill property. These results will support the Company’s broader strategy of advancing Majuba Hill as a key domestic source of copper and silver at a time of heightened U.S. demand for secure, reshored supply chains.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada, USA - a globally top-ranked mining jurisdiction, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute’s 2022 Annual Survey of Mining Companies.

 Project Size:

9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is located 113 road kilometers (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 kilometers (156 miles) northeast of Reno. It is accessible via well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, followed by a 23-mile drive west. People, roads, power, and water are fundamental considerations for infrastructure, and Majuba Hill already benefits from a strong foundation in all these areas. This existing infrastructure provides a significant advantage, offering substantial cost savings compared to more remote projects.

 History:

Historical Producer

 Drilling:

Approximately 89,395 feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $12.1 Million using current costs.

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:

Secured funding for next phase of drilling at Majuba Hill

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth sample bags and are transported from the Giant Mining secure warehouse to the ALS Labs Sample Prep Facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS Labs then securely transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 5% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining pulps will be retrieved from ALS Labs.
