# Avant Capital Originates $19.49-Million Bridge Loan on Multifamily Portfolio in Winter Springs And Winter Haven, Florida

NEW CANAAN, CT - September 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Avant Capital (“Avant”), a leading Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, today announced it has originated a $19,490,000 bridge loan secured by two multifamily properties in Central Florida: Terra Villa Park, a 41-unit residential and 3-unit commercial mixed-use property located at 154 Tuskawilla Road in Winter Springs, and Terra Hill Apartments, a 76-unit multifamily community located at 3135 Woodhill Road in Winter Haven.

 The multifamily market in Central Florida continues to benefit from strong demographic and economic trends, including robust job growth, in-migration, and sustained housing demand. Winter Springs offers residents a walkable, town center environment in a high-income Orlando suburb, while the Winter Haven property is positioned within a fast-growing market, supported by major employers such as Publix, Walmart, and Lakeland Regional Health. Both properties are well-occupied, with recent capital improvements and further upside from ongoing renovations.

 Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant, said, “This financing exemplifies our core focus on providing flexible capital to experienced multifamily sponsors. Terra Villa Park and Terra Hill are well-located properties in growth markets, and we are pleased to support the sponsor’s business plan as these communities continue to perform.”

 In 2025, Avant is targeting similar projects ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide with a focus on multifamily and industrial assets across high-growth markets such as Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. The company also acquires non-performing loans secured by commercial real estate.
