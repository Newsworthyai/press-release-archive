 “Securing this two-year permit extension is a crucial step in ensuring continuity of our exploration strategy at Gold Mountain,” commented Michale Smith, CEO of Element79 Gold. “We are now positioned to execute on our drill programs and advance the project toward resource development, with the intent of building long-term value for our shareholders.”
