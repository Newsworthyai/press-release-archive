# Skkynet Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results

A Key Highlight is a 475% Increase in Subscription Revenue

 MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO - September 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Skkynet Cloud Systems, Inc. (“Skkynet” or “the Company”) (OTCQB: SKKY), a global leader in industrial software for secure, real-time data connectivity and edge processing, today announced financial results for the third quarter ending July 31, 2025.

 For the nine-month period, sales were essentially flat year-over-year at $1.9 million. The Company reported a modest net loss of $14,105. Despite the flat sales environment, disciplined management of operating expenses resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of $0.2 million. As of July 31, 2025, the Company retained a strong cash position, with $1.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.

 A key highlight of the period was the rapid expansion of the Company’s subscription license business. Subscription revenues grew 475% over the nine-month period, substantially exceeding expectations. This growth underscores the increasing adoption of Skkynet’s solutions and the strength of its recurring revenue business.

 “We are encouraged by the strong growth in subscriptions, which reflects market demand for secure and real-time industrial data connectivity,” said Andrew Thomas, CEO of Skkynet. “Our ability to maintain a strong cash position while investing in product development positions us well for future growth. We remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our clients and maximizing shareholder value with the transition to a subscription-focused business.”

 Looking ahead, Skkynet expects improved performance in the fourth quarter and beyond, supported by subscription license sales momentum and an expanding product portfolio. The Company is preparing to launch a new product focused on artificial intelligence and data contextualization, aimed at enhancing safe, intelligent, and resilient operations across industrial systems, cloud platforms, and AI environments.
