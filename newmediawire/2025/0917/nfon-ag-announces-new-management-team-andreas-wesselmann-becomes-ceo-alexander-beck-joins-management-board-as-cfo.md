# NFON AG Announces New Management Team: Andreas Wesselmann Becomes CEO, Alexander Beck Joins Management Board as CFO

MUNICH - September 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Supervisory Board of NFON AG, a leading European provider of integrated business communications, announces changes to the company’s management: Andreas Wesselmann is to take over as Chairman of the Management Board (CEO) as of 1 October 2025. At the same time, Alexander Beck is joining the Management Board as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

 Previous CEO and CFO Patrik Heider has asked the Supervisory Board to terminate his contract early with effect from 30 September 2025 in order to pursue new professional challenges. The Supervisory Board and the entire company would like to thank Patrik Heider for his great commitment and successful achievements, which have made a significant contribution to NFON’s positive development and growth.

 In his new role as CEO, Andreas Wesselmann, previously Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and a member of the Management Board, will also assume responsibility for the company’s strategic direction as well as for its sales and marketing areas. By bringing together product, technology and market responsibility, innovations will in future be aligned even more closely with customer needs and scaled up more rapidly. Andreas Wesselmann’s contract was extended early by five years until 2030.

 With Alexander Beck, NFON has recruited a proven finance and management expert to the Management Board. He has many years of experience as CFO and managing director as well as international expertise in various sectors. His career has included roles in retail at MediaMarktSaturn, in the software industry at Nemetschek and most recently in the bicycle industry at the Accell Group, where in each case he held senior management positions.

 As CFO, Alexander Beck will be responsible for the company’s financial strategy and, together with Andreas Wesselmann, will advance NFON’s successful development and growth. “With this reorganisation, we are laying the foundation for the next phase of NFON’s growth,” comments Rainer Koppitz, Chairman of the Supervisory Board. “We would like to thank Patrik Heider for his significant contribution to our company’s successful development. At the same time, we are delighted that Andreas Wesselmann, an experienced and visionary manager, is assuming overall responsibility and combining strategic vision with technological excellence. With Alexander Beck, we are also expanding the Management Board team to include an internationally experienced financial manager who will secure and drive sustainable growth and investment strength in the long term.”

 Andreas Wesselmann notes: “I’m very pleased by the trust that has been placed in me and I’m looking forward to working closely with Alexander Beck. Together, we will continue to expand our innovative capabilities, tap new market opportunities and firmly establish NFON as the leading European provider of AI-based business communications. To this end, we will continue to consistently implement the NFON Next 2027 corporate strategy.”This announcement is available for download from the Investor Relations area of the NFON AG website.
