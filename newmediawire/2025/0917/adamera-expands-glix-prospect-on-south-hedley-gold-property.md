# Adamera Expands Glix Prospect on South Hedley Gold Property

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Adamera Minerals Corp. (TSX-V: ADZ; OTC: DDNFF) ("Adamera" or the "Company") continues to expand the Glix Prospect and has identified several additional soil samples with anomalous gold values ranging from 24 to 4,283 ppb* (4.3 g/t) gold. A follow up sampling and prospecting program is underway and geophysical surveys are being planned for the Glix area.

 The Glix prospect is located on the Company’s 100% owned South Hedley claims in British Columbia and is the second prospect delineated on the property this year (the first prospect is called the Max Prospect, see news release dated August 7 and 14, 2025). Adamera will be initiating a Notice of Work (NoW) application under the Mines Act for a drill program to test the two prospects.

 Approximately 2.5 million ounces of gold(1) were reportedly produced in the Hedley Gold Camp. The South Hedley Property is located less than 10 kilometres from Barrick Gold Corp’s past producer, the Nickel Plate Mine.

 The Glix Prospect is a coherent and continuous gold in soil anomaly that currently measures approximately 90 x 50 metres (“m”) and is open for further expansion. The most recent samples from the Glix Prospect were collected to test the north and south limits of the soil anomaly. The sample results strongly suggest the anomaly remains open in all directions except the east, where the anomaly terminates at a prominent north-south trending fault. A crew will be mobilized shortly to attempt to locate a bedrock source for the gold near the 4,283 ppb* sample and further test the lateral limits of the soil anomaly to the north, south and west.

 “This most recent sampling program conducted on the Glix Prospect last week significantly advanced this project. The site with a soil sample containing 4.3 g/t gold, which is the highest gold value recovered on the property to date, will be the focus of immediate prospecting. This is a very high priority for the Company, considering the grade of the samples and how unexplored the area is,” says Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO of Adamera.

 The Glix Prospect is located in an area on the property with favourable geology. Prospecting by Adamera identified an inlier of scapolite-altered clastic and impure calcareous rocks thought to be laterally equivalent to the Late Triassic Hedley Formation, host to the Nickel Plate and Mascot mines to the north. In addition, sulphide mineralization (pyrrhotite-arsenopyrite) in limestone was discovered within 300m of the gold bearing soil samples. The immediate area appears to be unexplored with the exception of reported work to the north in the 1990s.

 Adamera first identified this prospect by reconnaissance soil sampling. First pass sampling returned weakly anomalous fire assay values ranging from 25 to 45 ppb gold. Follow up sampling returned a sample with 419 ppb* gold. Previous follow up sampling identified numerous samples with highly anomalous gold values ranging from 17 to 684 ppb*. Samples with anomalous gold also show significant enrichment in zinc and arsenic which are known to be pathfinder elements at the nearby Nickel Plate and Mascot mines. Gordon Gibson (P.Geo.), qualified person under NI 43-101, is an independent consultant that has reviewed and approved data associated with this release.

 *Soil samples were analyzed in-house using the DetectORETM method for gold, a proprietary process developed by Portable PPB in Australia that allows for rapid gold analysis at ppb levels using a pXRF. The method uses a rigorous QA/QC process whereby a standard rock sample of known gold content is inserted every 30 to 45 samples at the preparation step. This sample is later analysed by the pXRF along with additional control samples that are tested every 20 analyses. The pXRF is fully automated and can analyse up to 180 samples per run. Each sample run using the pXRF is initiated by testing 5 control samples, if any samples do not pass the standard’s specifications, the XRF is immediately calibrated. Samples analyzed using the DetectORETM method report gold content in DetectORE units which represents a calculated ppb value. Selected samples are followed up with fire-assay as a means of calibrating the DetectORETM results, therefore the Company considers DetectORETM gold results to be a semi-quantitative and highly effective exploration advantage. The gold content of the discovery soil sample with 419 ppb* gold was a direct follow up of widely spaced soil samples with 25 to 45 ppb gold determined by fire assay of a 30-gram sample with atomic absorption finish at the Activation Laboratory in Kamloops.
