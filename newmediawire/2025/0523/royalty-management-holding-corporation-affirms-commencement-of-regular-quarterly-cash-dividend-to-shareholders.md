 FISHERS, IN - May 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries reaffirms and reminds its shareholders of the commencement of its initial cash dividend that has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors in the amount of $0.01 per share per year, paid calendar quarterly, starting on June 30, 2025.  Shareholders of the Company as of the record dates of June 30, 2025, September 30, 2025, December 31, 2025, and March 31, 2026, will each receive a quarterly dividend of one-fourth of $0.01 per share, payable within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “We are thankful to be in a strong cash generating position from our core assets to be able to start paying a cash dividend this year to our underlying shareholders.  We wanted to take a quick opportunity to remind our shareholders of the first quarterly payment that will be due to shareholder of record on June 30, 2025, and then calendar quarterly thereafter for the next twelve months.  Furthermore, we believe as a company we need to focus on continual revenue and cash flow growth, returning capital back to our shareholders and stock buybacks. As our market value appreciates, we anticipate shifting more of our excess cash to the payment of dividends, as opposed to our stock repurchase program, and vice-versa.  This may result in our Board of Directors increasing the cash dividend as some of our portfolio holdings increase their returns to the company, which will be announced to the public is such a decision is made. We remain flexible and nimble in order to maximize return to our shareholder over the long term by constantly evaluating market conditions as well as other opportunities for company growth.  To that point, we are evaluating a number of larger cashflow generating opportunities that could catapult the business forward, should we determine it in the best interests of our shareholders to move forward with these opportunities."
