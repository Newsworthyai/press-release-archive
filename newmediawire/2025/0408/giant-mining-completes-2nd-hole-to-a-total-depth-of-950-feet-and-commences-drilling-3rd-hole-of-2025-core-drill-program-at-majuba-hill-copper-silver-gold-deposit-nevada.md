# Giant Mining Completes 2nd Hole to a Total Depth of 950 Feet and Commences Drilling 3rd Hole of 2025 Core Drill Program at Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit, Nevada

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Giant Mining Corp. (CSE: BFG | OTC: BFGFF | FWB: YW5) (“Giant Mining” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that Hole MHB-33 (“MHB-32”) has been successfully drilled to a total depth of 950 feet (289.56 meters). MHB-33 is the second of five holes of the 2025 diamond core drilling program (the “Core Program”), currently underway at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit (“Majuba Hill”) in Pershing County, Nevada.

 As previously stated, the primary objective of the Core Program is to expand the known zones of copper mineralization at Majuba Hill and advance the project toward a new Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).

 David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, commented: "We are excited about the continued success and efficiency of the geological and drilling team during our ongoing drill program. This is another step toward advancing Majuba Hill toward our ultimate goal of a new NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate. The scale and potential of this system continue to impress and the entire team at Giant Mining has never had more conviction in advancing Majuba Hill toward its true potential.”

 Big Sky Exploration, LLC (“Big Sky”) of Eureka, Nevada, successfully completed drilling of Hole MHB-33 and mobilized the drill rig to a new pad where Hole MHB-34 has commenced drilling. MHB-33 was quick-logged and tagged for sampling on-site by Giant Mining geologists (Figure 2), as part of the Company’s efforts to efficiently advance the 2025 Core Program at Majuba Hill.

 The core samples from MHB-32 are being securely transported to Giant Mining’s secured warehouse facility in Elko, Nevada. At this location, the cores will undergo systematic sawing. Following this, the processed samples will be sent to ALS Group USA, Corp. ("ALS Labs") in Elko, Nevada. At ALS Labs, the samples will undergo rigorous analyses, including assays for copper, silver, gold, and other trace elements, to accurately assess the mineral content and support ongoing exploration efforts at Majuba Hill.​

 As previously reported in the March 17, 2025 news release, the 2025 Core Program has been designed to follow up on high-grade copper mineralization intersected in breccias from the 2024 core holes MHB-30 (“MHB-30”) and MHB-31 (“MHB-31”) and extend the high-grade copper zones below the historic underground workings (Figure 3).

 The Company will provide regular updates as the drill program progresses, including assay results, geological observations, and any significant developments encountered during drilling. These updates will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed on the advancement of the Majuba Hill project and its potential to support a future resource estimate.

 Engagement of Blossom Social Inc.

 Giant Mining is pleased to announce it has engaged Blossom Social Inc. ("Blossom"), a leading mobile app platform and social network for investors recognized by Apple as one of the Top 25 Apps for 2025, an Essential Finance App of 2024, and an Essential Social App of 2025.

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Measures, Chain of Custody

 The Company utilizes a QA/QC program using best industry practices at the Majuba Hill Project. The samples are placed in cloth or plastic sample bags and are transported from the Majuba Hill to the Giant Mining secure warehouse for core sawing and processing and then samples are delivered to the ALS Labs sample prep facility in Elko, Nevada. ALS then transports the prepared pulps to their analytical lab in North Vancouver, B.C.

 Drill core samples are sawn in half lengthwise and one half is placed in labeled cloth sample bags. All samples are analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and 33 other elements. Gold is determined by ALS Labs method Au-AA23 which is a fire assay with an AAS finish on a 30-gram split. Copper, silver, and the remaining 31 elements are determined by ALS Labs method ME-ICP61 which is a four-acid digestion and ICP-AES assay. Approximately 5% of the submitted samples are drill duplicates and copper-gold-porphyry commercial standard reference material pulps. The remaining sample pulps are retrieved from ALS Minerals and retained by the Company for future metallurgical testing.

 Majuba Hill’s critically important characteristics are as follows:

 Location:

Nevada, USA - a globally top-ranked mining jurisdiction, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute’s 2022 Annual Survey of Mining Companies.

 Project Size:

9,684 Acres

 Infrastructure:

The Majuba Hill property is 113 road km (70 miles) southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada, and 251 km (156 miles) northeast of Reno.  Access is by well-maintained county roads from the Imlay, Nevada exit on U.S. Interstate 80, and traveling westward 23 miles. People, Roads, Power and Water are the basic elements when considering infrastructure and Majuba Hill already has a solid infrastructure foundation for building a large facility which will provide significant savings compared to more remote projects

 History:

Historical Producer

 Drilling:

83,930 feet of drilling to date. Rough replacement value of drilling USD $10.4 Million in development costs.

 Mineralization:

The project shows indications of a potentially large Cu – Ag +/- Au mineralized body with many features in common with both large porphyry copper, silver, and gold projects.

 Expandability:

The IP survey, deep drilling, and step-out drilling indicate significant expansion potential, with mineralization open in all directions.

 Fully Financed:

Secured funding for 2025 Drilling Campaign
