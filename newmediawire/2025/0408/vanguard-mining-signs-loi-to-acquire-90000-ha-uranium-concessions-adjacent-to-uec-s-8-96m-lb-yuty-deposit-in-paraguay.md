# Vanguard Mining Signs LOI to Acquire 90,000 ha Uranium Concessions Adjacent to UEC's 8.96M lb Yuty Deposit in Paraguay

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 8, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vanguard Mining Corp. ("Vanguard" or the "Company") (UUU: CSE) (RECHF: OTC) (SL5: Frankfurt) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire four (4) concessions: the three (3) San Jose and one (1) Yuty Uno concessions (together, the “Yuty Prometeo” project.) The 4 concessions cover approximately 90,000 hectares (222,395 acres) within the Parana Basin in southeastern Paraguay.

 David Greenway, CEO of Vanguard Mining Corp., commented, "The acquisition of the Yuty Prometeo concessions represents a transformative step forward in Vanguard’s uranium exploration strategy. These highly prospective concessions, located adjacent to UEC’s established Yuty multi-million-pound deposit, position us in one of the most promising uranium regions in South America. We are excited to build on the historical exploration and leverage modern techniques to unlock the project's full potential."

 The terms of the proposed transaction are outlined below (the “Transaction Terms”). Under the LOI, Vanguard will acquire all issued securities of Paraguay Uranium S.A. (“Paraguay Uranium”) from 1302343 BC Ltd., which currently holds an 85% ownership interest. Paraguay Uranium holds an 85% interest in the Yuty Prometeo uranium project, located in southeastern Paraguay, and is the legal and beneficial owner of the concession. These concessions are contiguous to Uranium Energy Corp.’s Yuty Deposit, which hosts Indicated resources of 8.96 million pounds of U₃O₈.

 The Transaction Terms

 The non-binding letter of intent outlines the terms in preparation for a definitive agreement as follows:

 Vanguard may acquire an 85% interest in Paraguay Uranium by providing the following:

 - Payment of $20,000 to Paraguay Uranium upon signing.

 - Issue to the shareholders of Paraguay Uranium, pro rata in proportion to their holdings, an aggregate of 8,000,000 common shares in the capital of Vanguard.

 - Payment of $20,000 to Paraguay Uranium upon Vanguard being issued “Prospecting Permit” which entitles the company to both commence further surface exploration as well as exploration drilling.

 About the Yuty Prometeo Uno Concession

 The Uno Concessions, part of the Yuty Prometeo Project, cover approximately 27,666 hectares (68,368 acres) within the Paraná Basin, and are directly contiguous to UEC’s Yuty Project. To date, 28 drill holes have been completed on the property, returning uranium assay results ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% U₃O₈. Geophysical surveys, drilling data, and surface sampling indicate that the Prometeo block is on trend with UEC’s adjacent Transandes block.

 About the Yuty Prometeo San Jose Concession

 The San Jose Concession, part of the Yuty Prometeo Project, covers approximately 62,210 hectares (153,754 acres) over three (3) concessions and is located along the Upper Permian-Carboniferous contact, about 100 km northwest of UEC’s Yuty Project and 40 km west of its Coronel Oviedo Project. A radiometric car survey conducted over a 40 km by 10 km area identified significant uranium anomalies across the property.

 About UEC’s Yuty ISR Project

 The Yuty ISR Project, owned by UEC, covers approximately 117,359 hectares (290,000 acres) and is located about 200 kilometers east and southeast of Asunción, the capital of Paraguay. Positioned within the Paraná Basin, the area hosts several known uranium deposits, including Figueira and Amorinópolis in Brazil. Preliminary studies indicate the deposit is amenable to in situ recovery (“ISR”) — the same low-cost extraction method UEC successfully employs at its operations in Texas.

 Modern exploration of the Yuty Project began in 1976, when Anschutz Corporation (“Anschutz “) of Denver, Colorado, conducted regional uranium exploration under a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corporation and Taiwan Power Company. Working under an exclusive concession covering 162,700 square kilometers, nearly the entire eastern half of Paraguay, Anschutz identified multiple target areas, including Yuty. From 1976 to 1983, the company drilled approximately 75,000 meters of core and rotary holes, halting further work due to declining uranium prices.

 In July 2006, CUE Resources Ltd. acquired an option on the Yuty Project and launched its own rotary and diamond drilling campaigns. Between 2007 and 2010, CUE completed 256 drill holes totaling 31,000 meters, ultimately acquiring 100% ownership of the project.

 On March 30, 2012, UEC acquired all outstanding shares of CUE Resources Ltd., securing a 100% undivided interest in the Yuty Project.[1]

 Resource Estimates:

 The current disclosed resource for UEC’s Yuty Project is 8.962 million lbs of U308 Indicated, and 2.203 million lbs of U308 Inferred, which has been finalized in a technical report prepared for UEC titled “Yuty Uranium Project Initial Assessment US SEC Subpart 1300 Regulation SK Report, Paraguay SA” dated July 1, 2022.
