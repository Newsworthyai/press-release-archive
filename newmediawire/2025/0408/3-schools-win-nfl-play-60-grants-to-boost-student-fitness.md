# 3 schools win NFL PLAY 60 grants to boost student fitness

(NewMediaWire) - April 08, 2025 - DALLAS — For students to get their health into the endzone, a mix of various cardio and strength exercises that work different parts of the body is ideal for whole body health, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. That is why the American Heart Association and the National Football League (NFL), in collaboration with the 32 teams, held the NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Blitz to get students moving leading up to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans.Three schools, named the national winners of the Exercise Blitz, received $1,000 NFL PLAY 60 grants for improvements to the schools’ physical activity equipment.

 “At the American Heart Association, our future is all about improving yours,” said American Heart Association Chief Executive Officer Nancy Brown. “For 18 years, the American Heart Association and the NFL have teamed up to inspire kids to get moving to support their overall wellness by pairing fun with health fundamentals to drive life-long wellness through NFL PLAY 60. In our century of work, the American Heart Association will continue to be laser focused to propel physical and mental health in children.”

 Douglas Road Elementary in Lambertville, Mich. on behalf of the Detroit Lions, LaMuth Middle School in Painesville, Ohio on behalf of the Cleveland Browns and Cook-Wissahickon School in Philadelphia on behalf of the Philadelphia Eagles are the three winning schools of the NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Blitz. Held from Jan. 27- 31, the Exercise Blitz invited students to complete a 5-day physical activity video series, featuring special guests from the NFL. Teachers tracked student completion of movement minutes and submitted the tracker for an opportunity to receive a grant. The winning three schools were drawn at random.

 Physical activity positively impacts overall mental and physical wellness which is essential to help children reach their full potential[1]. That is why the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, offer a suite of resources to parents, teachers and caregivers to add movement to each day. The NFL PLAY 60 Exercise Library features two-to-three minute exercise videos from each of the 32 NFL teams featuring players, NFL Legends, cheerleaders and mascots. The free NFL PLAY 60 app allows users to select their favorite team and control personalized avatars onscreen with their own physical movement. Users can create custom workouts and earn special PLAY points and unlock cool NFL gear for on-screen PLAY 60 avatars.

 “Every year, NFL PLAY 60 helps students across the country achieve their daily goal of 60 minutes of play through the innovative and engaging NFL PLAY 60 app,” said NFL Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility Anna Isaacson. “We look forward to continuing to work with our partners at the American Heart Association to provide students with resources they need to lead healthy lifestyles.”

 Rooted in American Heart Association science, the NFL PLAY 60 initiative helps children to develop healthy habits for a better chance of a healthy adulthood.
