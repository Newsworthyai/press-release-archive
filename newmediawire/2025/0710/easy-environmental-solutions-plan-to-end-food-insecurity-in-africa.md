# Easy Environmental Solutions Plan To End Food Insecurity In Africa

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. (OTC: DUTV), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Formerly known as Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. and listed under the same name, Easy Environmental Solutions is on a mission to improve food security, promote sustainable forms of agriculture, create access to clean water and renewable energy and work toward a net carbon-neutral future.

 One of its main focuses is on ending hunger in Africa, where millions of people are starving. Easy Environmental Solution is leveraging Terreplenish, the company’s organic microbial fertilizer that is made from recycled food and crop waste and is targeted at lifeless, unproductive soil, to meet that end. The product, which can process two tons of biomass per hour, works by introducing beneficial microbes into the soil.

 “It would be like if you could get 20% more rainfall,” Gaalswyk told Benzinga. “When you're looking in Africa where you’ve got a lack of fertilizer and you’ve got 20% less rainfall, it’s a game changer. We really believe it's a solution for starvation in all of Africa.”

 Hand-in-hand with Terreplenish is the company’s Easy FEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System. Easy Environmental Solutions describes it as a decentralized, fully automatic “Fertilizer Plant in a Box” that can be deployed at rural agricultural co-ops and communities all over the world. The company just received a deposit from an African client to deploy the EasyFEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System.
