# From Fighting Inflammation To Regenerating Cells: How Jupiter Neurosciences Is Putting The Pep Back In Our Step As We Age

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - July 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Christer Rosen, chairman & CEO of Jupiter Neurosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Jupiter Neurosciences is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation, with a current focus on central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and rare diseases. The company also has a direct-to-consumer longevity product line called Nugevia™, which is aimed at generating near-term revenue while maintaining momentum in its clinical pipeline.

 At the heart of Jupiter Neurosciences' business is JOTROL™, which is an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. The company said a phase 1 trial showed it to achieve blood plasma levels 8-10-fold higher than naïve resveratrol.

 “I like cash flow and biotech is not cash flow,” Rosen told Benzinga about the company’s direct-to-consumer line. “You hope you get good results, you raise some money and you hope for good results.” Nugevia's first three formulations target mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within" and will be sold via a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model starting in the third quarter. “The longevity and aging market is exploding,” says Rosen.

 Jupiter Neurosciences is going after CNS diseases and the longevity markets because of multi-functional benefits. On the one hand, it can reduce and potentially eliminate inflammation, which is key to treating brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's, says Rosen. It can also increase mitochondria, which regenerate cells.
