# ABVC BioPharma Receives $150K Milestone From AiBtl, Bringing Total Licensing Revenue to $846K Across Strategic Partnerships

Licensing-first Strategy Continues to Deliver Non-dilutive Revenue; ABVC Positions Itself as a Leader in CNS-focused Botanical Therapeutics

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - July 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today announced that it has received a $150,000 cash licensing payment from AiBtl BioPharma Inc., one of its key strategic partners, as part of a broader licensing agreement signed earlier this year.

 The payment marks a significant milestone in the continuing commercialization of ABVC’s late-stage drug candidates ABV-1504 and ABV-1505, which are being developed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) respectively. Both candidates have completed Phase II and Phase IIB clinical trials and hold active INDs with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

 “This milestone payment reflects the accelerating momentum behind our global licensing strategy and validates the value of our late-stage clinical assets,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC Chief Executive Officer. “Our partnership with AiBtl exemplifies how we are strategically collaborating with innovation-focused companies to bring our botanical therapies to market worldwide.”

 Cumulative Licensing Milestone

 To date, AiBtl BioPharma has paid a total of $350,000 in cash milestone licensing fees to ABVC. Including earlier payments from other strategic partners such as ForSeeCon and OncoX, ABVC has received a cumulative total of $846,000 in non-dilutive licensing income. These milestone payments reflect growing interest in ABVC’s late-stage botanical drug portfolio and reinforce the Company’s capital-efficient, partnership-driven business model.

 Strengthening a Global Platform for Botanical Innovation

 Over the past six months, ABVC has successfully executed licensing agreements with multiple partners across North America and Asia, including:

 AiBtl BioPharma Inc. - Licensed ABV-1504 and ABV-1505 for global development and commercialization, for which ABVC will receive equity, cash milestone payments, and royalties. ABVC and its subsidiary BioLite Inc. received 46M AiBtl shares, and are eligible for potential $7M cash payment, and royalties up to $200M after the product launches.

 ForSeeCon Eye Corporation - Secured a license for ophthalmic indications under ABVC’s botanical IP platform. ABVC and its subsidiaries BioFirst Corporation have received 10M ForSeeCon shares, and are eligible for potential $7M cash payment, and royalties up to $120M after the product launches.

 OncoX BioPharma, Inc. - Entered into a deal to expand botanical innovation into the oncology space. ABVC and its subsidiaries BioLite Inc. and Rgene Corporation are received up to 10M OncoX shares, and are eligible for potential $5M cash payment, and royalties up to $50M after the product launches.

 These deals are aligned with ABVC’s asset-light business model, focusing on developing innovative botanical drugs through Phase II/III, and licensing out clinical-stage products to commercial partners for global expansion.

 Outlook and Commitment to Shareholder Value

 This $150,000 payment is part of a larger milestone and royalty structure that is expected to contribute significantly to ABVC’s 2025 revenue stream. The company previously announced a 234% increase in annual revenue and a 77% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, reflecting its capital-efficient approach and licensing-driven growth. These improvements reflect ABVC’s pivot toward a licensing-first strategy, which is designed to generate recurring milestone income and reduce the need for dilutive fundraising.

 “Our licensing-first strategy is working, and today’s payment is one of several anticipated milestone payments as partners progress clinical development activities under our licensing agreements,” added Dr. Patil. “We remain committed to creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders through focused innovation, smart partnerships, and disciplined execution.”

 Addressing a Global Need for CNS Therapies

 The growing demand for alternative and effective treatments for CNS disorders has become more urgent globally. According to The Daily Telegraph (July 7, 2025), Australia is currently facing a serious drug shortage, with nearly 300,000 patients expected to be affected, potentially driving some to seek medication through illegal channels. ABVC and AiBtl's progress in botanical drug development could offer a timely and legal therapeutic alternative to vulnerable patient populations in need.[1]
