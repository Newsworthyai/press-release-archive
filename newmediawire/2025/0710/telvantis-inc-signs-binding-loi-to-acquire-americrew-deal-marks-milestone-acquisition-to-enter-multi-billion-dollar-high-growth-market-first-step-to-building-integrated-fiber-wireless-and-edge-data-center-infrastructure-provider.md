# Telvantis Inc. Signs Binding LOI to Acquire AmeriCrew; Deal Marks Milestone Acquisition to Enter Multi Billion Dollar High Growth Market; First Step to Building Integrated Fiber, Wireless and Edge Data Center Infrastructure Provider

NEW YORK, NY - July 10, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Telvantis Inc., formerly Raadr, Inc. (OTC: RDAR) (“Telvantis” or the “Company”), a Florida-based technology-driven telecommunications and enterprise solutions provider and AmeriCrew Inc. (OTC: ARCU), a New Jersey-based corporation, today announced the signing of a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire all of AmeriCrew’s operating businesses.

 The acquisition of AmeriCrew’s operating entities will mark the first transaction of the Company’s US-based acquisition strategy. AmeriCrew operates on a unique veteran employment and apprenticeship model that supports the communities it services with a scalable, high-quality workforce model.

 The combined companies will continue to rapidly expand their US footprint in the fiber, 5G wireless connectivity and edge-datacenter space. The new company’s strategy involves entry into selected high growth markets for local data infrastructure and edge computation to support emerging applications such as AI, crypto mining and localized data platforms. The intention is to rapidly become a dominant, integrated player in the construction, operation ownership of such local communication infrastructure and networks. According to independent research, the edge computation market alone will grow at an annual rate of more than 30% over the coming years and is expected to reach $43 billion by 2030.

 AmeriCrew’s to-be-acquired entities are expected to exceed $12 million in revenues at substantial profit margins this year. 2026 expected revenues for the businesses are substantially higher. No common equity is expected to be issued as a part of the transaction. The acquired entities will retain their very experienced management team and operate mainly independent from the holding company.

 The Closing of the acquisition and final purchase price details are subject to final negotiations, as well as a variety of customary conditions and approvals.

 “This acquisition marks a true milestone for our business. Americrew is the anchor-acquisition for our vision to build a fully integrated wireless and fiber infrastructure provider,” commented Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis Inc. “The opportunity to enter such a dynamic growth market with an experienced team, aligned values and a strong commercial pipeline is very unique,” added Contreras.

 “Bringing Kelley Dunne, Brian Weis and the entire AmeriCrew team on board is a game changer for our group. We are very excited about this step and the various tools we can provide AmeriCrew to accelerate our company’s growth,” added Conteras.

 “We believe that the deployment of private fiber and 5G Fixed Wireless access networks in communities, anchored by edge data compute capabilities, will be one the next areas of expansive growth in our industry,” commented Kelley Dunne, CEO of AmeriCrew Inc. “We are seeing a lot of commercial momentum right now for a turn-key entity to deploy, own and operate these types of networks with our real estate and commercial partners,” elaborated Dunne.

 “The industry feedback is already overwhelmingly positive and together with Telvantis we have a strategic opportunity to be at the forefront of this massive growth in edge computation and local private networks,” concluded Dunne.

 “AmeriCrew’s strong commercials, know-how and industry network is a phenomenal addition to our group,” commented Daniel Gilcher, CFO of Telvantis Inc. “This will not only strengthen and accelerate our uplisting appeal and but also increase the value to our shareholders immediately,” added Gilcher.

 “This acquisition is the first addition to the group and we are working on a series of others. We are very confident to close the AmeriCrew transaction over the coming weeks,” added Gilcher.

 The Company aims to provide a strategic update to shareholders and investors over the coming weeks.
