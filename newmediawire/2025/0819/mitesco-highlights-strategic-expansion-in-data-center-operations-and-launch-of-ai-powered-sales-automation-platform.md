# Mitesco Highlights Strategic Expansion in Data Center Operations and Launch of AI-Powered Sales Automation Platform

VERO BEACH, FLORIDA - August 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mitesco, Inc. (OTC: MITI, www.mitescoinc.com), a growth-focused technology company, today announced key developments in its business strategy, including expansion of its data center footprint and the upcoming launch of “Robo Agent” - an AI-driven sales automation platform designed to enhance productivity in the residential real estate sector.

 Robo Agent will debut as an integrated add-on module within the Follow Up Boss™ CRM, widely adopted by residential real estate professionals, and now a part of Zillow Group. With more than 3 million agents across the U.S., according to the National Association of Realtors, the addressable market presents a significant revenue opportunity.

 Corporate Developments and Capital Market StrategyThe company’s shares are now trading on the OTC-QB Venture Market, reflecting renewed investor confidence and improving volume trends.

 “We view the recent uptick in share activity as an encouraging signal,” said Mack Leath, CEO of Mitesco. “With continued operational execution, our mid-term goal is an uplisting to NASDAQ or a senior exchange, better positioning the company for institutional interest and aligning with shareholder expectations. We are also evaluating strategic international listings as part of broader M&A initiatives in growth markets - particularly those advancing cloud infrastructure and AI-driven productivity tools.”

 Mitesco remains active in its acquisition strategy, targeting complementary businesses in software, data center services, and emerging tech verticals that enhance scale and support long-term margin expansion.

 Centcore Data Center: Scaling Infrastructure and Market AdoptionCentcore (www.centcoreusa.com), Mitesco’s cloud infrastructure division, reported increased active user engagement in Q2, with strong momentum from SMB and municipal sectors seeking reliable remote backup solutions.

 “The traction we’re seeing validates the channel partnership model we’ve built,” said Brian Valania, General Manager of Centcore. “One standout is Accucom, our lead systems support team for the Melbourne, FL facility. Their presence in the municipal sector has been pivotal in driving recurring business and supporting our operational scalability.”

 Centcore’s infrastructure meets rigorous compliance standards (SOC 2, Tier 3+, CJIS), providing enterprise-grade security and reliability to a broad range of customers.

 AI Strategy: Robo Agent Accelerates Real Estate ProductivityThe Robo Agent platform has entered a private preview phase with agents from leading brokerages, including Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Sotheby’s, EXP Realty, and Caldwell Banker. Early feedback suggests strong demand for automated client outreach tools that integrate seamlessly into daily workflows.

 “The Q4 launch is on track,” Valania noted. “Our initial version will serve as an extension to the Follow Up Boss™ platform. Unlike standalone tools, Robo Agent operates with the agent’s existing CRM, minimizing adoption friction while driving measurable productivity gains. With over 200,000 agents already within Zillow’s Premier Agent network, we're positioning Robo Agent for rapid adoption.”
