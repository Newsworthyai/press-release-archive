# Protect your loved ones by learning the truth about estate planning

(NewMediaWire) - August 19, 2025 - DALLAS — Despite 83% of Americans saying they recognize the importance of estate planning, only 31% say they actually have a will—leaving loved ones vulnerable to legal delays, unexpected costs and unnecessary stress, according to Trust & Will.[1] To close this critical gap, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, invites consumers to learn more about their options during a free webinar during National Make-a-Will Month this month. The one-hour session will take place on Wednesday, Aug. 27, at 2 pm (ET) / 1 pm (CT) / 11 am (PT). Participants will learn the truth behind common estate planning myths and gain practical knowledge to help secure their future.

 “Estate planning ensures your voice is heard, supports your loved ones and allows you to leave a legacy that reflects your values. This webinar gives people the knowledge and tools to take that important step.” said Lee Shapiro, volunteer chair of the American Heart Association and managing partner and co-founder at 7wireVentures, an investment firm headquartered in Chicago.

 The online workshop will feature nationally recognized estate planning professionals Lindsey Weinberg Esq., estate planning attorney and partner at The Laiderman Law Firm, and Andrew Fussner Esq., national vice president of estate settlement at the American Heart Association. These experts will share practical guidance on steps consumers can take to achieve financial stability and long-term plans. The session is designed to equip participants with the clarity and confidence necessary to make informed decisions about their financial future and legacy planning. Attendees will also learn how to create estate plans that reflect their personal values as well as how to avoid costly mistakes. Participants will receive free educational materials with registration along with complimentary, no-obligation estate preparation tools.

 The Heart Association also offers a suite of additional, simple, free online planning tools through FreeWill. Using this platform, anyone anywhere can create a legally binding will in as little as 20 minutes and take the first step toward protecting their loved ones and financial legacy.

 The American Heart Association believes planned giving is a powerful way to create lasting impact and support causes that are personally meaningful. Donations contributed through a will, trust or another type of estate plan will support the Heart Association's 2028 Impact Goal, which help drive innovative breakthroughs and implement proven solutions in science, public policy and quality of care creating healthier people and communities nationwide. Heart Association donors who choose to give a legacy gift through charitable financial planning are also recognized for their leadership as members of the prestigious Paul Dudley White Legacy Circle, a designation within the Cor Vitae Society, named in tribute to one of the Heart Association’s visionary founders and a pioneer of preventive cardiology.
