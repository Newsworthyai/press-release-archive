# PufCreativ Launches PufCreativ Cares to Expand Charitable Impact Across Cannabis and Wellness, Celebrating Millions Raised for Good Causes

Leading Creative Agency to Partner with HoliHub for National Recovery Month in September

 DENVER, COLORADO - August 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - PufCreativ, a full-service cannabis marketing agency blending award-winning creative with data-driven strategy to empower brands shaping the future of cannabis and wellness, announced today the launch of PufCreativ Cares, the company’s charitable arm uniting all of its giving initiatives under one banner.

 From its founding in 2017, PufCreativ has integrated philanthropy into its business model, helping to raise more than $12 million for nonprofits across the cannabis, wellness, and advocacy spaces. Through PufCreativ Cares, the company will expand its reach and inspire more industry peers to contribute to causes that matter, particularly those supporting equity, wellness, and community impact. Past charitable partners include Companies Doing Good, Cannabis Impact Fund, and the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault.

 This September, in honor of National Recovery Month, PufCreativ is partnering with HoliHub, a Denver-based, peer-run nonprofit redefining recovery through inclusive, community-led healing. HoliHub’s programs combine group support, one-on-one counseling, and a wide range of holistic services that are all delivered through an accessible, sliding-scale model. In under a year, HoliHub has supported more than 500 individuals and achieved an 83% return rate, signaling deep community trust.

 "This partnership with HoliHub is a full-circle moment for me and PufCreativ,” said CEO John Shute. “Over the years, I’ve seen friends and family struggle with opiate addiction, and those experiences inspired me to pursue a career in cannabis more than a decade ago. Founding PufCreativ and launching PufCreativ Cares allows me to combine my passion for the industry with a mission to uplift communities, and supporting accessible, inclusive recovery programs is a natural extension of that commitment."

 Funds raised during the Recovery Month campaign will go directly toward expanding HoliHub’s services, building bridges between recovery and alternative wellness communities, and championing inclusive, stigma-free pathways to healing.

 “Our partnership with PufCreativ represents a vital shift in how we talk about recovery, moving beyond stigma to a place of understanding and compassion,” said Shimi Mermelstein, Founder and Executive Director of HoliHub. “Recovery is diverse, complex, and deeply personal. Together, we’re opening the door for all voices to be heard, honored, and supported. That is true progress.”

 PufCreativ’s clients include licensed dispensaries, product brands, multi-state operators, nonprofits, and advocacy groups, as well as health and wellness brands entering the alternative medicine space. The company also works with women-led, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)–led, LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual)–led, and equity-focused teams, along with industry service providers, consultants, and legal professionals.
