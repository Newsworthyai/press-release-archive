# Longevity In A Capsule: Jupiter Neurosciences Launches First Three Supplements Under Nugevia™ Brand

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Jupiter Neurosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing JOTROL™ – an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects – is solidifying its two-pronged business approach with the launch of Nugevia™, its direct-to-consumer longevity product line.

 Nugevia leverages JOTROL to improve mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within." It’s a big milestone for Jupiter Neurosciences as it harmonizes its strategy to developing drugs to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders and rare diseases, while developing a direct-to-consumer (DTC) arm to drive revenue and cashflow, reducing its dependency on the slower clinical process in which it can take years for a drug to go from the developmental stage to the market.

 Nugevia is that direct-to-consumer play, and addresses a big market, as people around the world seek to not only live longer but improve their quality of life as they do it.

 The scientifically backed longevity market is booming and is expected to experience significant growth in the years to come. Back in 2023, it was worth $65 billion, and it’s projected to hit $314 billion by 2030. When you combine mind, beauty and energy, Jupiter Neurosciences pegs the addressable market at $8 trillion.

 Longevity In A Bottle

 Nugevia’s products, which are powered by the underlying patent-protected resveratrol formulation, JOTROL, are backed by more than eight years of pharmaceutical development. JOTROL is designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. In addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, resveratrol activates PARP-1 – an important protein in DNA repair and stress response – improves cardiovascular health, enhances cognitive function and is antibacterial and antiviral against food-borne pathogens.

 "The launch of Nugevia is the natural next step in translating our science into broad, real-world impact," said Christer Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Jupiter Neurosciences. "By building on the same proprietary technology platform that underpins our prescription drug development, we're delivering a differentiated consumer offering with unmatched bioavailability and scientific credibility."

 Nugevia's first three formulations, which the company just launched, target mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within" and will be sold via a DTC model. The company says what sets it apart from single-ingredient supplements is that Nugevia features precision-engineered "intelligent stacking" of synergistic compounds designed to enhance cellular resilience, support blood-brain barrier delivery and promote system-wide optimization.

 Take Nugevia GLO, for starters. Jupiter Neurosciences says GLO is a daily supplement designed to support radiant, resilient skin from the inside out by promoting cellular defense, collagen integrity and hydration. Then there is Nugevia PWR, a daily mitochondrial health supplement scientifically formulated to support cellular energy, endurance and recovery. Meanwhile, Nugevia MND is a scientifically formulated supplement designed to protect and enhance cognitive function and support overall brain health. All three will be available directly to consumers this fall.

 Jupiter Neurosciences is targeting the skin, mitochondrial health and mental clarity with its first three products because those are areas of the longevity market that it says are seeing a lot of interest and demand. That’s particularly true of MND, which helps improve brain health.

 "My mother passed away from Alzheimer's Disease making this particular product one that holds a deep sense of obligation and importance to me,” said Rosen. “Additionally, Jupiter's former CFO ultimately lost his fight to Parkinson's Disease. This is personal, this is important and based on our JOTROL pharmaceutical pre-clinical and clinical date we are here to bring what we believe is the best cognition product to the market."

 Brand Ambassador On Board

 To get the word out about Nugevia and build brand awareness, Jupiter Neurosciences just named its first brand ambassador - professional golfer Annika Sörenstam. Sörenstam has won over 95 international tournaments including 72 LPGA titles and 10 major championships.

 Rosen said Sorenstam is the perfect spokesperson for Nugevia given her long career in golf. "As someone who has remained competitive well beyond her touring years, Annika is a powerful advocate for our mission to support healthy aging and optimal function at any stage of life,” said Rosen.

 Sörenstam will work with the company to get the word out about Nugevia and the science that backs its product line. “I have a strong interest in living a healthy, active lifestyle, and as a professional athlete, when I use a product, I want to know that there is strong science behind it. I found this to be the case with Nugevia," said Sörenstam.

 When it comes to most clinical-stage pharmaceutical companies, it takes years to realize revenue as they wait for their drugs to make it to the market. Jupiter Neurosciences is turning that on its head, leveraging JOTROL to develop a line of direct-to-consumer supplements that brings its revenue today while developing treatments for tomorrow. With what the company says is eight years of science to back it up and a famous golfer to get the word out, its new line of longevity products could serve to invigorate its business, and the company warrants a closer look.
