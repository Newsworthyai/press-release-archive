# GeoVax Provides Update on BARDA Project NextGen and Outlines 2025 Business Momentum

Company Reaffirms Commitment to Innovation in COVID-19, Oncology, and Biosecurity Amid Strategic Program Developments

 ATLANTA, GA - April 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today addressed the termination of its Project NextGen (PNG) award by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), effective April 11, 2025. The Company also provided a comprehensive business update across its core programs, including the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (GEO-CM04S1), cancer immunotherapy (Gedeptin®), Mpox/smallpox vaccine (GEO-MVA), and advanced MVA manufacturing process.

 GeoVax expressed disappointment in the HHS/BARDA action but remains committed to the critical medical need addressed by GEO-CM04S1, particularly among the more than 40 million immunocompromised Americans - and over 400 million people globally - who remain inadequately protected by the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines.  Thus far, clinical data in support of GEO-CM04S1 demonstrate encouraging support of the potential of GEO-CM04S1 for providing (a) more robust immune response, (b) increased durability and (c) protective immunity for those patients with depleted immune systems inadequately responding to the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines.

 The Company also noted recent public statements by HHS leadership acknowledging the potential enhanced value of multi-antigen vaccines addressing respiratory viruses.  Of special note is that GEO-CM04S1 was the only multi-antigen/polyvalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate selected under the PNG initiative.

 “While the recent HHS/BARDA Stop Work Order action was disappointing and surprising, our commitment to protecting vulnerable populations remains unchanged, and our clinical momentum is strong in support of our ongoing Phase 2 GEO-CM04S1 programs,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax.

 Continued Progress Across a Catalyst-Rich Pipeline

 GEO-CM04S1: Advancing to Meet Unmet COVID-19 Needs

 GEO-CM04S1 continues to demonstrate potential as both a primary and booster vaccine, especially in immunocompromised patients. Key milestones anticipated during 2025 include:

 * Healthy Adult Booster Trial - Enrollment is complete; data readout expected in H1 2025.
* CLL Patient Study (Immunocompromised patient study) - Ongoing enrollment; interim results resulted in continuation of the GEO-CM04S1 arm, whereas the Data Safety Review Board recommended early termination of the mRNA arm, which was subsequently implemented.
* Stem Cell Transplant/CAR-T Trial (Immunocompromised patient study) - Enrollment and evaluation continue among hematological patients receiving stem cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy, comparing GEO-CM04S1 to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

 GEO-CM04S1 is a multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine, utilizing a synthetic-MVA platform, expressing both S and N antigens, offering the potential for broader, more durable protection than current mRNA vaccines.

 Gedeptin®: Advancing into Phase 2 in Solid Tumors

 GeoVax’s oncology program, utilizing the Gedeptin® technology, is planned to progress to a Phase 2 trial in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor for first recurrent head and neck cancer. Gedeptin has received Orphan Drug designation for use among advanced head & neck cancer patients.  The Gedeptin technology provides potential for expansion into other solid tumors including triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.

 GEO-MVA: Addressing Biosecurity and Global Vaccine Equity

 GeoVax anticipates initiating clinical trials in 2025 for GEO-MVA, its Mpox/smallpox vaccine candidate. The Company has successfully produced cGMP clinical product and is focused on completing the vaccine vialing in support of initiating clinical evaluation during H2 2025.  GEO-MVA positions GeoVax to offer a U.S.-developed alternative to foreign-sourced vaccines amid rising global biosecurity threats and constrained supply.

 Advanced Manufacturing: Scaling MVA for Global Reach

 GeoVax is advancing continuous cell line manufacturing for MVA-based vaccines, offering a path to scalable, cost-effective production - including localized manufacturing for low- and middle-income countries. This innovation addresses critical gaps in vaccine self-sufficiency and supply resilience.

 Outlook for 2025

 Despite the PNG award termination, GeoVax anticipates a milestone-rich 2025 across its portfolio. The Company will continue to engage with government and industry partners, pursue clinical trial completions, and drive innovation through expanded AI integration to optimize development, trial operations, and manufacturing efficiency.

 “Our scientific foundation is strong and our strategy is clear,” added Dodd. “GeoVax remains committed to delivering transformative solutions for unmet medical needs in infectious disease and cancer. We’re advancing with purpose and fully prepared to deliver on the promise of our development program.”
