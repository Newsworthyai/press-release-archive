# Quantumzyme Highlights Enzyme Engineering Platform and Ongoing Work in Sustainable Ibuprofen Synthesis

SAN DIEGO, CA - April 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantumzyme Corp. (OTC: QTZM), a biotechnology company leveraging computational enzyme engineering, is providing insight into the company’s enzymatic design capabilities and current areas of research-particularly in the field of sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing.

 As part of its green chemistry initiatives, Quantumzyme has been evaluating enzyme-based methods to reduce the environmental footprint of common small molecule drug production. One area of focus has been the development of an enzyme-driven approach to ibuprofen synthesis. Ibuprofen, a widely used anti-inflammatory and pain relief medication, is typically produced through multi-step chemical processes that involve hazardous reagents and generate significant chemical waste.

 “At Quantumzyme, we’re exploring how computationally designed enzymes can be used to reimagine traditional chemical processes,” stated Naveen Kulkarni, CEO of Quantumzyme. “While our work on ibuprofen synthesis continues to evolve, it illustrates the potential of enzyme catalysis to reduce complexity and environmental impact in pharmaceutical manufacturing.”

 The company’s enzyme discovery efforts center on its proprietary in silico platform, which integrates structural modeling, molecular docking, and virtual screening to identify enzymes with high specificity and stability for industrially relevant reactions. In the case of ibuprofen, Quantumzyme’s team screened 22 candidate enzymes and identified a promising variant- bcPADH from Burkholderia cenocepacia- capable of converting a key intermediate (ibuprofen aldehyde) into the final active pharmaceutical ingredient under lab conditions.

 By using bacterial systems to express and optimize this enzyme, the company has been able to achieve high conversion efficiency and purity, under safer, low-energy conditions. Importantly, this method avoids the use of harsh substances such as hydrofluoric acid, carbon monoxide, and pyrophoric metals commonly found in traditional synthesis routes.

 While Quantumzyme’s current research around ibuprofen is one application, the platform is being developed to support a wide range of use cases across pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, agrochemicals, and biofuels. The company’s strategy focuses on applying green chemistry principles to reduce hazardous inputs, minimize waste, and improve process efficiency across sectors.

 “This is about more than one molecule,” added Kulkarni. “We’re building a platform that can be applied broadly- wherever sustainable, precise biocatalysis can offer value over conventional chemistry.”

 Quantumzyme continues to optimize its enzyme systems and evaluate potential commercial pathways for future deployment. We are presently assessing scale-up feasibility and industry integration for our enzyme-enabled solutions.
