# Neuralbase Announces Global Market Engagement Strategy Amid Expansion of Technical Leadership Team

LAS VEGAS, NV - June 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neuralbase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), a developer of enterprise AI solutions for regulated industries operating under the brand BMP AI, today announced the initiation of its global industry engagement program, with the first selected engagement being participation at the upcoming Global AI Show Abu Dhabi in late 2025.

 As part of the Company's expanded growth strategy, Neuralbase AI has recently appointed key personnel to advance the continued development of its BMP AI platform and position the Company for broader international exposure:

 * Tushar Shivekar has been appointed Chief Technology Officer, bringing over 14 years of experience in software engineering, automation, and enterprise AI deployment. Mr. Shivekar leads Neuralbase AI’s technical strategy, engineering operations, and product development.
* Suraj Sharma has been appointed Head of Design and Frontend Development, bringing more than a decade of expertise in UX architecture, AI product design, and conversational interface development. Mr. Sharma oversees the design and frontend strategy for Neuralbase AI’s BMP AI platform.

 Neuralbase AI’s BMP AI platform delivers document-grounded, compliance-first AI solutions built for enterprises operating in highly regulated sectors. The platform integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), document ingestion, auditability, security governance, and explainability tooling - allowing enterprises to safely integrate AI-powered assistants into business operations while maintaining strict compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, and evolving AI governance frameworks.

 In connection with these appointments, the Company is executing a global conference participation plan to engage with enterprise customers, industry partners, and government agencies operating in regulated sectors such as healthcare, financial services, legal services, and public sector AI deployment. The Company’s global engagement strategy is designed to position Neuralbase AI within key enterprise AI, compliance technology, and regulated industry ecosystems across North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Participation in these forums provides access to enterprise AI buyers, regulatory agencies, technology partners, and industry stakeholders evaluating next-generation AI governance and document-grounded platforms.

 The Global AI Show Abu Dhabi represents the first of several international industry events Neuralbase AI intends to participate in as part of this market-facing initiative. Company representatives will attend and engage with enterprise and governmental stakeholders to evaluate emerging market opportunities and strategic partnerships.

 “With the addition of key technical leadership and the initiation of our global conference participation strategy, we are proactively positioning Neuralbase AI to engage with enterprise customers, regulatory stakeholders, and strategic partners across international markets,” said Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of Neuralbase AI Ltd. “These efforts directly support our long-term focus on building a trusted, compliance-first enterprise AI platform for regulated industries worldwide.”

 The Company expects to evaluate participation in additional enterprise AI conferences across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific throughout the remainder of 2025, 2026 and beyond, as part of its ongoing market engagement program.
