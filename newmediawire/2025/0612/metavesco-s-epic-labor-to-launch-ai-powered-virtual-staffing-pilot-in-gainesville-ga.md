# Metavesco's Epic Labor to Launch AI-Powered Virtual Staffing Pilot in Gainesville, GA

CUMMING, GA - June 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) today announced the upcoming launch of a cutting-edge, AI-powered virtual staffing “branch” in Gainesville, Georgia, marking a major step in the company’s rapid expansion strategy. This pilot program aims to leverage machine-learning algorithms and generative AI to source, screen, dispatch, and manage qualified labor in real time, without the overhead of a traditional physical office.

 “We’ve spent the last two months testing a number of AI powered services that I believe can change the game for on-demand staffing models,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “By embedding AI at every touchpoint, from candidate matching and demand forecasting to 24/7 client chatbots and automated scheduling, we can not only slash expansion costs, but also turbo charge our ability to scale.”

 Key Goals of the Gainesville AI Pilot

 * Automated Talent Sourcing & Screening: Advanced resume parsing AI will identify and rank the best local candidates within minutes, cutting time-to-fill by up to 60%.
* Predictive Demand Forecasting: Machine-learning models analyze historic booking patterns, seasonal trends, and local event calendars to anticipate client needs, ensuring the right talent is always ready.
* Conversational AI Support: A 24/7 GPT-driven virtual assistant on our Gainesville microsite will capture leads, answer client FAQs, and schedule work orders even when our recruiters are offline.
* Dynamic Dispatch & Scheduling: AI optimization assigns workers based on skills, proximity, and client preferences, with minimal manual oversight.

 Potential

 * Lean, High-Margin Growth: Operating without a brick-and-mortar location slashes fixed costs, driving stronger operating leverage and faster path to profitability.
* Scalable Roll-Out Plan: Upon validation in Gainesville, Epic Labor will replicate this virtual model across 5 additional markets over the next 12 months.
* First Mover Advantage: Few competitors are marrying deep-tech AI with blue-collar staffing at scale, positioning Epic Labor as a pioneer.
* Shareholder Value Creation: Enhanced margins and rapid market penetration set the stage for elevated revenue forecasts and an accelerated path to positive cash flow.

 “I’m very excited about the potential with this pilot but do want to caution that this is indeed a test pilot,” added Schadel. “Fortune favors the bold. AI is going to impact every industry and staffing is ripe for disruption. I believe can execute this rollout and establish best practices using the Gainesville market as a guinea pig. Proving the power of AI in blue collar staffing will give Epic Labor a blueprint for explosive growth that will drive increased market share.”
