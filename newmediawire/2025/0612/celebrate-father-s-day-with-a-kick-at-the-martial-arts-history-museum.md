 (NewMediaWire) - June 11, 2025 - Glendale, CA – Father’s Day is always one of the most popular days of the year at the Martial Arts History Museum—and for good reason. It’s a time when kids bring their dads to celebrate, laugh, and dive into the thrilling world of martial arts culture. Now, with the museum housed in a much larger and more exciting space, there’s even more to explore, experience, and enjoy.

 This year, we’re pulling out all the stops to make it extra special. From samurai armor to ninja legends, from Bruce Lee to Kung Fu Panda, the museum offers a dynamic journey through history, film, and tradition. Whether your dad is a lifelong martial artist or just a fan of great action movies, there’s something here to make him smile, reminisce, and maybe even strike a pose.

 And here’s the best part—Dads get in FREE! That’s right, it’s our way of saying thank you to all the amazing fathers who inspire, protect, and lead with strength, wisdom, and heart.

 “Many times kids will blindfold their dad and bring him to the museum. And boy, is he surprised that there is even a museum for the martial arts,” says museum president Michael Matsuda. “Each and every year, we get more and more people and it’s completely packed.”

 So if you're looking for a Father's Day activity that’s unique, meaningful, and full of action, skip the crowded restaurants and surprise Dad with something different. Take him to the Martial Arts History Museum, where he’ll be surrounded by iconic legends, powerful traditions, and maybe even a flying sidekick or two.

 This Father’s Day, celebrate the warrior in your life—with honor, fun, and a roundhouse kick of history. The museum opens at 11 am and closes at 6 pm. 201 N. Brand Blvd. B100, Glendale, CA 91203 or visit MAmuseum.com.
