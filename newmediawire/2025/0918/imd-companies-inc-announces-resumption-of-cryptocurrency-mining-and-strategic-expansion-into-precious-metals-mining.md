# iMD Companies, Inc. Announces Resumption of Cryptocurrency Mining and Strategic Expansion Into Precious Metals Mining

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC: ICBU) is excited to announce the strategic resumption of its cryptocurrency mining operations, focusing on ASIC-resistant altcoins optimized for GPU hardware, alongside a bold expansion into precious metals mining through prospective U.S. partnerships. These initiatives mark a significant step in diversifying revenue streams, leveraging ICBU’s prior infrastructure and mining expertise to capitalize on both digital and tangible asset markets.

 Resumption of Cryptocurrency Mining

 ICBU is re-entering the cryptocurrency mining sector by targeting energy-efficient, GPU-mineable coins that resist ASIC dominance, ensuring accessibility and sustainability. This strategy builds on the company’s 2021/22 crypto initiatives. By focusing on the following altcoins, ICBU aims to maximize profitability in the 2025/26 market:

 * Ravencoin (RVN): Utilizing the KawPow algorithm, RVN supports asset tokenization and is ideal for GPU miners, offering steady returns with a potential value increase post-2026 halving.
* Ethereum Classic (ETC): Powered by the Ethash algorithm, ETC provides GPU-friendly mining with consistent profitability, leveraging its established smart contract ecosystem.
* Kaspa (KAS): With its kHeavyHash algorithm and BlockDAG architecture, KAS delivers rapid block times and high profitability, enhanced by the 2025 Crescendo Hard Fork.
* Ergo (ERG): Using Autolykos v2, ERG offers energy-efficient mining and DeFi potential, making it a sustainable choice for diversified operations.

 This focus aligns with 2025 trends, where altcoin mining profitability depends on low energy costs and market dynamics. ICBU anticipates revenue from hashrate sales, token accumulation, and potential Web3 integrations, reinforcing its blockchain strategy.

 Expansion into Precious Metals Mining

 In parallel, ICBU is diversifying into traditional precious metals mining through strategic partnerships with U.S. gold and silver mine owners, complementing the volatility of crypto with stable, high-value assets.

 The company is in negotiations to form a partnership with several mining companies that have rights to placer and lodge claims. These companies are currently in the process of completing their 43-101c geological reports for the valuation and the feasibility of the claims. The company will be focusing their efforts on the extraction of gold and silver.

 This dual-mining approach positions ICBU to benefit from rising gold (~$3,700/oz) and silver (~$42) prices and the $200B+ U.S. precious metals market, creating a balanced portfolio of digital and physical assets. These efforts aim to establish revenue-generating assets, leveraging existing operational capabilities.

 Strategic Outlook

 “ICBU’s renewed focus on GPU-based cryptocurrency mining and strategic entry into precious metals mining reflects our commitment to innovation and diversification,” said Rick Wilson, CEO of iMD Companies, Inc. “By leveraging our existing infrastructure and forging new partnerships, we are poised to drive significant revenue growth in both high-growth and stable markets.”
