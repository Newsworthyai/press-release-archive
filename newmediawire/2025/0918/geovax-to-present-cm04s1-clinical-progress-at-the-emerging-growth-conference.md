# GeoVax to Present CM04S1 Clinical Progress at the Emerging Growth Conference

Next-Generation Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine Demonstrates Differentiated Immune Responses in Immunocompromised Patients

 ATLANTA, GA - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigen vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today announced that it will present at the Emerging Growth Conference on Thursday, September 25, 2025. This live, interactive online event will provide investors and stakeholders an opportunity to hear directly from the Company’s Chairman and CEO, David Dodd, and participate in a real-time Q&A session.

 Mr. Dodd will highlight recent positive interim clinical results for GEO-CM04S1, GeoVax’s lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which were presented this month at two major international scientific meetings:

 * International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2025 (Krakow, Poland): Phase 2 data in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients showed that CM04S1 achieved the study’s immune response primary endpoint, while the comparator mRNA vaccine did not. Based on the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommendation, further enrollment is proceeding exclusively in the CM04S1 arm.
* European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID) 2025 (Lisbon, Portugal): Interim results demonstrated robust, durable T-cell and cross-variant antibody responses in immunocompromised blood cancer and post-transplant patients, with no serious adverse events reported. The data reinforce CM04S1’s differentiation versus standard-of-care vaccines.

 “These results underscore the promise of CM04S1 as a multi-antigen solution for patients left behind by first-generation COVID-19 vaccines,” said David Dodd, Chairman & CEO of GeoVax. “Our MVA platform is demonstrating the potential to deliver broad, durable immune protection where it is needed most.”

 Mr. Dodd will present from 3:55 PM to 4:05 PM Eastern Time. Register here to attend the conference and receive event updates: https://goto.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1717091&tp_key=c78a55764a&sti=govx

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The Company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
