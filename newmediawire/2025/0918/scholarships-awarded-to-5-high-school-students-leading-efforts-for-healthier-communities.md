# Scholarships Awarded to 5 High School Students Leading Efforts for Healthier Communities

DALLAS - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - By age 18, according to an American Heart Association scientific statement, many young Americans have already developed cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes[1]. The American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is investing in the next generation of student leaders working to reverse that trend by awarding scholarships through its school-based initiative, the American Heart Challenge™.

 Five $1,000 scholarships are awarded annually to high school students across the country who are passionate about heart health and exhibit exceptional leadership qualities. Students are recommended by their school’s American Heart Challenge program advisers and selected for their commitment to improving their own health and the health of their communities.

 “These outstanding student leaders model healthy choices and inspire their peers to do the same,” said Lee A. Shapiro, J.D., volunteer chair of the American Heart Association and managing partner and co-founder at 7wireVentures, an investment firm headquartered in Chicago. “They aren’t just the future of health; they’re helping shape it today.”
