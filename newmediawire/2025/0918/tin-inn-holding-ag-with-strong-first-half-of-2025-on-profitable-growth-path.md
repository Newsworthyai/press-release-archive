WASSENBERG, Germany - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - TIN INN Holding AG (Ticker symbol TIW / ISIN DE000A40ZTT8), the vertically integrated hospitality platform for standardized ESG hotels in German mid-sized cities, achieved key strategic milestones in the first half of 2025 and successfully implemented its operational growth strategy with a positive consolidated result.

 In the first half of the year, TIN INN recorded approximately 12,823 overnight stays* across its five operating hotels, representing an increase of around 34% compared to 9,569 overnight stays on a pro forma basis in H1 2024. Occupancy* rose by roughly 4 percentage points to 72.1% (H1 2024: pro forma 69.4%). The average daily rate* (ADR) increased by about 3% to EUR 77.06 (H1 2024: pro forma EUR 75.06), while revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose to EUR 55.52 (H1 2024: pro forma EUR 53.74).

 In H1 2025, TIN INN Holding AG generated revenues of EUR 3.7 million. Together with other operating income, including changes in inventories from projects under construction totaling EUR 4.9 million, total output reached EUR 8.7 million. On the cost side, material expenses amounted to EUR 2.0 million, equivalent to about 23% of total output. Personnel expenses came to EUR 1.8 million, or around 20% of total output. This confirms the high efficiency of the business model, which is designed for a lean cost structure through serial production and digitalized operations. EBITDA stood at EUR 3.2 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of approximately 36% on total output, underscoring the Company’s earning power even at an early stage of scaling. Consolidated net income after taxes amounted to EUR 1.7 million.

 In May 2025, the Company successfully completed its IPO in the Scale segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This demonstrated TIN INN’s capital markets readiness and significantly strengthened its equity base: the equity ratio rose to around 50% as of 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: pro forma around 10%).2025 Guidance Confirmed

 The Management Board confirms its guidance for the full year 2025, continuing to expect total output of around EUR 14 million and EBITDA of approximately EUR 4.1 million. In addition, the Company plans to double the number of operating locations from five to ten by year-end.

 TIN INN also anticipates further progress in smart factory automation, which is expected to deliver significant mid-term reductions in unit costs per hotel module. This will materially enhance project-level returns on capital and strengthen the margin base for the rollout in the coming years.Nico Sauerland, Co-CEO of TIN INN Holding AG, commented: “With our successful IPO, we have laid the foundation to consistently scale our platform. The results of the first half of the year confirm the strength of our model: we combine industrial manufacturing, digital operations, and ESG substance – creating a structurally superior offering in the German mid-market hotel segment. Our goal to double the number of our hotels in 2025 is clearly within reach.”
