# Viromed Medical AG: Successful ISO 13485 Certification Paves the way for Market Launch of ViroCAP® in October 2025

RELLINGEN, Germany - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Viromed Medical AG ("Viromed"; ISIN: DE000A3MQR65), a medical technology company and pioneer of cold plasma technology, has received the ISO 13485 certification. This officially makes Viromed a medical device manufacturer, paving the way for the company to launch its own medical devices on the market. Viromed can now independently approve and market ViroCAP®, a mobile medical device for the treatment of skin diseases. Sales and deliveries of the first devices in the ViroCAP® product family will begin in October 2025.

 Uwe Perbandt, CEO of Viromed Medical AG, explains: "With this certification, we have reached the next milestone. We are no longer just a developer, but also an approved manufacturer, enabling us to bring our products to market independently and quickly. This not only opens up new revenue potential for us, but also gives us a clear competitive advantage. We expect the introduction of our ViroCAP® systems to provide a strong boost to our growth and the expansion of our market position."

 The ISO 13485 certification is a key requirement for the approval of medical devices in Europe in accordance with the applicable Medical Device Regulation (MDR). It certifies that Viromed has successfully established a quality management system in accordance with international standards. With this successful certification, the company has laid the foundation for accelerated market launch of its products - and thus for sustainable revenue growth.

 Wide range of product for different fields of application

 With the ViroCAP® product range, Viromed addresses several markets. ViroCAP® derma and ViroCAP® med are intended for use in dermatology and wound treatment, while ViroCAP® vet is intended for veterinary use. Both ViroCAP® derma and ViroCAP® vet can be launched on the market immediately upon receipt of the certificate. At just 160 grams, the ViroCap® is the world's lightest mobile device for cold plasma applications. Its technology enables contact-free treatment, eliminating the need for direct contact with the skin or wound.

 With the ability to independently certify class-I-risk products, Viromed gains significant flexibility and speed in market entry. The company is thus tapping into attractive growth areas in dermatology and the clinical environment.
