# GeoVax Reaffirms Commitment to Evidence-Based Vaccine Safety and Development of GEO-CM04S1 for Vulnerable Populations

Company Underscores Rigorous Safety Monitoring and Long History of the MVA Platform as Development of GEO-CM04S1 Advances

 ATLANTA, GA - September 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines, today reaffirmed its commitment to rigorous, science-based evaluation of vaccine safety. The statement follows discussions by federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting, held September 18-19, 2025, regarding reports of adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccination.

 GeoVax recognizes the importance of transparent pharmacovigilance and ongoing review of safety data for all vaccines. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are designed to detect potential signals that require further thorough, independent analysis. Reports in VAERS alone do not establish causality, and GeoVax supports the continued application of rigorous scientific standards to assess vaccine safety.

 About GEO-CM04S1

 GEO-CM04S1 is GeoVax’s investigational multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vector platform. MVA is a non-replicating vector with a decades-long history of safe use, including in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women and pediatric populations in prior vaccine settings.

 CM04S1 is being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, including studies focused on patients with hematologic cancers resulting in significantly weakened immune systems that do not appear to adequately respond to the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines. To date, GEO-CM04S1 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile under the oversight of independent Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) and encouraging immune response within immune-compromised patients.

 Commitment to Patients and Public Health

 “In this moment of heightened focus on vaccine safety, our mission is more critical than ever: to develop vaccines that address the needs of populations most at risk from various infectious diseases,” said David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax. “For GEO-CM04S1, this means addressing the critical needs of immunocompromised individuals for whom existing vaccine options may provide insufficient protection. We remain committed to transparent science, thorough safety monitoring, and collaboration with regulatory authorities as we work to deliver this much-needed solution.”

 GeoVax emphasizes that ongoing clinical trials are designed with robust pharmacovigilance frameworks and long-term follow-up to ensure safety and efficacy are comprehensively assessed.

 About GeoVax

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. GEO-CM04S1 is a next-generation, multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. GeoVax is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent EMA regulatory guidance, anticipates progressing directly to a Phase 3 clinical evaluation, omitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products.
