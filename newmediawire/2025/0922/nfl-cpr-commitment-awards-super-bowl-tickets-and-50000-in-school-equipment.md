# NFL CPR Commitment Awards Super Bowl Tickets and $50,000 in School Equipment

DALLAS - September 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Five students and five schools have been awarded special incentive prizes as part of a collaboration between the American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, and the National Football League (NFL) Foundation to encourage young people to learn Hands-Only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Students who participated in the Association’s in-school programs, Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™, during the 2024-25 school year and learned Hands Only CPR were eligible for incentive prize drawings from the NFL. Individual prizes included tickets to Super Bowl LX and schools participating in the Challenge were eligible for a drawing of $10,000 for a physical activity equipment makeover.

 The following five students each received two tickets to Super Bowl LX taking place on February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California:

 * Hanrock of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania,
* Frankie of Appleton, Wisconsin,
* Lucy of Riverview, Florida,
* Chelsie of Rockwall, Texas and
* Alicia of Kirkland, Washington.

 The following schools received $10,000 to use for a physical activity equipment makeover:

 * East Pointe Elementary School in Greenwood, Arkansas,
* Ehrman Crest Elementary School in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania,
* Orchard Park Elementary School in Fort Mill, South Carolina,
* Stratford School in San Francisco, California and
* Stephen-Argyle Central Elementary School in Stephen, Minnesota.

 “At the American Heart Association our future is about improving yours. Through the generous incentives provided by the NFL we are working together to motivate more students to complete the Hands-Only CPR module and share what they learned with their families, expanding awareness of how to respond in a cardiac emergency,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Through our collaboration with the NFL, we reached more schools and empowered more students with the lifesaving skill of CPR.”

 Students who participate in the Association’s in-school Heart Challenge program receive free Hands-Only CPR instruction so they can be confident and capable to respond in a cardiac emergency. More than 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year[1], 70% of those occurring at home[2]. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival. A scientific statement from the Heart Association shows that children as young as age four can impact the survival rate by calling 911[3].

 The American Heart Association is the global leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official guidelines for CPR. The collaboration with the NFL is the Association’s most recent demonstration of the vow to grow CPR education with the commitment to double survival rates of cardiac emergencies by 2030. With most cardiac arrests outside the hospital occurring at homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important for all families. If a teen or adult collapses, witnesses should immediately call emergency services and begin chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 beats per minute and a depth of approximately two inches.

 “Our collaboration with the American Heart Association will ensure that young people across the country are equipped with the knowledge and confidence to act in a cardiac emergency,” said NFL Vice President of Philanthropy and Executive Director of the NFL Foundation Alexia Gallagher. “By empowering the next generation with these lifesaving skills, we are not only strengthening the chain of survival today, but also helping to build healthier, safer communities for the future.”

 The NFL’s support includes the production of an introduction video by Damar Hamlin, Buffalo Bills safety and cardiac arrest survivor. In the video, which appears prior to the Kids Heart Challenge Hands-Only CPR online learning module, Hamlin shares that CPR saved his life and encourages kids to learn the lifesaving skill. Each elementary student who completed the online learning module earned an entry for two tickets to Super Bowl LX in 2026. Additionally, Kids Heart Challenge participating schools received entries to win a $10,000 fitness equipment makeover for student participation.

 The NFL Foundation renewed their commitment to support CPR education for the 2025-2026 school year. Once again, five student participants will receive tickets to Super Bowl LXI on February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California and five schools will receive $10,000 fitness equipment makeovers. Entries are available now to those completing the Hands Only CPR module called Finn’s Mission. Parents and school administrators can visit heart.org/schools to learn how their students can participate.

 With a foundation set in physical activity and rooted in proven science, Kids Heart Challenge has expanded beyond the gymnasium to meet the needs of today’s youth and educators as science has proven the strong connection between physical and mental health. The program offers a variety of activities to get elementary students’ hearts pumping such as dance, basketball or jumping rope paired with digital missions such as Hands-Only CPR. The Association has worked with schools across the nation for 48 years promoting physical health and wellness.

 The Association encourages everyone, everywhere to join in the Nation of Lifesavers initiative and make CPR awareness and education a permanent fixture in all communities across the country. Take 90 seconds to learn how to save a life now at www.heart.org/nation.
