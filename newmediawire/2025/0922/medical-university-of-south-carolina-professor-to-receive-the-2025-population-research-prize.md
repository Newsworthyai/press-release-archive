# Medical University of South Carolina Professor to Receive the 2025 Population Research Prize

DALLAS - September 22, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Daniel T. Lackland, Dr.P.H., FAHA, professor of epidemiology and neurology at the Medical University of South Carolina, will receive this year’s Population Research Prize at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, to be held Nov. 7-10, 2025, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Dr. Lackland will be presented with the award during the Presidential Session on Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025.

 Dr. Lackland is a global leader in hypertension research, stroke prevention and efforts to address gaps in cardiovascular disease outcomes. He directs the Division of Translational Neuroscience and Population Studies and the Master of Science in Clinical Research Program at Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina. A fellow of the American Heart Association and the American College of Epidemiology, he is internationally recognized for his population-level research on hypertension and cardiovascular disease, with a special focus on differences among various communities.

 “Dr. Daniel Lackland’s research continues to shape our understanding of hypertension and stroke, especially in underserved communities,” said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association’s 2025-2026 volunteer president, executive director for Northwell’s Katz Institute for Women’s Health, senior vice president of Women’s Health at Northwell, the Partners Council Professor of Women’s Health and professor of cardiology at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. “He played a pivotal role as chair of a 2013 American Heart Association scientific statement that traced the dramatic decline in U.S. stroke mortality (from 88 to 23 per 100,000 between 1950 and 2010), attributing the decline to aggressive hypertension treatment strategies. His vital research has contributed to significant improvements in blood pressure care, an integral component of cardiovascular care, over the last two decades.”

 A prolific researcher and mentor, Dr. Lackland has authored more than 350 peer-reviewed publications and served as a leader for numerous National Institutes of Health funded studies. He currently serves as principal investigator for the Black Pooling Project, a national, multi-cohort observational study that combines data from nine large epidemiologic studies to better understand racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and hypertension among Black Americans. He also chairs the Executive and Steering Committees of the long-running CARDIA study and serves as chair of the Observational Study Monitoring Board for the RURAL Study, among many other national research and advisory roles.

 Dr. Lackland has been an active contributor to the Heart Association’s clinical guidelines, including the 2013 and 2017 hypertension guidelines, and he is the current editor-in-chief of the World Hypertension League Newsletter. As past president of the World Hypertension League, he continues to lead collaborative global initiatives to improve circulatory health.

 “I’m incredibly honored to receive this award and recognition from the American Heart Association,” said Dr. Lackland. “Throughout my career, I have focused on understanding the social and biological drivers of high blood pressure and stroke. I share this recognition with my many colleagues, students and community partners who are committed to improving health outcomes for the whole population with the common passion for prevention and risk reduction.”

 Dr. Lackland earned his doctor of public health in epidemiology from the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. He also received a master of science in public health in environmental epidemiology and a bachelor’s degree in biology and chemistry, both from the University of South Carolina.

 In addition to his scientific achievements, Dr. Lackland is known for his exceptional mentorship. He has guided dozens of graduate students, many of whom now lead their own groundbreaking research programs. His service extends to numerous boards and advisory roles, including serving as a past volunteer regional board president of the American Heart. He also serves on the board of the Constellation Health Quality and chairs the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence Foundation.
