# NFL safety Justin Reid expands CPR education for youth through summer program

(NewMediaWire) - June 05, 2025 - KANSAS CITY, Mo. — More than 350,000 cardiac arrests happen outside hospitals in the U.S. each year. Most don’t receive the cardiopulmonary recitation (CPR) they need to survive. NFL player Justin Reid is tackling that reality through a new program pairing CPR training with a summer camp. Through his Kansas City based JREID Indeed summer program, the former Chiefs player, now with the New Orleans Saints, is expanding his American Heart Association Nation of Lifesavers Player Ambassador role.

 As an ambassador Reid is helping the Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, and its Nation of Lifesavers™ movement double cardiac arrest survival rates by 2030. In honor of National CPR and AED week happening June 1-7, Reid brought Hands-Only CPR education to the 35 high school students participating in JREID InDeed’s summer program, called Tackling Tech. Yesterday, participants learned the correct rate and depth of compressions to save a life. Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “It is important for me to participate as a Nation of Lifesavers Player Ambassador and to educate more Americans about how easy it is to learn Hands-Only CPR. The person you save is likely someone you know and love,” said New Orleans Saints player and founder of JREID InDeed, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering under-resourced communities, Justin Reid. “Tying together the Tackling Tech program with CPR education is an honor. But, challenging them to find a solution to help others remember the lifesaving skill is how we are changing outcomes - one training at a time.” Reid has served as Nation of Lifesavers Player Ambassadors since the start of the 2024 National Football League (NFL) season

 Reid issued a challenge to the summer program participants. The goal was simple. Take the CPR skills they learned and help others learn. Reid asked them to create a fun and engaging way to expand their new CPR knowledge to students across the country. Now as the summer continues, the participants are developing unique school and student friendly dances to help others learn the steps in the chain of survival. The American Heart Association’s in-school programs Kids Heart Challenge™ and American Heart Challenge™ will take these TikTok style dances to school assemblies to help youth remember the two steps to save a life in a fun and active way.

 “CPR education is crucial to saving lives and improving outcomes in a cardiac emergency,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. “Finding ways to meet people where they are and bring this lifesaving skill to more people is empowering communities to act fast and be ready and able to respond with the lifesaving skill of CPR. Justin’s work and the engagement of his summer camp kids is a great example of how we can all play a role in expanding CPR education to make a difference when seconds matter.”

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. When more people are ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.
