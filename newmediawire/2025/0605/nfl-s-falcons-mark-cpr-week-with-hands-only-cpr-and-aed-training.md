# NFL s Falcons mark CPR Week with Hands-Only CPR and AED training

(NewMediaWire) - June 05, 2025 - ATLANTA — With sudden cardiac arrest claiming thousands of lives each year, the Atlanta Falcons teamed up with the American Heart Association to equip players and coaches with the lifesaving CPR (cardiopulmonary) skills during National CPR and AED (automated external defibrillator) Week. According to American Heart Association data, nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 The Falcons have worked for three years to improve bystander CPR in the Atlanta community and support the American Heart Association’s work to double the survival rates of cardiac arrest by 2030, the goal of the Nation of Lifesavers™ movement. The commitment to bystander CPR education is especially important to the Falcons, as head coach, Raheem Morris, assisted in saving the life of a three-year-old boy just 12 days after completing this same instruction with the American Heart Association in 2023. Morris’ bystander CPR efforts are considered the first CPR save directly tied back to Nation of Lifesavers collaboration between the American Heart Association and the National Football League (NFL). Since then Morris, along with his wife Nicole, have been champions for increasing CPR education bringing training to family, friends and community events.

 “We are incredibly thankful to the Atlanta Falcons and the Morris family for their steadfast dedication to educating people about the lifesaving skill of CPR and AED use,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “Each year, hundreds of thousands of cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals, and immediate CPR can double or even triple a person’s chance of survival. That’s why we are committed to ensuring more people are trained, confident, and ready to act as a lifesaver in a cardiac emergency."

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community.

 Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR with rescue breathes in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest.

 “We cannot thank the American Heart Association enough for the work they do in our communities, helping to save lives through the education and training of others,” said Raheem Morris, Atlanta Falcons head coach. “We have seen firsthand the impact their work can have, not only on ourselves, but on anyone who requires help when a critical moment occurs. We encourage everyone who is able to participate in training and prepare yourself should the need ever arise.”

 In 2023, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives.
