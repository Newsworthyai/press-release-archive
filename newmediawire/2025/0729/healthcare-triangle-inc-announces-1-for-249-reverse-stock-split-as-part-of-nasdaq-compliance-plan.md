# Healthcare Triangle, Inc. Announces 1-for-249 Reverse Stock Split as Part of Nasdaq Compliance Plan

PLEASANTON, CALIF. - July 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCTI) (“HCTI” or the "Company"), a leader in digital transformation solutions including managed services, cloud enablement, and data analytics for the healthcare and life sciences industry, today announced that it will effect a 1-for-249 reverse stock split of its common stock. The reverse stock split will become effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, August 1, 2025, and the Company’s common stock will commence trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis at the opening of the market on August 1, 2025, pending confirmation by the Depository Trust Company and the Nasdaq. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the Company’s existing trading symbol, “HCTI,” and a new CUSIP number 42227W 306 has been assigned as a result of the reverse stock split.

 The Company expects that the reverse stock split, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders in a special meeting of Stockholders held on February 26, 2025, will increase the price per share of the Company’s common stock, and is part of the Company’s strategy to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market.

 At the effective time of the reverse stock split, each two hundred forty-nine (249) shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically converted into one (1) issued and outstanding share of common stock without any change in the par value of $0.00001 per share or the total number of authorized shares. The reverse stock split will reduce the Company’s number of shares outstanding common stock from approximately 1,452,124,283 shares to approximately 5,831,850 shares. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be rounded up at a participant level in lieu thereof.

 Stockholders of record as of August 1st, 2025, will be receiving information regarding their share ownership following the reverse stock split from the Company's transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC.
