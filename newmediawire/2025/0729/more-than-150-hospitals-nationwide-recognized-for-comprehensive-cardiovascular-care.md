# More than 150 hospitals nationwide recognized for comprehensive cardiovascular care

(NewMediaWire) - July 29, 2025 - DALLAS — Heart disease and stroke are the No. 1 and No. 5 causes of death in the United States, respectively, according to the American Heart Association 2025 Statistical Update. Preventing cardiovascular deaths depends on a unified care approach rooted in evidence-based clinical treatments and collaboration.

 The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is recognizing 158 hospitals across the nation with a new Commitment to Quality award that highlights high performance across three or more clinical areas in the Get With The Guidelines® program. Hospitals earning this new award demonstrate a comprehensive approach to quality improvement for patient care.

 Get With The Guidelines programs help care teams use the latest evidence-based science to guide their treatment decisions. Studies show that following treatment guidelines can help people recover faster, avoid complications and reduce their chances of needing to return to the hospital. The programs are designed to ensure everyone gets care that’s timely, consistent and backed by research.

 Get With The Guidelines awards are given for conditions including stroke, heart failure, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, Type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Award levels range from bronze to gold plus status, depending on how long and how well a care team meets key measures. Hospitals receiving the Commitment to Quality award have achieved Silver awards or higher in at least three American Heart Association programs for 2025.

 "Delivering high-quality cardiovascular care requires a systemwide commitment to using proven treatments and putting patients at the center of every decision," said Donald Lloyd-Jones, M.D., Sc.M., FAHA, past volunteer president of the American Heart Association and current volunteer chair of the Association’s Quality Oversight Committee. "Hospitals earning the Commitment to Quality award show what’s possible when health care teams work together to apply the latest science across multiple areas of patient care. Their dedication is helping more people live longer, healthier lives."
