# Splash Beverage Group, Inc. Announces NYSE American to Commence Delisting Proceedings for Warrants (Ticker: SBEV-WT)

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - July 29, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) (the “Company”), a portfolio company of leading beverage brands, today announced that on June 23, 2025, it received notice from NYSE Regulation that the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American” or the “Exchange”) has determined to commence delisting proceedings with respect to the Company’s publicly traded warrants to purchase shares of common stock for $184.00 per share (the “Warrants”), which are listed under the ticker symbol SBEV-WT, and to suspend trading in the Warrants effective immediately.

NYSE Regulation determined that the Warrants are no longer suitable for continued listing pursuant to Section 1001 of the NYSE American Company Guide due to their low trading price.

The NYSE stated that it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to delist the Warrants upon completion of all applicable procedures, including any appeal by the Company of the NYSE’s delisting determination. The Company has until July 30, 2025 to appeal the NYSE’s determination but does not intend to do so.

The delisting of the Warrants will not impact the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock, which will remain listed on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol SBEV. Additionally, the delisting of the Warrants will have no effect on the Company’s business operations or its ongoing reporting obligations under SEC rules.

Following the delisting, the Warrants may be eligible for quotation on an over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets Group Inc., if a market maker applies for and obtains approval from FINRA to quote the securities. However, there can be no assurance that any market maker will apply to quote the Warrants, or that any such trading will commence or be sustained.
