# Nearly 5,000 organizations nationwide recognized for high-quality cardiovascular care

(NewMediaWire) - July 29, 2025 - DALLAS — Someone in the United States dies of cardiovascular disease (CVD) every 34 seconds, on average.[1] Reducing deaths from CVD requires a coordinated approach to care — one built on the transparent use of proven treatments and collaboration.

 The American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, is recognizing 4,859 health care and emergency response organizations nationwide for their continuing commitment to improving health outcomes for people affected by heart disease, stroke and related conditions. That’s about 1,700 more organizations than were recognized last year, showing growing momentum in the effort to save lives.

 The recognition is tied to the American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines® and other quality improvement initiatives that help care teams use the latest evidence-based science to guide their treatment decisions. The programs are designed to maximize opportunities for people to receive care that’s timely, consistent and supported by research.

 The awards are given for conditions including stroke, heart failure, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, Type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Award levels range from bronze to gold plus, depending on how long and how well a hospital meets key measures.

 Among this year’s awardees, the Association is recognizing 158 hospitals with a new Commitment to Quality award that highlights high performance across three or more clinical areas in the Get With The Guidelines program. Hospitals earning this new award demonstrate a comprehensive approach to quality improvement for patient care.

 “When someone is having a heart attack or stroke, they need care that’s fast, coordinated and follows the science,” said Donald Lloyd-Jones, M.D., Sc.M., FAHA, past volunteer president of the American Heart Association and current volunteer chair of the Association’s Quality Oversight Committee. “The organizations recognized this year are doing that work in communities all over the country — giving more people the best possible chance to live healthier, survive and recover.”

 This year, more than 14,500 total awards were given out, with many organizations receiving more than one. For the fifth year, the honorees represent all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam.*

 “Health care teams continue to see the value of these programs,” Lloyd-Jones said. “As the Association continues its second century of work, this kind of progress shows what we can achieve together to help people live longer, healthier lives.”

 Every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a stroke or heart attack, and heart disease and stroke are the No. 1 and No. 5 causes of death in the United States, respectively, according to the American Heart Association 2025 Statistical Update. Studies show that following treatment guidelines can help patients recover faster, avoid complications and reduce their chances of needing to return to the hospital.
