# Jupiter Neurosciences CEO And President Talk About The Power of JOTROL And The Launch of Its Longevity Consumer Line With Benzinga

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Christer Rosen, Chairman and CEO, and Alison Silva, President and CBO at Jupiter Neurosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS), sat down with Benzinga to discuss how the company is addressing longevity and brain health with JOTROL™ and its new direct-to-consumer product line, Nugevia.

 Jupiter Neurosciences is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing JOTROL, an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Resveratrol also activates PARP-1 – an important protein in DNA repair and stress response – improves cardiovascular health, enhances cognitive function, is antibacterial and antiviral against food-borne pathogens. JOTROL is designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. Meanwhile Nugevia leverages JOTROL to improve mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within."

 “You can drink 10,000 bottles of red wine per day or take two of our capsules,” to get the resveratrol benefits, Rosen told Benzina during the interview. “The trick is to get enough in the bloodstream, and the existing products don’t do the job. JOTROL is patented all over the world through 2036. We are starting to conquer what we think is going to be a fantastic time for us.”

 How JOTROL Stands Out

 While resveratrol has been around for decades and is among the most researched molecules, Silva says achieving therapeutic benefits has proven elusive, mainly due to dosing limitations. To achieve therapeutic benefits, the plasma concentration has to be over 250 nanograms per milliliter, and to get that amount into a product would be impossible without having either severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects or having to swallow a lot of huge pills.

 Jupiter Neurosciences was able to reformulate resveratrol and, through clinical trials,

 demonstrated blood plasma levels 8-10-fold higher than naïve resveratrol with one-tenth the dose. Plus, there were no GI side effects. “It makes it a key therapeutic for inflammation in the neurodegenerative space, inflammation in the longevity and healthspan space,” said Silva. “So that’s the cracking of the code we believe we have done with JOTROL.”

 Leveraging JOTROL For The Consumer Market

 In addition to developing JOTROL to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and rare diseases, the company just launched a direct-to-consumer line, Nugevia, which leverages JOTROL.

 The idea came to Jupiter Neurosciences about a year ago when the longevity and aging market was getting a lot of attention. Lots of companies were making claims about having supplements backed by clinical data, but the majority, says Rosen, didn’t really have the clinical proof – but Jupiter Neurosciences did. “We’re definitely ahead of the curve. We already have a product going into a Parkinson trial, and at the same time, we said why don't we launch a nutraceutical line and have some cash flow. I happened to like cash flow. Biotech is not cash flow,” said Rosen.

 Nugevia's first three formulations, which it just launched, target mitochondrial support, mental clarity and "beauty from within" and will be sold via a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model. Nugevia GLO is a daily supplement designed to support radiant, resilient skin from the inside out by promoting cellular defense, collagen integrity and hydration. Nugevia PWR is a daily mitochondrial health supplement scientifically formulated to support cellular energy, endurance and recovery, and Nugevia MND is a scientifically formulated supplement designed to protect and enhance cognitive function and support overall brain health. All three will be available direct-to-consumers in September.

 Short Sellers Be Forewarned

 As for when Jupiter Neurosciences will see revenue from its Nugevia product line, Rosen said it will start to materialize this year, next year and more meaningfully in the year after that, once it has more brand ambassadors and key opinion leaders on board and word is out about its products.

 Jupiter already announced professional golfer Annika Sörenstam – who has won over 95 international tournaments including 72 LPGA titles and 10 major championships – is the company’s first brand ambassador, and more will be announced soon. Rosen said potential spokespeople are drawn to the company because of the science behind its products.

 “The market doesn’t know about it yet, when you look where we are with the stock price,” says the CEO. “We’ve been hit by short sellers heavily…we took it as we need to deliver, and when we deliver the share price will take care of itself, and that's what we plan to do and do it sooner than people expect.”
