# IQSTEL's Acquisitive Nature Paying Off? Company Nears Its Goal Of $1 Billion

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Leandro Iglesias, CEO, and Alvaro Quintana Cardona, CFO of IQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST), were recently guests on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 IQSTEL is a multinational telecommunications and technology company that has businesses in telecommunication, fintech and cybersecurity, all of which are seeing transformational growth. The company counts 600 of the largest telecom companies around the world as customers and reported organic revenue of $90 million last year. In addition to growing organically, IQSTEL is focused on making strategic acquisitions to build its platform of B2B businesses, completing twelve purchases since its inception in 2018.

 “We look for companies that add value to our shareholders. We look for companies that have strong revenue streams that could grow that revenue stream,” Cardona told Benzinga. “Through all of our acquisitions, we have been increasing the value of the company. We have a stronger balance sheet with every acquisition.”

 In addition to building value through buys, the company is streamlining its operations, recently reducing its debt by $6.9 million, which is equivalent to about $2 per share. More than half of that debt reduction came in the form of a conversion into preferred shares, which Cardona says is a testament to the company’s long-term vision.

 As for IQSTEL’s goal to achieve $1 billion in revenue by 2027, Iglesias said the company is two years ahead of that objective. IQSTEL isn’t increasing operational expenses on its quest to $1 billion in revenue and, as a result, should achieve EBITDA of $20 to $30 million when it hits that goal, said Iglesias, noting that progress isn’t showing up in the stock price yet. “Some companies in our sector are trading between 10X to 20X EBITDA. That’s a valuation gap we are planning to close,” Iglesias said.
