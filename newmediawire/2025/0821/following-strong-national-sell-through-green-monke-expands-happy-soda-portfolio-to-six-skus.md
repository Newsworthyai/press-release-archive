# Following Strong National Sell-Through, Green Monke Expands Happy Soda Portfolio to Six SKUs

With Multiple #1 SKUs Across Key Retailers, Green Monke Adds Two New Great-tasting Flavors for Continued Growth

 TAMPA BAY, FLORIDA - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Green Monke (“Green Monke”), an award-winning hemp-D9 THC beverage brand, today announced the launch of two new flavors - Orange Cream and Lychee - bringing its Happy Soda portfolio to six great-tasting, nostalgia-inducing flavors. This expansion builds on the sell-through success of Green Monke’s original four flavors, which have secured top spots in convenience and grocery channels across the country.

 A Portfolio Built on Proven Demand

 Green Monke’s Happy Soda lineup has quickly emerged as a national leader in the hemp beverage category:

 * #1 SKU across 125 stores of a prominent convenience store chain in Minnesota.
* #1 and tied-2nd SKUs in a THC drink test case across 13 stores of a leading convenience chain in Georgia.
* Two SKUS tied-4th across 14 stores of the same leading convenience chain in South Carolina.
* Tied-4th SKU across 18 stores of a grocery and convenience store chain in Georgia.
* The #1 alcohol alternative at Pabst Theater Group venues in Wisconsin.

 “Our first four flavors have built the foundation - proving that Happy Sodas resonate with consumers, move quickly off shelves, and win in diverse retail settings,” said Pat Gleeson, President of Green Monke. “Now we’re ready to bring fresh innovation to the hemp THC drink market.”

 Two New Flavors Delivering Taste & Wellness, Nationwide

 Building on the success of top-selling Green Monke Blue Raspberry and Tropical Citrus - each crafted with our signature balanced blend of 10mg THC and 10mg CBD - Green Monke is introducing two new 10mg Happy Sodas:

 * Orange Cream – A nostalgic fusion of ripe orange and smooth vanilla, Orange Cream offers a grown up take on the classic creamsicle. With only 5g sugar, it’s a smooth, crowd-pleasing addition to the Happy Soda lineup.
* Lychee – A crisp, tropical blend with delicate floral notes and a hint of strawberry, Lychee is Green Monke’s first sugar-free SKU in the U.S. At just 15 calories and 0g sugar, it delivers a sophisticated, guilt-free alternative to alcohol.

 Both flavors are now available nationwide, answering growing consumer demand for delicious, better-for-you beverages that provide a satisfying alternative to alcohol. Perfect for social occasions, these new Happy Sodas deliver full flavor while aligning with modern wellness trends.

 Florida: A Priority Growth Market

 While available coast-to-coast, Orange Cream and Lychee were carefully crafted to meet the demands of the evolving Florida drink market. Florida represents one of the most attractive opportunities for hemp beverage expansion in the U.S., offering:

 * The 3rd largest population in the country at 24.8M residents.
* 140M+ annual visitors drawn to year-round tourism.
* Rapid adoption of hemp-infused, alcohol-alternative beverages.

 The Florida launch will be supported by an integrated marketing campaign featuring influencer partnerships, event activations at concerts and wellness gatherings, and targeted digital advertising in major metro areas.

 “The Florida market is one of the biggest opportunities in front of us,” said Gleeson. “With two exciting new SKUs, proven category leadership, and strong distribution, we’re positioned to win here in a big way.”
