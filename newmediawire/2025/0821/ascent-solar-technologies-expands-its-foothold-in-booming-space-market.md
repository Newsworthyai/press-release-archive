# Ascent Solar Technologies Expands Its Foothold In Booming Space Market

By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Paul Warley, CEO of Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTI), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

 Ascent Technologies is a maker of featherweight, flexible and durable CIGS thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions that are being used to power space exploration. It is a growing supplier to the space market, counting NASA and space company NOVI Space Inc. as partners.

 “It’s moving and moving quickly,” Warley told Benzinga of space in the interview. “We’re excited about the market right now.”

 When Warley came on board in 2023, the company shifted its focus to increasing the efficiency of its solar panels to better compete in the space market. Since then, Ascent has been successful in achieving higher efficiencies and bringing more capacity online, enabling it to strike deals and boost its backlog. “We’ve signed over 20TK NDAs in the last five or six months,” said Warley. “A lot of people are testing our product right now, and most of those people paid to test that product.”

 Ascent Technologies’ appearance at the 40th annual Space Symposium held this past spring is a classic example of how Ascent Technologies is networking and building awareness. During the conference, Ascent executives got in front of CEOs and decision makers, showing off the company’s solar technology and the speed at which it can turn on capacity.

 Looking out to the remainder of the year, Warley said the solar panel maker is focused on improving efficiency and getting orders filled in a timely manner. “Higher efficiency makes the product more attractive,” said Warley.
