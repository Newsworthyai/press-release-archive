# BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTCID: BFCH) Engages Veteran Investment Banker Wellfleet Investments LLC to Lead Capital Raise Strategy

CRESTVIEW, FL - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTCID: BFCH), a physician-led turnaround public company doing business as EVERMIND Holdings, Inc., today announced that it has engaged Wellfleet Investments LLC, a veteran investment banking firm established in New York in 1998, to support its strategic capital formation efforts.

 Wellfleet Investments LLC (“Wellfleet”) is a registered broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC# 8-36769 / CRD# 18488) and is a member of FINRA (www.finra.org) and SIPC (www.sipc.org). The firm specializes in structuring and placing financings for private and public companies, with deep relationships spanning family offices and institutional investors. Additional information about Wellfleet and its registered principals and personnel can be found at (finra.brokercheck.com) and (www.wellfleetinvestments.com).

 Two-Phase Capital Raise Plan

 The Company intends to execute its capital strategy in two phases:

 * Phase I (Seed Raise – $150,000): Proceeds will fund legal and compliance review, modernization of the Company’s Charter and Bylaws, governance enhancements, the formation of EVERMIND Labs, and the finalization of the acquisition of ERApeutics (d/b/a EVERMIND™ Beverage). Additional proceeds will support PCAOB audit preparation, OTCQB uplisting readiness, and expanded investor relations.
* Phase II (Institutional Raise – $1.5M to $2M): Upon successful completion of Phase I and advancement to OTCQB, the Company plans to work with Wellfleet to conduct a seven-figure raise. Proceeds will be used to vend in additional accretive assets, transition these assets into value-producing operations, and further scale the platform.

 “We are building something rare in the OTC markets - a compliant, methodical turnaround with real institutional alignment,” said Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, CEO of BFCH. “Securing a FINRA-registered investment banker at this stage is uncommon. It validates the path we’ve set: seed capital to reset the foundation, then a seven-figure raise at OTCQB to scale assets into value production. This is how disciplined companies create asymmetric returns for their shareholders.”

 Jeffrey Bega, CEO and Managing Partner of Wellfleet Investments LLC, added: “BFCH is executing the type of governance reset, audit readiness, and asset strategy that smart capital looks for. Our role is to help connect that disciplined plan with family offices and institutional investors who value early-stage structured turnarounds. We look forward to supporting Dr. Balencic and his team as they build shareholder value.”

 In parallel with these steps, BFCH has recently amended its Q2 Report (view here) and amended its 2024 Management Certification (view here) on OTC Markets to ensure filings reflect current management, capitalization, and strategic direction.
