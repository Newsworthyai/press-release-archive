 Revamped Design and Enhanced Performance

 The KOINFOLD design team has introduced a sleek, modern interface for KOINFOLD 2.0, delivering a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

 Virtual Bank Accounts Coming in Q4 2025

 In Q4 2025, KOINFOLD 2.0 will introduce virtual bank accounts, accessible directly through the app. Key features include:

 * Dedicated Virtual Accounts: Following a swift Know Your Customer (KYC) process powered by MoonPay, users can create personalized virtual accounts in minutes.
* Fiat Onramping: Seamless fiat deposits in USD, EUR, and GBP with lightning-fast conversion to stablecoins like USDC and USDT, bridging traditional finance and DeFi.
* Multiple Payment Options: Integration with PayPal, Venmo, credit/debit cards, instant bank transfers, and Apple Pay for unparalleled onramping flexibility.
* Transaction Tracking: Built-in capabilities to provide users with real-time clarity on their virtual account transactions, ensuring transparency and trust.

 Solana Retail Integration in Development

 The ability to use cryptocurrencies at retail outlets accepting Solana for goods and services is progressing, with development extending beyond the initial Q3 2025 target.
