 PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH - August 21, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Insurance Canopy, a leader in small business and vendor insurance, is pleased to announce a new strategic partnership with Marketspread, one of the largest online platforms in the U.S. for booking and managing vendor and exhibitor-based events. Through this collaboration, Marketspread users across nine industries will now have access to quick, affordable, event-based liability insurance through Insurance Canopy’s integrated platform.

 Instead of the often lengthy process of working with an insurance agent, market vendors and exhibitors using Marketspread can now purchase insurance online through Insurance Canopy in just a few clicks. The process will allow Marketspread users to purchase an Insurance Canopy policy through the Marketspread platform and is designed to meet the varying needs of event-based businesses across more than nine industries.

 The partnership offers several key benefits for small business owners:

 * Online access: Policies can be purchased directly online, without having to speak with an insurance agent.
* Fast coverage: Vendors can secure a quote in only 8-10 minutes and download proof of insurance instantly.
* Affordable options: The program offers the most competitively priced event policies in the market.
* Industry-specific coverage: Products are designed specifically for often-overlooked niche vendor categories like artisans, farmers' market vendors, food vendors, entertainers, photographers, liquor vendors, and more.
* Simple onboarding: Insurance options are offered directly through Marketspread’s platform as part of the event registration process.

 Daryle Stafford, CEO of Insurance Canopy, says the partnership reflects Insurance Canopy’s long-standing commitment to building coverage options that reflect how small businesses actually operate.

 “We’ve built our reputation on creating insurance solutions for niche industries that are often overlooked by traditional providers,” Stafford said. “Our collaboration with Marketspread is about bringing that same level of precision and affordability to the vendors and exhibitors who are the backbone of local events, festivals, and markets across the country. We’ve long admired the way Marketspread makes life easier for organizers and promoters, and that shared focus on supporting small businesses makes them a natural partner. Insurance Canopy offers the most flexible and simple solutions when it comes to meeting the needs of small, specialized businesses.”

 “Our goal has always been to make life easier for event organizers and vendors, and insurance is a big piece that is often overlooked, or underserved,” said Daniel Westervelt, Co-Founder at Marketspread. “Insurance Canopy is a natural partner for us because of their focus on niche markets and their ability to deliver affordable coverage quickly online. We’re excited to offer this to our Marketspread community; it’s one more way we’re helping vendors show up prepared and protected for anything.”
