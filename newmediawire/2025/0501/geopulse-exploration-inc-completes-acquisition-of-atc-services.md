# Geopulse Exploration, Inc. Completes Acquisition of ATC Services

LOS ANGELES, CA - May 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Geopulse Exploration, Inc. (OTC: GPLS)(“Geopulse” or the “Company”) has entered into a Reorganization Agreement with Advanced Technology Construction, LLC, d/b/a ATC Services for the acquisition of all of the outstanding membership interests of ATC.

 ATC Services is headquartered in the Permian Basin of Texas and is engaged in the business of oil and gas construction, maintenance, and fabrication services. ATC Services provides high-margin support services to some of the largest players in the Permian and provides services including but not limited to drilling and facility pad construction, road construction and maintenance, frac pit construction, pit closures, fabrication, environmental remediation, hydrovacs, vacuum trucks, and other services.

 In the closing, which took place on April 28 2025, Geopulse acquired the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding ATC membership units that it didn’t already own. As per the acquisition agreement, two members of ATC, namely Shawn Rye and Chris Bishop, will be appointed to the Geopulse’s Board of Directors.

 ATC Services will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geopulse.  This transaction is expected to add approximately twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) in run-rate annual revenue to Geopulse. The management teams of both ATC and Geopulse believe that there is significant opportunity to grow the ATC operations through organic growth as well as through additional acquisitions of synergistic service providers in the Texas market.

 “This transaction presents an incredible opportunity to grow and scale across the Permian and Delaware Basins, and we couldn’t be more excited for the opportunity ahead of us,” said Chris Bishop, CEO of ATC Services.

 ““From humble beginnings to long term sustainable growth, that’s the direction ATC Services feels it’s future with Geopulse will be shaped,” stated Shawn Rye, Director.

 Management of Geopulse has determined that this transaction is an excellent course of action to increase shareholder value for Geopulse shareholders. “With the current growth in demand for energy, as well as potential re-shoring efforts of many industries, the services that ATC can provide will be in demand for many years to come,"  stated Marcus Laun of Geopulse.

 The Company is excited to announce the grand opening of its new headquarters in Big Spring TX, in June 2025.
