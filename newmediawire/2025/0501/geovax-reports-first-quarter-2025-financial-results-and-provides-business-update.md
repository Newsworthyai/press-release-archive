 ATLANTA, GA - May 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer, today announced its financial results and key operational accomplishments for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

 “Despite the recent and unexpected termination of our Project NextGen award by BARDA, our commitment to advancing GEO-CM04S1 remains unwavering. This next-generation, multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine is highly differentiated and continues to show promise, particularly for the over 40 million immunocompromised individuals in the U.S. who remain vulnerable to current variants. Our ongoing Phase 2 trials, including studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and stem cell transplant recipients, are progressing well, with key data readouts anticipated in the first half of 2025,” stated David Dodd, GeoVax’s Chairman and CEO.

 Dodd continued, “Concurrently, we are preparing to initiate the clinical evaluation of GEO-MVA during the second half 2025, while a Phase 2 trial of Gedeptin in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor for recurrent head and neck cancer is advancing towards trial initiation These efforts underscore GeoVax’s strategic focus on delivering innovative immunotherapies and vaccines that address critical unmet needs across oncology, infectious diseases and biodefense.”

 Clinical Trial Progress and Operational Developments

 GEO-CM04S1

 * GEO-CM04S1 continues to demonstrate potential as both a primary and booster vaccine, especially in immunocompromised patients. Key milestones anticipated during 2025 include:  Healthy Adult Booster Trial – Enrollment is complete, with data readout expected in the second quarter of 2025. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Patient Study (Immunocompromised patient study) – Enrollment ongoing in Phase 2 study evaluating GEO-CM04S1 as a COVID-19 booster vaccine for immunocompromised patients; interim data resulted in continuation of the GEO-CM04S1 arm, whereas the Data Safety Review Board recommended early termination of the mRNA arm, which was subsequently implemented. Stem Cell Transplant/CAR-T Trial (Immunocompromised patient study) – Enrollment and evaluation continue among hematological patients receiving stem cell transplantation or CAR-T therapy, comparing GEO-CM04S1 to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
* GEO-CM04S1 is a multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine, utilizing a synthetic-MVA platform, expressing both S and N antigens, offering the potential for broader, more durable protection than current mRNA vaccines.
* Published peer-reviewed article in Vaccines (MDPI) - In April 2025, a peer-reviewed article titled “Preclinical Evaluation of a Multi-Antigen SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidate GEO-CM02” was published in Vaccines (MDPI), which highlights the potential benefits of GeoVax’s multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine approach and further validates the Company’s approach for developing GEO-CM04S1 utilizing the MVA platform. The publication supports the rationale for advancing next-generation COVID-19 vaccines capable of delivering broader, more durable immune responses.
* GEO-CMO4S1 addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $30B+.

 Gedeptin®

 * Advancing into Phase 2 in Solid Tumors – GeoVax’s oncology program, utilizing the Gedeptin® technology, is planned to progress to a Phase 2 trial in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor for first recurrent head and neck cancer. Gedeptin has received Orphan Drug designation for use among advanced head & neck cancer patients.  The Gedeptin technology provides potential for expansion into other solid tumors including triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.
* Gedeptin addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential for use addressing Head & Neck cancer at $15B+.

 GEO-MVA

 * Mpox and Smallpox Vaccine Platform Addressing Biosecurity and Global Vaccine Equity – GeoVax anticipates initiating clinical trials in 2025 for GEO-MVA, its Mpox/smallpox vaccine candidate. The Company has successfully produced cGMP clinical product and is focused on completing the vaccine vialing in support of initiating clinical evaluation during the second half of 2025.  GEO-MVA positions GeoVax to offer a U.S.-developed alternative to foreign-sourced vaccines amid rising global biosecurity threats and constrained supply.
* GEO-MVA addresses a significant medical need worldwide reflected in an estimated market potential at $10B+.

 Vaccine Manufacturing Process Development

 * Scaling MVA for Global Reach – GeoVax is advancing continuous cell line manufacturing for MVA-based vaccines, offering a path to scalable, cost-effective production - including localized manufacturing for low- and middle-income countries. This innovation addresses critical gaps in vaccine self-sufficiency and supply resilience.

 Corporate Updates

 * Announced plan to establish strategic presence in the United Kingdom to advance manufacturing partnerships, European collaborations with service providers and academic partners, technology licensing opportunities and scientific expertise.
* Senthil Ranganathan, Ph.D., joined GeoVax on April 21, 2025, as Vice President, Technical Development & CMC Operations, reflecting significant progress in the Company focus on product authorization and commercialization activities.
