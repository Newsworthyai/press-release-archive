# 7 stroke advocates recognized nationwide for resilience and community impact

(NewMediaWire) - May 01, 2025 - DALLAS — Every 40 seconds someone in the U.S. has a stroke[1], one of the leading causes of serious, long-term disability. To spotlight the courage and dedication of those impacted by stroke, the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, is honoring seven nationwide recipients through its annual Stroke Hero Awards.

 The awards celebrate stroke survivors, caregivers, health care professionals and advocates who are advancing awareness, education and support for the stroke community nationwide. Recognized each May, during American Stroke Month, the Association — a global force changing the future of health of all — honors these Stroke Heroes and proudly advocates for stroke survivors year-round.  Those who have had a stroke often must work against physical, emotional and cognitive changes to move forward. This year’s winners demonstrate how personal experiences can drive public impact — from publishing support guides and launching nonprofits, to advocating in hospitals and local communities.

 Winners include:

 * Caregiver Hero: Lana Wilhelm, St. Louis 	When Lana Wilhelm’s husband survived a devastating stroke, she felt isolated and needed support, education and resources for her new caregiving role — and she wanted others to have it too. She started by writing Stroke and the Spouse: A Guide for the Survivor’s Care Partner. Lana also gives bedside support in the hospital to new survivors and their families, attends support groups and gives presentations informed by her background as a nurse and her personal caregiving journey.

 * Equity Hero: Carolyn Brown, Canton, Connecticut  	In her career as an occupational therapist, Carolyn Brown saw firsthand the heartbreaking reality of stroke survivors using up all their insurance benefits but still needing care. Feeling compelled to help, Carolyn launched StrokeOT, Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides continuing rehabilitative care to survivors. What started as exercise classes led by an occupational therapist has expanded significantly. Now, stroke survivors nationwide can access support groups, physical therapy, cooking classes and more.

 * F.A.S.T. Hero: Sheila Beal, Raleigh, North Carolina 	Sheila Beal’s swift, decisive actions saved her husband, Andy, when he experienced two strokes in April 2018. Andy had dismissed his symptoms and gone back to bed after a suspected “warning stroke,” or TIA (transient ischemic attack). But after Sheila researched stroke warning signs on the American Stroke Association’s website, she woke Andy up and drove him to the hospital, where he suffered a second severe stroke. Her vigilance ensured Andy received lifesaving treatment and paved the way for a smoother recovery.

 * Group Heroes: Helping Kids with Hemiplegia, Chapel Hill, North Carolina  	Helping Kids with Hemiplegia is a camp that empowers young stroke survivors, enhances their confidence and fosters their independence by focusing on functional skills, adaptive strategies and positive reinforcement. This approach connects kids and families with unique resources that can help transform their lives. The organization’s therapeutic day camp lets young stroke survivors with hemiplegia practice using their affected limbs to perform daily tasks, fostering skill development and a belief in their own capabilities.

 * Pediatric Hero: Makenzie Childs, Spanaway, Washington  	Makenzie Childs survived a pediatric stroke when she was just a preschooler. She not only pulled through after intensive therapy, now she’s a vibrant competitive dancer. The Childs family became involved with a pediatric stroke support and awareness group to help people facing the same crisis. The family also raises awareness as patient ambassadors for the local children’s hospital. Makenzie shared her experience on the Stroke Stories podcast and danced to raise funds for pediatric stroke care.

 * Survivor Hero: Brisa Alfaro, Apple Valley, California  	Brisa Alfaro experienced a stroke that left her completely paralyzed and unable to speak at 32 — with less than a 1% chance of living to tell about it. But not only did Brisa survive, she has made it her mission to educate, empower and support others. Her motto is “Small Moves, BIG RESULTS,” and through her speaking engagements and book, Limitless: Small Moves to Your Greatest Life after a Paralyzing Stroke, Brisa has reached thousands with her message of hope.

 * Voters’ Choice Hero: Kathleen O’Leary, Buffalo, New York 	After Kathleen O’Leary suffered a massive stroke and couldn’t find a support group, she created one herself. Now stroke survivors in Buffalo, New York have a place to go for information and support. The physician and mom of two also pointed out to her colleagues that they weren’t preparing patients for life after a stroke. She pushed through depression and serious physical challenges to champion the formation of a task force of medical, mental health and social services professionals to help stroke survivors find a new normal.

 Winners were selected by a nationwide panel of volunteer judges from the American Stroke Association, except for the Voters’ Choice Award, which was selected by online popular vote.
