# ABVC BioPharma Announces First Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Strategic Planning for AI-Driven Agricultural Project in Taiwan

SILICON VALLEY, CA - May 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing botanical-based therapies for central nervous system, oncology, and ophthalmology indications, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, and shared updates on its strategic plan to explore the development of an AI-enabled agricultural facility in Taiwan.

 First Quarter 2025 Highlights

 * Operating expenses decreased 76% to $693,005, compared to $2.84 million in Q1 2024
* Net loss reduced 68% to $944,190, compared to $2.93 million in Q1 2024
* Basic and diluted net loss per share improved to $(0.06), compared to $(0.29) in Q1 2024
* Recognized a land asset in Taiwan valued at $7,670,000, for which the Company is evaluating development of a GAP-compliant, AI-powered plant factory

 In the first quarter of 2025, ABVC recognized a parcel of land in central Taiwan valued at $7,670,000 as a strategic asset. The Company is currently assessing the feasibility of developing this site into a state-of-the-art, AI-integrated agricultural facility designed to meet Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) standards. There can be no assurance that the project will be implemented as currently envisioned, or that any future development on the site will be successfully completed. If implemented, the project could leverage local AI capabilities to enable precision-controlled agriculture and contribute to a more sustainable and traceable botanical supply chain.

 This strategic initiative aligns with ABVC’s long-term vision to enhance vertical integration, improve material consistency, and support its future botanical drug pipeline.

 “We believe this potential AI-driven agricultural project reflects our forward-looking approach to sustainable pharmaceutical innovation,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, CEO of ABVC BioPharma. “As we continue to advance our clinical pipeline, we are also taking steps to evaluate infrastructure that could support long-term scalability.”

 The Company emphasized that the land recognition follows applicable accounting standards and responds to prior disclosures related to asset valuation methodology in the 2024 Form 10-K.
