# Social entrepreneurs honored for lifesaving innovations

(NewMediaWire) - January 30, 2025 - DALLAS, Jan. 30, 2025 – An organization that developed a health monitor to continuously track blood oxygen levels and one that launched a digital health platform to provide peer support to people recovering from addiction are the recipients of the 2025 Impact with Heart awards from the American Heart Association. The Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, annually recognizes leaders in innovative entrepreneurship that supports equitable health outcomes.

 According to the just released American Heart Association 2025 Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics report, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally. Data in the report finds that health risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease – including obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes – are increasing at alarming rates especially among underrepresented groups.

 "The American Heart Association is dedicated to changing the future of health and driving equitable health outcomes across all communities," said American Heart Association Chief Executive Officer Nancy Brown. "Through events like Impact with Heart, we can celebrate entrepreneurial excellence while also forging new collaborations that will further the fight against cardiovascular disease particularly among people and communities most at risk. At the American Heart Association our future is about improving yours."

 Brown said the Impact with Heart celebration showcases innovative and effective projects to drive equitable health. The event brings together local community based, entrepreneurial organizations supported by the American Heart Association’s Social Impact Funds and EmPOWERED to Serve Business Accelerator™. Attendees had the opportunity to engage with the founders of several participating and funded organizations and learn how these entrepreneurs are driving sustainable, scalable changes in their local communities.

 The year’s third annual event took place Jan. 29 at The Ailey Studios in New York City. CNBC network television Senior Personal Finance Correspondent Sharon Epperson served as mistress of ceremonies and Season 2 American Idol winner Ruben Studdard shared his personal health journey.

 Two trailblazing organizations whose work embodies the spirit of innovation and impact were honored with Impact with Heart awards:

 * Sober Sidekick headquartered in Marina Del Ray, California, was recognized for its groundbreaking digital health engagement platform which uses an "Empathy Algorithm" to provide peer support for people recovering from addiction. The organization was founded by Chris Thompson as a personal project while he was in the early stages of sobriety. His experience overcoming addiction fuels his mission to empower others through this decentralized mental health tool. The organization has received equity-based venture capital funding from the American Heart Association Social Impact Funds and has provided support to over 341,000 people to date.
* OxiWear is located in Arlington, Virginia, and is a participant in the American Heart Association’s EmPOWERED to Serve Business Accelerator. The company’s lifesaving FDA-approved medical wearable device provides continuous, real-time oxygen monitoring and emergency alerts for people with pulmonary conditions. The tool was developed by company founder Shavini Fernando after she was diagnosed with severe pulmonary hypertension.

 “It often takes years for the best practices in medicine to translate into commercially available, broadly adopted standards of care, and sometimes breakthrough advancements never reach patients at all,” said Marsha Jones, volunteer board chair of the American Heart Association and former executive vice president and chief diversity officer for The PNC Financial Services Group. said. “The American Heart Association is working to change that by strategically investing in organizations to accelerate the scale and spread of their innovations. We’re proud to recognize this year’s Impact with Heart recipients and support their efforts as part of our mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.”

 The American Heart Association Social Impact Funds, launched in 2018, support community-based solutions that reduce social and economic barriers to equitable health for all. The investment strategy complements the work of the Association’s strategic goal to address nonmedical, social and economic barriers that cause many people to develop heart disease and have shorter, unhealthier lives. By providing equity-based investments to emerging for profit businesses and philanthropic grants to nonprofit organizations, the Social Impact Funds support the sustainability and spread of evidence-based solutions across diverse markets and issues. The Social Impact Funds are part of American Heart Association Ventures.

 The EmPOWERED to Serve Business Accelerator provides philanthropic support to social and digital health entrepreneurs and organizations that are driving change through health justice in their communities and specifically target food insecurity, transportation, access to health care, STEM, youth education and more.
