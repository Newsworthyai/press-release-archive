# Shear Kershman Labs, Texas A&M College of Dentistry, and Innovative MedTech Inc. Sign Memorandum of Understanding for Groundbreaking Therapeutic Platform Technology

BLUE ISLAND, IL - January 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Shear Kershman Laboratories, a leader in healthcare innovation, Texas A&M University College of Dentistry, a globally recognized institution in oral healthcare and education, and Innovative MedTech Inc. (OTC: IMTH), a cutting-edge medical technology developer, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on transformative healthcare initiatives in oral care.

 Commenting on the MOU, Michael Friedman, President & CEO of Innovative MedTech, stated, “The MOU sets the foundation for a strategic partnership aimed at advancing medical and dental technologies, enhancing patient care, and fostering groundbreaking research. By combining Shear Kershman Labs’ healthcare expertise, Texas A&M’s academic and research excellence, and Innovative MedTech’s technological prowess, the collaboration is poised to redefine the future of healthcare delivery and innovation. We are incredibly excited to be leading the charge in developing what we view as a revolutionary therapeutic platform for oral care.”

 A Shared Vision for Innovation and Impact

 Under the terms of the MOU, the three organizations will:

 * Develop Innovative Solutions: Jointly design and implement advanced technologies to address critical challenges in oral health and overall patient care.
* Advance Education and Training: Enhance academic programs and provide practical training opportunities for students and professionals to ensure the next generation of healthcare providers is equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills.
* Promote Collaborative Research: Conduct groundbreaking studies and clinical trials to drive medical and dental advancements, with a focus on improving patient outcomes globally.

 Focus on Bioequivalency Study for Oral Thrush Treatment

 A key component of the MOU includes a bioequivalency study for Oral Thrush, also known as oral candidiasis. Shear Kershman Labs has developed a long-lasting formulation, BioViscid™, which is designed to provide highly effective bio-adhesion across both dry and mucosal tissues. Early trials with volunteers affected by thrush indicate that BioViscid™ delivers sustained release profiles over 6-8 hours post-application. Initial data from in vitro tests demonstrate that BioViscid™ maintains its adherence and controlled release properties even in high-moisture environments (including eating and drinking), while showing no adverse reactions on skin or mucosal tissues.

 With its unique combination as an amphipathic molecule and bio-adhesive encapsulation, BioViscid™ establishes itself as a pioneering technology in drug delivery. This innovation maximizes therapeutic effects and convenience for users, making it a transformative platform for medical and consumer health applications requiring stability, controlled release, and targeted application.

 Unlike existing treatments like fluconazole or amphotericin B, which are often systemically administered, BioViscid™ represents a significant advancement as it adheres to the mucosal cavity and avoids first-pass metabolism, enhancing efficacy and patient experience.

 Leadership Perspectives

 “BioViscid™ represents a breakthrough in the treatment of oral thrush,” said Dr. Blake Hawley, of Shear Kershman Labs. “Unlike current options, our formulation ensures sustained contact with the affected area, dramatically improving therapeutic outcomes and patient convenience.”

 Dr. Lily T. Garcia, Dean of Texas A&M College of Dentistry, stated, “This partnership exemplifies the transformative potential of collaboration between academia and industry. BioViscid™ represents more than innovation; it is a testament to the remarkable outcomes possible when science, technology, and patient care align. We are excited to see the impact this will have on advancing oral healthcare.”

 Oral Thrush: Prevalence and Market Opportunity

 Oral candidiasis, commonly known as oral thrush, affects approximately 5-7% of Americans, particularly those with weakened immune systems, infants, elderly individuals, and people using certain medications (like corticosteroids or antibiotics) that disrupt normal microbial balance. Populations at higher risk include those with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or cancer, as well as individuals using dentures. This prevalence translates to millions of cases annually in the U.S.

 The global market size for oral candidiasis treatments is estimated to be around $4-6 billion, driven by prescription and over-the-counter antifungal medications, mouth rinses, and topical formulations. This market is expected to grow with the aging population, increasing incidence of immunocompromised conditions, and a rising awareness of the need for effective treatment options. Novel drug delivery systems, such as bio-adhesive or sustained-release formulations, are positioned to revolutionize this space.

 Anticipated Impact

 The collaboration is expected to produce significant breakthroughs, including:

 * The development of novel drug delivery methods for oral diseases.
* Innovative treatment solutions to improve patient care in underserved communities.
* Enhanced curriculum offerings at Texas A&M College of Dentistry to bridge the gap between technology and traditional practice.
