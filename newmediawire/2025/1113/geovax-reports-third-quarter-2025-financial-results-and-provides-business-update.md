# GeoVax Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Business Update

Quarter Highlighted by GEO-MVA Acceleration Amid Global Mpox Emergency, Gedeptin® Expansion Into New Solid Tumor Programs, and Strong GEO-CM04S1 Clinical Data in Immunocompromised Patients

 Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET

 ATLANTA, GA - November 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multi-antigenic vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided a business update highlighting key corporate and clinical advancements across its vaccine and oncology programs.

 “As highlighted in this report, during the third quarter GeoVax continued making important progress, advancing innovative vaccines and immunotherapies that address urgent and underserved medical needs,” said David Dodd, GeoVax’s Chairman and CEO. “With continued global Mpox spread and constrained vaccine supply, our GEO-MVA program represents a U.S.-based, scalable, next-generation MVA platform. Our EMA and BARDA-aligned program position GeoVax to accelerate regulatory readiness and commercial entry.

 “For our GEO-CM04S1 COVID-19 vaccine program, recent clinical presentations validate our belief that multi-antigen vaccines - expressing both spike and nucleocapsid - are essential for breadth and durability in vulnerable immunocompromised populations. In particular, the robust immune responses demonstrated in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients represents a meaningful step forward in addressing the unmet needs of over 40 million immunocompromised Americans.

 “In our Gedeptin® oncology program, the expansion into multiple solid tumor indications builds upon a growing recognition that tumor-targeted immune priming can dramatically improve checkpoint outcomes. We are executing a clear path to clinical and commercial value creation.

 Dodd concluded, “GeoVax continues to execute with purpose and discipline. Our multi-antigen vaccine and immunotherapy platforms position the Company squarely within the national call to strengthen America’s health security, expand domestic manufacturing, and deliver equitable global solutions.”

 Third Quarter 2025 Operational Highlights

 GEO-MVA (Mpox/Smallpox Vaccine): Expedited Development Amid Expanding Global Crisis

 * GeoVax accelerated development of its GEO-MVA vaccine in response to the World Health Organization’s reaffirmation of Mpox as a global public health emergency, as Clade I outbreaks continued across Africa, Europe, and the U.S.
* Favorable scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) supported a streamlined regulatory pathway for GEO-MVA, advancing the Company’s goal of becoming a critically important diversified supplier of MVA vaccine addressing the Mpox increasing threat.
* A new research collaboration with the University of Queensland and UniQuest will evaluate needle-free delivery using Vaxxas’ high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) platform, targeting improved thermostability, self-administration, and dose-sparing performance - features critical for pandemic preparedness and global vaccine equity.

 GEO-CM04S1 (Multi-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine): Strong Immunogenicity Data and CLL Trial Success

 * GeoVax advanced its Phase 2 clinical trials of GEO-CM04S1 - its multi-antigen COVID-19 vaccine for immunocompromised populations - and released encouraging interim data from both blood cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient cohorts.
* At the 6th ESCMID Conference on Vaccines (Lisbon, Portugal) and iwCLL 2025 Workshop (Krakow, Poland), GeoVax presented data confirming the differentiated performance of GEO-CM04S1:  No serious adverse events attributed to GEO-CM04S1, confirming the strong safety profile of the MVA platform. Robust T-cell and cross-variant antibody responses in CLL and hematologic cancer patients - immune activity that exceeded that of standard-of-care mRNA vaccines. Primary endpoint achieved: The CLL trial met its immunogenicity target, prompting discontinuation of the comparator mRNA arm. Durability: Sustained cellular responses were observed across multiple timepoints, indicating long-term protection potential for immunocompromised patients. Next-generation construct: Incorporating the Omicron KP.2 Spike gene for enhanced variant coverage, planned for 2026 trial launch.

 Gedeptin® (Oncolytic Gene-Directed Therapy): Expanding to New Solid Tumor Indications

 * Following publication of KEYNOTE-689 Phase 3 results confirming the role of perioperative checkpoint inhibition in head and neck cancer, GeoVax announced plans for a Phase 2 trial (AdPNP-203) evaluating Gedeptin + pembrolizumab + fludarabine in first-line, resectable HNSCC, with initiation targeted for 2H 2026.
* Simultaneously, preclinical studies are expanding into triple-negative breast and cutaneous cancers in collaboration with Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute, assessing checkpoint combination strategies.

 Other Corporate and Strategic Updates

 * Alignment with U.S. Policy Priorities: GeoVax’s U.S.-based MVA platform directly supports the Administration’s and Congress’s bipartisan calls for onshoring, “Made in America,” and pandemic-preparedness investments, as echoed in recent ASPR, BARDA, and State Department initiatives.  The Company’s continuous avian cell line manufacturing process aligns with legislative goals to modernize domestic biomanufacturing and reduce dependency on foreign vaccine suppliers. Engagements continue with ASPR, BARDA, CEPI, Africa CDC, WHO, and UNICEF, reinforcing the Company’s commitment to biodefense, preparedness, and equitable access.
* Regulatory Alignment: Ongoing EMA interactions support an accelerated GEO-MVA commercialization pathway.
* Global Health Equity Engagement: GeoVax sponsored the Dr. David Satcher Global Health Equity Summit to highlight its leadership in equitable vaccine innovation.
* Public Health Credibility: The Company reaffirmed its commitment to evidence-based vaccine safety and transparency, emphasizing the longstanding safety record of the MVA platform in immunocompromised and special populations.

 Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

 Net Loss: Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, was $6,318,914, or $0.31 per share, as compared to $5,815,468, or $0.91 per share, for the comparable period in 2024. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s net loss was $17,046,348, or $0.97 per share, as compared to $16,729,642, or $4.52 per share, in 2024.

 Revenue: During the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2025, the Company reported $-0- and $2,489,145 of government contract revenues associated with the BARDA/RRPV Project NextGen award, compared to $2,789,484 and $3,090,161 for the comparable periods in 2024. During April 2025, GeoVax received notification that BARDA determined to terminate the contract for convenience to the government.

 R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $5,043,504 and $15,127,090 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, compared with $7,402,884 and $16,105,480 for the comparable periods in 2024, with the overall decrease primarily related to discontinued costs associated with termination of the BARDA/RRPV Contract, as well as lower costs for the GEO-CM04S1 clinical trials and manufacturing costs associated with the GEO-CM04S1 and Gedeptin programs.
