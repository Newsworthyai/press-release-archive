# Genesis Holdings Selects DigiShares as White-Label Technology Provider for Travaleo, Its Luxury Branded Real Estate STO Platform

ALPHARETTA, GA - November 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Genesis Holdings Inc., Regen (OTC: GNIS), a pioneering real estate investment and digital asset company, announced today that it has officially selected DigiShares, a leading white-label platform for tokenized securities, to provide the backend technology infrastructure for its soon-to-be-announced platform Travaleo - a boutique hotel and luxury residence investment marketplace.

 This newly formalized agreement is a significant move in Regen’s strategic rollout of its real estate tokenization strategy. The collaboration empowers Travaleo with a seamless, end-to-end system to issue, manage, and enable the trading of Security Tokens. These digital assets are directly backed by income-generating luxury real estate assets in some of the world’s most desirable travel destinations.

 Travaleo’s core mission is to blend the inherent stability of high-yield luxury real estate with the transformative efficiency of blockchain technology. This model will provide qualified investors fractionalized access to an exclusive portfolio of branded residences and boutique hotels across Latin America and Europe. All assets on the platform will be digitized and managed through the DigiShares system, ensuring compliance, transparency, and investor control through blockchain-based smart contracts.

 “We are proud to partner with DigiShares, a recognized leader in digital securities infrastructure,” said Oscar Brito, CEO of Regen and visionary behind Travaleo. “Their technology allows us to focus on our core mission - giving global investors access to iconic real estate with built-in income and long-term value, wrapped in the trustless transparency of tokenization.”

 “We are thrilled to be selected by Genesis Holdings as the technology backbone for the innovative Travaleo platform,” said Claus Skaaning, CEO of DigiShares. “The team's deep expertise in luxury real estate, combined with our proven, white-label tokenization technology, creates a powerful synergy. We are dedicated to providing the secure and compliant infrastructure Travaleo needs to unlock this high-value asset class for investors worldwide.”

 Oscar Brito brings an extensive track record in luxury real estate and digital asset innovation. As a co-founder of The London Bulgari Hotel and a former board member of the development team behind the historic Admiralty Arch, also in London, Brito has played a key role in transforming legacy properties into modern luxury destinations. His real estate portfolio spans the Americas, with multi-million-dollar investments in the United States, Dominican Republic and Argentina.
