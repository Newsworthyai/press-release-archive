# Fitzroy Minerals Welcomes Resources Expert and Shareholder Craig Parry as Technical Advisor

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - November 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Fitzroy Minerals Inc. (TSXV: FTZ, OTCQB: FTZFF) (“Fitzroy” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Craig Parry as Technical Advisor to the Company.

 Mr. Parry is a mining executive and geologist with a proven track record of founding, leading, and financing successful resource companies. He currently serves as Lead Director of Skeena Resources, Executive Chairman and CEO of Vizsla Copper, Chairman of Vizsla Silver, and Advisor to Abitibi Metals. Over his career, he has held key roles with IsoEnergy, NexGen Energy, EMR Capital, Tigers Realm Coal, and Rio Tinto. Mr. Parry has been instrumental in several major discoveries, including Vizsla’s Panuco-Copala silver veins, IsoEnergy’s Hurricane deposit, and NexGen’s Arrow deposit.

 Mr. Parry graduated from The University of New South Wales and holds a Bachelor of Science (Applied Geology) with first class Honours and the University Medal.

 Craig Parry commented: “I’m thrilled to join Fitzroy Minerals as the company advances its Chilean copper projects. It is rare that a company has two projects with this much potential.

 I initially invested in Fitzroy because of the Buen Retiro copper project which I think could be a major IOCG1 discovery. I am also delighted that Fitzroy management has outlined a fast-track route to non-operated copper production at Buen Retiro, which could give the Company sufficient cash flow to self-fund exploration in future years.

 In addition, the discovery of copper-molybdenum-gold-rhenium mineralization at Caballos in one of the world’s most prolific porphyry belts has further galvanised my support. Having worked for many years in this region I understand the significance of this target and see it as having potential to deliver a major new copper discovery as exploration drilling continues.”

 Merlin Marr-Johnson, CEO of Fitzroy Minerals, stated, “As the Buen Retiro and Caballos projects advance we will expand our skill-set and our team judiciously. In this vein, we are very pleased to welcome existing shareholder Craig Parry as Technical Advisor to the Company. Craig has a fantastic track-record of discovery, de-risking, and wealth-creation and his experience will help us deliver value to all stakeholders in the Fitzroy Minerals portfolio.”
