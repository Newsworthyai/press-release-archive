# Quantum Announces 93% Gallium Recovery

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLOMBIA - November 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantum Critical Metals Corp. (TSX.V: LEAP | OTCQB: ATOXF | FSE: 86A1) ("Quantum" or the "Company"), a junior explorer focused on advancing critical minerals, has achieved a major milestone in its mission to secure North America’s critical metals supply chain. The Company is pleased to report a 93% gallium recovery from preliminary bench-scale metallurgical test work on mica samples from its 100% owned NMX East Project in the James Bay region of Québec.

 This breakthrough indicates the potential for mica to be a significant new sourceof gallium, a critical metal used in semiconductors, 5G technology, defense systems, and renewable energy applications. Traditionally, gallium is recovered as a byproduct of bauxite or zinc processing - making Quantum one of the first companies to demonstrate successful direct recovery from mica.

 Quantum’s early focus on metallurgical optimization and critical metal extraction positions it as a front-runner in developing domestic gallium supply. The discovery strengthens Canada’s strategic role in securing Western access to essential materials amid global supply disruptions caused by China’s export controls on gallium.

 Gallium is typically recovered from bauxite (alumina refineries) or zinc processing residues. Mica hosted gallium is an unconventional source, but recent studies have shown that through acid baking and leaching of floatation concentrations there is recovery potential as demonstrated by Quantum.

 Marcy Kiesman, CEO of Quantum Critical Metals Corp. commented:

 "A 93% recovery of gallium is a strategically significant milestone for Quantum. The next important step will be to validate the process at scale in efforts to establish Canada as a domestic gallium supplier for North America. A domestic gallium supply will reduce our reliance upon Chinese exports and position Quantum as a key player in the critical metals value chain to strengthen Western national security.”

 About NMX East

 The NMX East project is 100% owned by Quantum Critical Metals Corp. The site has historically been explored for the lithium potential in the pegmatites at site. Quantum has recently been studying the gallium association within the pegmatite with the objective of determining the feasibility of extracting the metal from the pegmatite. The site is also strategically located near Power Metallic Mines Inc. which announced a recently expanded land position near its Nisk-Lion-Tiger polymetallic discoveries. On June 9th, 2025, a land acquisition of 167 km² from Li-FT Power Ltd. highlighted the regional development and underscores the broader area’s potential for polymetallic exploration. Power Metallic Acquires 167KM² from Li-FT Power, Expanding Nisk - Lion Polymetallic Project Area by over 300%.
