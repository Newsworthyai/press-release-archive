# OncoX Deepens ABVC Alliance

CEO Yen Wen Pin’s IPO Vision Gains Traction as OncoX Expands Pipeline

 SILICON VALLEY, CA - August 1, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABVC) ("Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic solutions in ophthalmology, CNS (central nervous systems), and oncology/hematology, today shared a strategic update on its ongoing collaboration with OncoX BioPharma, Inc., a rising oncology player that has licensed four IND-stage drug assets from ABVC. The two companies have taken another step forward, as OncoX continues to unlock funding to support product advancement under its bold, innovation-driven roadmap.

 Led by its CEO, Mr. Yen Wen Pin, OncoX has leveraged its core competencies in natural product innovation and dietary supplements to build a unique position in oncology. The Company is actively translating its strengths into a pipeline of immunotherapy-driven treatments supported by ABVC’s IND-stage programs. Mr. Yen’s strategic vision includes building long-term revenue streams through therapeutic innovation and cross-sector expansion.

 “We are building OncoX with a long-term vision to deliver real value to patients and investors,” said Mr. Yen Wen Pin, CEO of OncoX BioPharma. “Through the licensed INDs from ABVC and continued collaboration, we’re pushing forward innovative therapies that will anchor our strategy and will help facilitate our momentum, stability, and strong identity in the cancer therapeutics space.”

 OncoX’s platform centers around immunotherapy-inspired cancer treatments derived from ABVC’s clinical-stage portfolio. Each program represents a carefully selected opportunity - designed not for the sake of headlines, but for real progress. OncoX has deliberately raised capital in phases, allocating it directly to the development of these candidates. Its recent funding efforts have led to the fulfillment of an additional milestone payment, a sign of both operational discipline and intent.

 “We view this partnership as a case study in how smart biotech collaborations can grow over time,” said Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer. “OncoX’s consistent execution has translated into steady licensing revenue for ABVC and increasing momentum around these oncology programs. We’re optimistic about what the next chapters will bring.”

 Including this latest milestone, ABVC and its subsidiaries have now recorded a total of $1.396 million in cumulative licensing income from OncoX and other strategic partners, including AiBtl BioPharma and ForSeeCon Eye Corporation.

 With each step forward, OncoX brings new definition to its roadmap - blending innovation with pragmatism, and aligning business development efforts with the scientific potential of its pipeline. OncoX remains focused on developing not only drug candidates, but a revenue-generating model grounded in credibility and commercial viability.About OncoX BioPharma
