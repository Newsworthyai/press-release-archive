# AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. Announces Exclusive Distribution Agreement With VisionPlus Corp. for TearScan® Lactoferrin and IgE Diagnostic Tests in South Korea

SAN DIEGO, CA - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. (OTC:AXIM) (“AXIM”), a leader in rapid, point-of-care ocular diagnostics, today announced it has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VisionPlus Corp. (“VisionPlus”) to market and distribute AXIM’s TearScan® Lactoferrin Test for the detection of aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) and TearScan® IgE Test for ocular allergy throughout South Korea.

 Under the agreement, VisionPlus receives exclusive rights to distribute AXIM’s TearScan® Lactoferrin and TearScan® IgE diagnostic tests, both supported by the I-Peak digital reader, across South Korea. The companies will collaborate on Korean MFDS registration, targeting simultaneous submissions for both assays. VisionPlus will lead local compliance, regulatory coordination, and commercialization through its established network of ophthalmology clinics, hospitals, and specialty Dry Eye Centers.

 The initial term of the agreement is one year, with automatic one-year renewals for an additional four years tied to annual sales milestones. AXIM will retain manufacturing control, intellectual-property ownership, and provide regulatory and technical support for market entry and ongoing product quality compliance.

 Catalina Valencia, President of AXIM Biotechnologies, stated:“VisionPlus is an exceptional partner with a proven commitment to advancing ocular health. Their clinical insight and national reach make them ideal to introduce AXIM’s TearScan® platform to South Korea. This collaboration will bring quantitative tear diagnostics directly to clinicians, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more personalized care for patients suffering from dry eye disease and ocular allergy.”

 Jerry Park, President of VisionPlus Corp., added:“Years ago, VisionPlus recognized that the global rise in digital device use and worsening environmental conditions would lead to an epidemic of Dry Eye Disease. We established dedicated Dry Eye Clinics across Korea in anticipation of that need. AXIM’s TearScan® Lactoferrin and IgE tests will complete our vision—creating a one-stop diagnostic and treatment ecosystem for Dry Eye Disease and related conditions.”

 AXIM’s TearScan® diagnostic portfolio provides quantitative, point-of-care tear biomarker analysis in minutes, using a small tear sample. The system’s reader delivers precise measurements that help clinicians differentiate between aqueous-deficient dry eye, evaporative dry eye, and allergic conjunctivitis - a crucial distinction for selecting effective therapy and monitoring patient progress.
