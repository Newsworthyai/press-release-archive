# Frequency Holdings (OTC: FRQN) CEO Rick Jordan Featured on NewsNation Prime to Discuss $1 Billion National Text Scam

NEW YORK, NY - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Rick Jordan, CEO of Frequency Holdings Inc. (OTC: FRQN) and its cybersecurity subsidiary ReachOut Digital Intelligence, appeared live on NewsNation Prime over the weekend to break down a Wall Street Journal report detailing a $1 billion nationwide text message scam that has defrauded Americans through fake toll notifications and other mobile fraud schemes.

 In the six-minute segment, unusually long for national broadcast interviews, Jordan was featured as the leading cybersecurity expert explaining how human behavior, social engineering, and geo-targeted “smishing” attacks have become more sophisticated than ever.

 “Cybersecurity today isn’t just about firewalls or software, it’s about human awareness,” said Jordan. “These criminal groups operate like corporations, using precision targeting, grammar-checked messages, and emotional triggers to manipulate people. My mission, and ReachOut’s, is to protect Americans and small businesses from exactly this kind of threat.”

 Jordan went on to call for stronger accountability from major mobile carriers and greater consumer choice in mobile protection services, adding that he would “gladly pay a few dollars a month to stop these attacks before they ever reach a phone.”

 This latest national appearance follows Rick Jordan’s ongoing presence across major U.S. media outlets including Bloomberg, FOX Business, Cheddar, CBS News, and NewsNation, where he is frequently invited to explain complex cybersecurity issues “for America”, as one producer described it.

 Jordan’s expertise has made him a go-to commentator for translating emerging cyber threats into actionable insights for both consumers and enterprises. His plainspoken approach and long-form network segments continue to elevate Frequency Holdings’ and ReachOut's visibility as a credible force in cybersecurity, compliance, and AI-driven digital defense.

 “Being trusted by national networks to interpret billion-dollar cyber issues is a reflection of the same trust our clients place in us,” added Jordan. “Every public appearance strengthens the Frequency and ReachOut brands as reliable defenders in a digital world that’s getting noisier - and more dangerous - by the day.”
