# tZERO and Archax Team Up to Expand Global Distribution and Cross-List Digital Assets

Bridging US, UK, and European markets to deliver liquidity and investor connectivity

 NEW YORK, NY and LONDON - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - tZERO Group, Inc., a pioneer in blockchain and tokenization for capital markets, and Archax, the UK/EU-regulated digital asset platform, have today announced a strategic partnership to cross-list and distribute digital securities and other tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to expand their global reach. The collaboration opens new distribution channels for issuers and broadens access for investors - delivering greater global connectivity, liquidity, and efficiency in the evolving digital securities ecosystem.

 Through this partnership, tZERO and Archax will work together to streamline the process for digital securities issuers to list their assets across multiple venues, allowing them to tap into a broader international investor base and provide access to deeper pools of liquidity. Dual listings matter because they boost trading opportunities and liquidity, attracting market makers who add depth through arbitrage and hedging. In addition, as part of this partnership, tZERO will become an investor in Archax.

 By connecting two leading, regulated marketplaces and custodians - tZERO in the US and Archax in the UK/EU - the partnership strengthens an important leg in infrastructure supporting digital securities worldwide. It addresses a key need in the market: enabling issuers to reach investors across jurisdictions without the traditional barriers of geography and fragmentation. It also expands access to other listings on each platform - such as tokenized real-world assets like money market funds and other structured products.

 “A key reason for tokenization is geographic convergence. While financial markets are global and increasingly digital, yet the world remains highly fragmented,” said Alan Konevsky, CEO of tZERO. “Digital assets can trade 24/7, across borders, and while convergence initiatives are underway at the policy level, real progress depends on stitching together ‘follow-the-sun’ infrastructure that reduces frictions and creates a smoother experience for capital formation, trading and custody for issuers and investors. Archax is a key partner for us in the UK and Europe, where we are aligning regulated digital asset infrastructure with institutional demand, and together we are setting the foundation for expansion into other regions. This relationship is central to tZERO’s global infrastructure and strategic partnerships initiatives, laying the rails for a new era of interconnected, compliant, and resilient market access.”

 "This collaboration with tZERO demonstrates Archax’s commitment to bridging traditional finance and the digital world," added Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax. "Together, we are providing issuers with seamless access to international markets and helping investors benefit from enhanced liquidity and connectivity."

 “Institutional-grade digital markets will only reach their potential when regulated venues interconnect across borders,” said Al Swimmer, Chief Strategic Relationships Manager at tZERO. “Partnering with Archax allows us to do exactly that – build a trusted global network that expands liquidity, enhances investor access, and sets the standard for cross-border digital asset distribution.”

 As institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, regulated marketplaces and custodians such as tZERO and Archax play a critical role in providing trusted infrastructure. This partnership signals an important milestone in building a more integrated, efficient and globally connected ecosystem for all aspects of digital securities.
