# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Executes a Confidentiality Agreement with H. Cegielski - Poznan S.A.

VANCOUVER, BC - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications and security platforms, is pleased to announce the execution of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with H. Cegielski - Poznań S.A. (HCP), a subsidiary of Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa S.A. (PGZ), one of Poland’s leading defence and industrial groups. HCP, headquartered in Poznań, is a historic and strategically significant manufacturing enterprise within the Polish defence sector.

 The NDA establishes a framework for the exchange and protection of confidential information between the two organisations in relation to the manufacture of CiTech’s Nexus Tower. Under the agreement, both parties will securely share technical documentation, design data, and other proprietary materials associated with the production and assembly of the Nexus system.

 This collaboration marks a major step in CiTech’s European industrial expansion, supporting its plans to establish localised manufacturing and engineering partnerships across Europe. As part of the PGZ Group, HCP brings extensive expertise in heavy manufacturing, precision engineering, and defence-sector production, making it an ideal partner for the Nexus Tower program.

 “The signing of this NDA with HCP represents another key milestone in CiTech’s international growth strategy,” said Brenton Scott, CEO, CiTech. “HCP’s world-class manufacturing capability, backed by the strength and resources of PGZ, aligns perfectly with our goal of delivering advanced, relocatable infrastructure platforms for defence, emergency response, and critical communications.”

 The Nexus Tower Project involves the design and production of a 20-metre autonomous, relocatable tower system capable of rapid deployment to support communications, surveillance, and integrated mission systems. This collaboration will enable efficient production scaling, leveraging HCP’s industrial facilities, workforce, and the PGZ Group’s extensive defence manufacturing infrastructure.
