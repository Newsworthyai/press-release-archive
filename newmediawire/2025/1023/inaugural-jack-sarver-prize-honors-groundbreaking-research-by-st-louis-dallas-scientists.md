# Inaugural Jack Sarver Prize Honors Groundbreaking Research by St. Louis, Dallas Scientists

DALLAS - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Zainab Mahmoud, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Zhao Zhang, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, will receive the inaugural Jack Sarver Prize in Clinical Science and Jack Sarver Prize in Basic Science, respectively, at the American Heart Association’ Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, to be held Nov. 7-10, 2025, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. The awards will be presented during dinner events of the Council on Clinical Cardiology and the Council on Basic Cardiovascular Sciences on Saturday, November 8, 2025.

 The Jack Sarver Prize in Clinical Science and the Jack Sarver Prize in Basic Science were established through a gift to the American Heart Association in honor of Jack Sarver who died of heart disease in 1979 at the age of 58. The Sarver family’s struggle against heart disease began in the paternal family line generations before his birth. Childhood memories of the young father’s struggle have motivated the family to “end the heritage of heart disease."

 Dr. Mahmoud is recognized for her abstract entitled, “Aspirin Prophylaxis for Preeclampsia Prevention in Nigeria: A Mixed Methods Study.” Noting that more women die in Nigeria around the time of childbirth than in any other country in the world and that preeclampsia is a leading cause of these deaths, her study assessed aspirin use among at-risk pregnant women and explored ways to overcome obstacle to improve treatment options. Mahmoud concluded that addressing barriers that included poor dissemination of guidelines, limited provider and patient awareness, delayed prenatal care and cost, this evidence based, low-cost intervention could significantly reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in Nigeria and other high-burden settings.

 Dr. Zhang is recognized for his abstract entitled, “Forward Genetic Screen Identifies HELZ2 as a Central Regulator of APOB mRNA Stability Linking Hepatic Steatosis and Atherosclerosis.”

 Zhang’s research looked at how genetic factors can impact apolipoprotein B (APOB), which is a key protein involved in how the body transports lipids through the bloodstream. The research considered how APOB can affect the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), in which excessive fat accumulates in the liver and can lead to inflammation and liver damage, and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in arterial walls. Using a mouse model, his study investigated mechanisms for addressing these risks and discovered a rare, dominant mutation implicating HELZ2 protein as a potential therapeutic target for MASLD and atherosclerosis.

 “We are honored to recognize Dr. Zainab Mahmoud and Dr. Zhao Zhang with the first-ever Jack Sarver Prize awards,” said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women’s health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women’s Health of Northwell Health in New York City. “Their research touches on the very foundation on which this award was established - preventing cardiovascular disease to improve the lives of people for generations to come. It truly embodies the mission of the American Heart Association to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives."

 Dr. Mahmoud earned a bachelor’s degree and a medical doctorate from Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. She has a diploma in tropical medicine from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and she earned a master’s in health policy from Imperial College London. She completed an internship and residency in internal medicine and was chief resident at Pennsylvania Hospital and completed her fellowship in cardiovascular diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. A physician-scientist whose research is focused on generating evidence in key aspects of cardio-obstetric care to catalyze positive change, Mahmoud was the 2023 recipient of the Dr. Nanette K. Wenger Research Goes Red® Award for Best Scientific Publication on Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke in Women.

 Dr. Zhang earned a bachelor’s degree from Shandong University in Jinan, China and a Ph.D. in developmental biology from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. Following his Ph.D., he completed postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Beutler at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern). In June 2020, Dr. Zhang began his independent research career in the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at UT Southwestern where his research program uses a phenotype-first, forward genetics approach in mice to uncover mechanisms of cardiometabolic disease and inform strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.

 Submissions for the next award cycle will open in spring 2026. Established investigators may be eligible to be awarded over $35K to further their scientific research career. Visit Professional Membership Awards for details.
