# Ethema Signs LOI to Acquire Addiction Recovery Care (ARC)

WEST PALM BEACH, FL - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Ethema Health Corporation (OTC: GRST) (“Ethema” “GRST” or the “Company”), and Addiction Recovery Care LLC (“Vendor”) entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to purchase certain of the assets and separate entities operating under the ARC brand name in Kentucky. The Letter of Intent is to purchase certain of the assets of the ARC in-patient facilities in Kentucky operating in Inez, Pikeville, Owensboro and Ashland, along with out-patient facilities in Kentucky operating in Prestonsburg, Mount Sterling, Louisa, Ashland and Lexington. The separate entities include a Psychiatric Hospital, a Pharmacy, a Medical Laboratory and a Rural Health Clinic. The addiction treatment and psychiatric facilities have a capacity of approximately 900 patients. There are likely to be related real estate transactions involved in the acquisitions which will remain outside of the Company but could be utilized to generate substantial new equity for the Company.

 FINANCING

 The purchase price of the acquisitions will be funded with approximately 25% in cash, 25% in a vendor note and 50% in equity linked funding from the vendor. The cash portion will be raised by issuance of new equity and the proceeds from sale and subsequent leasing of certain of the ARC facilities. The Company has used real estate sale and subsequent leaseback transactions to finance its Florida operations in 2023.

 STRUCTURE

 The Company will create a new entity (“NewcoARIA”) to acquire the ARC assets and separate entities and will ultimately also hold the Company’s existing Florida and Kentucky treatment entities. NewcoARIA will be initially owned by Ethema, new investors and the Vendor. It is likely that the Company will pursue an Initial Public Offering of NewcoARIA on a senior U.S. exchange. The proposed structure would simplify this substantial acquisition and not complicate the equity and debt structure in Ethema. Total revenue in the existing Florida and Kentucky entities is forecast at approximately $25 million for 2026 and the revenues from the acquired assets and separate entities is forecast to exceed $100 million in 2026.

 Mr. Shawn Leon, Company CEO, reported, “The discussions that led to the signing of the LOI started in January 2025 and we are pleased to have finally reached an LOI agreement with ARC. The principle philosophy behind the proposal was that the combination of ARC’s assets with our ARIA Kentucky assets all operating under the ARIA brand, would create a statewide network of treatment facilities to not only service the entire state but to help steer the future of treatment in the state of Kentucky.”

 Mr. Leon added, “We will implement our highly regarded, responsible operating philosophy and procedures to NewcoARIA, operating at the highest level of safety and compliance as our overriding guiding principle, which results in the very best care possible for our clients.”

 Mr Tim Robinson, CEO of ARC, also added, “Throughout our considerable discussion process we came to trust that our clients and staff would be best served by combining our assets with ARIA. We remain committed to our staff, our clients and the ARC mission and believe that this will continue under the ARIA umbrella. We look forward to getting through a challenging year and we believe that the proposed transaction will help put this behind us.”
