* Company focuses resources on its most advanced clinical development programs while reducing early-stage research activities
* Organizational adjustments include a workforce reduction of approximately 50%, expected to lower operating costs and extend cash runway into Q1 2027
* Measures mark targeted continuation of the clinical development strategy outlined in May 2025

 BERLIN, Germany - October 23, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Managing Board and Supervisory Board of Pentixapharm Holding AG (Frankfurt Prime Standard: PTP), an advanced clinical-stage biotech developing novel radiopharmaceuticals, today jointly resolved to significantly reduce early-stage research and development activities and concentrate resources on the company’s most advanced clinical programs.

 This prioritization allows Pentixapharm to invest more effectively in its most value-generating development programs, including the Phase 3-ready CXCR4 flagship program for the improved diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension. This decision represents a continuation of the clinical development strategy introduced in May 2025, which prioritizes high-value CXCR4-targeted programs.

 The sharpened focus includes an adjustment of the organizational structure, accompanied by a targeted workforce reduction of approximately 50 % at Pentixapharm AG. Implementation is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2026. The adjustments are expected to lower annual operating costs and extend the company’s cash runway through the first quarter of 2027.

 “Our Phase 3-ready PentixaFor CXCR4 program for the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension has made significant progress in recent months and remains a central value driver, showcasing Pentixapharm’s clinical development expertise,” said Dr. Dirk Pleimes, CEO and CMO of Pentixapharm AG. “Optimizing our operational costs is an important step to enhance the company’s efficiency and lay a solid foundation for achieving the next clinical milestones. While the adjustment of our organizational structure was a carefully considered decision, it is essential to safeguard the company’s long-term value and support sustainable growth. We will implement the measures responsibly and support to our employees throughout the transition period.”
