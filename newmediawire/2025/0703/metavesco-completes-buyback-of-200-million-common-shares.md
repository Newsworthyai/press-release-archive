# Metavesco Completes Buyback of 200 Million Common Shares

CUMMING, GA - July 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced it has completed the repurchase of 200 million shares of its common stock.

 The Company has begun the procedural steps to have these common shares returned to the treasury for cancellation.

 “This buyback reflects our ongoing commitment to creating long-term shareholder value,” said Ryan Schadel, President and CEO of Metavesco. “Retiring shares at this level demonstrates our confidence in the Company’s growth strategy and our focus on improving per-share metrics.”

 The transaction, executed contractually on July 1, 2025, and completed on July 2, 2025, was structured as a stock redemption in a private transaction whereby the Company purchased 200 million common shares for $22,000 from a former affiliate. The retired shares represent a significant reduction in the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock of over 5% and will immediately be returned to treasury for cancellation.

 This action follows a series of strategic moves by Metavesco to strengthen its balance sheet, including the recently announced Bitcoin treasury initiative and targeted expansion of its wholly owned staffing subsidiary, Epic Labor.

 The Company remains focused on increasing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation, strategic asset growth, and operational execution across its current and future divisions.
