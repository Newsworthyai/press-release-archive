# Vanguard Mining Advances 90,000-Hectare Yuty Prometeo Uranium Project Adjacent to UEC's 8.96M lbs Deposit with NI 43-101 Technical Report Underway

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Vanguard Mining Corp. ("Vanguard" or the "Company") (CSE: UUU | OTC: RECHF | Frankfurt: SL5) is pleased to announce that it has retained senior geologist Mr. Ariel Testi, CPG, to prepare an initial NI 43-101 Technical Report on its newly acquired Yuty Prometeo Project (“Yuty Prometeo”) in southeastern Paraguay, with completion expected within the next 30 days. days.

 This update follows the previously announced Letter of Intent (“LOI”) on April 8, 2025, regarding Vanguard’s acquisition of a 90,000-hectare (222,395-acre) land package comprising the San Jose and Prometeo concessions. The Yuty Prometeo is situated within the Paraná Basin, adjacent and contiguous to UEC’s Yuty Project, which hosts a defined uranium resource of 8.96 million pounds.

 "As CEO of Vanguard Mining Corp., I view the acquisition of the Yuty Prometeo as a transformative milestone in our uranium exploration strategy. These highly prospective concessions - located adjacent to UEC’s established multi-million-pound Yuty deposit - strategically position us in one of the most promising uranium regions in South America. Bringing Ariel on board to prepare the initial NI 43-101 Technical Report is a valuable addition to this initiative, and I look forward to his insights and guidance as we advance the project," David Greenway, CEO, Vanguard Mining Corp.

 About Mr. Ariel Testi, CPG

 Mr. Ariel Testi is a seasoned geologist, economist, and entrepreneur with 22 years of experience in the mining industry. His expertise spans mineral exploration, project development, and the strategic management of mining companies.

 He began his career in 2003 as a project geologist, leading exploration programs targeting base metals, uranium, and precious metals across Argentina and Chile. Over the years, he has contributed to exploration efforts for several notable companies, including Anglo American PLC, BHP Billiton plc, Hochschild Mining plc, Northern Orion Resources Inc., and Mandalay Resources Corporation.

 In 2017, Mr. Testi joined Minera Cielo Azul S.A., a subsidiary of Blue Sky Uranium Corp., where he played a pivotal role in the discovery of the Ivana Deposit - a U-V deposit currently in the pre-feasibility stage. The deposit hosts an indicate resource of over 17 million pounds of U₃O₈ and has established a new uranium district in Argentina.

 Mr. Testi holds a Bachelor of Science in Geology from the University of La Plata (2000), a Master of Science in Applied Geology from Queen’s University (2012), and an Executive MBA from IAE Business School at Universidad Austral (2018). He is an active member of the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG), the American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG), and the Argentine Geological Society.

 About the Yuty Prometeo Project

 The Yuty Prometeo consists of four (4) concessions - three (3) San Jose concessions and one (1) Prometeo concession - covering a combined area of approximately 90,000 hectares (222,395 acres) within the uranium-rich Paraná Basin in southeastern Paraguay.

 The Prometeo Concession spans approximately 27,666 hectares (68,368 acres) and is directly contiguous to UEC’s Yuty Project. Historical records reference 28 drill holes on the property, with uranium values ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% U₃O₈. Data from previous work by the Anschutz Corporation suggest that the Prometeo block lies on trend with UEC’s adjacent Transandes block..

 The San Jose Concessions total approximately 62,210 hectares (153,754 acres) across three adjacent concessions, located along the Upper Permian–Carboniferous contact - about 100 km northwest of UEC’s Yuty Project and 40 km west of its Coronel Oviedo Project. A radiometric car survey conducted over a 40 km by 10 km area identified significant uranium anomalies across the property.

 Together, these concessions form a strategically located, highly prospective uranium exploration project within one of South America’s most promising uranium districts.

 About UEC’s Yuty ISR Project

 The Yuty ISR Project, owned by UEC, covers approximately 117,359 hectares (290,000 acres) and is located about 200 kilometers east and southeast of Asunción, the capital of Paraguay. Positioned within the Paraná Basin, the area hosts several known uranium deposits, including Figueira and Amorinópolis in Brazil. Preliminary studies indicate the deposit is amenable to in situ recovery (“ISR”) - the same low-cost extraction method UEC successfully employs at its operations in Texas.

 Modern exploration of the Yuty Project began in 1976, when Anschutz Corporation (“Anschutz “) of Denver, Colorado, conducted regional uranium exploration under a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corporation and Taiwan Power Company. Working under an exclusive concession covering 162,700 square kilometers, nearly the entire eastern half of Paraguay, Anschutz identified multiple target areas, including Yuty. From 1976 to 1983, the company drilled approximately 75,000 meters of core and rotary holes, halting further work due to declining uranium prices.

 In July 2006, CUE Resources Ltd. (“CUE”) acquired an option on the Yuty Project and launched its own rotary and diamond drilling campaigns. Between 2007 and 2010, CUE completed 256 drill holes totaling 31,000 meters, ultimately acquiring 100% ownership of the project.

 On March 30, 2012, UEC acquired all outstanding shares of CUE Resources Ltd., securing a 100% undivided interest in the Yuty Project.(1)
