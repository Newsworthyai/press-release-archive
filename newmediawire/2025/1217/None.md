By Meg Flippin, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - December 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Richard MacPherson, Founder, President and CEO of Birchtech Corp. (OTC: BCHT), was recently a guest on Benzinga All Access.

 MacPherson discussed the company’s third-quarter earnings results and Birchtech’s prospects for the remainder of this year and 2026. “We expect a strong finish to the year. A lot of it has to do with the progress we’ve made in our water treatment division,” MacPherson told Benzinga during the interview. “We’re very pleased with the pipeline we have going into 2026.”

 While Birchtech is known for its expertise in removing toxins and forever chemicals from water, MacPherson said a big growth driver for the company is treating water for utilities and power companies. The CEO said that’s an area that’s expected to add a "significant amount of revenue” through 2026.
