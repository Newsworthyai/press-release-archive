# UPDATE: Golden Cariboo Resources Intersects 0.56 g/t Gold Over 99.84m (327.56 ft)

VANCOUVER, BC - December 17, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE:GCC) (OTC:GCCFF) (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ) announces it has intersected 0.56 g/t gold over 99.84m (327.56 ft) in QGQ25-23 from 182.20m. Additionally, drill holes QGQ24-21 and QGQ25-23 to -24 each intersected intermittent anomalous gold mineralization but were terminated early due to mechanical issues while drilling. Intercepts are summarized in Table 1 with drill hole specifications in Table 2. All of the above holes ended within anomalous intersections. No significant results were obtained from QGQ25-22, which was terminated early due to excessive deviation of the hole.

 Ongoing drilling in the Fall is testing north of the Halo zone, with drill hole QGQ25-28 currently in progress. The Company is targeting proximal to the greenstone and argillite inferred contact to vector into further mineralization to the North.

 QA/QC samples, including blanks, standards and coarse reject duplicates, constitute 5% of the total number of samples. The reported drilling has all been NQ core, which has been logged, samples outlined, generally from 0.5 to 2m in length, by a Company geologist based on lithology, alteration and mineralization, then split in half before being sent to the laboratory. The core and samples are processed and stored at, and shipped from, the Company’s secure drill compound at Hixon, British Columbia all controlled by employees of the Company.

 The drill core samples were sent to the ALS Canada Ltd.’s laboratory (ALS) in North Vancouver where samples were internally sent to their Thunder Bay, Ontario facility for gold analysis by PhotonAssay™ (photon) technology for gold on an average 400-500g subsample. The ALS facilities are accredited to ISO 17025 standards and entirely independent from the Company. Photon analysis uses a larger size, compared to 30 or 50g in a Fire assay (FA), providing a more thorough assessment of gold distribution in coarse gold settings, characteristic of the Halo zone, where nugget effects can impact conventional assay results. Samples were also analyzed by ALS, North Vancouver for 36-elements by aqua regia digestion with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) finish on 0.5g aliquots after crushing to >70% passing below 2 mm and split using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing 500g splits to >85% passing below 75 microns.

 About Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd.

 Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. is rediscovering the Cariboo Gold Rush by proceeding with highly targeted drilling and trenching programs on its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property which is bordered by Osisko Development, partly intertwined with them at the north end of the Cariboo Gold Project, and located along a favourable corridor adjacent to the Spanish and Eureka thrust faults over a 94,899 hectare (234,501 acre) area. Historically, over 101 placer gold creeks on the 90-kilometer (56 mile) trend, from the Cariboo Hudson mine north to the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property, have recorded production with successful placer mining continuing to this day.

 Golden Cariboo’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of, and road accessible from, Hixon in central British Columbia. The Property includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 and developed over a footprint of about 150m x 150m (< 6 acres) at the Main zone straddling Hixon Creek. Overall, the geological setting of the gold mineralization at the Company’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property shows strong similarities with the Spanish Mountain gold deposit, situated 120 km (75 miles) towards the southeast along the same geological trend. As a sediment-hosted vein (SHV) deposit, the Spanish Mountain deposit is considered to belong to the epizonal orogenic subclass of gold deposits which include some of the world’s largest deposits such as Muruntau, Uzbekistan and Bendigo, Australia.
