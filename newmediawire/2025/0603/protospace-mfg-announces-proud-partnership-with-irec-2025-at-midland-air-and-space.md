# ProtoSpace Mfg Announces Proud Partnership With IREC 2025 at Midland Air and Space

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA - June 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ProtoSpace Mfg, the world leader in rapid manufacturing for aerospace, engineering, and research teams, is proud to announce its sponsorship and active participation in the International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) 2025, hosted this June at Midland International Air and Space Port in Midland, Texas. This year marks IREC’s exciting debut in Midland, as the event moves to accommodate growing student participation and to strengthen its impact on the aerospace sector.

 IREC, organized by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA), is the premier international collegiate rocketry competition, drawing over 2,000 in-person students this year, breaking its previous record of 1,700 participants. Teams from across the globe will showcase their complete rocket projects, demonstrating innovation, problem-solving, and resilience under real-world deadlines.

 ProtoSpace Mfg’s involvement aligns with its deep commitment to fueling the next generation of aerospace talent. Broadening its support beyond direct involvement with the teams, the company provided different manufacturing support to the competition, including the design and fabrication of new launch pads for Midland International Air and Space Port, payload form factor templates to effectively support students competing in the SDL Payload Challenge and custom rackmount cases for usage in the IREC livestream of the competition. Additionally, Dr. Doug Milburn, Co-Founder and Vice President of Protocase and ProtoSpace Mfg, will deliver a keynote address to students on Tuesday, June 10, sharing insights on innovation, iteration, and the critical role of rapid prototyping in aerospace breakthroughs.

 “This competition is not just about rockets - it’s about shaping tomorrow’s engineers and innovators,” said Dr. Doug Milburn. “IREC is unique because it pushes students to complete the full engineering cycle, from design and fabrication to launch, under intense time and technical pressures. This culture of rapid iteration and learning from failure is exactly what the aerospace industry thrives on - and exactly where ProtoSpace Mfg’s capabilities can empower teams to do their best work.”

 “We are thrilled to have ProtoSpace Mfg as a sponsor and partner for IREC 2025,” said ESRA President Steve Taylor. “ESRA’s mission is to help students develop hands-on engineering problem-solving skills through the challenge and spectacle of rocketry. This year, the event has grown to include more students and higher altitudes than ever before. To succeed, student teams must constantly respond to new information as they design, build, test, and receive feedback from ESRA safety reviewers. ProtoSpace Mfg helps teams iterate their designs and bring the best possible entry to their ultimate launch at IREC.”

 ProtoSpace Mfg’s own story reflects the growing potential of aerospace innovation beyond traditional hubs like California and Texas. The company’s recent expansion to Wilmington, North Carolina, highlights its commitment to broadening aerospace job opportunities and attracting diverse talent in new regions.

 The 2025 event will feature several key moments, including an opening ceremony on Tuesday, June 10, where local leaders, lead sponsor ProtoSpace Mfg, the AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics), and other dignitaries will welcome students and kick off three days of launches at the Midland International Air and Space Port site.

 Teams will compete under tight timelines, with rigorous judging and safety inspections, technical podium presentations, and rocket launches running from Wednesday through Saturday, June 11–14. Throughout the event, social media channels will deliver live updates, student interviews, and highlights from the competition floor. The event stream can be viewed live on the ESRA YouTube channel or in person at the Blakemore Planetarium at the Museum of the Southwest in Midland, Texas.

 ProtoSpace Mfg’s sponsorship provides teams access to custom-manufactured rocket components and enclosures, helping them achieve the speed and precision required to bring complex designs to life. This partnership underscores ProtoSpace Mfg’s long-standing support for hands-on engineering education and its mission to eliminate latencies in innovation.
