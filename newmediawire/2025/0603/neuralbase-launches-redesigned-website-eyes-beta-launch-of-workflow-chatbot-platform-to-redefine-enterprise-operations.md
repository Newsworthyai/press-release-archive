# Neuralbase Launches Redesigned Website, Eyes Beta Launch of Workflow Chatbot Platform to Redefine Enterprise Operations

LAS VEGAS, NV - June 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NEURALBASE AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI, is pleased to announce the upcoming beta launch of its newly enhanced and rebranded workflow and business chatbot platform. The solution has now been significantly repositioned under the BMP AI identity to reflect its expanded enterprise capabilities and strategic vision.

 Simultaneously, the Company has also launched a redesigned website, www.neuralbase.ai, providing an inside look at BMP AI’s proprietary technology, interactive prototypes, and development roadmap.

 Built for Business. Designed for Workflows. Beyond ChatGPT.

 Unlike general-purpose AI platforms such as ChatGPT, BMP AI is engineered specifically for secure, internal enterprise environments. Its bots function not just as virtual assistants but as intelligent task engines, automating cross-functional workflows and supporting contextual decision-making.

 “We’re not just building chatbots. We’re building intelligent workflow companions that eliminate silos, automate daily tasks, and enhance decision-making,” said Vighnesh Dobale, Chairman of NEURALBASE AI. “As organizations strive for speed, compliance, and operational precision, BMP AI is designed to become a foundational layer of enterprise productivity,” added Dobale, who also serves as CEO.

 What Sets BMP AI Apart

 * Workflow-Centric Architecture: BMP AI bots are built around business-critical processes such as HR onboarding, CRM automation, helpdesk operations, and inventory control.
* Persistent Context Awareness: Bots retain structured, multi-step task context - ensuring continuity, reducing rework, and improving accuracy.
* Plug-and-Play Integrations: Native compatibility with platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, and SAP enables rapid deployment.
* Vertical-Specific Intelligence: Pre-trained for industries including healthcare, education, logistics, and financial services - where regulatory and contextual precision are essential.

 Explore NeuralBase.ai

 The redesigned www.neuralbase.ai serves as the official gateway to NEURALBASE AI’s technology and vision. While not overly stylized, the site delivers clear, structured information on the BMP AI platform. Visitors can review feature summaries, company updates, and a high-level look at ongoing development.

 “Our website isn’t about flash - it’s about clarity,” said Dobale. “It’s a transparent window into how we’re building practical, secure AI systems for real enterprise problems. As our product evolves, so will the site - with more demos, documentation, and insights to come.”
