# Frequency Holdings YCRM Announces Addition of David Meltzer to Board of Directors, Joining Kevin Harrington to Accelerate Growth and Uplisting Strategy

With media reach, market insight, and founder-focused conviction, Meltzer strengthens Frequency’s mission to build lasting value across cybersecurity, identity, and AI

 CHICAGO, IL - June 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Frequency Holdings Inc., formerly Yuengling’s Ice Cream Corp. and ReachOut Technology (OTC: YCRM), is proud to announce the appointment of David Meltzer to its Board of Directors. Meltzer joins existing board member Kevin Harrington, original “Shark” from ABC’s Shark Tank, to support the company’s strategic vision, national expansion, and trajectory toward a future uplisting.

 Meltzer is the Chairman of the Napoleon Hill Institute and formerly served as CEO of Leigh Steinberg Sports & Entertainment, the inspiration for Jerry Maguire. Meltzer is a globally recognized entrepreneur, speaker, and media personality with deep experience in scaling brands, growing equity value, and aligning businesses with bold, impact-driven visions. Meltzer has been featured on numerous platforms including Forbes and Bloomberg, and produces Entrepreneur’s #1 business podcast The Playbook, which Rick Jordan has been a guest. Meltzer is widely known for his philanthropic work and business leadership, and brings extensive experience in technology, branding, and capital strategy.

 “David brings wisdom, reach, and conviction to this board,” said Rick Jordan, CEO of Frequency Holdings and ReachOut. “This isn’t just about high-profile names, this is about building a board that drives strategy and signal. With David and Kevin, we have two of the most visible, trusted business builders in America aligned with what we’re creating. That should send a strong signal to every investor watching.”

 The appointment marks a critical moment in Frequency’s evolution. As the Company finalizes its transition into a holding company structure modeled after Berkshire Hathaway and Alphabet, it is assembling a board with media fluency, public company expertise, and long-term investor vision. Its flagship subsidiary, ReachOut, continues its cybersecurity-first roll-up strategy targeting high-margin technology MSPs in high-demand/low-competition U.S. markets. The Company is also launching new ventures, including TRUSTLESS, a decentralized identity and data security platform in which Frequency will maintain a significant equity stake.

 “Rick Jordan is one of the clearest communicators and resilient leaders I’ve seen,” said David Meltzer. “He leads with intent. He listens. And he’s building something that transcends industry. I’m honored to help shape that vision.”

 The Company recently filed its name change to Frequency Holdings, Inc. with the State of Nevada and is awaiting FINRA approval for its ticker and symbol change. This move reflects a sharpened focus on becoming a multi-brand technology holding company, one that balances strategic M&A, operational efficiency, and visionary leadership.

 “The board I am assembling isn’t just governance, it’s guidance,” added Jordan. “I value mentorship and we’re creating value across every layer--shareholder value, strategic clarity, and public trust. The addition of David in joining Kevin and Kingsley on the board send a clear message--Frequency is here to lead.”
