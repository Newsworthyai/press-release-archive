# Neutra Corp Reports Breakthrough First Quarter Following Launch of Its New Clinical Research Network

HOUSTON, TX - June 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Neutra Life Sciences, a newly launched Site Management Organization (SMO) and wholly owned subsidiary of Neutra Corp (OTC: NTRR), is proud to announce a strong and promising start to operations in Q1 2025. Founded on the success of a pilot program personally funded by its CEO in 2024, the company has already achieved positive operational cash flow in under six months, signaling a strong market position and operational efficiency from the outset.

 With a mission to become the leading SMO in the clinical research industry, Neutra Life Sciences is focused on building a robust, multi-specialty site network that accelerates the delivery of high-quality clinical trials. Since officially launching, the company has grown from a single pilot site to a network of four clinical research sites - each with active research capabilities to support Phase Ib through Phase IV Trials in the following specialties:

 * Pediatrics
* Pediatric Pulmonology
* Family Medicine
* Urgent Care
* Optometry

 This specialty mix positions Neutra Life Sciences as a rapidly expanding, innovation-driven SMO capable of supporting complex, late-phase trials across key therapeutic areas.

 Earlier this year, Neutra closed Joint Venture partnerships with several clinical sites, expanding the company’s infrastructure to conduct Phase 1b through Phase 4 research. These partnerships represent a key part of Neutra's strategy: to grow organically while forming strategic alliances that add long-term value and increase trial capacity.

 “In a highly competitive and often fragmented SMO landscape, we're proving that intentional growth and diversified specialties can drive meaningful change for sponsors, CROs, and most importantly, patients,” said Sydney Jim, CEO of Neutra Corp. “This allows us to be able to build and scale without sacrificing quality, site performance, or patient care.”

 The company’s trajectory is especially noteworthy when compared to industry benchmarks. In 2023, a 17-site SMO founded in 2017 was acquired for nearly $300 million, with only three active specialties. In contrast, Neutra has established a dynamic, specialty-rich network in under a year and is actively advancing its growth strategy.

 Neutra Life Sciences is continuing to expand with multiple additional sites and medical specialties already in development. Each new site will be developed through intentional, organic growth - an approach that may take time, but is expected to prove far more profitable and sustainable in the long run. The company is expected to bring on two to three additional specialties within this quarter, further strengthening its ability to serve a broader range of clinical trials and indications.

 We are pleased to provide an update that we are in the due diligence phase of the potential strategic acquisition of Curaconnector.com, which could complement our current operations and enhance long-term shareholder value. While the outcome is not yet certain, we are evaluating the opportunity with a disciplined and strategic approach. Importantly, regardless of the acquisition’s outcome, our primary focus remains on the continued growth and development of Neutra Life Sciences, which we believe represents a significant driver of value and long-term performance. We remain committed to executing on our core strategy and will provide further updates as appropriate.
