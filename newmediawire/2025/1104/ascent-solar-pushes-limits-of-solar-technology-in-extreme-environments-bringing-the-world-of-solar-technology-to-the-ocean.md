# Ascent Solar Pushes Limits Of Solar Technology In Extreme Environments, Bringing The World Of Solar Technology To The Ocean

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - First, it was in space, and now, it's the world's oceans’ waves. When it comes to bringing solar energy to extreme environments, Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTI) seems to have a lock on it. The maker of featherweight, flexible and durable CIGS thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions just announced it delivered test samples to two customers to “push the limits of its solar technology in extreme environments.”

 Ascent Solar has come a long way since it first began making thin-film PVs. The company realized early on that its technology can withstand extreme environments and can be used for everything from space exploration to communications and monitoring in any environment. It is now showcasing that by putting its technology in the hands of two new potential customers.

 Range Of Customers Testing Its Solutions

 First up is an ocean monitoring technology company that develops autonomous underwater vehicles that can go anywhere in the ocean with a high degree of speed, endurance and sensing. The ocean monitoring company will test Ascent’s solar technology’s functionality and durability in aquatic terrestrial applications, with the intent of enabling persistent equipment operation of ocean-based monitoring technologies.

 The other customer makes cutting-edge power lasers for the space and defense industries. It will test Ascent’s PVs’ space-based power beaming receiving capabilities, as it seeks out technologies that enable the transmission of power between satellites in orbit. These are just the latest examples of how Ascent is expanding its presence in both markets.

 “We see underwater and space applications as unique opportunities for thin-film PV to thrive, as the technology’s lightweight, flexible and durable design allows it to withstand the immense pressures and tempestuous conditions that define these environments,” said Paul Warley, CEO of Ascent Solar Technologies. “Our team looks forward to reviewing the findings from each of these tests, as we aim to unlock thin-film solar technology’s potential in both markets.”

 Demand For Alternatives Growing

 What makes Ascent Solar’s PV technology suitable for extreme environments is that its products are light, flexible, bendable and perform well in low-light conditions, as well as extreme temperatures. They are also durable and long-lasting, and cheaper to make than existing solutions. What Ascent Solar says gives it an edge over its competitors is its ability to deliver solar arrays in six to eight weeks, much faster than its rivals, which Ascent says have lead times of nine to 12 months. Ascent’s CIGS PV products are based on years of R&D and are manufactured in its Thornton, Colorado, 5MW production facility.

 Because they can withstand extreme environments, they are being considered for use in underwater and space applications, which are expected to see growth in the coming years.

 Take the marine environment solar market for starters. It's forecast to grow from $1.2 billion today to $3.5 billion by 2033. Meanwhile, the space industry is a $6.8 billion opportunity for Ascent by 2040. Driving that growth is the need to shift to more environmentally-friendly ways to power the vessels and equipment necessary to explore the solar system and the oceans. It's also being driven by new regulations, a push by countries to reduce carbon footprints and advances in solar panel efficiencies and technologies that make them a more viable option for all sorts of industries. Not to mention, solar has proven reliable and cost-effective.

 Inking Deals

 Just ask the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center – with support from NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) - which teamed up with Ascent to develop a space-based power system that can receive beamed power using Ascent Solar’s CIGS PV modules. It’s part of NASA’s mission to develop the ability to do more in space at a fraction of the cost.

 Ascent also inked a deal this summer with NOVI Space Inc., a space company that makes and operates AI-powered satellites. Under the terms of that deal, Ascent is providing NOVI with rollable PV array blankets so that the company can deliver real-time Earth Observation insights directly from space. Ascent wants to replicate those successes in the maritime and defense industries, and these two test deliveries mark a key milestone toward that goal.

 From outer space to the Pacific Ocean, solar power is playing a role in exploration and communications thanks to Ascent Solar. Among the leaders in thin-film PVs, the company is pushing the limits on what solar can deliver in extreme environments and is one to watch.
