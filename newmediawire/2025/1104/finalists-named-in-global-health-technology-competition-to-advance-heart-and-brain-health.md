# Finalists Named in Global Health Technology Competition to Advance Heart and Brain Health

DALLAS - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Health care innovation often outpaces adoption - especially for people with heart disease and stroke, the world’s leading causes of death. To help bridge this gap, the American Heart Association®, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, has named five finalists in its 8th annual Health Tech Competition, hosted by the Center for Health Technology & Innovation.

 The competition offers a live forum for health care technology companies to present innovations designed to prevent or treat cardiovascular conditions, including high blood pressure, stroke, heart failure and related conditions.

 This year’s five selected finalists will present their solutions in the Health Innovation Pavilion during Scientific Sessions 2025 - the American Heart Association’s flagship global event for the latest research and clinical advancements in cardiovascular science. Finalists include:

 * Brainomix (in Oxford, England): Creating AI-powered software to improve stroke diagnosis and treatment decisions.
* Cambrian Health (San Francisco): Building an AI-powered platform that ensures clinical best practices are seamlessly executed at the point of care.
* Lumia (Boston): Delivering wearable solutions for people with orthostatic intolerance and chronic blood flow disorders.
* Noah Labs (Berlin): Transforming voice into a digital biomarker to enable earlier intervention for cardiometabolic diseases.
* PolyVascular (Houston, Texas): Developing minimally invasive solutions for children with congenital heart disease, aiming to reduce the need for repeated open-heart surgeries.

 Final presentations will be delivered live at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, Nov. 8–9, from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. CT.

 Finalists’ presentations will be evaluated based on:

 * Validity: How well is the working prototype or product functioning in the market with customers?
* Scientific Rigor: How well does validation research use evidence-based health research?
* Impact: To what extent does the product improve patient outcomes through innovative technology?

 A panel of expert volunteer judges will review business and science presentations from each company. Judges include:

 * Eric D. Peterson, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center
* Lee Shapiro, J.D., volunteer chairman of the board of the American Heart Association and co-founder and managing partner of 7WireVentures
* Lisa Suennen, managing partner at American Heart Association Ventures
* Ken Nelson, partner at the Med Tech Innovators Advantage Fund
* Craig Beam, president of Beam & Associates
* Tim Benner, chief strategy officer and chief marketing officer of Masimo
* Henry Peck, chief business officer of LSI
* Star Jones, lawyer/TV personality, Divorce Court, and American Heart Association national volunteer
* Lee H. Schwamm, M.D., FAHA, associate dean of digital strategy and transformation at Yale School of Medicine
* Joseph C. Wu, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, volunteer past president (2023-24) of the American Heart Association, professor and director at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and co-founder of Greenstone Biosciences
* Michael V. McConnell, M.D., MSEE, clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine
* Asif Ali, M.D., clinical associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston and director at Cena Research Institute
* Jessica Golbus, M.D., M.S., FAHA, assistant professor at the University of Michigan
* Ashoo Tandon, M.D., M.S., FAHA, FAAP, FACC, pediatric cardiologist, director of cardiovascular innovation and associate staff at Cleveland Clinic Children’s
* Dave Albert, M.D., founder of AliveCor
* Daniel Cantillon, M.D., chief medical officer of Masimo

 The winner will be announced live in New Orleans on Nov. 9 and will receive complimentary membership in the Center for Health Technology & Innovation Innovators’ Network, a consortium connecting entrepreneurs, providers, researchers and payers to advance cardiovascular and brain health innovation. Members collaborate with the Center and each other in different ways, including: building models for clinical outcome studies - which lowers the significant cost of developing those studies independently; helping connect the science to technology; and providing evidence that a digital platform improves health care outcomes - a key concern for providers and payers.

 Innovators’ Network members also have the opportunity to access the American Heart Association’s digital evidence-based scientific guidelines and clinical recommendations as they develop digital health care technologies.

 “The Center for Health Technology & Innovation aims to advance the rapid, efficient and effective development of health care technology,” said Robert A. Harrington, M.D., FAHA, volunteer past president of the American Heart Association (2019-2020), volunteer chair of the Association’s Health Tech Advisory Group for the Center and the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine and provost for medical affairs of Cornell University. “Joining the Innovators’ Network gives members the opportunity to leverage the consortium and work toward broadening and deepening their engagement in this arena.”
