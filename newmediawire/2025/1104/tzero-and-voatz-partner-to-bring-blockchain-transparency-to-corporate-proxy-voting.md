# tZERO and Voatz Partner to Bring Blockchain Transparency to Corporate Proxy Voting

A New Standard for Shareholder Participation - Secure, Verified, and Recorded On-Chain

 NEW YORK, NY and BOSTON, MA - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - tZERO Group, Inc., a leader in blockchain and tokenization for capital markets, and Voatz, a pioneer in secure mobile voting, today announced a strategic collaboration to deliver blockchain‑backed proxy voting.

 tZERO and its broker-dealer subsidiaries were among the first to bring private securities on-chain, establishing the leading broker-dealer-led infrastructure for the issuance, trading, and custody of tokenized securities in the US. As blockchain technology gains momentum across private and public markets, tZERO is aligning its regulated market infrastructure with Voatz’ identity‑verified voting platform to power a new era of transparent, secure, and efficient corporate governance.

 “Markets have gone digital - governance should follow,” said Alan Konevsky, CEO of tZERO. “tZERO is reaffirming its roots as a pioneer of blockchain innovation in public markets. By pairing our regulated market infrastructure with Voatz’s verified voting technology, we’re transforming shareholder engagement into a real-time, transparent and accountable process - delivering verifiable truth quickly and seamlessly - not trust through opaque and over-intermediated legacy processes. We look forward to partnering with a range of transfer agents and other market participants to deliver these solutions.”

 “Shareholders deserve a secure, convenient, and verifiable way to vote,” said Nimit Sawhney, Co-Founder and CEO of Voatz. “Our platform provides identity‑verified voting with a blockchain‑backed audit trail. Partnering with tZERO means those votes directly reflect issuer records and can be reported faster, with greater transparency.”

 The product vision includes plans for providing governance solutions for late-stage private companies, tokenized real‑world assets and DAOs and other distributed entities. tZERO also expects to offer this solution to its tokenized securities and RWA clients as part of its end-to-end solution set for private markets.

 This partnership advances tZERO’s long-term vision of uniting traditional market infrastructure with the efficiencies of digital finance. By integrating security, automation, and transparency, tZERO is reshaping how capital formation and ownership evolve in the Web3 economy.
