# Opawica Identifies 10,000m of 25 High Priority Drill Targets on Its Arrowhead Property in the Abitibi Gold Belt

VANCOUVER, BC - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Opawica Explorations Inc. (TSXV: OPW) (FSE: A2PEAD) (OTC: OPWEF) is thrilled to announce a major advancement in its exploration strategy at the Arrowhead Property, located in the heart of the Abitibi Gold Belt - one of the world’s most prolific gold-producing regions.

 In collaboration with ALS GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd., a global leader in artificial intelligence for mineral exploration, Opawica has identified 20 high-priority drill-ready zones using GoldSpot’s proprietary “Smart Targeting” technology. This cutting-edge AI method integrates millions of dollars’ worth of geological data across a high-resolution 5m x 5m x 5m grid, delivering unprecedented precision in mineral targeting.

 “We’re combining the power of AI with traditional geoscience to uncover what could be a transformative gold system,” said Blake Morgan, CEO of Opawica. “Our initial drill program hit gold in every hole. Now, with advanced data and a significantly expanded campaign, we’re ready to show the market the true scale of Arrowhead’s potential.”

 Highlights of the Upcoming Drill Program

 - Western Zone: 15 drill targets totalling 4,500 meters, focused on high-grade continuity with 100–300 meter spacing.

 - Eastern Zone: 3 drill holes (2,000 meters) testing a Z-shaped fold hinge zone linked to IP anomalies.

 Seismic-Based Targets: 2 deep holes (1,000 meters each) based on Echo-Geotech’s 2021 2D seismic survey.

 - Historic Follow-Up: 4 drill holes (1,500 meters) targeting high-grade historic values near hole 95-04, spaced 50–75 meters.

 Why Arrowhead Stands Out

 - Located adjacent to producing mines like Agnico Eagle’s LaRonde Complex.

 - Backed by advanced AI analysis and extensive exploration investment.

 - Proven gold hits in every hole of the initial drill program.

 - Positioned for a high-impact, data-driven expansion.
