# Golden Cariboo Resources Commences Autumn Drill Campaign at the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine Property

VANCOUVER, BC - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) (CSE:GCC) (OTC:GCCFF) (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ) announces the launch of its autumn surface drilling campaign at the Company’s flagship Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine Property (the “Property”), located approximately 4 kilometers northeast of Hixon, British Columbia. This phase of exploration builds on the success of earlier programs and aims to extend the gold bearing Halo and Main zones’ strike length from almost 600m (1969 feet) to 2km (1.24 miles) adjacent the black argillite-greenstone contact (News Release September 9, 2025).

 The Company is also proud to welcome two accomplished Professional Geoscientists (P.Geo) to its technical team: Cheryl Reid and Catherine Banfield, both bringing extensive field and analytical expertise to support the project. Cheryl Reid is an exploration geologist with 20 years of experience in mineral exploration across Canada. Her expertise at VMS and Archean greenstone belt hosted orogenic gold projects includes drill supervision, core logging, QA/QC, database management and field mapping. Catherine Banfield has 20 years experience in polymetallic mineral exploration and mining projects across Canada as well as internationally. Catherine brings valuable insight into structural interpretation and geological modeling.

 “We are thrilled to kick off our autumn drilling campaign and to welcome Cheryl and Catherine to our team,” said J. Frank Callaghan, President & CEO of Golden Cariboo Resources. “Their combined experience and technical acumen will be invaluable as we continue to expand the gold bearing zones and define new targets.”

 About Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd.

 Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. is rediscovering the Cariboo Gold Rush by proceeding with highly targeted drilling and trenching programs on its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property which is bordered by Osisko Development, partly intertwined with them at the north end of the Cariboo Gold Project, and located along a favourable corridor adjacent to the Spanish and Eureka thrust faults over a 94,899 hectare (234,501 acre) area. Historically, over 101 placer gold creeks on the 90-kilometer (56 mile) trend, from the Cariboo Hudson mine north to the Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property, have recorded production with successful placer mining continuing to this day.

 Golden Cariboo’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of, and road accessible from, Hixon in central British Columbia. The Property includes the Quesnelle Quartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 and developed over a footprint of about 150m x 150m (< 6 acres) at the Main zone straddling Hixon Creek. Overall, the geological setting of the gold mineralization at the Company’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property shows strong similarities with the Spanish Mountain gold deposit, situated 120 km (75 miles) towards the southeast along the same geological trend. As a sediment-hosted vein (SHV) deposit, the Spanish Mountain deposit is considered to belong to the epizonal orogenic subclass of gold deposits which include some of the world’s largest deposits such as Muruntau, Uzbekistan and Bendigo, Australia.
