# BioFlight Fuels Awarded INSAT Funding for SAF Flight School Project Advancing Low-Carbon Aviation

BARRIE, ONTARIO - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - BioFlight Fuels Inc. (“BioFlight”), a Canadian biofuels company focused on producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from renewable natural gas (RNG), has received funding support from the Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technologies (INSAT) for its SAF Flight School project. This project will help unlock new feedstock sources, support commercialization, and contribute directly to Canada’s net-zero aviation targets by turning waste into opportunity, transforming municipal biogas into clean, renewable fuel for the aviation sector.

 Working with Bright Spot Climate and Ivys Adsorption, BioFlight will assess and verify the lifecycle performance of SAF produced via its Fischer–Tropsch (FT) conversion pathway and develop a supply chain framework ensuring transparency and sustainability from feedstock to fuel.

 “This project marks an important milestone in BioFlight’s mission to decarbonize aviation,” said Keith Strachan, CEO of BioFlight. “By validating the pathway of producing SAF from renewable biogas and RNG, we are building the foundation for large-scale, commercial SAF production in Canada. This funding allows us to accelerate the development of our SAF production capabilities, expand our partnerships, and move closer to the day when every Canadian flight can be powered by clean fuel.”

 INSAT’s third wave of funding, delivered by Strix, supports Canadian innovators accelerating the transition to low-emission aviation technologies. The initiative recognizes SAF as the most immediate and scalable pathway to achieving net-zero aviation by 2050.

 “As Canada works to reduce emissions in aviation, the development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuels will be essential,” said Michel Dion, CEO of Strix. “Initiatives like BioFlight’s SAF Flight School contribute to building the domestic expertise and infrastructure we need to support this transition.”

 The SAF Flight School project directly supports Canada’s net-zero commitments by advancing renewable energy innovation and creating new economic opportunities across the clean fuels and aerospace sectors. Upon completion, BioFlight’s technology is expected to achieve meaningful GHG emission reductions compared to conventional jet fuel.

 BioFlight’s first commercial SAF facility - Terminal 1 in Sarnia, Ontario - is now under development. The plant will convert renewable natural gas (RNG) from municipal and agricultural sources into certified drop-in aviation fuel. Terminal 1 is expected to produce over 15 million kilograms of Neat-SAF annually, as well as other by-products like renewable Naphtha.
