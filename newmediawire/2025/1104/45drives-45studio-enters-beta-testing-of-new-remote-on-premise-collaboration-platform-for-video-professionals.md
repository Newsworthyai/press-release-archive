# 45Drives' 45Studio Enters Beta Testing of New Remote On-Premise Collaboration Platform for Video Professionals

SYDNEY, NOVA SCOTIA and WILMINGTON, NC - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Open-source storage leader 45Drives today announced the beta launch of a remote collaboration platform using on-premise storage for video professionals, developed by its creative technology division, 45Studio.

 Currently in active beta testing, this new platform, a powerful, self-hosted alternative to Frame.io and other cloud-based collaboration tools, is designed to give post-production teams a faster, more secure, and more cost-effective way to work together on video projects.

 Through this beta, 45Drives is inviting professional editors, colorists, and production teams to test the platform in real-world workflows and provide feedback that will directly guide product development.

 “This beta represents exactly how we build at 45Drives,” said Dr. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives. “We believe the best tools come from working hand-in-hand with the professionals who rely on them every day. By opening this platform to creative pros early, we’re ensuring it evolves into something truly built for them, not just for the market.”

 Solving Real Problems with a Non-Proprietary Approach

 Modern production teams face significant pain points with proprietary cloud collaboration platforms:

 * Cloud dependency: Cloud-only tools often introduce latency, long upload times, and bandwidth challenges.
* Security risks from 3rd party exposure: Cloud tools put your mission-critical creative content in the hands of third parties beyond your control.
* Cost scalability: Pricing tends to scale steeply with storage, usage, and sharing activity.
* Pay-per-share limitations: Inviting clients or collaborators can require costly higher-tier plans or paid seats.

 This yet-to-be-named platform, built by 45Studio, takes a fundamentally different approach. With it being on-premise, it lets teams collaborate directly over their own infrastructure, delivering the same seamless review and approval experience professionals expect, but without the delays, ongoing fees, or data control tradeoffs.

 Collaboration with Industry Experts

 45Drives and 45Studio are partnering with Nicholas Wiczynski, Founder of NGW Post, an award-winning boutique post production company, specializing in offline editing, re-recording mixing, color grading, and network delivery. Nicholas is working directly with the 45Studio team to ensure the platform fits the real-world workflows of professional editors and post facilities.

 “What’s exciting about this project is how much 45Drives values feedback from people in the trenches,” said Nicholas Wiczynski of NGW Post. “In post-production, we live and die by speed, collaboration, and reliability. This platform is shaping up to solve real pain points that every professional editor knows too well.”

 Building Together, The 45Drives Way

 The launch of this beta exemplifies 45Drives’ open, community-driven philosophy. Whether in enterprise storage, homelabs, or now media production workflows, 45Drives consistently works side by side with its users to refine and advance technology through collaboration and transparency.
