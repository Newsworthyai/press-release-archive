# SuperCloud International Opens Pre-Orders for the Liberty Stealth Phone, the World's Most Private Smartphone

Breakthrough Device Built in the USA Offers Military-Grade Privacy Protection and Complete Digital Independence

 FORT LAUDERDALE, FL - November 4, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - SuperCloud International, Inc., a leading multimedia and technology company advancing privacy-first communication and entertainment platforms, today announced that pre-orders are now open for its Liberty Stealth Phone, the world’s most private smartphone built entirely in the United States.

 The Liberty Stealth marks a major milestone in SuperCloud International’s broader vision to deliver secure, American-made hardware and software that puts users back in control of their data. With hardware-level kill switches, a fully open-source Linux-based operating system, and zero Big Tech tracking, Liberty Stealth represents a revolutionary new chapter in mobile privacy for consumers. The phones are an evolution of a previous product line which has been used by top government agencies for their added security and privacy.

 Built on a private PureOS architecture, Liberty Stealth is designed to eliminate all forms of digital surveillance, advertising trackers, and hidden data collection mechanisms. The device features physical switches that allow users to completely disconnect Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, camera, and microphone at the circuit level, ensuring total privacy even when the phone is powered on.

 “This isn’t just a smartphone, it's the beginning of a new era in device security,” said James Devericks, Chairman and CEO of SuperCloud International, Inc. “For years, Big Tech has profited from surveillance disguised as convenience. The Liberty Stealth gives power back to the people by offering true ownership, transparency, and digital freedom. Privacy is not a privilege, it’s a right.”

 In addition to its hardware-based privacy controls, Liberty Stealth features a user-replaceable 4,500mAh battery, m.2 modem slot for future 5G upgrades, and built-in OpenPGP encryption for secure communications. Each phone is fully auditable and free from Google or Apple services, ensuring that no data is mined, shared, or stored without user consent.

 Key Features Include:

 * PureOS (Linux-based) - 100% open-source, auditable, and free from Google/Apple tracking
* Hardware Kill Switches - Physical disconnection for all radios and sensors
* End-to-End Encryption - Smart card support for secure communication
* User-Replaceable Battery - No planned obsolescence
* Upgradeable Modem - Future-proof design with 5G compatibility
* Made in the USA - Built with trusted domestic partners for national security and data integrity

 Early adopters can secure their Liberty Stealth Phone today with a $199 refundable deposit, guaranteeing priority shipping when deliveries begin in late 2025. The first 10,000 pre-orders will receive three months of UMAXX.TV, SuperCloud’s encrypted live-TV streaming service, free of charge.

 The Liberty Stealth Phone is designed for individuals, professionals, and organizations seeking total control over their digital privacy, without compromising performance, usability, or connectivity.

 “Every call, every text, every app today carries a hidden cost: your data,” added Devericks. “Liberty Stealth was engineered from the ground up to eliminate that cost. It’s time to take back your freedom.”
