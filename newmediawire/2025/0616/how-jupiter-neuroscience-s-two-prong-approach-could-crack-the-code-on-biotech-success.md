# How Jupiter Neuroscience's Two-Prong Approach Could Crack The Code On Biotech Success

By Meg Flippin Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - June 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - While being a biotech company can be difficult, it is not impossible. Just look at Jupiter Neurosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNS), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, for evidence. The company, which is developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation, with a current focus on central nervous system or CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and rare diseases, is taking a two-prong approach. That enables it to help people long-term and generate recurring revenue in the short-term.

 Being a biotech company isn’t easy these days. Tariffs and drug pricing reform are threatening to stifle innovation in the U.S, analysts argue. Then there’s the prospect of what Goldman Sachs calls “one-shot cures,” in which a biotech company focused on gene therapy is successful, but struggles to create a recurring revenue stream.

 Unlike some of its peers, Jupiter Neurosciences has both a clinical arm in which it is developing drugs to treat CNS disorders and rare diseases, and a direct-to-consumer arm that the company says drives revenue and cash flow. This helps to reduce its dependency on the slower clinical process where it can take years for a drug to go from the developmental stage to the market.

 Leveraging JOTROL

 At the heart of this strategy is Jupiter Neurosciences’ flagship platform product JOTROL™, which is an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. Resveratrol is a naturally-occurring compound found in plants that is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It comes from grapes, berries, peanuts and red wine, and can aid in protecting cells from damage. It has also been found to relieve anxious behavior by correcting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation

 Resveratrol also activates PARP-1, an important protein in DNA repair and stress response, improves cardiovascular health, enhances cognitive function, is antibacterial and antiviral against food-borne pathogens and can reduce inflammation, preventing the growth of tumors, reports Jupiter Neurosciences. JOTROL enhances these benefits and is, the company says, a first-in-class oral therapeutic that reaches effective levels in the brain and increases energy metabolism, induces mitochondrial biogenesis and reduces inflammation.

 A phase 1 trial of JOTROL determined the drug was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels administered and demonstrated blood plasma levels eight to 10-fold higher than naïve resveratrol administered in historical clinical trials, meeting performance objectives, reported the company. The phase II trial is focused on treating Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and a broad spectrum of CNS and rare diseases. JOTROL has patents in the USA, Europe, China, Hong Kong and Japan and is protected through 2036.

 While Jupiter Neurosciences Waits

 Treating neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s is a big opportunity for Jupiter Neurosciences. In 2024, the market size was $54.22 billion and it is projected to increase to $85.4 billion by 2032. But in the meantime, Jupiter Neurosciences has its direct-to-consumer arm of its business to shore up revenue and cash flow. That’s a big business too since it's focused on longevity. According to the company the longevity industry is projected to hit $8 trillion by 2030.

 Earlier in June, the company announced the official launch of Nugevia™, its consumer longevity product line aimed at generating near-term revenue while maintaining momentum in its clinical pipeline. Nugevia's first three formulations target mitochondrial support, mental clarity, and "beauty from within" and will be sold via a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model starting in the third quarter.

 Each product integrates JOTROL. The company says what sets it apart from single-ingredient supplements is that Nugevia features precision-engineered "intelligent stacking" of synergistic compounds designed to enhance cellular resilience, support blood-brain barrier delivery and promote system-wide optimization.

 "The launch of Nugevia is the natural next step in translating our science into broad, real-world impact," said Christer Rosén, chairperson and CEO of Jupiter Neurosciences. "By building on the same proprietary technology platform that underpins our prescription drug development, we're delivering a differentiated consumer offering with unmatched bioavailability and scientific credibility."

 Jupiter Neurosciences said the launch of Nugevia is expected to provide what it calls a “self-reinforcing commercial engine” in which revenue from Nugevia supports its ongoing clinical trials.

 Biotech is tough, unless you are Jupiter Neurosciences. With a two-prong approach to drug development, it is hoping to ensure it will be around regardless of what's going on in the world.
