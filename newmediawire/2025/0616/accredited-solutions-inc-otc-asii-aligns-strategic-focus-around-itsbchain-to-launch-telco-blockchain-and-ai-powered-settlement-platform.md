# Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) Aligns Strategic Focus Around ItsBchain to Launch Telco Blockchain and AI-Powered Settlement Platform

NEW YORK, NY - June 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) ("Accredited Solutions" or the "Company") today announced a strategic shift in its operational focus, centering its business model around the upcoming acquisition of ItsBchain, a blockchain subsidiary with deep expertise in telecommunications infrastructure and settlement automation. This move is part of the Company's mission to lead in the next generation of blockchain-based telecom and fintech solutions.

 ASII is proud to confirm it is finalizing the acquisition of ItsBchain, as previously disclosed via a signed MOU. The acquisition is expected to close in the coming week. ItsBchain’s proven leadership and forward-thinking approach have inspired a strategic partnership built on shared vision and execution discipline. ASII is excited to channel its resources into unlocking the potential of ItsBchain’s most advanced platform - one that unites blockchain, telecom, and AI to create an innovative system for carrier settlement and interconnect transaction processing.

 “Our decision to realign our strategic priorities is entirely driven by opportunity - an extraordinary one presented by our partnership with ItsBchain,” said Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions, Inc. “They’ve developed multiple projects we admire, but one in particular stands out as a game-changer. We are preparing to officially launch this initiative in the coming days, and we believe it has the power to transform telecom and fintech settlements as we know them.”

 The upcoming project will deliver blockchain-based infrastructure and AI-powered intelligence for voice, SMS, and data traffic settlements. It is designed to reduce fraud, optimize settlement times, and increase trust between telecom carriers globally.

 ItsBchain is led by a world-class team that includes former CEOs of major Latin American telecommunications companies, alongside IT and financial professionals with more than 25 years of industry experience. The strength and credibility of this leadership team further reinforce ASII’s belief that this partnership is the most strategically compelling opportunity in the Company’s history.

 A Strategy Grounded in Forward Momentum

 This realignment does not come from improvisation, but from a strategic reassessment of the most accretive and scalable opportunities currently in ASII’s pipeline. The partnership with ItsBchain, backed by its exceptional management team, offers ASII a growth roadmap that is not only exciting but also operationally efficient and highly aligned with global technology trends.

 Corporate Update on Globetopper

 As part of this strategic refocus, ASII will be rescinding its Stock Purchase Agreement with Globetopper effective June 30, 2025. While the Globetopper acquisition offered initial access to the digital gift card market, shareholder response and market behavior made it clear that the structure would have created excessive dilution on ASII - over 300% of ASII’s current market capitalization to honor this acquisition. Though the e-gift card industry remains promising, it is highly fragmented and increasingly competitive. In contrast, the opportunity with ItsBchain positions ASII to become a true market leader in a high-demand, innovation-driven sector. This is not a “me too” entry - it is a move into the epicenter of a transformative global market.

 Audit and Reporting Update

 The Globetopper transaction introduced unexpected complexities to ASII’s audit process. However, those challenges have been largely resolved, and the Company is now in the final stages of completing its financial audit. ASII expects to file its updated financials and regain current status in the coming weeks.
