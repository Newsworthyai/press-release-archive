# A Family-Friendly Pit Stop Before Takeoff

GLENDALE, CA - October 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Burbank airport (officially Hollywood Burbank Airport, BUR) is known for being easy to get in and out of, which is a huge plus compared to the hustle of LAX. But let's be honest: once you've checked in, the waiting game begins, and the terminal can be a little short on entertainment. Instead of battling over the last uncomfortable chair, why not turn your travel day into an adventure with a quick, unique stop that will get the whole family moving?

 Enter the Martial Arts History Museum!

 Just a quick hop from the airport, you'll find the Martial Arts History Museum - the only museum of its kind in the world! Designed by former Disney artist and museum founder Michael Matsuda, this facility is a vibrant tapestry weaving together Asian art, history, culture, and tradition with the fascinating story of American martial arts. It's a place where you can actually walk your luggage in, set it aside in a safe corner, and enjoy a couple of hours of engaging, educational fun.

 This isn't just a museum for martial arts fanatics; it's a journey through culture that appeals to all ages! Your family can explore Pop Culture Connections by seeing actual props from some of the most famous martial arts movies, and youâ€™ll also learn about the history and origins of Anime.

 The exhibits go beyond Asia, too, covering Cultural Diversity with sections on Warrior Women, Native American, African art, and even Hispanic Lucha history, offering a fantastic, diverse learning experience. It's an Interactive Learning experience designed to take about 1 to 1 hours to wind through, offering unique videos, fascinating displays like the interesting Chinese lions, Samurai and even cool documentaries on martial arts film and television. You can also read the names from the official Martial Arts Hall of Fame.

 As a Time Saver, it's the perfect way to burn a couple of pre-flight hours without the stress of LAX traffic. For your convenience, the museum's parking is just around the corner on Orange Avenue, and you get the first 90 minutes free.

 So, why sit on a hard, very uncomfortable seat at the terminal when you can enjoy a great, stimulating couple of hours at an exciting place that's also a terrific bargain? Maybe even take home a cool museum cap as a souvenir!

 The Martial Arts History Museum is located at 201 N. Brand Blvd., B100, Glendale, CA 91203. MAmuseum.com or call (818) 245-6051.
