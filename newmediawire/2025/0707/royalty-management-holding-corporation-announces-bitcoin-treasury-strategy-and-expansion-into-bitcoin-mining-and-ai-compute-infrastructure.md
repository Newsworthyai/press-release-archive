# Royalty Management Holding Corporation Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Expansion Into Bitcoin Mining and AI Compute Infrastructure

The Company is creating a formal Bitcoin Treasury Management policy to regularly allocate excess cash into Bitcoin and other digital assets as a long-term reserve asset and strategic store of value.

 Separately, Royalty Management’s investment into property that can host Bitcoin and high-power compute for AI data centers moves forward.

 The Company has access to over $50 million in registered securities that can be deployed, at the appropriate Company valuation, to expand its balance sheet holdings in Bitcoin.

 FISHERS, INDIANA - July 7, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward-leaning royalty and asset development company, today announced the initiation of a formal Bitcoin Treasury Management Strategy as part of its long-term capital preservation and growth plan. This decision reflects the Company’s conviction in Bitcoin as a superior long-term store of value and a strategic reserve asset in an increasingly uncertain monetary environment. The Company views Bitcoin as both a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, and a high-conviction investment aligned with sound monetary principles. In parallel with its treasury strategy, Royalty Management is also advancing a platform to develop and lease infrastructure for Bitcoin mining and high-performance compute (HPC) data centers, recognizing the long-term tailwinds behind the convergence of decentralized finance and AI workloads.

 “This initiative reflects our belief that Bitcoin is a foundational digital asset with enduring value, said Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Management. “As we generate cash from our operating activities and access to registered capital, we are positioning Royalty Management to be structurally aligned with the future of value, and we intend to create a sustainable program for treasury diversification anchored in Bitcoin.”

 Strategic Highlights:

 * Bitcoin Treasury Program: The Company has begun internal policy development to enable regular, systematic allocation of excess cash and reserves into Bitcoin, with flexibility to hold stablecoins for operational purposes. Treasury purchases will be opportunistic, long-term oriented, and based on market and business conditions.
* Infrastructure for Bitcoin Mining + AI Compute: Royalty Management has control over land and infrastructure in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana suitable for Bitcoin mining and high-power data center deployment. The Company is working with a nationally recognized industrial site consultant to finalize competitive power pricing and initiate marketing of its first package to national operators.
* Innovative Royalty Structures: In addition to fiat lease payments, Royalty Management plans to structure royalty and lease agreements with an option to receive partial compensation in Bitcoin - tying cash flow to the performance of on-site mined BTC and aligning long-term incentives with network growth.
* Capital Access: RMCO has access to over $50 million in registered securities and other investment mechanisms, enabling it to expand its balance sheet holdings in Bitcoin and other assets at an opportune valuation.

 Furthermore, as a result of months of efforts, the Company is also pleased to announce that it has engaged a nationally recognized industrial site development consultant to help Royalty Management complete its Bitcoin mining and datacenter leasing program. The Company has control over an attractive leasing package of property and expandable electrical infrastructure located in eastern Kentucky, and securing competitive electrical usage rates was the final part of that package needed to go to market. With the engagement of this firm, the Company can move forward to secure the electric rates and work with them to market this package to national operators. Royalty Management has other sites identified that are under ownership or control to expand beyond this initial site to duplicate this leasing model and expand the Company’s presence in the Bitcoin and datacenter marketplace.

 Thomas Sauve commented, “We also have made a substantial leap forward on our eastern Kentucky Bitcoin mining and datacenter leasing site by engaging with a firm that can assist us on securing attractive power rates, the last component we needed to put in place in order to go to market to operating companies for build-out of this site. This firm can also assist us in marketing our package to their extensive network of interested parties. Once buildout of this initial site is underway, we currently have a half dozen of other sites throughout eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and Indiana at various stages of development that can be turned into profitable Bitcoin mining, digital asset, and AI datacenter leasing sites. We look forward to a long and profitable partnership with this group.”

 Ben Kincaid, Royalty Management Board Director and recognized thought leader at the intersection of Bitcoin and geopolitics, stated "Bitcoin is a cornerstone of America’s economic renewal - driving industrial development, energy innovation, and financial resilience. By aligning our strategy with Bitcoin and the infrastructure behind it, Royalty Management is investing in the future of American strength, sovereignty, and competitiveness."

 Once finalized, Royalty Management would also work to receive some of the leasing consideration from these sites to be paid in the form of Bitcoin generated at that site, in addition to the cash payments to the Company.

 Royalty Management plans to continue to leverage its current real asset portfolio, infrastructure access, and innovative royalty structures to build a durable presence at the intersection of Bitcoin, digital assets, and high-performance compute. Implementation of the Bitcoin treasury program remains subject to final Board approval and ongoing market conditions. Allocations may be adjusted or suspended at the Company’s discretion.

 The timing, value, and type of Bitcoin or other digital assets pursuant to this strategy, if any, will be determined by Company management and is based on board approval of the overall Bitcoin treasury program. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and other digital assets, and the other anticipated cash needs of the Company. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason at the discretion of Company management.
