# Join the Nation of Lifesavers at the 2025 MLB All-Star Game

(NewMediaWire) - July 07, 2025 - DALLAS — Most people who suffer cardiac arrest outside a hospital don’t survive—largely because they don’t receive CPR, according to the American Heart Association. This year Major League Baseball (MLB) and the American Heart Association aim to help change that. Baseball fans can learn how to save a life during the 2025 MLB All-Star Game. The American Heart Association will be offering walk up style Hands-Only CPR instruction at the Capital One All-Star Village taking place at the Cobb Galleria in Atlanta. Qualified CPR trainers will be onsite offering instruction to fans while the experience is open to the public Saturday, July 12 through Tuesday, July 15.

 MLB and the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, want more people to be confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency, adding more people to the Association’s Nation of Lifesavers™ movement, which intends to double survival rates by 2030. Participants will learn the correct rate and depth of CPR compressions. According to the American Heart Association, compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill most everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest. Increasing the number of people prepared to administer CPR improves the likelihood of a positive outcome.

 "By offering Hands-Only CPR instruction at the All-Star Village, Major League Baseball is joining the Nation of Lifesavers and helping the American Heart Association to educate legions of baseball fans in the lifesaving skill of CPR,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “Each year, hundreds of thousands of cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals, and immediate CPR can double or even triple a person’s chance of survival. That’s why we are committed to ensuring more people are trained, confident, and ready to act as a lifesaver in a cardiac emergency."

 The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR. According to American Heart Association data, 9 out of every 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival.

 “We are thankful that the American Heart Association will be on-site at the 2025 MLB All-Star Game and are excited for the number of fans who will be instructed on Hands-Only CPR at the All-Star Village. As a proud member of the Smart Heart Sports Coalition and supporter of the American Heart Association’s National of Lifesavers movement, MLB is honored to provide a platform for the Association to turn more bystanders into lifesavers and prepare more of our fans to be trained on lifesaving skills when faced with a cardiac emergency,” said Jon Coyles, senior vice president of drug, health & safety programs at Major League Baseball.

 This marks the first appearance at an MLB event and the eighth appearance of the American Heart Association at a national sporting event. The American Heart Association has previously provided Hands-Only CPR and AED instruction where other professional leagues are convening fans. Appearances include Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, LVIII in Las Vegas, LVII in Phoenix, the 2023 NFL Draft in Kansas City, the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit, 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay and the 2024 NBA All-star in Indianapolis.

 The American Heart Association and MLB want all communities to better prepared to respond to a cardiac emergency where fans live, work and play. Learn how to save a life in just 90 seconds. Visit www.heart.org/nation to join the Nation of Lifesavers.
