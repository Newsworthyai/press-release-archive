# Metavesco Increases Bitcoin and Ethereum Exposure

CUMMING, GA - August 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO), a publicly traded diversified holding company, today announced it has increased its exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, reinforcing its commitment to building a high conviction digital asset strategy.

 The Company has acquired an additional 10 ETH at an average cost of $4,410 each and 1 BTC at a cost of $119,110, expanding its position in what it views as two of the most important digital assets in the world.

 “Bitcoin and Ethereum remain our highest conviction digital assets,” said Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco. “Bitcoin is our digital gold, a store of value and balance sheet anchor. Ethereum, meanwhile, is evolving into the future infrastructure of traditional finance as Wall Street embraces blockchain technology and seeks to tokenize securities. I believe these represent generational opportunities. When we see the right setups, we’re not afraid to lean in.”

 Metavesco’s Bitcoin treasury strategy is powered by its over 26 PH/s of hashing power with all-in cost as low as roughly $55,000 with the Company’s most efficient miners, more than a 50% discount to current market prices near $120,000. The Company’s Ethereum position was initiated earlier this year and has since been expanded to capture what it believes will be a multi-year institutional adoption wave.

 The Company’s broader treasury strategy is designed to:

 * Acquire high-conviction digital assets at favorable entry points
* Hold them as long-term balance sheet reserves
* Drive shareholder value and wealth creation

 “The combination of our operating businesses, capital markets access, and disciplined capital allocation gives us a unique advantage in the microcap space,” Schadel added. “We’re building a public company platform that can capture upside across multiple verticals, with digital assets playing a central role and creating a flywheel effect.”

 The newly added BTC and ETH positions are considered speculative (not part of the long term treasury at this time) and will be monitored closely. The position was created using long term decentralized futures contracts. The Company may exit the position if market dynamics dictate risk reduction.

 Metavesco expects to provide further treasury updates as market opportunities emerge.
