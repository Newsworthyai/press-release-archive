# Insurance Canopy Expands Liability Coverage for Educators and Coaches for Misconduct Claims

Affordable legal protection for workers facing high-risk allegations not covered by general or professional liability policies

 PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH - August 13, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Insurance Canopy is introducing a new misconduct liability insurance option (known as SAM/SML) to help educators, life coaches, tutors, and instructors protect themselves against wrongful allegations of sexual misconduct. The new coverage fills a growing need among teaching and mentoring professionals, since most general and professional liability policies exclude SAM claims.

 Designed for high-trust environments where miscommunication or misinterpretation can lead to costly legal action, SAM coverage helps pay for legal defense, attorney fees, and settlement costs in the event of a covered claim. Monthly premiums start at $10.33 for educators earning $50,000 or less annually.

 President and CEO Daryle Stafford stated, “At Insurance Canopy, our mission is to empower professionals by providing the protection they need against unforeseen risks. False allegations and baseless lawsuits can have a devastating impact on one’s career and financial well-being. With our misconduct (SAM) coverage, we aim to offer peace of mind, ensuring these professionals/our customers are supported and protected when they need it most.”

 Examples of potential claims include:

 * A student misinterpreting physical instruction from a music or art teacher
* A client viewing a supportive gesture from a coach as inappropriate
* Parents suing over online communication between a tutor and their child

 While not required by law, SAM coverage is strongly recommended for independent contractors, coaches, private instructors, and educational business owners. Without it, educators could face lawsuits and bankruptcy from even unproven allegations.

 Coverage excludes known prior incidents, uninsurable acts, and employment-related practices. Insurance Canopy encourages policyholders to review the exact terms and consult a legal professional when deciding what coverage is right for them.
