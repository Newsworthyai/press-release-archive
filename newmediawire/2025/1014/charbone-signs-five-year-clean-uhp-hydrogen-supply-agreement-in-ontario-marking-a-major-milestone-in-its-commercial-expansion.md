BROSSARD, QUEBEC - October 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - CHARBONE CORPORATION (TSXV: CH; OTCQB: CHHYF; FSE: K47) (“CHARBONE” or the “Company”), a North American producer and distributor specializing in clean Ultra High Purity (“UHP”) hydrogen and strategic industrial gases, announces a significant commercial milestone: the signing of a five-year hydrogen supply agreement with an Ontario-based independent distributor for regular deliveries of clean UHP hydrogen.

 Key Highlights:

 - Long-Term Contract - Five-year term with an Ontario distributor, providing a stable and recurring demand of CHARBONE’s clean UHP hydrogen.

 - Operational Readiness - CHARBONE’s transportation subsidiary achieved full regulatory and safety compliance within just eight months, meeting Canada’s strict hydrogen handling standards and ensuring a “Safety First” approach to distribution.

 - Strategic Expansion - This contract marks CHARBONE’s entry into the Ontario market, a rapidly growing region for clean UHP hydrogen. It reinforces the Company’s presence in Eastern Canada and positions CHARBONE for further growth in the clean energy sector.

 “This five-year contract demonstrates that CHARBONE can build a trusted, compliant, and secure hydrogen supply network, positioning us for further expansion,” said Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE. “Ontario is a strategic market for us, and this achievement underscores our long-term commitment to serve industrial and specialty gas distributors with the highest levels of quality and reliability.”
