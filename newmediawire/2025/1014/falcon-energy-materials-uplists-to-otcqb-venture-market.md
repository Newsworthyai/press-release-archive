# Falcon Energy Materials Uplists to OTCQB Venture Market

ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - October 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Falcon Energy Materials plc (TSX-V: FLCN) (“Falcon” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has been approved to uplist from the OTC Pink market to the OTCQB Venture Market (“OTCQB”), operated by OTC Markets Group Inc, effective today.

 The OTCQB, established in 2010, serves as the premier U.S. marketplace for early-stage and developing companies. It provides improved visibility and greater access to U.S. investors and is recognized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an “established public market.”

 Falcon’s shares will trade on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol “FLCNF” while continuing to trade on the Toronto TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol “FLCN”.

 Falcon believes this milestone will enhance liquidity, increase transparency, and broaden its exposure to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. capital markets.

 Matthieu Bos, Chief Executive Officer of Falcon, commented:

 "This uplisting marks an important step in our growth strategy. Trading on the OTCQB Venture Market aligns with our commitment to increasing shareholder value, improving market visibility, and maintaining high standards of corporate governance."
