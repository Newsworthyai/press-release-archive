# NeuroOne® Bolsters Patent Portfolio With Recent Decisions From Both the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office and European Patent Office

Growing IP Portfolio Signals Further Opportunity for Expansion of Company’s Technology Platform

 EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN. - October 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: NMTC) ("NeuroOne" or the "Company"), a medical technology company focused on improving surgical care options and outcomes for patients suffering from neurological disorders, today announced successful additions to the company’s growing patent portfolio: the first granted patent in Europe and both an issued patent and a Notice of Allowance in the United States.

 On September 29, 2025, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application 17/860,232, titled “Probe Devices with Temperature Sensors and Related Systems and Methods,” which covers novel electrode devices having at least one electrode contact and a temperature sensor.

 A Notice of Allowance is issued by the USPTO after examination of a patent application and a determination that a patent should be granted from the application. NeuroOne anticipates the issuance of the patent in the coming months.

 In addition, on October 1, 2025, European Patent 4013481, titled “Spinal Cord Stimulation Systems, Methods, and Devices” was granted by the European Patent Office. The patent covers novel spinal cord stimulation devices having a deployable electrode array body.

 Finally, on October 7, 2025, U.S. Patent 12,435,407, titled “Methods for Making Probe Devices and Related Devices,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent covers novel methods of making neural probe and spinal cord stimulation devices, including specific steps for the arrangement of probe components and deposition of electrode contact material.

 In addition to the allowed U.S. patent application, the granted European patent, and the issued U.S. patent, NeuroOne’s patent portfolio includes four additional issued U.S. patents, seven additional pending U.S. applications, and eight pending foreign applications covering a wide variety of thin-film electrode technologies, including both neural and spinal cord electrodes having unique structures to optimize the functionality and minimized profile of those electrodes.

 “NeuroOne has made tremendous progress expanding our robust patent portfolio. Our goal is to continue to grow our technology platform to broader use cases and applications,” said Dave Rosa, chief executive officer, NeuroOne. “Temperature Control is an integral feature of our OneRF Ablation System® that provides a critical safety measure for brain ablations for patients suffering from seizures. We are also excited to receive our first European patent that features our percutaneously placed paddle electrode, designed to save patients from having to undergo a surgical incision to treat lower back pain.”
