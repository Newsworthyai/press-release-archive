# Focus Universal Inc. Launches Universal Smart IoT Apps

ONTARIO, CA - October 14, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Focus Universal Inc. (NASDAQ: FCUV) ("Focus" or the "Company"), a provider of patented hardware and software design technologies for Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and SEC Financial Reporting AI-Driven Automation Software, is pleased to announce today that the company has launched the Universal Smart IoT App in Apple’s app store and Google Play’s app store.

 Although IoT has long been recognized as a revolutionary technology with the large potential to change the world - ranking as the top transformative technology, widespread adoption has been limited by high development costs and technical complexity. The customized nature of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and projects often requires bespoke designs built from scratch, leading to skyrocketing development and implementation costs. Focus Universal has dedicated over a decade to researching and overcoming these specific challenges, resulting in Universal Smart IoT - an innovative platform that radically simplifies IoT development and dramatically reduces associated costs.

 Unlike traditional IoT systems, where engineers start from scratch for each new device, the company’s platform provides a pre-built common foundation. Utilizing Focus’ platform, different IoT devices can share roughly 90% of the same hardware and software, substantially reducing development costs and complexity. This unique approach not only accelerates time-to-market but also democratizes access to IoT solutions.

 Further enhancing this ecosystem is Focus Universal’s Universal Smart Software Platform, which eliminates the need for multiple device-specific applications. The company believes engineers no longer need to build separate apps for each IoT product - the company’s platform supports them all without sacrificing performance or functionality, according to the company technology lead. This streamlined app development process can significantly cut costs and improve efficiency, allowing us to offer the company’s IoT platform to customers at a fraction of the cost required to develop custom solutions

 One of the company’s revolutionary products, the Ubiquitor, exemplifies this efficiency. The Ubiquitor can connect to any sensor - or even a large number of independent sensors - without theoretical limit. As more sensors are added, the average cost of the Ubiquitor per sensor becomes negligible. This results in an effective cost which approaches the cost of the sensors alone, already significantly lower than traditional devices. When used in conjunction with the company’s universal platform, the total development cost is a fraction of conventional approaches, offering substantial savings in both raw materials and engineering time.

 To install the Universal Smart IoT App, search ‘FCUV’ in the Apple app store or Google Play’s app store. The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms. The company believes this milestone signals a new era for the Internet of Things. Following two decades of innovation, the company is continuing to move forward with full-scale commercialization. In doing so, the company not only begins to complete its technology promise to shareholders but also demonstrates to the world that deploying complex IoT technology can be as easy as plugging in an office phone or other device. The company’s platform provides both a competitive edge and cost savings even when compared to traditional, non-IoT devices - thanks to universal hardware and software shared across all sensors. Switching from one sensor to another requires no change to the underlying device’s hardware or software, enabling true interoperability across devices.

 Additionally, Focus Universal’s AI-driven SEC financial reporting software has been successfully demonstrated to several of the well-respected industry leaders within the SEC filing and compliance sector. SEC financial reporting is traditionally a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. The entire process may take several weeks. Delays in filing can result in SEC reviews, enforcement actions, and significant penalties. Focus Universal, by contrast, has developed a fully automated, end-to-end solution powered by both automation and Variegated AI, whereby Focus believes the technology enables the computer to conduct the activities for which the computer is designed and optimal and allows the human to remain within the decision loop and center upon what the human excels. With a single click, the company’s software can:

 * Retrieve financial statements from accounting platforms,
* Reformat data into spreadsheets for consolidated financial reporting,
* Automatically generate consolidated financials,
* Populate the word-processed version of SEC filings,
* Convert the documents to SEC-compliant versions via EDGARization, and
* Embed accurate tags into the HTML file - with very limited manual input.

 Built-in validation, including self-consistency and compliance checks, ensures accuracy and eliminates human error. Essentially, Focus believes what once took weeks of manual work can now be completed in minutes. Edgarization is the process of converting source documents - such as Microsoft Word, Excel, or PDF files - into the SEC-compliant Edgar HTML format. Traditionally, this process handles only ten pages per hour. The company’s software, however, can process a hundred-page SEC financial report in a few seconds. Focus Universal is partnering with industry-leading partners to conduct real-time testing of this technology.

 The IoT market was valued at $540 Billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $3.3 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 26.1%. Yet despite its promise, industry surveys reveal that a majority of IoT projects fail - Cisco Systems reported a 75% failure rate, and Microsoft found that 30% of IoT projects fail at the early proof-of-concept stage. Focus Universal’s Universal Smart IoT technology was specifically developed to overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of the IoT revolution.

 According to recent industry analysis, the Financial Reporting Software Market was valued at US $13.9 Billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to US $36.6 Billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.8%. The surge is driven by the increasing complexity of financial data, the high cost of compliance, and the need for scalable, efficient, and intelligent reporting tools. Focus believes this innovation does not replace the SEC-required review process but removes much of the labor-intensive, manual work, dramatically cutting preparation and revision time for public companies.
