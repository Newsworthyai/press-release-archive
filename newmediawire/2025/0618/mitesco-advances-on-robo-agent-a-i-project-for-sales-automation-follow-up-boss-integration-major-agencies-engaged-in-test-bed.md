# Mitesco Advances on Robo-Agent A.I. Project for Sales Automation, Follow-up-Boss Integration, Major Agencies Engaged in Test Bed

VERO BEACH, FLORIDA - June 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Mitesco, Inc. (OTC:MITI, www.mitescoinc.com) today announced that its software development project known as Robo-Agent is well underway with a beta test team from major residential real estate players engaging to advance the effort. It also announces that it intends to rollout the initial version as an add-on to a popular existing CRM platform, Follow-up-Boss(TM).

 “While Robo-Agent is ultimately intended for broader business-to-consumer (B2C) applications, our initial implementation targets the residential real estate market,” said Mack Leath, CEO of Mitesco. “With agent compensation shrinking and market activity relatively stagnant, increasing productivity is more critical than ever.”

 Robo-Agent is being developed under Mitesco’s Vero Technology Ventures division and is designed as a comprehensive, turnkey solution for automating the entire sales lifecycle. Key features include time and task management, prospecting and qualification (for both buyers and sellers), and individualized business planning for agents.

 Leath added, “We’re employing a conversational A.I. approach that requires minimal technical knowledge - both for agents and their prospects. By launching as an add-on to Follow Up Boss, which has over 200,000 users and was acquired by Zillow Group in November 2023, we’re accelerating adoption through its existing ecosystem and integrations.” According to the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials (ARELLO), there are over 3 million active real estate licenses in the U.S., including more than 1.5 million National Association of Realtors (NAR) members. NAR reports that the average agent is 55 years old, works 35 hours per week, and has 10 years of experience in the field.

 The beta testing group includes agents from eXp Realty, Sotheby’s, LPT Realty, Coldwell Banker, and Berkshire Hathaway Home Services (BHHS). The participants range in technical skill levels and work across buyer and seller sides of the transaction spectrum. The goal is to ensure Robo-Agent is effective and intuitive for all agents, from part-time newcomers to full-time professionals operating in luxury markets. The platform will support tailored activity planning and performance tracking based on each agent’s goals and transaction volume.

 Once launched, Robo-Agent will be hosted in the Centcore Data Center, a Mitesco division providing secure, high-performance cloud infrastructure. Centcore is SOC 2, Tier 3+, and CJIS-certified, positioning it as a reliable and scalable platform for AI-powered business tools.
