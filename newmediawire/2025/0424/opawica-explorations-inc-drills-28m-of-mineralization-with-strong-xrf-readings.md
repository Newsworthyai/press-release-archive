# Opawica Explorations Inc. Drills 28m of Mineralization With Strong XRF Readings

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - April 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Opawica Explorations Inc. (TSXV: OPW) (FSE: A2PEAD) (OTC: OPWEF) (the “Company” or “Opawica”), a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on precious and base metals in the Abitibi Gold Belt is providing an update on its 2025 exploration campaign at the Bazooka Property ('Bazooka')..

 In drill hole OP-25-31 Opawica Explorations intersected a broad 28 m zone of shearing, silicification, quartz veining, some arsenic. The drill hole intercepted the target zone from 307 to 335 m, consisting of well-sheared, silicified and quartz veining sediments. The XRF readings of arsenic range from 1000 ppm As at the beginning of the zone to 200 ppm As at the end of the zone. The central part of the zone maintained a 1000 ppm As. One point XRF reading gave a reading of 92 g/t Au

 Opawica has now completed its first phase of its drill program on the Bazooka Property.  The program consisted of 3359 m in drilling in 14 holes. All the drill core has been split and logged. A total of 1384 m of core were sampled for a total of 1112 samples.  All the 1112 samples are now at the laboratory for analysis.

 Blake Morgan CEO stated, “With nearly 7000M of high priority targets remaining on the Bazooka Property and 10,000m high priority targets remaining on the Arrowhead. The team is eagerly awaiting assays. With multiple thick intercepts with high XRF readings of  234 g/t Au, the team has decided to await assays before making its next drilling move. So far we have been ecstatic with what we have been seeing. Multiple thick intercepts with fantastic XRF reading for gold and Nickle and on top of that, visible gold. We will have some more updates shortly and hope to get the assays back over the next few weeks.”

 Assay core samples are at ALS Chemex lab of Rouyn-Noranda, 165 Rue Jacques-Bibeau, Que. (an ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited facility). The sampling program is undertaken by company personnel under the direction of Yvan Bussieres, PEng. A secure chain of custody is maintained in transporting and storing of all samples. The rock samples will undergo fire assays, 1E3 (aqua regia) -- ICP/OES and select samples underwent gravimetries.

 X-ray fluorescence is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials such as drill cores. XRF analyzers determine the chemistry of a sample by measuring the fluorescent (or secondary) X-ray emitted from a sample when it is excited by a primary X-ray source. The company notes the results only provide an indication of the amount of minerals present. Certified assaying of the core samples is required to accurately determine the amount of base metal and precious metal mineralization.

 Samples of mineralization were taken at 0.5-metre-to-1.5-metre intervals, with sample intervals being adjusted to respect lithological and/or mineralogical contacts and isolate narrow veins or other structures that may yield higher grades. The core was split in two separate sections -- one-half of the core and the other half was sent for analysis.

 Mr. Yvan Bussieres, P.Eng., reviewed and approved the technical content of this news release. The qualified person has been unable to verify the information on the adjacent properties. Mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby and/or geologically similar properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization hosted on the company's properties
