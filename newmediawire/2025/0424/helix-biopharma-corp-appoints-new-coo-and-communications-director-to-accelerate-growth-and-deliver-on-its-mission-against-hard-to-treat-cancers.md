# Helix BioPharma Corp. Appoints New COO and Communications Director to Accelerate Growth and Deliver on its Mission Against Hard-to-Treat Cancers

TORONTO, ONTARIO - April 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Helix BioPharma Corp. (TSX: “HBP”, OTC PINK: “HBPCD”, FRANKFURT: “HBP0”) (“Helix” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage oncology company shaping a near future where today’s hard-to-treat cancers are vincible, today announced the appointments of Veronika Kandziora as Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) and Jessica Kourniaktis, DPhil, as Director of Communications of the Company.

 Ms. Kandziora is a seasoned executive with over 20 years of leadership experience across the biopharma, financial, and consulting sectors, bringing a rare trifecta of administrative acumen, people-centered leadership, and organizational insight to her role as COO of Helix BioPharma. Her long-standing relationship with the Company brings invaluable continuity and deep institutional knowledge to this role, having supported corporate strategy, transformation, and stakeholder engagement for Helix in Europe and North America. She previously served as Corporate Secretary of Helix (2017-2019) and as a strategic consultant to the Company’s leadership and Board in the years leading up to her appointment. Alongside these roles, she spent 15 years as an independent Asset Manager, advising clients on corporate development, intellectual property, and strategic investments - primarily in the biopharma space. Ms. Kandziora began her career in the financial industry in 2003, leading complex international projects across Germany, Austria, Italy, and Liechtenstein, and consulting for wealth managers, trustees, and investment funds with a focus on biotechnology, technology, and raw materials. A polyglot with a strong foundation in finance and compliance, Ms. Kandziora holds a Diploma in Management and Hospitality from the WIFI Academy of Applied Sciences in Austria, and is a certified Vocational Trainer in Liechtenstein. She has also completed advanced compliance training with the Institute for Compliance and Quality Management (ICQM) and the Association for Quality Assurance of Financial Services (VQF), reinforcing her ability to navigate complex regulatory and governance environments with confidence and clarity.

 Dr. Jessica Kourniaktis is a communications strategist with 10 years of experience in the life sciences and an academic background in the Humanities, bringing a unique approach to communications that combines analytical depth with clear, compelling storytelling. In 2020, she founded Manage Mind, a boutique consultancy through which she has advised clients in oncology, cell therapy, rare diseases, and metabolic disorders, while also collaborating with industry-leading communications firms and top-tier branding, storytelling, and design agencies to help science-driven ventures articulate their vision and engage critical stakeholders. A former Teaching Fellow at the University of Oxford, she began her industry career at SynDermix AG while completing her DPhil in Cold War and Cultural History (2018), quickly rising to become the company’s youngest senior executive and first female member of the C-suite. She went on to serve as COO of two Swiss biopharma startups - Laevoroc Medical AG and metaShape Pharma AG - and as a Board Member of ESGTI AG (2022–24), a Swiss investment firm formerly listed on BX Swiss, where she focused on market research, asset valuations of pre-revenue life sciences ventures, and stakeholder reporting at both Board and shareholder levels. This breadth of leadership experience deeply informs her communications work, grounding it in a clear understanding of business priorities, investor expectations, and the internal dynamics that shape how science moves forward. Dr. Kourniaktis earned her BA from the University of Bristol, her MA from University College London (UCL), and her DPhil from the University of Oxford. She has published original research in peer-reviewed academic journals and collective volumes, and was named Emerging Life Sciences CEO of the Year (Europe) in the 2022 Global CEO Excellence Awards for her leadership in advancing early-stage innovation. Dr. Kourniaktis will function as a consultant to Helix pursuant to a consulting agreement between the Company and Manage Mind.

 Ms. Kandziora, Chief Operating Officer of Helix BioPharma, said, “Helix is at a pivotal stage in its development - with a promising portfolio of assets and a new, determined focus on achieving its goals. As COO, my role is to bring structure, clarity, and strategic alignment across the organization, ensuring that our operational foundation is strong and agile enough to empower our team, innovate from a position of strength, and fulfill our commitment to deliver better treatment options to those of us facing hard-to-treat cancers - without delay.”

 Dr. Kourniaktis, Director of Communications, added, “Helix’s story is one worth hearing - and we’re just getting started. Over the past few months, I’ve had the privilege of supporting the Company’s communication strategy, helping to shape how we show up and what we stand for. As Communications Director, I’m excited to make sure more people understand the work we’re doing, get behind the vision, and help us move faster toward getting patients the treatments they need.”

 Thomas Mehrling, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Helix BioPharma, said, “Veronika is highly regarded for her strengths in organizational leadership, and her deep familiarity with the Company makes her uniquely positioned to support Helix through this next phase. Jessica brings a sharp, strategy-first approach to communications, shaped by her experience across science, operations, and storytelling. Together, they strengthen our leadership team at a time when clarity, focus, and execution are critical to delivering on our vision.”
