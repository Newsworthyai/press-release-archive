# GeoVax Establishing Strategic Presence in Europe  With Initial Footprint in the UK

Hub to Advance Global Vaccine and Immuno-Oncology Development

 ATLANTA, GA - March 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - GeoVax Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of immunotherapies and vaccines, today announced its initial steps toward establishing a strategic presence in Europe, with the UK as its initial footprint. This move aligns with the Company’s commitment to advancing its vaccine and immunotherapy pipeline through global collaborations.

 Efforts are underway to identify a UK location best suited to align with GeoVax’s development and corporate strategy. The Company already has several established connections in the UK and broader European region, including:

 * Scientific Expertise: Professor Teresa Lambe, a principal investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group, recently joined GeoVax’s Scientific Advisory Board. Professor Lambe played a pivotal role in the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and has extensive experience in vaccine design and evaluation.
* Manufacturing Partnerships: GeoVax maintains an existing contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) relationship with Oxford Biomedica PLC (Oxford, UK), as well as additional collaborations with Oxford Biomedica (France), with facilities in Strasbourg and Lyon.
* Technology Licensing: The Company has a broad licensing agreement with ProBioGen AG (Berlin, Germany) to utilize their AGE1 continuous avian cell line for the manufacture of MVA vaccines.
* European Collaborations: GeoVax currently collaborates with multiple European-based service providers and UK academic partners, reinforcing the strategic rationale for establishing a presence within the region.

 To support this initiative, GeoVax is working closely with Professor Teresa Lambe and clinical investigators and scientists in Oxford and other academic centers across the UK to develop preclinical, translational, and clinical projects supporting its pipeline. Additionally, Dr. Deborah Spencer, a highly regarded expert in industry-academic partnerships and public health development, has recently been retained to facilitate and coordinate initiatives in the UK and Europe.

 Establishing a strategic presence in Europe will support GeoVax’s infectious disease vaccine development efforts and play a key role in advancing Gedeptin®, the Company’s lead immuno-oncology candidate. Currently in clinical development for the treatment of advanced head and neck cancers, Gedeptin is anticipated to be further developed for use with immune checkpoint inhibitors as a potential treatment for various other solid tumors. GeoVax holds worldwide rights to Gedeptin for all indications.

 "Expanding our presence into Europe represents a critical milestone for GeoVax as we continue to develop innovative solutions for infectious diseases and oncology, especially in building upon our initial UK footprint," said David Dodd, President and CEO of GeoVax. “The globally recognized expertise of our key European collaborators and partners will significantly enhance our research and development capabilities. This expansion underscores our commitment to global collaboration and innovation in both vaccine and immuno-oncology development. As we accelerate the development of our infectious disease vaccine candidates and Gedeptin, we look forward to providing continued updates."

 GeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines for many of the world’s most threatening infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers. The company’s lead clinical program is GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine for which GeoVax was recently awarded a BARDA-funded contract to sponsor a 10,000-participant Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GEO-CM04S1 versus an approved COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 is currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials, being evaluated as (1) a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from hematologic cancers and other patient populations for whom the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are insufficient, (2) a booster vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and (3) a more robust, durable COVID-19 booster among healthy patients who previously received the mRNA vaccines. In oncology the lead clinical program is evaluating a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy, Gedeptin®, having recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. A Phase 2 clinical trial in first recurrent head and neck cancer, evaluating Gedeptin® combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned. GeoVax has a strong IP portfolio in support of its technologies and product candidates, holding worldwide rights for its technologies and products. The Company has a leadership team who have driven significant value creation across multiple life science companies over the past several decades.
