# YCRM Withdraws S-1 Registration Statement, Announces Shift to More Flexible Financing Strategy as Company Prepares for 2024 10-K Filing (Yuengling's Ice Cream Corp)

ReachOut Technology Corp. Emphasizes Commitment to Strategic Capital Management and Long-Term Shareholder Value

 CHICAGO, IL - March 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Yuengling's Ice Cream Corporation (OTC: YCRM), and its wholly owned subsidiary ReachOut Technology Corp, today announced the formal withdrawal of its previously filed S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company submitted the withdrawal request before market open on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.

 "We took a hard look at our capital strategy and made a decisive move," stated Rick Jordan, CEO of ReachOut Technology. "This particular financing structure doesn't align with our growth needs. Our financing approach needs to match where we're heading, not where we've been."

 The withdrawal represents a strategic pivot as the Company seeks more flexible financing structures to support its aggressive growth initiatives in AI implementation and digital asset security development adding to strategic acquisitions, bringing a higher level of digital intelligence to its business model.

 "Last year brought challenges. An acquisition didn't deliver what we expected. That's reality," Jordan continued. "But I'm done looking backward. Focusing on operational strategy,  and market growth. With our 10-K approaching, shareholders deserve to know exactly how we're positioning for our next steps, and there's more coming."

 The Company clarified that this action does not signal reduced fundraising activity, but rather a recalibration toward financing options that better support ReachOut's growth needs and technology deployment strategy.

 Jordan emphasized, "We're not stopping our financing efforts... we're getting better alignment. Every decision we make is about growing the company as we transform this industry. This is about having the right tools, at the right time, to build something worthy of telling the story."

 The withdrawal is part of ReachOut's broader initiative to optimize its capital structure while maintaining focus on strategic acquisitions, AI innovation, and digital asset security solutions.
