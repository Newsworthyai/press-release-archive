# Zonte Metals Outlines a Large, Strong Gravity Anomaly on Its Cross Hills Copper Project

DARTMOUTH, NOVA SCOTIA - March 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Zonte Metals Inc. (TSXV:ZON)(XOTC:EREPF) (“Zonte” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the advancement of the Nine Mile target with the discovery of its fifth large gravity anomaly, on its Cross Hill Copper Project in Newfoundland and Labrador.

 Highlights from Nine Mile target:

 - The discovery of a strong 5 mGal gravity anomaly.

 - The gravity anomaly has significant size, with dimensions up to 3700 metres by 3100 metres and +900 metres deep, and open to the south.

 - The gravity anomaly sits in a complex structural zone that could have provided mineralizing fluid pathways, enhancing its potential.

 Terry Christopher, President and CEO, comments: “The discovery of this large, strong gravity anomaly at Nine Mile is a significant discovery for Zonte, being its fifth large-scale gravity anomaly outlined within the project. A portion of the new anomaly is positioned at a flexure in the Cross Hills fault and intersected by multiple fault sets. This structural zone may have acted as a conduit for fluid movement and a potential trap for mineralization. At the surface, above the anomaly, copper has been identified in rocks, while copper-in-soil anomalies have been identified where the soil sampling has been completed. When strongest portions of the anomaly are examined, two separate target areas are highlighted; a northern one sitting within a structural zone within the strongest magnetic signature at Nine Mile and a southern one which is close to the K6 copper bearing drill holes. The K6 discovery points to a fertile copper system and the spatially relationship to several recently outline gravity anomalies highlights the potential for discovery. The newly defined target area will be the focus for the additional exploration to take it to drill stage, as soon as the snow melts.”

 The Company recently completed a ground gravity survey over the Nine Mile target, a priority target identified through a 2020 helicopter magnetic survey (see releases dated November 24, 2020 and January 22, 2021). That magnetic survey discovered the largest magnetic anomaly on the project and subsequent exploration discovered a copper-in-soil anomaly, copper-in-rocks, classic IOCG alteration all sitting within an interpreted flexure in the Cross Hills fault system.

 The gravity survey covered an area measuring up to 4.8 by 4.5 km, with data collected at 200-metre centres where terrain allowed. The survey discovered a strong 5 mGal anomaly that extends from the Nine Mile area, southward toward the K6 target and remains open to the south. 3D inversion processing of the residual gravity data defined a very large anomaly measuring 3,700 metres in length, up to 3,100 metres in width, and extending to a depth of 900 metres, within the 0.6–1.0 gm/cc range. Of note, the very southwest portion of this anomaly sits just east and vertically deeper of the drill holes that intersected copper mineralization at the K6 target (see releases dated February 29, 2024 and October 11, 2024).

 The gravity data was re-reprocessed in the 1.0 – 1.2 gm/cc range to identify the strongest signature within the larger anomaly. This additional 3D inversion processing highlighted two areas. The first, on the northern end measures 2100 metres in length, 560 metres in width and 1000 metres in depth. This anomaly sits within an east-west structural zone and is partially enveloped by a strong magnetic anomaly. The second, at the southern end, measures up to 1900 metres in length, 2000 metres in width and +700 metres in depth, and is open along strike to the south and to depth.

 The Company is in the process of planning additional sampling and mapping throughout the newly defined target area. This work will commence shortly.

 About Zonte

 Zonte Metals Inc. is a junior explorer focused on gold and copper. The Company owns 100% of the MJ project, in the Tintina Gold Belt, located in the Yukon Territory, the Wings Point project in the new Central Newfoundland Gold Belt, and the Cross Hills Copper project located in Newfoundland and Labrador. In Colombia, the company has a 25% carried interest in Project X where historic drilling intersected significant gold mineralization and the Company and partner have an application over open areas sitting on top of the open pit outline of the Gramalote Deposit in Colombia, which is held by AngloGold Ashanti and B2Gold. The title issuance is being contested by the state governing the application and the Company has started legal action to protect its rights.
