# Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) Engages Partner Capital Group, LLC  (PartnerCap) to Explore Strategic Alternatives to Maximize Shareholder Value

NEW YORK, NY - March 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) ("Accredited Solutions" or the "Company"), a technology-driven operating company focused on strategic fintech, blockchain, and digital assets, is pleased to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to acquire ItsBChain LLC, a blockchain-based subsidiary, from iQSTEL Inc. (OTCQX: IQST). This acquisition aligns with ASII’s long-term strategy to expand its presence in blockchain-powered fintech solutions, digital transactions, and payment processing ecosystems.

 The acquisition of ItsBChain will enable ASII to leverage blockchain technology in new and innovative ways within the digital finance sector. The integration of ItsBChain’s expertise in the telecommunications blockchain market with ASII’s growing e-gift card and prepaid financial services portfolio creates significant synergies. Blockchain applications in telecom have proven highly effective in securing transactions, reducing fraud, and improving operational efficiencies. ASII plans to extend these advantages to its digital payment solutions, ensuring enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency for its growing network of partners and customers.

 “We are thrilled to welcome ItsBChain to the Accredited Solutions family,” said Eduardo Brito, CEO of Accredited Solutions, Inc. “While the market has yet to fully recognize the value of our GlobeTopper acquisition, we remain confident in our vision and long-term growth strategy. The addition of ItsBChain positions us to accelerate our development of blockchain-based payment systems, particularly in the B2B segment, providing secure, efficient, and scalable fintech solutions.

 ItsBChain’s platform has strong synergy with e-gift payment systems, which not only creates new revenue streams but also significantly reduces transaction costs. Our ambition to become a global leader in fintech payments is driven by the fact that blockchain technology represents the future of payments, and we intend to be at the forefront of this transformation. The synergies from this acquisition will cut our time-to-market by at least 70%, giving us a substantial competitive advantage.

 We remain committed to exploring every opportunity to maximize shareholder value, including strategic mergers, partnerships, and new investment initiatives. We deeply appreciate the continued trust and support of our shareholders as we execute our vision.”

 The definitive Purchase Agreement for ItsBChain is expected to be executed no later than July 1, 2025. ASII is committed to integrating blockchain technology into its financial products and services, reinforcing its leadership in the digital payment sector with enterprise level corporations, incumbent telco operators and premier online retailers.
