# DATAGROUP Initiates Delisting Procedure on the Munich Stock Exchange

PLIEZHAUSEN, Germany - December 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Management Board and Supervisory Board of DATAGROUP SE (WKN A0JC8S) today decided to submit a request to the Munich Stock Exchange at short notice to revoke the inclusion of DATAGROUP shares in the open market (delisting). This step is intended to enable the company to operate as a private company with greater strategic flexibility in the future.

 In connection with the planned delisting, DATAGROUP points out that investors will not have the opportunity to sell their shares now or at a later date as part of a delisting offer, as is the case with shares admitted to the regulated market. This option is expressly not available here. Shareholders who wish to sell their shares should therefore consider doing so before the delisting.

 Shareholders who remain invested must expect that, after the delisting, their shares will likely only be tradable to a limited extent or possibly not at all, as trading volume is likely to decline significantly and trading opportunities are expected to be significantly restricted.
