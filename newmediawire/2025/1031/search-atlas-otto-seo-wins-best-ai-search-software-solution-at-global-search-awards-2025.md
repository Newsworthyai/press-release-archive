# Search Atlas' OTTO SEO Wins Best AI Search Software Solution at Global Search Awards 2025

Revolutionary AI SEO Software Recognized for Transforming Digital Marketing Landscape and Paving the Way for Agentic Marketing

 NEW YORK CITY - October 30, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Search Atlas Group has been awarded Best AI Search Software for OTTO SEO at the prestigious Global Search Awards, beating companies like Semrush and Ahrefs. Search Atlas’ victory comes from OTTO SEO’s ability to fully automate SEO execution, while Semrush’s AI Optimization (AIO) only provides recommendations, cementing Search Atlas’ position as a pioneer in AI-driven search optimization technology.

 OTTO SEO, the world's first automated SEO AI assistant, has revolutionized how businesses approach search engine optimization by eliminating manual labor and deploying thousands of webpage optimizations with just a few clicks. The award recognizes OTTO's groundbreaking approach to GEO and AEO which helps marketers get their clients more visibility in LLMs.

 Why OTTO is The Future of Search Marketing

 OTTO SEO represents a fundamental shift in search optimization technology. By simply adding the OTTO pixel to their website, businesses automate complex SEO tasks that traditionally required hundreds of hours of manual work from marketing and agency teams. Search Atlas OTTO has an intuitive interface which enables users to deploy comprehensive optimizations across their entire web presence without technical expertise or extensive SEO knowledge.

 The latest evolution of OTTO includes pixel-less, server-side installation that eliminates JavaScript dependencies. You create an API token inside the Cloudflare account, enable the DNS permission, and validate and connect it to OTTO, making implementation seamless while ensuring permanent site changes. With universal CMS support across 20 different content management systems (WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, and Go High Level), OTTO adapts to virtually any website infrastructure.

 OTTO also combines your organic and paid search strategy with OTTO PPC, which builds complete, conversion-ready ad ecosystems. OTTO PPC structures campaigns, automates negative keyword management, and refines ad copy, bids, and targeting through continuous machine-learning optimization to maximize conversions and long-term ROAS efficiency.

 Most significantly, the recent reveal of OTTO Agent on September 26 marks the beginning of "the SEO Agentic Revolution", according to Search Atlas CEO Manick Bhan. This conversational AI agent allows users to communicate directly with OTTO to deploy changes through natural language, making advanced SEO accessible to businesses of all sizes.

 "Winning Best AI Search Software validates the ton of work that went into OTTO and the vision everyone at Search Atlas has," said Manick Bhan, Founder, CEO and CTO of Search Atlas. "OTTO isn't just about automation, it's about empowering marketers to focus on strategy while AI handles the execution. We're working to fundamentally re-imagine SEO for the age of AI-driven search."

 What Users Are Saying About OTTO

 OTTO SEO has garnered enthusiastic praise from marketing teams and agencies worldwide like with Alec Neumeyer the Co-Founder at Secure Line Marketing who said:

 “OTTO has transformed how we manage SEO. The AI automation allows us to quickly update essential SEO elements, significantly speeding up our workflow. It’s not just about efficiency; it’s about scaling our capabilities without scaling our headcount. OTTO has made our operations faster, our team more effective, and our client interactions more impactful.”

 OTTO also helped Adam McChesney Founder and CEO of Builders of Authority to save time and money for his clients:

 “When we started with Otto, we were ranking for 185 keywords with 15 in the top 3. As of this month, we are ranking for 1,571 keywords and have 55 keywords ranking #1 that’s generated us an estimated traffic value of $18,500/mo.

 We have been able to do over 500 days of SEO with Otto. Pretty awesome stuff!”

 2026 Vision: Vibe SEO and the Agentic Marketing Revolution

 In 2025 Search Atlas emerged as the top GEO software for marketing agencies to use and looking ahead to 2026, they show no intention of slowing down their quest to help businesses dominate search engine and LLM visibility.

 Search atlas helps ambitious businesses dominate search marketing through their revolutionary “Vibe SEO” approach and an expanding suite of agentic tools.

 Vibe SEO, introduced by Manick Bhan, who is an expert in the field of SEO and GEO, at the Search Atlas Live 2025 event in New York City on September 26, 2025, represents the next evolutionary step in digital marketing. Drawing parallels to how "vibe coding" has revolutionized software development by making programming more intuitive and accessible,

 "We're moving beyond traditional, manual SEO processes toward an intuitive, AI-driven approach that feels natural and seamless," Bhan explained. "In 2026, we'll be rolling out a complete ecosystem of agentic tools that work together intelligently to make marketers better, more data-driven and quicker. The future of search marketing isn't about working harder, it's about working smarter with AI as your collaborative partner."
