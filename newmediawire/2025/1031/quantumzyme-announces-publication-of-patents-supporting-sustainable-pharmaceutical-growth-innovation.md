# Quantumzyme Announces Publication of Patents Supporting Sustainable Pharmaceutical Growth &amp; Innovation

SAN DIEGO, CA - October 31, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Quantumzyme Corp. (OTCQB: QTZM), a biotechnology company pioneering enzyme engineering and green chemistry solutions, is pleased to announce details regarding the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) publication of its international patent application titled “Modified Polypeptides for Enzymatic Synthesis of Ibuprofen” (Publication No. WO 2025/093935 A1).

 Although the patent was published in May 2025, the company is announcing it now to highlight the Company’s ongoing progress and commitment to growth through innovation in sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing. This announcement also reflects the company’s broader growth strategy, which centers on expanding its enzyme engineering capabilities, strengthening its intellectual property portfolio, and advancing discussions with potential global partners. The “Next Steps” outlined below represent the next phase in executing that strategy.

 The company previously announced the publication of its U.S. Patent Application (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2025/0146029 A1) covering related enzymatic processes. Together, these filings establish broad protection for Quantumzyme’s proprietary enzyme engineering platform in both the United States and international markets.

 These publications strengthen Quantumzyme’s international intellectual property portfolio and represent a major step toward commercializing its enzymatic process for the sustainable manufacture of ibuprofen. These patents cover the company’s proprietary biocatalytic method for producing ibuprofen through an enzyme-mediated process designed to reduce chemical waste, eliminate harsh reagents, and enhance overall manufacturing efficiency.

 “The publication of our patents both in the USA and internationally mark an important milestone for Quantumzyme,” stated Naveen Kulkarni, CEO of Quantumzyme Corp. “It validates the strength of our enzyme engineering technology and enhances our position for global partnerships focused on greener, more efficient pharmaceutical manufacturing. It also allows us to advance into the optimization and pilot-testing phase, and engaging with potential partners interested in sustainable and scalable API production.”

 The patented ibuprofen synthesis builds on Quantumzyme’s proprietary QZyme Workbench™ platform, which integrates quantum mechanics, molecular modeling, and AI-driven optimization to design next-generation biocatalysts. This technology underpins multiple enzyme systems the company is developing for sustainable, high-efficiency production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and specialty chemicals.

 Next Steps

 Quantumzyme intends to:

 * Continue laboratory optimization and scale-up validation of the enzymatic ibuprofen synthesis process.
* Pursue discussions with global pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) regarding licensing or joint-development frameworks.
* File additional patent applications covering related enzymatic transformations and process improvements.
