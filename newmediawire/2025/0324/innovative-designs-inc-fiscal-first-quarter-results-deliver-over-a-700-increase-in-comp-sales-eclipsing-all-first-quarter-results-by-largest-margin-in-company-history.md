# Innovative Designs, Inc. Fiscal First Quarter Results Deliver Over a 700% Increase In Comp Sales, Eclipsing All First Quarter Results by Largest Margin in Company History

Profitability Continues as Demand for Superior Evacuated Cell Home Insulation Expands Rapidly

 PITTSBURGH, PA - March 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Innovative Designs, Inc. (OTC Pink: IVDN) is proud to report that in the Company’s 2025 fiscal first quarter, ended January 31st, sales revenues total an all-time record over $540,000 vs. $65,886 for the same period in the previous year. This represents a comp. increase of over 700%. The exact total will be included in the Company’s next financial filing with the SEC. These results will continue the Innovative Designs status as a profitable company which was achieved for the first time at the end of the 2024 fiscal year.

 Strongly rising sales of Insultex House Wrap®, a patented and superior performance product of Innovative Designs, are responsible for most of the impressive revenue growth that the Company is now experiencing. Because of the sharp and continuing rise in demand for this unparalleled home insulation, Innovative Designs has been working to develop increased production capacity.  At this time, we are pleased to report that our main production facility in Massachusetts has been able to substantially accelerate product output. We have also been researching and developing additional production facilities in other parts of the country and this additional production is now also beginning to add to our available supply. Because of these efforts we have made dramatic progress in filling our large backlog of orders for Insultex House Wrap® and cut our delivery times down from 6 or 8 weeks to much shorter periods. This improvement in delivery has pleased our existing and new customers to the extent that even faster order flow is coming to us as a result.

 The surging demand for Insultex House Wrap®, is being sparked by new government building codes calling for continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements. Insultex House Wrap delivers its advantages thanks to its patented vacuum cell structure design. No other product on the market today offers a vacuum cell structure. A vacuum is the best thermal insulation possible and only Insultex® incorporates countless evacuated cells. Insultex® also provides a moisture barrier and other key benefits. The result is a substantial reachedr new construction, adding an R-6 moisture barrier membrane that does not need additional insulation boards or other support as with other available choices from competitors.Joseph A. Riccelli Jr., CEO of Innovative Designs, commented, “The financial success that Innovative Designs has reached at this point with the growing performance recognition and successful sales of our unmatched Insultex House Wrap®, is extremely gratifying. However, we will not be satisfied until the investment community also begins to share in this recognition. To this end, we are now in the process of upgrading the listing status for IVDN shares from the current OTC Pink tier to the higher OTCQB level.  This process requires meeting considerable accountability standards as well as making detailed applications and filings which are all being attended to at this time. Additionally, plans are still being made for our upcoming shareholder’s meeting which will be an interactive online event designed to better inform the investment community about all that Innovative Designs is delivering, with earnings projections for the balance of 2025 and beyond.  I am very much looking forward to hosting this important event. Specific details will be announced soon.”         About Innovative Designs, Inc.Innovative Designs, Inc. manufactures the Insultex® House Wrap and Arctic Armor® Line, under the "i.d.i.gear" label featuring INSULTEX®.
