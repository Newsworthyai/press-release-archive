 LAS VEGAS, NV - March 24, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) (“Golden Matrix” or the “Company”), a global developer, licensor, and operator of online gaming platforms, today announced record financial and operational results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

 “2024 has been a pivotal year for Golden Matrix,” said Brian Goodman, CEO. “We successfully scaled our iGaming and sports betting operations, expanded our global footprint, and delivered strong full-year revenue growth of 63%, with 81% revenue growth achieved in the fourth quarter. Our strategic acquisitions of Meridianbet and Classics for a Cause, combined with our AI-powered platform enhancements, position us for sustained success. As we enter 2025, we remain well positioned for growth, with revenues for Q1 2025 estimated to rise by up to 80%. Our focus remains on innovation, profitability, and expanding into high-growth markets.”

 Financial Highlights

 Golden Matrix reported significant revenue growth, driven by expansion across key gaming markets, increased player engagement, and AI-driven product enhancements.

 * Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 81% to $46 million and full-year Revenue jumped 63% to $151 million, reflecting strong demand and strategic acquisitions.
* Gross Profit for the fourth quarter rose 45% to $27 million and full-year Gross Profit increased by 30% to $89 million, benefiting from operational efficiencies and high-margin product offerings.
* Net Income declined 207% for the fourth quarter and 111% for the full year to a Net Loss of $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, primarily due to additional amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation, interest expenses, and restructuring expenses.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 Adjusted EBITDA or AEBITDA, is a “non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs. Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net Debt Leverage Ratio is defined as net debt as of the balance sheet date divided by annualized adjusted EBITDA for the quarter then ended. We believe that using Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage Ratio is useful to investors in determining our leverage ratio since we could choose to use cash and cash equivalents to retire debt. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, are unaudited, and have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reﬂect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reﬂect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reﬂect the signiﬁcant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reﬂect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures, please see the section titled “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based Compensation Expense and Restructuring Costs” and “Reconciliation of Net Debt and Leverage Calculation”, included at the end of this release.
