# Royalty Management Holding Corporation Announces the Creation of Datacenter, AI, and Alternative Currency Mining Division: The Vault Holding Corporation

Subsidiary Created With Mission and Focus to Monetize Company’s Growing Assets and Opportunities in Datacenter, Artificial Intelligence Servers, and Alternative Currency Mining Sectors

 The Vault Holding Corporation Will be an Audited Subsidiary With Potential for Public Spinoff as Part of Expansion Plans, Capital Optimization, and Value Driver

 FISHERS, IN - September 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) (“Royalty Management” “RMCO”, or the “Company”), a forward leaning royalty company building shareholder value by acquiring and developing high value assets in a variety of resource-driven and emerging technology industries, is pleased to announce today that the Company has restructured an existing subsidiary of Royalty Management Corporation to create a new, focused operating company called “The Vault Holding Corporation” (or “The Vault”). The Vault is tasked with a mission of investing in, and expanding its holdings of, the growing datacenter, artificial intelligence (AI), and alternative currency mining space on behalf of its parent company, Royalty Management Corporation. With this sector as a key focus of RMCO and investment capital deployment, the Company made the decision to target this expansion in a more focused way with the creation of a company with a specific purpose of deploying capital to projects and equipment.

 Similar to the strategy of RMCO, The Vault will be focused on generating revenue and income for the entity, as well as providing additional return to RMCO as part of Royalty Management’s overall planned alternative currency treasury program from the generation of The Vault’s own mining activities at its controlled sites. The Vault has multiple sites it is incubating and developing that possess economically attractive, long-term electricity rates and existing infrastructure, with the goal of expediting return on capital to its investors.

 Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “The creation of The Vault is on the heels of a recent study we performed with ScoutCities that has successfully identified several sites within the Company’s portfolio of owned or controlled properties that have exhibited attractive characteristics of being used for datacenters, AI, and other electricity-dominant industries, such as mining for alternative currencies. These site characteristics include, among other factors, favorable electricity rates in the range of mid to high 4 cents per kilowatt hour with datacenter-friendly utility providers, access to local fiber optic infrastructure for communication and internet, and expandable site footprints.”

 Tom continued, “As the investment thesis around this core Company theme solidified and became clearer, it made perfect sense to consolidate RMCO’s interests and investments in building out our assets in the datacenter, AI, and alternative currencies space within one company that can provide a focused vehicle for growth and monetization in this sector. The Vault will stand as our platform for investing in equipment, properties, and infrastructure in this space and we look forward to meaningful value creation for RMCO starting almost immediately.”

 Through The Vault, RMCO will grow these datacenter, AI, and alternative currency assets through a variety of business lines and investments:

 1. Leasing The Vault controlled assets, such as real estate, buildings, infrastructure, and electrical rate contracts, to third parties that will build and deploy datacenters and similar infrastructure. In return, The Vault will receive rental and royalty income, with the potential to receive additional consideration in the form of alternative currencies that are mined using these controlled assets;
2. Deploy The Vault’s own servers and equipment at these sites through new equipment purchases and site investment. The Vault will generate its own alternative currency income and return from these assets; and
3. Acquire and invest in other properties and assets within this sector, including those that manufacture datacenter and AI equipment.

 The Vault looks to invest in this sector through a combination of cashflow investment, strategic partners, and utilizing its own registered securities though the filing of an anticipated registration statement. Royalty Management looks forward to providing its investors additional updates on The Vault in the near future.
