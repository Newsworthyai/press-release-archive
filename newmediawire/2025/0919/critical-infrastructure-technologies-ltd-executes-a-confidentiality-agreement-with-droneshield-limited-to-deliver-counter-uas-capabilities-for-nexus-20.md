# Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. Executes a Confidentiality Agreement With Droneshield Limited to Deliver Counter-UAS Capabilities for Nexus 20

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) (OTC: CITLF) (FRA: X9V) (“CiTech” or the “Company”), a leading developer of autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications platforms, is pleased to announce the execution of a Confidentiality Agreement (NDA) with DroneShield Limited to design and integrate Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capabilities for the Nexus 20 platform, requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.

 This new NDA builds on the recently executed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Babcock International and three-way NDAs with Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy and Ericsson Limited, which secure collaboration on the full 4G/5G telecommunications systems for the Nexus 20.

 With DroneShield’s globally recognised expertise in counter-drone technology, the Nexus 20 platform will be enhanced with leading-edge C-UAS capabilities, providing robust protection against evolving aerial threats in operational environments.

 “This agreement with DroneShield marks another critical step forward in delivering a fully integrated defence capability to meet the operational needs of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence,” said Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech. “By combining secure communications from Nokia and Ericsson, Babcock’s defence expertise, and DroneShield’s counter-UAS technology, the Nexus 20 is being positioned as the only one of its kind, globally.”

 The Nexus 20 program, comprising 50 platforms requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, aims to deliver a fully integrated, secure, and resilient system for modern defence operations. The execution of this NDA ensures that the C-UAS system design can now proceed alongside the telecommunications integration already underway.
