SILICON VALLEY, CA - September 19, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - ABVC BioPharma, Inc.. (NASDAQ: ABVC) (“ABVC” or the “Company”) today announced that it has received a licensing payment of US$145,950 from OncoX BioPharma, Inc. (“OncoX”) under the terms of the parties’ global licensing agreement. With this latest payment, ABVC has collected a total of US$595,950 from OncoX in Q3 2025, contributing to the Company’s total consolidated licensing revenues from all strategic partners of US$1,275,950 for the third quarter to date across multiple partnerships, including AiBtl BioPharma, ForSeeCon Eye Corporation, and OncoX.

 Management Commentary

 Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, stated:

 “This US$145,950 licensing payment from OncoX brings our total OncoX receipts in Q3 to nearly US$600,000 and underscores the current strength and reliability of our licensing framework. With four IND-approved oncology assets already licensed from ABVC and ongoing efforts to expand its portfolio - including the anticipated acquisition of the Lycogen® lycopene platform - OncoX is positioning itself as a long-term value generator. These milestone revenues, which come with minimal incremental costs, directly contribute to enhancing ABVC’s high-margin profile and long-term growth strategy.”About OncoX BioPharma
