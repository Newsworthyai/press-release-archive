# Policy Makers Meet on Capitol Hill to Shape the Global Future of Digital Assets

WASHINGTON, D.C. - September 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - The Future of Money, Governance, and the Law (FoMGL) on October 29-30, 2025 arrives at a pivotal moment as governments around the world seek clarity, innovation, and collaboration in the development of frameworks for decentralized finance, tokenization, and public infrastructure modernization. The summit’s programming spans a wide range of timely and critical topics, including finance, technology, and regulation.

 The event now includes legislators, administration officials, and policy leaders from around the world including Kyle Hauptman, Chair of the U.S. National Credit Union Administration, the regulatory authority for all U.S. Credit Unions. He will be joined by former UK Parliament Member, Lisa Cameron. She is also Chair of the UK-US Crypto Alliance, a think tank which seeks to foster alignment in Crypto policy between the United States and the United Kingdom. But, it is not just national leaders from around the world that will be shaping the future of digital assets. Local leaders that are perfecting the use of blockchain for local governance includes Ebony Thompson, the Baltimore City Solicitor that used blockchain technology to list vacant properties and make affordable housing available to local residents.

 Other government blockchain champions speaking at the summit include Utah County Commissioner, Amelia Powers-Gardner. She led the use of blockchain for the U.S. presidential election and has used blockchain for managing vital records. According to Ms. Powers-Gardent “The Future of Money, Governance, and the Law conference is where ideas become action. Bringing leaders together to explore blockchain and emerging technologies ensures that innovation in government is not only possible, but purposeful, building trust, transparency, and better services for every citizen.”

 Other confirmed speakers include David Beck, Former Command US Space Force and Principal at Space Technologies; Ryan VanGrack, Vice President of Legal and Global Head of Litigation at Coinbase and Vincent Kadar, CEO of Polymath.

 “We are thrilled to showcase the innovation and leadership of these digital mavericks modeling blockchain and digital assets as solutions to public sector challenges,” said Gerard Dache, Executive Director of the Government Blockchain Association. “They are shaping the future of money, governance, and the law.”

 The event is co-hosted by the Government Blockchain Association and The Edge of Company with a wide array of ecosystem sponsors like Sleap.io, a Web3 travel platform revolutionizing global bookings with crypto payments; Alter New Media, a mission-driven PR and marketing agency bridging purpose and innovation; and Moonlight Capital Limited, an ethical investment firm fueling blockchain adoption, underscore the multifaceted nature of this transformation. “Their participation reflects the summit’s mission to connect real-world utility, strategic communication, and responsible investment in building the digital foundations of tomorrow’s public sector,” said Joshua Kriger, Co-Founder of The Edge of Company.
