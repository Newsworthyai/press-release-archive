# YCRM ReachOut Technology Returns to Trading: CEO Rick Jordan Lays Out Blockchain CyberSecurity Strategy and Industry-First AI MSP Partnership In Shareholder Letter

CHICAGO, IL - February 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Yuengling's Ice Cream Corporation (OTCMKTS:YCRM)

 ReachOut Technology ("ReachOut"), wholly owned subsidiary of Yuengling's Ice Cream Corporation (OTC: YCRM), today is marking several transformative milestones with the release of a comprehensive shareholder letter from Founder and CEO Rick Jordan.

 **TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS**

 ReachOut Technology marks its return to active trading with significant developments in blockchain security, service delivery transformation, and growth plans and expansion in 2025. Let's go!

 **AUDIT COMPLETION & MARKET STATUS**

 ReachOut Technology has successfully returned to active trading, following a rigorous nine-month process completing comprehensive audits spanning multiple entities and years of operation. This extensive effort encompassed five separate full audits - including the original YCRM vehicle, ReachOut's historical financials (2 years), and two revenue-generating acquisitions (2 years each) - culminating in a consolidated transition period audit (10-KT) and three completed 10-Q filings for 2024.

 Trading View picked up the filing and said ... "Gross profit stood at $783,578 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and $2,758,990 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, indicating improved cost management and efficiency."

 "The temporary delisting was excruciating, but it forged something extraordinary," stated Rick Jordan, CEO of ReachOut Technology. "This horrendous process, while time-consuming, has established a rock-solid foundation for our future growth. The resilience demonstrated speaks volumes about what's coming next."

 **NAME CHANGE & CORPORATE IDENTITY TRANSFORMATION**

 The company's FINRA application for name and symbol change has been re-submitted, finalizing the reverse merger with Yuenglings and corporate restructuring. While the regulatory review typically requires 60 days to several months, ReachOut is already actively engaging to expedite the process.

 "This isn't just paperwork," Jordan emphasized. "This is who we are. This is what we've built. ReachOut Technology is about to take its rightful place in the market."

 **2025 GROWTH INITIATIVES**

 ReachOut Technology's growth strategy centers on three measurable objectives: expansion of its established managed services business, execution of identified acquisition targets, and penetration of specific market verticals. Organic revenue growth and acquisitions are paramount, and ReachOut is also building something brand new in blockchain security.

 "Let me be crystal clear about our growth strategy," Jordan stated. "We're going ALL IN. Our pipeline is stacking, and we're just getting started."

 **TRUSTLESS**

 ReachOut Technology is announcing it is securing a substantial stake in TRUSTLESS, a blockchain security disruptor. Jordan will serve as CEO of both organizations, creating powerful strategic alignment. This equity position strategically positions ReachOut to capitalize on TRUSTLESS' growth trajectory and future liquidity events.

 This strategic position extends far beyond conventional blockchain applications, targeting how organizations handle sensitive credentials and digital identity, addressing the massive security vulnerabilities that plague traditional password and authentication systems. This strategic stake positions ReachOut shareholders to benefit from TRUSTLESS's innovation in the $1.4+ trillion enterprise security market, where credential breaches remain the primary attack vector for major corporate compromise, and government like the recent US Treasury hack.

 "This isn't just another blockchain company," Jordan explained. "TRUSTLESS represents a complete reimagining of how handling digital identity and sensitive data is approached. Through leadership of both organizations, we've created perfect strategic alignment. Perfect positioning. Perfect timing."

 Jordan recently appeared on David Meltzer's global podcast "The Playbook" to discuss TRUSTLESS.

 **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVES**

 ReachOut Technology announces strategic partnership with Neo AI focusing on a groundbreaking initiative... development of the industry's first fully autonomous Level 1 Technician. This revolutionary approach to service delivery automation has shown incredible potential in the MSP space achieving 35% faster ticket resolution times and dramatic cost reductions at scale. This initiative breaks the traditional MSP growth model by enabling exponential scaling without proportional overhead increases as ReachOut continues both organic and acquisition strategies.

 "While others talk about AI, and MSPs are scared of it, we're deploying it," Jordan emphasized. "This enables us to scale massively without the traditional overhead that kills most MSP margins. While other providers remain stuck adding technicians with every new client, we're shattering that model completely."

 **VISIBILITY & THOUGHT LEADERSHIP**

 ReachOut continues establishing market presence through strategic industry engagements. Jordan recently presented enterprise blockchain security solutions at CES's Web3 stage and will keynote alongside David Meltzer at Cre8tive Con in Chicago, addressing practical AI implementation and monetization strategies for 2025.

 Kevin Harrington, the original shark from ABC's Shark Tank, continues on the board of directors and close advisory. "Everything that Rick's told me would happen, has happened... He knows how to scale," Harrington said.

 **MORE TO COME**

 With audits completed, strategic initiatives producing measurable results, and clear growth objectives established, ReachOut Technology demonstrates tangible progress toward market leadership in 2025.

 "To those who stuck with us through the audit process...THANK YOU. Your patience is about to be rewarded," Jordan concluded. "We're not just planning for growth... we're executing on it. Right now."
