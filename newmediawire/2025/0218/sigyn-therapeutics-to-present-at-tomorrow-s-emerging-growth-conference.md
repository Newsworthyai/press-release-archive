 About Sigyn Therapeutics(TM)

 Sigyn Therapeutics is developing next-generation blood purification therapies to address cancer and life-threatening infectious disease disorders that are not treatable with drugs.  The Company’s lead product candidate, Sigyn Therapy(TM) has been demonstrated to reduce the presence of viral pathogens, bacterial toxins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines from human blood plasma. Based on these capabilities, Sigyn Therapy(TM) is a candidate to treat life-threatening viral pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis, which is the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals.  The clinical protocol of first-in-human studies incorporates Sigyn Therapy with regularly scheduled dialysis treatments to address endotoxemia and concurrent inflammation, which are highly prevalent disorders that shorten the lives of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Extending the lives of those with ESRD could significantly impact dialysis industry revenues.

 The Company’s oncology pipeline is comprised of ImmunePrep(TM), a platform to enhance the delivery of immunotherapeutic antibodies; ChemoPrep(TM) to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents; and ChemoPure(TM) to reduce chemotherapy toxicity.  If successfully advanced, the Company’s therapies offer to provide strategic value to the dialysis and biopharmaceutical industry.
