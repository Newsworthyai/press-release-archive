# Sauce Essentials Expands Live Resin Line With New 1.25g AIO Vape Launch in California

Premium Cannabis Brand Set to Launch Bold New Flavors in New 1.25g AIO Live Resin Vape Line: Sour Blue Dream & Black Truffle

 COSTA MESA, CA - February 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Sauce Essentials (“Sauce” or “the Company”), one of the fastest growing US premium cannabis brands committed to providing top-quality products at affordable prices, announced today the launch of their upgraded 1.25g Live Resin All-In-One (AIO) Sauce Bars vape line, available now in Sour Blue Dream and Black Truffle, with more bold new flavors to launch in the coming months. Exclusively available in California from February 2025, Sauce’s new 1.25g offering will replace their 1g live resin AIO vape products, enhancing Sauce Essentials’ product lineup with a larger format and a commitment to high-quality live resin extraction.

 Crafted for superior potency, flavor, and price point, Sauce’s new 1.25g products preserve the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes from freshly harvested cannabis. By capturing the plant’s natural essence at peak freshness, Sauce Essentials continues to elevate the vaping experience for connoisseurs and casual consumers alike.

 “Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of THC vapes with bold flavors and uncompromising quality,” said Dylan Spencer, Chief Marketing Officer at Sauce Essentials. “With our upgraded 1.25g live resin vapes, we’re delivering an even better, longer-lasting experience while staying true to the flavors, effects and price point our customers love.”

 Following the California launch, Sauce Essentials plans to expand their new 1.25g line to additional markets, including Arizona and Oregon, in the coming months. As the brand grows its presence nationwide, consumers can expect the same high-quality formulations and attention to detail that have made Sauce Essentials a standout in the industry.

 Sauce Essentials’ Sour Blue Dream, a sativa-dominant hybrid with berry and citrus notes, and Black Truffle, an indica-leaning hybrid with rich, earthy flavors, will be available at licensed dispensaries across California from February 14.
