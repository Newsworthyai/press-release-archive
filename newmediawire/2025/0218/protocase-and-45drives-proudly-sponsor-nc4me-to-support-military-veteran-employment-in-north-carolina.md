# Protocase and 45Drives Proudly Sponsor NC4ME to Support Military Veteran Employment in North Carolina

WILMINGTON, NC - February 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Protocase and 45Drives, two companies leading in specialized high velocity rapid manufacturing for aerospace, defense, research, and enterprise data storage, are proud to announce sponsorship of North Carolina for Military Employment (NC4ME). This partnership reinforces their commitment to supporting military veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce and strengthening North Carolina’s economy.

 Every year, 20,000 service members transition out of the military through North Carolina’s Department of Defense installations, adding to the 778,000 veterans already residing in the state. Many businesses strive to support these veterans by utilizing their valuable skills to fill critical roles, yet they often lack the resources to identify and hire qualified military candidates. NC4ME was established by the Governor in 2015 as a public-private partnership to address this challenge by providing strategic education and workforce development tools to employers.

 As a company with a strong foundation in innovation and technical expertise, Protocase recognizes the immense value that military veterans bring to the workforce. "Expanding our global operations to Wilmington, NC, has been an exciting step for Protocase, and we are thrilled to partner with NC4ME to support the military community here," said Steve Lilley, President of Protocase. "Veterans bring discipline, leadership, and technical skills that align perfectly with our mission of providing high-quality, rapid manufacturing solutions."

 45Drives, which specializes in enterprise data storage solutions, also sees this partnership as a strategic move to invest in North Carolina’s workforce. "We find that military veterans possess problem-solving capabilities, resilience, and most especially the key attitude-plus-aptitude combination that fits like a glove with the way we train, develop, and advance talent within our two organizations," said Dr. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives. "We are honored to support NC4ME and help connect talented veterans with rewarding career opportunities at our Wilmington location."

 For Mike Pearson, Chief Operating Officer of Protocase and a veteran himself, this initiative is especially meaningful.

 "Having made the transition from military service into the private sector myself, I understand firsthand the challenges that veterans face when stepping into civilian careers," said Pearson. "At Protocase, we are committed to creating a work environment where veterans can apply their expertise, leadership, and technical skills in ways that not only benefit them, but also drive innovation within our company."

 Through this partnership, Protocase and 45Drives will actively participate in NC4ME initiatives that educate business leaders on the benefits of hiring military personnel, provide accredited HR training on recruiting and retaining veterans, and facilitate direct connections between employers and veteran job seekers.

 By focusing on the "demand side" of the employment equation, NC4ME ensures that veterans not only transition into civilian life successfully but also contribute significantly to the local economy. Protocase and 45Drives are excited to be part of this mission, reinforcing their dedication to fostering strong community and workforce development in the greater low country region.
