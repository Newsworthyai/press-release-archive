# A Future With Connected And Autonomous Vehicles Requires Infrastructure To Support It - Iteris Continues To Expand Its Partner Network To Help Make It Happen

By Anthony Termini, Benzinga

 DETROIT, MICHIGAN - February 18, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Grand View Research estimates that the road safety market will be worth $11 billion by 2030. McKinsey & Company projects that when fully autonomous vehicles (AV) become commonplace, they could unleash an economic windfall of between $300 billion and $400 billion.

 To get there, automakers will have to equip those AVs with cameras and sensors that connect them to everything around them, and the road environment will have to “incorporate the required infrastructure needed for the implementation of AVs.”

 The list of cars that come with built-in cameras is a short one. While all Tesla models are equipped with cameras in the front, rear and on both sides, only a few BMW (and Mini) models come with built-in dashcams. The same is true of some Mercedes-Benz models.

 Some Toyota and Lexus models are prewired and can be fitted with an after-market dashcam. Furthermore, some Subarus can record and store snapshot images if the pre-collision braking system or obstacle warning is activated. Images are also stored when the airbags are deployed. Still, no Subaru, Toyota or Lexus yet comes standard with a dashcam.

 The current relative lack of infrastructure poses a challenge to the rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles. However, it also represents an opportunity – and one Austin, Texas-based company is helping expand the infrastructure ecosystem necessary for AVs and connected vehicles to operate safely and efficiently on America’s roadways through an ever-growing network of partners and the continued integration of new data layers.

 The Future Of Connected Mobility

 Iteris, Inc. has created a technology ecosystem for connected smart mobility infrastructure management. The company, which recently went private through a merger with Italian information technology infrastructure and logistics provider Almaviva S.p.A., is a global leader in connected vehicle (CV) and connected vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies.

 The company manufactures a comprehensive suite of radar and video detection sensors, software and other communications devices. Its products and cloud-based monitoring solutions are incorporated into intersections and roadways in cities and states around the world.

 The Iteris platform is an end-to-end solution. Its products monitor, visualize and optimize mobility infrastructure. Its algorithms can distinguish vehicles, pedestrians and bicycles at an intersection.

 Iteris collects and analyzes data from different types of devices that can be used by CVs to better understand their operating environment. By aggregating and reporting speed, travel time, traffic volume, incident, weather and speeding outlier data both historically and in real-time, Iteris is contributing to enabling the mobility infrastructure that can help the Federal Highway Administration develop specific highway safety and congestion performance measures.

 Iteris uses a variety of proprietary scanning techniques that capture information about traffic patterns from smart devices and roadside units in a network while maintaining the device owners’ anonymity. The data it collects can be invaluable.

 It can provide real-time insights into traffic incidents, which can improve response times and situational awareness for transportation agencies. Iteris says it is creating an ecosystem that bridges software and sensors, vehicles, public and private roads and infrastructure for safer and more efficient traffic operations.

 Iteris Leverages Collaborations To Improve Safety

 Over the past several years, Iteris has worked with a number of public and private partners to provide municipalities and government agencies with the necessary design, real-time analytics and other technologies to improve mobility and ready roadways for connected and automated vehicles.

 In 2023, Iteris worked with the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and in-vehicle camera manufacturer Vizzion to verify the accuracy of crash and roadwork incidents logged in NCDOT's Traveler Information Management System.

 Their work illustrated that the use of near real-time in-vehicle camera images can enable a transportation agency to have enhanced awareness of incidents and improve the quality of logged incident data.

 Earlier that same year, Iteris partnered with HERE Technologies to create new smart mobility solutions. The integration of the two companies’ technologies helps provide greater contextual awareness to solve the dynamic, real-world traffic needs of public agencies.

 The collaboration also addresses some of the critical priorities of the National Roadway Safety Strategy and supports federal, state and local officials who ensure that roadways are safer and less congested.

 The company continued to expand its network this past year, and entered into two new agreements in June 2024. The first was with Telenav, which chose Iteris to help enhance its navigation applications. The deal integrates Iteris’ ClearData® enhanced mobility data into Telenav’s traffic and travel information application Scout Maps.

 Later that same month, Iteris struck a deal with Sumitomo Electric. The agreement resulted in Iteris’ Vantage PedSafe sensor, unique within the ITS sector because it tracks pedestrian behavior from curb to curb. Other systems detect pedestrian crossings only at the halfway point. Additionally, pedestrian speed-of-crossing data is crucial for understanding and adjusting signal timing.

 Each of these strategic alliances demonstrates that Iteris continues to ready roadways for connected and autonomous vehicles and to protect vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and bicyclists, in many environments.

 More information about Iteris is available on the company’s website.
