# Opawica Exploration Inc. Announces a Conceptual Exploration Target

VANCOUVER, B.C. - October 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Opawica Explorations Inc. (TSXV: OPW) (OTC: OPWEF) (FRA: OE5) (the “Company” or “Opawica”) is pleased is exploring for a Conceptual Exploration Target at its Bazooka Property, strategically located along the world-renowned Cadillac-Larder Lake Break (CLLB) - one of the most prolific gold-bearing structures globally.

 The Bazooka Property is adjacent to Yamana Gold’s Wasamac Project1, gold resource of, and lies within a district actively explored by major producers including Agnico Eagle Mines. This region continues to demonstrate potential for great grade gold discoveries.

 Exploration Target Overview

 The Company is exploring for a Conceptual Exploration Target of:

 - 10 to 40 million tonnes

 - Grading between 0.9 to 1.45 grams per tonne (g/t) gold

 This exploration target is based on current geological understating and historical drilling, which includes 210 drill holes totalling 51,219 meters6. The known mineralization is hosted within a 60-meter-wide zone of quartz-carbonate-sericite and talc-chlorite schists, referred to as the Main Zone, and is spatially associated with a strongly graphitic fault marking the contact between sedimentary and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks.

 The potential quantity and grade of this Exploration Target are conceptual in nature. There has not been sufficient drilling to define a mineral resource, and the current drill spacing is too limited to classify any portion of the target as an Inferred Mineral Resource. There is no certainty that further exploration will result in the delineation of a mineral resource.

 Geological Highlights

 The Cadillac-Larder Lake Break/Fault zone at Bazooka is characterized by a 20–60m-wide deformation corridor with intense alteration including carbonate, silica, fuchsite, and tourmaline.

 - Few examples of High-grade intercepts include:

 - 77.18 g/t over 5.79m (Hole BA5 )6

 - 25.77 g/t over 7.5m (Hole BZ81-3) 6

 - 5.0 g/t over 3.2m, including 9.8 g/t over 1.0m (Hole BA-03-01)6

 - 9.08 g/t over 2.11m, including 12.45 g/t over 1.0m (Hole BA-04-21)6

 - 11.46 g/t over 11.20m (Hole BRT-11-04)6

 These intercepts confirm the presence of sulphide-bearing quartz veins with visible gold, hosted within the most intensely altered zones of the Main Zone6.

 Strategic Positioning

 The Abitibi is the largest Archean greenstone belt in the world. It’s roughly 150 km the Val d’Or/Rouyn-Noranda camp the second richest gold mining district in the Abitibi.

 In addition, there is significant endowments of silver, copper, zinc and lesser quantities of lithium, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and molybdenum.
