# Introducing Dead Click Revival: New Tool Revolutionizes Remarketing Tactics With Unprecedented Identification Abilities

Dead Click Revival launched in May 2025. Just a few short months later, it's already transforming the way businesses across industries collect and use data for marketing

 MINNETONKA, MINNESOTA - October 16, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Dead Click Revival, launched in May 2025, is already reshaping how businesses identify, capture, and use visitor data to strengthen marketing and sales strategies.

 What is Dead Click Revival (DCR)? DCR is a visitor re-identification tool that begins by collecting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from website visitors. Then, the tool traces those IPs back to a real person, whose identity is now usable for sales, marketing, and operations within a business. The tool and process are fully compliant with all email and data privacy laws.

 With this tool, businesses can capture information such as names, email addresses, places of work, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles, and more–data that traditional means of gathering website analytics have not yet been able to capture.

 “We’ve been conditioned as brand owners and marketers to be okay with bare minimum data such as age, gender, and location,” said Megan Gaffney, Founder and Chief Marketing Officer of Dead Click Revival. “It's not enough anymore to be satisfied with this low level of transparency on your site.”

 Identity Resolution Leads to Strategic Action

 Dead Click Revival goes even further than identification. It’s what businesses can do with this information that’s the real meat on the bone for marketers nationwide. Leveraging more than twenty years of marketing, creative, and sales strategy, Gaffney helps each client determine: How can data from Dead Click Revival support business operations and increase ROI?

 “Dead Click Revival is an agnostic system that works around a company's operations tech stack and marketing and sales goals,” said Gaffney. “We have clients that range from very small, local service providers who individually call every lead up to multi-million-dollar enterprises who integrate their leads into existing CRMs. No matter the size of the organization, DCR provides a greater return on investment than many other digital marketing strategies, and that only compounds over time.”

 This is where remarketing comes into play. The creative arm of Dead Click Revival is Jason Smith, award-winning Creative Director and Partner of the Minnesota advertising agency Pocket Hercules. Smith helps clients align creative and executional strategies with the findings from the Dead Click Revival tool.

 “Dead Click Revival provides the lead, then Pocket Hercules crafts an engaging, resonant follow-up message to solidify the consumer relationship,” said Smith. “In the advertising industry, copywriting is a lost art, but it’s one of our biggest strengths at Pocket. When you connect with leads on an emotional level, that’s how you establish a connection.”

 Restricted industries such as cannabis, finance, firearms, or infrastructure have especially benefitted from DCR as a way to market around heavy digital advertising restrictions - but there is hardly an industry that won’t benefit from this new lead generation tool.

 “Most new ideas are born out of frustration, and that's where Dead Click came from,” said Gaffney. “I have a passion for helping business owners maximize their efforts, because I see how hard they work. They deserve more.”
