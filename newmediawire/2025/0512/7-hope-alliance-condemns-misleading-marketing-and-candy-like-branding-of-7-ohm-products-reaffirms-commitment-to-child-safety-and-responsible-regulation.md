# 7-HOPE Alliance Condemns Misleading Marketing and Candy-Like Branding of 7-OHM Products; Reaffirms Commitment to Child Safety and Responsible Regulation

Alliance Statement Calls for a ban on Deceptive Packaging and Flavor Profiles That Mimic Candy or Consumer Snacks, Warning Such Practices Undermine Public Health Efforts and Responsible Industry Standards

 LOS ANGELES, CA - May 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - 7-HOPE Alliance, (“7-HOPE”), a trailblazing nonprofit coalition dedicated to protecting legal access to 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OHM), today issued a strong public statement denouncing any marketing, branding, or sales strategies of 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OHM) products that appeal to minors, reaffirming its unwavering support for age restrictions, child-resistant packaging, and clear labeling to ensure the safety of young people.

 “Let us be absolutely clear: 7-HOPE Alliance stands firmly against any form of marketing that targets or could inadvertently attract children or adolescents,” said Jackie Subeck, Board Member of the 7-HOPE Alliance. “Of course we admittedly oppose regulations that would ban or de-facto ban 7-OHM products, as these regulations only fuel unsafe, unregulated markets and take vital wellness tools away from those who need them. But we do support strict safeguards to protect children-including 21+ age restrictions, child-resistant packaging, and bans on candy-like branding. Lawmakers should hold bad actors accountable through smart regulation, not broad bans that backfire.”

 As a science-based non-profit committed to advancing education, access, and responsible regulation of 7-OHM products, 7-HOPE believes safeguarding public health must begin with protecting young people. That means:

 * Mandatory 21+ age verification at point-of-sale (both online and in retail)
* Child-resistant packaging on all 7-OHM products
* Strict bans on “kid-friendly” packaging, including neon or bright packaging, cartoon-like branding, depictions of food or candy on packaging, or candy flavors.

 These standards are already central to the 7-HOPE’s platform, developed in consultation with researchers, healthcare providers, and consumers. As documented in multiple publications and educational materials, 7-OHM has shown promise as a harm reduction tool for adults navigating life challenges such as chronic pain, stress, and substance recovery, but it is not, and should never be, a product marketed for child or young adult use.

 Subeck added, “Our industry must lead with integrity or risk losing the opportunity to prove what science is beginning to show: that 7-OHM, when used responsibly by adults, may provide a safer alternative to far more dangerous options.”

Aligning with this stance, 7-HOPE applauds the recent decision by one of the largest manufacturers of 7-OHM products which will discontinue its line of “Ice Cream Cone” packaging. The brand has voluntarily committed to removing any candy-like branding and will focus on more adult-oriented, professional packaging moving forward as a way to show support for a safe and regulated 7-OHM market.

 “We understand the concerns raised by 7-HOPE and others in the community and recognize that our packaging choices must reflect our commitment to responsible use and safety,” said Chris Wheeler, CEO of EatOHMZ. “Discontinuing the ‘Ice Cream Cone’ line is a step towards ensuring our products are marketed responsibly, and we are proud to be part of a movement toward safer, more transparent branding.”

 This commitment, along with many others, is illustrative of the self-regulation happening within the 7-OH community and a response to a concentrated effort by 7-HOPE and other industry alliances to set important standards. 7-HOPE is committed to working with industry leaders to continue raising the bar on safety, transparency, and responsible marketing.

 7-HOPE applauds policymakers who are working to create meaningful guardrails, not blanket bans, so that bad actors can be rooted out without cutting off access to consumers who rely on 7-OHM for legitimate reasons.

 As the 7-HOPE Alliance continues its investments in safety studies, adverse event monitoring, and public education, it welcomes collaboration with state and federal lawmakers to develop and enforce child safety protections as a foundational regulatory standard.
