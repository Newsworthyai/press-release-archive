# Yuenglings Ice Cream Corp (OTC: YCRM) Files Name Change to Frequency Holdings, Inc. to Reflect Strategic Evolution Into Multi-Brand Tech Holding Company

CHICAGO, IL - May 12, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Yuenglings Ice Cream Corporation (OTC: YCRM) today announced that it has filed amended articles of incorporation with the State of Nevada to formally change its corporate name to Frequency Holdings, Inc.

 The name “Frequency” represents more than a rebrand, it’s a recalibration of vision, structure, and purpose. Inspired by the capital-first Berkshire Hathaway model and the Alphabet innovative playbook, Frequency Holdings is designed to scale a portfolio of high-impact technology ventures with clear vertical leadership, operational independence, and long-term shareholder value creation.

 “This isn’t about noise, it’s about signal,” said Rick Jordan, CEO of YCRM and founder of ReachOut. “I’ve spent my entire career tuning into where the world is going and building platforms around clarity, speed, and purpose. Frequency is the right identity for what we’re building... a company that knows how to cut through noise and deliver results.”

 ReachOut, the Company’s flagship operating subsidiary, will continue executing its high-velocity acquisition strategy across the United States, targeting IT and cybersecurity firms with $500,000 to $2 million in topline revenue. These acquisitions are strategically chosen for underserved regional markets and integrated using ReachOut’s AI-driven support model, operational playbooks, and scalable service stack.

 “ReachOut isn’t slowing down. If anything, it’s accelerating,” Jordan added. “But Frequency opens the door to more. We’re not just scaling one brand. We’re building a platform that allows us to incubate or acquire other companies in digital identity, AI, automation, and beyond. TRUSTLESS is just the beginning.”

 TRUSTLESS, Frequency’s early-stage digital identity and data verification venture, is designed to operate independently with its own leadership and capitalization path. Other synergistic ventures are under consideration for acquisition or launch within the Frequency ecosystem.

 The Company also confirmed that FINRA review for the name and symbol change is still in process, and this filing with the State of Nevada marks the formal transition of its corporate identity. The public markets will be updated accordingly once final approval is granted.

 “We’ve already changed who we are operationally. Now we’re making it official,” said Jordan. “Frequency Holdings reflects the real architecture of this business... a parent company with bold conviction, scalable subsidiaries, and a clear plan to build value the public markets can recognize.”

 The filing was submitted on Friday, May 9th, 2025 and is expected to be reflected on the state's systems later today, May 12th, or tomorrow, May 13th. Social media accounts and a landing page at frequencyhold.com are being created for release in the coming weeks.
