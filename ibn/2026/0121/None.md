# BioMedNewsBreaks — Oncotelic Therapeutics Inc.’s (OTLC) Deciparticle(TM) Platform Expands Possibilities in Immunology and Oncology

Oncotelic Therapeutics (OTCQB: OTLC) is rapidly emerging in next-generation drug delivery, with a scalable nanotechnology platform that can transform the paradigms of immunology and oncology treatments. “Leveraging Sapu Nano, the company’s clinical-stage nanomedicine, it unveiled new data at the 2025 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (‘SABCS’), highlighting that its Deciparticle(TM) platform can package even the toughest, water-resistant drugs into smaller, uniform nanoparticles that are small enough for effective and safe intravenous use,” reads a recent article. “The platform shows high-level compatibility across different therapeutic categories. All five main macrolide mTOR inhibitors, including temsirolimus, sirolimus, ridaforolimus, Everolimus (Afinitor(R)), and umirolimus, formed stable, monodisperse particles. Tacrolimus, a key drug, also forms stable nanoparticles with diameters of less than 20 nm, highlighting the platform’s ability to handle multiple drug structures. Complex peptides such as exenatide and cyclosporine A were successfully packaged, underscoring the fact that the innovation can work with both linear and cyclic peptides.”
