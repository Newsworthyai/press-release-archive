 Search Minerals (TSX.V: SMY) (OTC: SHCMF), a mine exploration and development company, was featured in a recent article that discussed its work to advance Canada’s strategically positioned rare earth portfolio. “The company controls two districts: the Port Hope Simpson – St. Lewis CREE District and the Red Wine CREE District. These properties are both located in Labrador, a mining-friendly province on the eastern edge of Canada, where Search Minerals has operated since 2009,” the piece reads. “This section of the country is part of the eastern Canadian Shield, which is home to some of the planets oldest rocks, which have gone through intense deformation, metamorphism, and glacial scouring over the years. This creates a suitable environment for mineral deposits, and the area is full of diverse types of rocks and deposits, as well… These two main districts, and the many prospects they host, provide a source of many critical rare earth elements that have the potential to shape our future. With vast exposure to a variety of rare earth elements, and a project pipeline that’s progressing, Search Minerals not only has exploration potential, but also a practical pathway to future development.”
