# RockBreaks – McEwen Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Completes Business Combination With Canadian Gold

This article has been disseminated on behalf of McEwen Inc. and may include paid advertising.

 McEwen (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) and Canadian Gold Corp. announced the completion of their previously disclosed business combination by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), pursuant to which McEwen acquired Canadian Gold. Under the terms of the arm’s-length arrangement, each Canadian Gold common share was exchanged for 0.0225 shares of McEwen common stock, following shareholder approval on Dec. 5, 2025, and final court approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. As a result of the transaction, Canadian Gold is expected to be delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange and to seek to cease being a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws, while McEwen gains full ownership of the Tartan project, which management believes offers strong exploration, development, and production restart potential.
