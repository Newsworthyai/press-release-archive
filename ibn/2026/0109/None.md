# InvestorNewsBreaks – Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) Brings Robotics to Beverage Service with BIM-E

Nightfood Holdings (OTCQB: NGTF), dba as TechForce Robotics, recently announced that the company is developing and launching a proprietary beverage dispensing robotic system called BIM-E (Beverages in Motion – Everywhere). “The system is designed to optimize both beverage revenue and service efficiency and was created to address two major challenges faced by many venues: long wait times and lost revenue caused by insufficient staff during busy periods. It reduces beverage serve time and may help capture lost revenue that often occurs when there’s not enough human servers to meet consumer demand,” an article reads. “The Beverage Bot is engineered to dispense both carbonated beverages and beer with precision, and delivers cold beverages quickly, without sacrificing consistency or quality… The company expects the solution to be especially well-suited for environments where beverage serve speed and volume are required, such as at concerts, sporting events, conferences, festivals, airports, and many others.”
