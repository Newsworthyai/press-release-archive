# BioMedNewsBreaks — Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Targets Critical Gaps in CTCL Treatment with HyBryte(TM)

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, is recognized by clinicians as one of the most difficult cancers to diagnose accurately in its early stages. A recent article discussed Soligenix’s (NASDAQ: SNGX) efforts to develop therapies aimed at addressing critical gaps in rare disease treatment, including CTCL.

 The publication reads, “Within a challenging diagnostic and treatment landscape, Soligenix is advancing a novel therapeutic approach for CTCL through its development of HyBryte(TM), also known as synthetic hypericin. HyBryte is a visible light-activated photodynamic therapy designed for the treatment of early-stage CTCL. Unlike traditional ultraviolet-based phototherapies, which can carry long-term safety risks with cumulative exposure, HyBryte is activated by visible light in the red-yellow spectrum, allowing targeted treatment of malignant T-cells in the skin while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue… Clinical data reported by Soligenix indicate that HyBryte has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in reducing CTCL lesions in patients with early-stage disease.”
