 Powermax Minerals (CSE: PMAX) (OTCQB: PWMXF), a Canadian mineral exploration company, recently completed its 2025 field exploration program at the Atikokan Rare Earth Elements property, marking a key technical milestone as the company advances its portfolio of REE-focused assets. “The property is located in the Atikokan–Ignace–White Otter Lake district of northwestern Ontario, a region with established infrastructure and a history of mineral exploration,” reads an article discussing this. “Details of the completed program were outlined in a December 17, 2025, announcement which described a systematic exploration campaign designed to evaluate the geological and geochemical potential of the Atikokan property. The 2025 field program combined geological mapping, prospecting, ground-based radiometric surveys, and geochemical sampling across several priority target areas… Geological mapping identified three principal lithological domains across the property. Block A is dominated by granodiorite to granite, while Block B consists mainly of gneissic tonalite, with granodiorite and granite appearing in its northern portion. Block C is also largely gneissic tonalite, with granodiorite and granite becoming more prominent toward the north-northeast.”
