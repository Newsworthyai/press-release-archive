 Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) is emerging as a key figure in the critical mineral solution. According to a recent article, the company is “developing a North American supply chain for rare-earth separation using its proprietary RapidSX technology and advancing plans for a commercial facility designed to reduce reliance on Chinese processing… A 2022 study by the Congressional Research Service confirmed that a single F-35 fighter jet requires approximately 920 pounds of rare-earth materials, many of which must undergo separation and magnet-manufacturing processes that currently occur almost entirely in China. New Chinese restrictions could widen this gap by cutting off access to advanced magnet manufacturing know-how, potentially affecting everything from precision-guided munitions to next-generation naval and air-defense platforms.”

 “This threat has placed renewed urgency on domestic companies, such as Ucore, that aim to rebuild processing infrastructure the U.S. allowed to atrophy over several decades… Ucore Rare Metals is central to this reshoring effort through its planned Strategic Metal Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana, where the company intends to separate mixed rare-earth concentrates into individual oxides needed for high-performance magnets. The facility is designed with a nameplate capacity of 7,500 metric tons per year of total rare-earth oxides, including up to 2,000 metric tons of neodymium-praseodymium (‘NdPr’) oxide, the primary feedstock for permanent magnets.”
