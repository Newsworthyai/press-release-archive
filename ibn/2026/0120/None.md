# TechMediaBreaks – Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) Scales AI Service Robotics to Meet Rising Commercial Demand

Nightfood Holdings (OTCQB: NGTF), operating under its TechForce Robotics platform, was featured in a recent article that discussed its intensified efforts in the AI-driven service robotics sector as automation adoption expands across foodservice, hospitality, and commercial environments. “Manufacturing readiness is a vital aspect of TechForce’s broader operational vision, especially as flagship programs mature into larger fleet deployment. The company’s Robotics-as-a-Service (‘RaaS’) model is created to catalyze scalable rollouts, recurring revenue, and ongoing support, positioning the company to meet the needs of customers across locations,” reads the article.

 “A key strategic development for TechForce Robotics is its recent efforts to expand manufacturing capacity in anticipation of increased demand. Although NGTF’s current manufacturing partner in China has helped early product rollouts and delivered initial units to market, the company is now focusing on a parallel manufacturing strategy targeted at onboarding a larger, globally viable manufacturing partner. This move is aimed at supporting higher-volume deployments, quicker delivery timelines, and better supply-chain resilience as interest from multi-location and enterprise customers rises.”
