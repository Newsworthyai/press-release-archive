 About Advisors Mortgage Group LLC

 With big dreams and even more determination, Advisors Mortgage Group was founded in October 1999 by a single loan officer in a 400-square-foot office in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. In the years since its formation, Advisors has grown to serve not only the greater New Jersey area, but also a vast portion of the United States. With branch offices up and down the East Coast and its corporate office in Ocean Township, New Jersey, Advisors has established itself as a pillar of excellence in the mortgage industry. Its immense experience is its greatest asset and the foundation of the success of the company and every Advisors’ branch and loan officer. In 2005, Advisors Mortgage Group was designated by the Federal Housing Authority as a Full Eagle FHA Underwriter. As a Full Eagle, Advisors has been able to expand its loan volume by approving loans, which a majority of the competition could not dream of. Advisors has built a platform for a seamless and stress-free mortgage process for all of its customers and carries that same mission throughout all of its offices. Advisors Mortgage understands that success cannot be attained without teamwork and communication, two of the company’s most important strengths.
