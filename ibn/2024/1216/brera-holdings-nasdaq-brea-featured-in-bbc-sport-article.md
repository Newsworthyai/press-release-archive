# Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA) Featured in BBC Sport Article

Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA), a publicly traded company focused on multi-club ownership of international football teams, was featured in a recent BBC Sport article. The publication discusses Chris Gardner, part of Brera’s dynamic team, the depiction of Gardner’s real-life struggle in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, and how a sequel “might just include the 70-year-old American’s latest venture into football as part of a unique multi-club ownership model, one with a social conscience.”

 “Originally founded in Milan, Brera Holdings just added Serie B side Juve Stabia in the south of Italy to a growing portfolio that includes clubs in North Macedonia, Mozambique and Mongolia… Gardner, now a motivational speaker and philanthropist after making his millions in the stock market, is part of an eclectic team at Brera. They include, in various roles, former footballers Giuseppe Rossi and Goran Pandev, Massimo Ferragamo – the son of illustrious Italian shoe designer, Salvatore – MLS founder Alan Rothenberg and a number of high-profile banking and financial experts.

 “One of, if not the most successful sports operations in the world, is the English Premier League. I am not going to get invited to sit at the table with the guys from Manchester United or Chelsea. But what we could do, we could build our own table and start from the ground up,” Gardner tells BBC Sport. He further discusses Brera’s hope to attract sports fans who believe in the philosophy of multi-club ownership and social impact, “giving the opportunity to folks who don’t have that kind of money to say, ‘I want to participate, I believe in the concept, I believe in the vision, I want to be a part of it’. That’s bigger!”
