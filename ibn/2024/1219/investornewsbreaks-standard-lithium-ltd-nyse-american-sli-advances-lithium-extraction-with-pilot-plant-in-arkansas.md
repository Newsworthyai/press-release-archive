# InvestorNewsBreaks – Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI) Advances Lithium Extraction with Pilot Plant in Arkansas

Standard Lithium (NYSE American: SLI), in partnership with Equinor ASA through their joint venture SWA Lithium, has successfully launched a pilot Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) plant at its South West Arkansas Project. The pilot plant, developed in collaboration with Koch Technology Solutions (“KTS”), is processing brine directly from the site to refine engineering parameters and produce battery-quality lithium carbonate for qualification with potential off-take partners. Utilizing KTS’s proprietary Li-Pro Lithium Selective Sorption technology, the pilot represents a crucial step in Standard Lithium’s journey toward building its first commercial lithium facility. The plant is expected to generate 1,000 gallons of lithium chloride solution for conversion into 30 kg of battery-grade lithium carbonate, which will aid in vendor selection and off-take agreements. This initiative highlights Standard Lithium’s leadership in developing North America’s first lithium-from-brine project in over 50 years, strengthening its position as an innovator in the clean energy market.
