# McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Poised to Tap Explosive Growth of AI Industry

McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) is positioned for opportunity as artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the landscape of economies around the world. “Estimates indicate that generative AI alone will triple its growth to a total market value of $1.3 trillion in the next decade… As most investors know by now, there is a surge in the demand for energy-guzzling data centers that are designed to develop and train AI systems. They also know that advanced semiconductor chips are at the heart of all AI technologies. However, many haven’t considered that critical minerals, such as copper, gold and silver, are vital components of this burgeoning industry,” reads a recent article.

 “McEwen Mining is well poised to benefit from the tailwinds arising from the explosive growth of the AI industry. For example, the company has a large exposure to copper through its subsidiary, McEwen Copper, owner of the Los Azules copper deposit in Argentina, which is one of the world’s largest and most economically robust undeveloped copper projects.

 “Given the skyrocketing demand for copper and the anticipated supply shortages in the coming decades, McEwen’s copper resource alone could be a game-changer. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and the drive to develop critical metals’ supply lines outside of those controlled by China and its allies makes the gold and silver extraction operations of McEwen Mining in the Americas better positioned to tap the AI revolution for years and decades to come.”
