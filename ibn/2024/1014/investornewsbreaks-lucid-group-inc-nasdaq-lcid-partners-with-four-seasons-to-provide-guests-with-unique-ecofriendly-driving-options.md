# InvestorNewsBreaks – Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) Partners with Four Seasons to Provide Guests with Unique, Ecofriendly Driving Options

Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID), maker of the world’s most-advanced electric vehicles, is teaming up with Four Seasons hotels and resorts to offer complimentary cars for guest use at select locations. The collaboration begins this month and underscores the commitment both companies have for environmental stewardship as well as providing guests with flexible, unique, ecofriendly experiences during their stays. Guests can either reserve a Lucid vehicle for a complimentary driving experience or enjoy a chauffeured Lucid house car, based on availability.

 In addition, Lucid is providing electric vehicle chargers, which are compatible with other electric vehicle types and will be available for both hotel guests and community members to conveniently charge their own vehicles. The program will begin this fall at select locations in the United States with additional properties in North America, Europe and the Middle East to be added in coming months.

 “Every time guests step into a Lucid Air, they will be welcomed by a meticulously crafted interior, elegant design and a driving experience that is unmatched by any other vehicle on the road today,” said Lucid Group CEO Peter Rawlinson in the press release. “Through this partnership, the world’s most advanced electric vehicle will now be available as a guest amenity, further enhancing the travel experience at Four Seasons properties across the globe.”
