Meta (NASDAQ: META), known for its social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, is taking significant steps to address online safety concerns. The company is launching a campaign to combat “sextortion,” a form of online exploitation. Antigone Davis, Meta’s Global Head of Safety, has announced new features aimed at helping parents protect their children online.

 These new safety features are part of Meta’s broader strategy to enhance user safety across its platforms. By focusing on safeguarding children, Meta aims to create a safer online environment. This initiative reflects the company’s commitment to addressing critical safety issues that affect its users.

 Despite these efforts, Meta’s stock performance remains strong. Today, the stock reached a high of approximately $584 on the NASDAQ. This indicates investor confidence in the company’s ability to manage safety concerns while maintaining its market position.

 Meta’s proactive approach to user safety could positively impact its reputation and user trust. As the company continues to implement these safety measures, it may further strengthen its standing in the competitive social media landscape.
