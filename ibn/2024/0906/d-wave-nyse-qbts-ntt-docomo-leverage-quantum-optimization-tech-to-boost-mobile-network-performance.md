# D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS), NTT DOCOMO Leverage Quantum Optimization Tech to Boost Mobile Network Performance

* A pilot project with Japan’s largest mobile service provider showed that the deployment of D-Wave’s annealing quantum computing solutions improved mobile network performance by 15%.
* D-Wave’s hybrid solver was able to process a task in just 40 seconds, compared to 27 hours with a general-purpose solver.
* The project demonstrated a significant reduction in signal congestion across base stations, which can potentially lead to more efficient transmission and cost savings.
* This collaboration marks an important step in applying and further integrating quantum computing in telecommunications.

 D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, and the first commercial provider of quantum computers, announced the results of a quantum optimization pilot project with Japan’s mobile phone operator NTT DOCOMO Inc. (“DOCOMO”), showing demonstrable improvements in mobile network performance (https://ibn.fm/JTeGD).

 During the pilot program, DOCOMO, which is the largest mobile service provider in Japan with over 90 million subscriptions, found that decreasing paging signals during peak calling times by 15% can reduce congestion at base stations. This can potentially lead to improved efficiencies and lower…
