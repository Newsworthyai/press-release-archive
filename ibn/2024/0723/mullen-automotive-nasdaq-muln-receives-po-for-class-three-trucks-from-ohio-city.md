# Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) Receives PO for Class Three Trucks from Ohio City

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, has received a municipal purchase for its Class 3 electric truck from the city of Dublin, Ohio. City officials noted that the Mullen Three is a “perfect application” as the city works to transition to electric vehicles; the city has been consistently listed as a top fleet among the 100 Best Green Fleets, ranked by the National Fleet Management Association Awards. In addition to this most recent order, Mullen is in discussions with multiple government agencies regarding orders for both its Class One and Three vehicles; the company anticipates receiving additional orders during the current fiscal quarter. The Mullen Three qualifies for a $15,000 incentive through the Massachusetts MOR-EV program and a $45,000 cash rebate voucher through the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Program. “We are thrilled to partner with the city of Dublin as they continue to lead the way for cities in adopting sustainable solutions,” said Mullen Automotive CEO David Michery in the press release. “Mullen is currently negotiating with multiple government agencies to provide its all-electric Class One and Three vehicles and will be announcing additional orders over the current fiscal quarter.”
