# Lexaria (NASDAQ: LEXX) Announces Positive Interim Animal Study Results on DehydraTECH-CBD in Diabetes Control

Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX, LEXXW), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, today announced receipt of blood glucose results from weeks 4 and 8 of its ongoing animal study WEIGHT-A24-1. The study is underway using diabetic, pre-conditioned Zucker rats. The results showed that DehydraTECH-liraglutide (Group H) and two DehydraTECH-CBD formulations (Groups A and B) were the top performers in the study at day 56, reducing blood sugar levels by 2.50%, 1.90% and 1.53% respectively. These results appear to support Lexaria’s belief that DehydraTECH-CBD may have utility, particularly if used together with a GLP-1 drug, in diabetic control.

 Additionally, select DehydraTECH-CBD formulations showed apparent superiority to DehydraTECH-GLP-1 at 4 and 8 weeks, while DehydraTECH-liraglutide showed apparent superiority to DehydraTECH-semaglutide. Animal testing of the combination of DehydraTECH-CBD with DehydraTECH-GLP-1 drugs is ongoing and in the final phases of the study, with additional results expected soon.
