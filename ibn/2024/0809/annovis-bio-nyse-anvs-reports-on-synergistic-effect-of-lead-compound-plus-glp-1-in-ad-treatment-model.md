# Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS) Reports on ‘Synergistic Effect’ of Lead Compound Plus GLP-1 in AD Treatment Model

Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS), a late-stage, clinical-drug platform company pioneering transformative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), is reporting new preclinical data regarding buntanetap, its lead compound. According to the report, the date demonstrates the synergistic effect of buntanetap when combined with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) agonist dulaglutide (Trulicity[R]) in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.

 The announcement noted that the Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostics and Therapeutics Market size is projected to reach $7.7 billion this year and grow to $10.1 billion by 2029. Major factors contributing to that growth include the increasing use of biomarkers in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and drug development and the rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s worldwide, the article observed. Active biotech, pharma companies interested in these markets this week include Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS).

 “In 2018, Annovis Bio published data showing that buntanetap fully restored memory, learning and synaptic potentiation in an Alzheimer’s mouse model,” the article stated. “Building on this research, Annovis recently investigated whether combining buntanetap with the GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide would produce a synergistic effect in the same animal model. The results were compelling: while buntanetap alone restored cognitive function to 100% and dulaglutide alone to 80%, the combination of these two compounds not only restored cognitive function but also enhanced it beyond levels seen in healthy controls.”
