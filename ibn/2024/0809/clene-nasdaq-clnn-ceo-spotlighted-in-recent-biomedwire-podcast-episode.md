# Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) CEO Spotlighted in Recent BioMedWire Podcast Episode

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN), a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving mitochondrial health and protecting neuronal function to treat neurodegenerative diseases, was featured in the latest episode of the BioMedWire Podcast, which is part of a sustained effort by IBN (Investor Brand Network) to provide specialized content distribution via widespread syndication channels. During the episode, Clene CEO and president Rob Etherington talks with IBN’s Carmel Fisher about the company’s mission, including its novel approach to the treatment of diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and multiple sclerosis (“MS”).

 “Clene Inc. is focused entirely on improving mitochondrial health and protecting neuron function,” said Clene CEO and president Rob Etherington in the press release. “We’re pioneering a very unique approach: the use of an oral suspension that patients can drink to treat the deficits that they might have if afflicted with one of these devastating neurodegenerative diseases. . . . Our drug enables the energetic capacity that those muscles require to function and, in the case of ALS, enables the main systems, primarily breathing, to be muscularly sustained so patients potentially have increased rates of survival, as our data suggests.”
