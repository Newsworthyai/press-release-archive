# InvestorNewsBreaks – Emperor Metals Inc. (CSE: AUOZ) (OTCQB: EMAUF) (FRA:9NH) Initial 2024 Drilling Results Support Expansion of Conceptual Open-Pit Gold Resource

Emperor Metals (CSE: AUOZ) (OTCQB: EMAUF) (FRA:9NH) has released initial results from its 2024 drilling campaign at the Duquesne West Gold Project, revealing promising potential for resource expansion in its open-pit model. The first three holes of the 19-hole program intersected significant low-grade gold mineralization near surface, with highlights including 52.1 meters at 0.8 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, which includes a higher-grade interval. CEO John Florek noted these findings demonstrate untapped potential in the project’s conceptual open-pit model, which aims to incorporate lower-grade bulk tonnage and maximize near-surface ounces for a resource estimate expected in Q1 2025. The program, designed to expand the mineralized zones and explore new areas, shows promise for increasing the deposit’s overall economic viability.
