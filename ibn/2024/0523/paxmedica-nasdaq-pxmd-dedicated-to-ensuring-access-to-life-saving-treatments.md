PaxMedica (NASDAQ: PXMD), a renowned biopharmaceutical company specializing in treatments for neurological disorders, recently took swift action to address a pressing medical situation unfolding in Malawi, East Africa. “The Ministry of Health (‘MOH’) of Malawi has issued a plea for access to IV suramin, a vital medication in combating the life-threatening sleeping sickness crisis affecting the region.
