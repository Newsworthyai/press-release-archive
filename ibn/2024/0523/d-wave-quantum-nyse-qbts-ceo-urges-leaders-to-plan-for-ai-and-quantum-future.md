# D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) CEO Urges Leaders to Plan for AI and Quantum Future

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, today announced that Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, has published a new guest column as part of the Forbes Technology Council that calls upon business leaders to immediately prioritize the exploration of quantum computing as they continue to accelerate their artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.

 In his column, Dr. Baratz explains that as AI continues to advance, it also consumes significant amounts of energy, and quantum computing could be used to identify and develop more powerful and sustainable AI models.

 “With sustainability now an added business imperative, the combination of quantum with AI could help organizations forecast demand more precisely and align production, minimizing the creation of excess goods and reducing waste through the supply chain,” Dr. Baratz wrote. “By using quantum to optimize routing, production and inventory management based on AI-powered forecasting, quantum and AI together could help organizations reduce the need for transportation and storage, reducing costs and carbon emissions.”
