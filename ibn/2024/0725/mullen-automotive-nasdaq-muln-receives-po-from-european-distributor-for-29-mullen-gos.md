# Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) Receives PO from European Distributor for 29 Mullen GOs

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, has received an order for 29 Mullen GOS from one of its newest European distribution partners. The order for the GOs, which are Mullen’s commercial micro-urban-delivery vehicle, came from GAMA, which is a distribution partner covering southeast Europe, including the Balkans Region. The order from GAMA, which is valued at $304,000, is part of a previously announced 53-unit commercial vehicle order; that order is for urban delivery vehicles as well as Mullen One and Mullen Three commercial EV cargo vans and trucks, which have not yet been delivered. The compact design of the Mullen-GO makes it an ideal vehicle “bridge the gap between the growing demand for quick deliveries and space constraints in dense cities throughout Europe,” the company noted. “GAMA is seeing strong interest in our commercial EVs, and we are delighted to begin vehicle deliveries in the Balkans region,” said Mullen Automotive CEO and chair David Michery in the press release. “As highlighted previously, the Mullen GO is the perfect micro urban delivery vehicle for small and congested old world European streets.”
