# Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS) Receives US Patent for Methods of Treating Acute Traumatic Brain Injury

Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS), a late-stage, drug-platform company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), today announced the receipt of U.S. Patent No. 12,042,482. The patent covers methods of treating acute traumatic brain injuries (“TBI”) and preventing nerve cell death with its lead drug candidate, buntanetap. Buntanetap (formerly known as Posiphen or ANVS401) targets neurodegeneration by inhibiting the formation of multiple neurotoxic proteins, including amyloid beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, and TDP43. This improves synaptic transmission, axonal transport, and reduces neuroinflammation. “We are thrilled to achieve this significant milestone for buntanetap,” said Maria Maccecchini, Ph.D., Founder, President and CEO of Annovis. “Nerve cell death is a common underlying factor in many brain conditions, beyond just Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Our preclinical studies in TBI and stroke animal models have demonstrated buntanetap’s efficacy in preventing cell death and loss of function, and it is our duty to explore its potential benefits for victims of brain trauma, a prevalent issue in the U.S.”
