# SuperCom (NASDAQ: SPCB) Wins New Contract to Provide Rehabilitative Services to Juveniles

SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ: SPCB), an identification and digital monitoring solutions company, recently secured a new contract for monitoring juveniles transitioning through California’s justice system. “The case management services will be provided for the California client through SuperCom’s fully owned subsidiary, Leaders in Community Alternatives (“LCA”), which provides evidence-based, community-focused services and electronic monitoring programs as a private contractor to government agencies. The California contract reflects a trend worldwide for court and law enforcement advocates to seek privately contracted rehabilitative service and electronic monitoring (‘EM’) solutions providers that allow teen suspects to enjoy a measure of freedom and community integration while under court supervision, with the hope of reducing recidivism,” a recent article reads. “This new contract allows us to expand our reach and offer our services to a new community,” SuperCom President and CEO Ordan Trabelsi is quoted as saying. “With this new project, SuperCom continues to strengthen its position as a leader in providing rehabilitative services and secure solutions.”
