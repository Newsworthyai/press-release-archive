# Lexaria (NASDAQ: LEXX) Announces Noteworthy Findings from Interim Results of Ongoing Diabetes Animal Study

Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX, LEXXW), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, today announced the receipt of interim results from the first four weeks of dosing in its ongoing diabetes animal study WEIGHT-A24-1. The company noted that the results have already produced several noteworthy findings. According to the announcement, unlimited food and water have been provided to the animals for the entire duration of the study. During the initial acclimation phase, which spanned 34 days before the beginning of dosing, the animals gained 10.9% body weight on average. During the subsequent 28 days of DehydraTECH-processed drug therapy dosing, all test articles showed either a stark decrease in the rate of body weight gain or, in select cases, the beginning of body weight reduction. Lexaria noted that DehydraTECH-CBD formulation 3 (“CBD3”) and DehydraTECH-liraglutide produced the largest weight loss results thus far -1.50% and -1.58% body weight reduction, respectively. This is the first time the company has applied DehydraTECH processing to the GLP-1 drug liraglutide. Lexaria is encouraged to witness its relative outperformance, which suggests that DehydraTECH appears to work with a second GLP-1 drug after semaglutide. In addition, DehydraTECH appears to be working with semaglutide both with and without the sodium salcaprozate (“SNAC”) technology. The announcement noted that only in study arms A, B, C, and E did any individual animals lose 5.0% or more body weight during the first 28 days of treatment. An additional 56 days of dosing remains across all treatment groups. According to the announcement, dosing in the final four study arms that constitute Cohort 2 of the study has begun and is expected to be completed in mid-October. Cohort 2 includes the best performers from Cohort 1 of the study, which comprises the first eight study arms.
