# Mullen (NASDAQ: MULN) Expands U.S. Battery Manufacturing with Updated DOE Proposal

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) has submitted a revised plan to the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to bolster domestic battery production at its Mishawaka, Indiana, and Fullerton, California, facilities. The company has invested $12 million to date, with an additional $43 million planned, seeking $55 million in matching DOE funds under a program funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Mullen’s plan prioritizes high-volume battery production at Mishawaka, a former GM Hummer facility, which will be upgraded to a capacity of 108,000 battery systems annually. Fullerton will focus on research, development, and prototype production. Mullen’s strategic acquisitions and infrastructure investments position the company as a leader in U.S. advanced battery manufacturing, aligning with DOE goals to expand clean energy production. First production units are set for delivery in mid-2025, with additional lines launching in subsequent years.
