Standard Lithium (NYSE American: SLI), in partnership with Equinor through its SWA Lithium joint venture, has entered into a license agreement with Koch Technology Solutions (“KTS”) to utilize KTS’s Li-Pro Lithium Selective Sorption (LSS) technology at the South West Arkansas Project’s commercial plant. This agreement grants Standard Lithium access to KTS’s advanced lithium recovery solution with performance guarantees, including a 95% lithium recovery rate and over 99% rejection of impurities like calcium and sodium, enabling cost-effective, high-purity lithium extraction.
