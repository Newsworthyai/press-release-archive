# Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) Receives Follow-On Order from UVA

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, has received an order for one Mullen One, a Class 1 EV cargo van, from the University of Virginia for the school’s fleet of commercial vehicles. According to the announcement, the order, which follows an earlier purchase the university made last year, will be fulfilled by Mullen’s commercial retail dealer partner, Randy Marion Automotive Group (“RMA”).

 The company also noted that it recently received a $7.7 million, 180-vehicle order from its dealer partner Eco Auto. The two orders represent a growing demand for Mullen’s electric commercial vehicles, the announcement pointed out. The company’s commercial EV lineup supports sustainability targets that many universities are working toward. Specifically, UVA is actively working to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and fossil fuel independence by 2050, as well as reduce nitrogen losses by 30% by 2030.

 “We are proud to partner with the University of Virginia in their mission to create a more sustainable campus,” said Mullen Automotive CEO and chair David Michery in the press release. “We’re seeing a significant and growing demand for electric vehicles in the higher education sectors as universities lead the transition to clean energy. We are confident that our vehicles will contribute significantly to UVA’s sustainability initiatives.”
