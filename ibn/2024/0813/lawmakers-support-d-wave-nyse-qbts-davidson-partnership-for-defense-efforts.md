# Lawmakers Support D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS), Davidson Partnership for Defense Efforts

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, and Davidson Technologies received strong support from local and federal lawmakers at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium that was held on August 6th for bringing advanced quantum computing to Alabama.

 Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle joined D-Wave and Davidson to emphasize the strategic significance of placing a D-Wave quantum computer at Davidson’s new global headquarters in Huntsville, AL. D-Wave’s state-of-the-art Advantage quantum computing system is expected to be installed at Davidson’s headquarters in 2025, with this forthcoming installation marking a major milestone in the country’s quantum computing leadership.

 “As Congress continues to task the Department of Defense with adopting quantum computing technologies to solve problems in the near-term, we believe this system will play an essential role for government agencies’ use case identification, application development, and workforce training,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “Davidson is well known for developing applications that use emerging technologies to safeguard the nation, and we are excited to engage with Davidson and the larger Alabama community to apply quantum technologies in support of national security efforts.”
