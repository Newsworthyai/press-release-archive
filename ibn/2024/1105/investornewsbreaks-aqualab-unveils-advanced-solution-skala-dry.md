# InvestorNewsBreaks – AQUALAB Unveils Advanced Solution – SKALA Dry

AQUALAB by Addium today introduced SKALA Dry, an advanced software solution designed to dramatically enhance the capabilities of spray dryers, continuous lines and other industrial dryers. SKALA Dry is a powerful upgrade for food processing operations that need to maintain the highest levels of operational efficiency and product quality. Utilizing PLC temperature data, SKALA Dry is able to make intelligent set point adjustments before products leave the dryer, giving users significantly improved moisture control, less product variability and more profit. “Without a way to measure what’s happening inside your dryer, all you can do is react to problems after they’ve happened – not respond to changes as they happen,” said Takuya Ohki, executive vice president at Addium.
