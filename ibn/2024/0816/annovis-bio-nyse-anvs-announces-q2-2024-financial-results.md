# Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS) Announces Q2 2024 Financial Results

Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS), a late-stage, drug-platform company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), today released financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024, and provided a business update. According to the update, results from the company’s completed Phase 2/3 AD study showed that buntanetap significantly improved cognition in patients with early AD. Additionally, data from its Phase 3 PD study revealed that buntanetap led to improvements in both the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (“MDS-UPDRS”) and cognition across several PD subpopulations. The company also discussed the filing of patents, team updates, and other achievements.

 “The recent months have been productive for our company,” said Maria Maccecchini, Ph.D., Founder, President and CEO of Annovis Bio. “We’ve completed pivotal Phase 2/3 Alzheimer’s and Phase 3 Parkinson’s studies, both of which revealed very encouraging data for buntanetap. Additionally, we’ve introduced a new crystalline form of buntanetap with improved properties, further strengthening our IP portfolio.
