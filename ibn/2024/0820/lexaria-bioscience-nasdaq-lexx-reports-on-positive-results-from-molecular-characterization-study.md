# Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX) Reports on Positive Results from Molecular Characterization Study

Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX, LEXXW), a global innovator in drug-delivery platforms, has released a report noting the positive findings from its applied research program. The program, which evaluated important mode of action facets of DehydraTECH(TM) processed with semaglutide, the glucagon-peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) drug, was conducted with the National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”).

 According to the company, the program was designed to examine the molecular properties of DehydraTECH-processed pure semaglutide in comparison to the commercially available semaglutide formulation Rybelsus(R). The program used simulated gastric fluid in order to mimic conditions in the human gut. Several testing methods were used, including polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (“PAGE”), size exclusion chromatography (“SEC”), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (“ESI-LCMS”) and dynamic light scattering (“DLS”).

 “Findings from the PAGE and SEC analyses in particular clearly showed not only that semaglutide was efficiently released in the simulated gastric fluid environment with each of two formulations tested, but also that the semaglutide in both formulations was likely in monomeric form,” stated the company in the press release. “This result is compelling because the available published literature describing Rybelsus notes that it occurs in simple monomeric form in the human gut due to its proprietary salcaprozate sodium (“SNAC”) ingredient chemistry.”
