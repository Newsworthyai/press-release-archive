# Mullen (NASDAQ: MULN) Developing Zero-Emissions Version of PowerUP Mobile EV-Charging Truck

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, is developing a zero-emissions version of its mobile EV-charging solution, PowerUP. The solution will be available on Mullen’s Class 3 all-electric cab chassis truck. According to the announcement, PowerUp provides increased versatility and 100% zero emissions power generation that can deliver on-demand, mobile DC fast-charging. The company noted that the shift to a 100% zero-emission model represents its commitment to sustainable transportation solutions while also meeting overwhelming market demand for zero-emission options in the mobile EV-charging space. First introduced in 2023 as a mobile EV-charging truck, the original model utilized a gasoline Class 5 cab chassis platform and a dual-fuel (propane/natural gas) power generation unit. The new zero-emissions PowerUP system offers significant improvements in charging capabilities and versatility and is available with multiple platform integration and scaling options including the Mullen THREE Class 3 cab chassis truck. The PowerUP is being developed at Mullen’s California-based high-energy facility, which is producing the next-generation of American-made EV battery packs. The addition of PowerUP to its lineup aligns with Mullen’s vision of creating a comprehensive electric-vehicle ecosystem built in the United States. “We’re constantly innovating and adapting to meet the evolving needs of the industry,” said Mullen Automotive CEO and chair David Michery in the press release. “The feedback on the initial PowerUP concept was overwhelmingly positive, but the market is clearly looking for a zero-emission solution. By leveraging our all-electric Mullen THREE, the new PowerUP delivers recharging at a higher level of scalability and performance while offering zero emissions for both the vehicle and power unit.”
