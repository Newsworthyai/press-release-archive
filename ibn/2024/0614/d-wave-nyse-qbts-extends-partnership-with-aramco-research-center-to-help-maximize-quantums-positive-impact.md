# D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS) Extends Partnership with Aramco Research Center to Help Maximize Quantum’s Positive Impact

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, has extended its agreement with Aramco, a global integrated energy and chemicals company, to manage geophysical optimization problems through D-Wave’s quantum technologies. For the past two years, the Aramco Research Center in Delft, the Netherlands, has been working with D-Wave’s powerful quantum technologies on solving highly complex optimization problems involved in computationally intensive seismic imaging, an ultrasound-like technology used to map the various geological strata many kilometers below the surface. Using D-Wave’s quantum technologies, the Aramco Research Center, which is focused on developing advanced computing technologies to help address global energy challenges, has seen performance gains over classical computers in both time-to-solution and scale.

 “Together with Aramco, we are demonstrating our quantum technology’s ability to take on core data challenges in geophysical research. We look forward to helping Aramco researchers maximize quantum’s positive impact on their computational challenges as they look to turn data into usable knowledge of the subsurface,” said Trevor Lanting, D-Wave’s Chief Development Officer.
