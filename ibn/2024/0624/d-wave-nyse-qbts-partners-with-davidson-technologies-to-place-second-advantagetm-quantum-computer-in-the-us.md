# D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS) Partners with Davidson Technologies to Place Second Advantage™ Quantum Computer in the US

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, and the world’s first commercial supplier of quantum computers, has announced the planned placement of the second U.S.-based D-Wave Advantage quantum computer.

 According to the announcement, the D-Wave Advantage system will be located at Davidson Technologies’ new global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama and could be the first in the United States that is certified for sensitive applications using annealing quantum computing. It is anticipated that the system could advance quantum’s role in national security and support the critical mission of defending the United States and its allies, both at home and abroad.

 “Davidson has a track record of embracing emerging and advanced technologies to address unique and critical national defense challenges and protect our nation’s interests,” said D-Wave Quantum CEO Dr. Alan Baratz in the press release. “By placing an Advantage quantum computing system onsite at Davidson’s headquarters and creating a unique operating environment, we’re opening up opportunities to tackle the US government’s most pressing computational problems.”

 In addition, D-Wave is reporting the results of a new study it commissioned with Hyperion Research, which revealed that a majority of surveyed businesses that are currently actively using quantum computing anticipate an “exceptional return on investment” (ROI) from their quantum optimization efforts. Specifically, the study reports an expected combined potential positive financial impact from quantum optimization investments, totaling up to an estimated $51.5 billion return for the surveyed organizations. The results, which were announced at D-Wave’s global Qubits 2024 user conference, polled more than 300 organizations in the United States and the European Union.

 “In my view, the data is clear: quantum computing has arrived as a critical business imperative,” said Dr. Baratz in the press release. “Those who proactively embrace this technology and invest in optimization efforts stand to reap significant rewards. The anticipated gains and ROI projections paint a compelling picture of a possible near-term future where quantum computing becomes a fundamental driver of business success.”
