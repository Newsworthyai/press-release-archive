# Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) Presents Preliminary Data Demonstrating Potential of CNM-Au8(R) for Rett Syndrome

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) (along with its subsidiaries, “Clene”) and its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving mitochondrial health and protecting neuronal function to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). Clene today announced that Karen Ho, Ph.D., the company’s vice president of translational medicine, presented new, preliminary data demonstrating the potential of CNM-Au8(R) as a treatment for Rett Syndrome, a severe, rare pediatric neurologic disorder. Dr. Ho unveiled the data in oral and poster presentations on June 19 at the International Rett Syndrome Foundation 2024 Annual Meeting in Westminster, Colorado. According to the announcement, CNM-Au8 demonstrated neuroprotective effects in an in vitro model of Rett Syndrome. Additionally, CNM-Au8 demonstrated rescue of mitochondrial deficits in induced astrocytes derived from Rett patients. “These preliminary data suggest that CNM-Au8 may treat Rett Syndrome by potential rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby promoting neuronal health, survival, and synaptic structure. If CNM-Au8 proves to be a successful treatment for Rett syndrome, this will add further affirmation to Clene’s central thesis: that CNM-Au8 – with its versatile and unique catalytic mechanism – holds promise as a potential treatment for multiple diseases of the nervous system, beyond its current targets of ALS and MS. It’s a truly rewarding time to participate in the development of CNM-Au8, which has strong potential to make a difference to the millions of people living with difficult-to-treat neurologic diseases,” said Dr. Ho.
