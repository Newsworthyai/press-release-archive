# InvestorNewsBreaks – SportLync, Inc. Changes Name, Raises Crowdfunding Ceiling to Drive Evolution to Multisport Platform

SportLync, formerly known as GolfLync, today announced a change in its name from GolfLync to SportLync, Inc., as well as an increase in its crowdfunding goal to $5 million. The capital raise, initially launched to allow users and supporters to invest in the platform, is part of a larger strategy to expand the company’s unique social networking model beyond golf to other sports. While the GolfLync app will continue to connect golf players across the country, SportLync is working on plans to bring similar community experiences to fans and athletes in other sports.

 “We launched our crowdfunding campaign to give our loyal users a chance to participate directly in our growth and success,” said Noah DiPasquale, CEO of SportLync. “Our transition to SportLync, Inc. represents the start of our evolution into a multisport platform, and raising our funding goal is a vital step toward making this vision a reality. This campaign is about inviting our users to help shape the future of sports connections.”
