# InvestorNewsBreaks – Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: TNXP) Publishes Promising Data on TNX-801 Vaccine for Mpox and Smallpox

Tonix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TNXP) has published new data in mSphere demonstrating that TNX-801, a recombinant chimeric horsepox virus vaccine, shows significantly reduced virulence compared to traditional vaccinia vaccines and provides protection against Clade Ia monkeypox in preclinical studies. With the World Health Organization declaring new public health emergencies for Clade Ib and IIb mpox, Tonix is positioning TNX-801 as a single-dose vaccine candidate aimed at durable protection against these outbreaks. Tonix is advancing TNX-801’s development with FDA feedback, collaborations for large-scale manufacturing, and planned clinical trials in Kenya, believing its vaccine could offer broad, long-lasting immunity against both mpox and smallpox.
