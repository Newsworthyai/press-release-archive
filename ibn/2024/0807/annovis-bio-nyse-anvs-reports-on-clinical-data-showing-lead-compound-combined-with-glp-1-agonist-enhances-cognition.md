# Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS) Reports on Clinical Data Showing Lead Compound Combined with GLP-1 Agonist Enhances Cognition

Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS), a late-stage, clinical-drug platform company pioneering transformative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), is reporting preclinical data regarding its lead compound, buntanetap. According to the announcement, the results show the synergistic effect of buntanetap when combined with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) agonist dulaglutide (Trulicity[R]) in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.

 Based on data gathered in 2018 showing that buntanetap fully restored memory, learning and synaptic potentiation in an Alzheimer’s mouse model, Annovis recently studied whether buntanetap combined with the GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide produced a synergistic effect in the same animal model. Calling the results “compelling,” the company reported that while buntanetap alone restored cognitive function to 100%, the two compounds together enhanced cognitive function beyond levels seen in healthy controls.

 “We are excited to see that buntanetap significantly amplifies the effects of dulaglutide on memory and learning, with a 6- to 10-fold increase in efficacy,” said Annovis Bio founder, president and CEO Maria Maccecchini, PhD, in the press release. “This synergy is particularly important for enhancing treatment outcomes while minimizing potential side effects. As the field of Alzheimer’s research shifts towards combination therapies, we believe our approach holds great promise for offering more effective treatment options for patients.”
