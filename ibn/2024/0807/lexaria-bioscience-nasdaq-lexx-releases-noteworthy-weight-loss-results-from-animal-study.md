# Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX) Releases “Noteworthy” Weight-Loss Results from Animal Study

Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX, LEXXW), a global innovator in drug-delivery platforms, is reporting recent results from its WEIGHT-A24-1 animal study. A recent article notes that interim results, which are based on the first 28 days of dosing, are “noteworthy,” including all animals showing either a noticeable decrease in the rate of body weight gain or the beginning of weight reduction. According to the article, the study was designed to the impact of Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology on glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) drugs for the potential treatment of diabetes and weight loss; the article noted that this study marks a “significant milestone” for the company because it is the first time Lexaria has used liraglutide in any of its GLP-1 studies.
