# Scinai Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: SCNI) Receives PEI Feedback Regarding Anti-IL-17 NanoAb

Scinai Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: SCNI), a biotechnology company focused on developing inflammation and immunology (“I&I”) biological products and on providing contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) services through its Scinai Bioservices business unit, has received the minutes of meeting from a recent Scientific Advice (“SA”) with the Paul Erlich Institute, Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines (“PEI”). According to the announcement, this is the European equivalent to a pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the United States as well as acceptable guidance for Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (“IMPD”) filing with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The company noted that the minutes of meeting reflect positive regulatory feedback that can be referenced as drug-development plans move forward for its anti-IL-17A/F nanoAb (SCN-1) in plaque psoriasis phase 1/2a clinical trial. Specifically, the minutes provided clarification for the preclinical toxicology and clinical program for plaque psoriasis first-in-human with intralesional injections for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. The PEI also requested to see data of efficacy in blocking IL-17F; accepted the company’s position that toxicology studies can be conducted in pigs rather than in nonhuman primates; accepted the company’s position to compare the SCN-1 to placebo directly in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis while skipping the need for testing in healthy volunteers; agreed to compare SCN-1 to placebo on the same human subject; and noted that the manufacturing process looks well developed with acceptable controls and specifications.Scinai Immunotherapeutics anticipates the preclinical trial will start in the second half of 2025. “It is encouraging to receive such a supportive regulatory summary for our plans,” said Scinai Immunotherapeutics chief scientist Dr. Tamar Ben-Yedidia in the press release. “The PEI agreed with the unmet need of the patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis for a better therapy and accepted our pre-clinical and clinical plans that will allow faster development of this product.”
