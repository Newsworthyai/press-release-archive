# SenesTech’s (NASDAQ: SNES) Evolve(TM) Offers Proactive Approach to Rat Problem

SenesTech’s (NASDAQ: SNES) flagship product, Evolve(TM), has repeatedly demonstrated an effective rat control alternative to current market offerings. “The active ingredient in the product has been scientifically proven to reduce rodent fertility, ultimately offering a more proactive approach to addressing the growing rat problem, as opposed to a more reactive approach, as is the case with poisons and traps. The obvious argument is that it’s better to control reproduction than to kill rats after they are born,” reads a recent article.

 “The company’s offering also addresses the potential secondary impact of using poisons to control rat populations, given the harm this approach can cause, not only to humans but also to other animals. One of many examples is an escaped zoo owl that was found dead, killed by raised levels of rodenticide in his system, caused by the consumption of poisoned rats for sustenance.”
