# Lexaria (NASDAQ: LEXX) Reports Positive Body Weight Results from Diabetes Animal Study

Lexaria Bioscience (NASDAQ: LEXX, LEXXW), a global innovator in drug delivery platforms, is reporting on 8-week body weight results from its ongoing animal study WEIGHT-A24-1. According to the company, this is the only study carried out anywhere in the world today to evaluate the relative performance of liraglutide processed with DehydraTECH. The results show that DehydraTECH-liraglutide is outperforming DehydraTECH-semaglutide. In humans, semaglutide has been shown in other studies to be more than twice as effective at promoting weight loss as liraglutide. Thus, the announcement noted that the continued outperformance of DehydraTECH-liraglutide compared to DehydraTECH-semaglutide is of particular interest. Additionally, the results show that select DehydraTECH-CBD formulations appear to continue to outperform DehydraTECH-semaglutide. The study is ongoing, with additional results expected.
