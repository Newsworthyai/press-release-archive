# Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) Presents Extended Survival Data at 2024 ENCALS Meeting

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) (along with its subsidiaries, “Clene”) and its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving mitochondrial health and protecting neuronal function to treat neurodegenerative diseases, presented new long-term CNM-Au8 treatment results for survival and neurofilament light (“NfL”) levels from the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial open label extension (“OLE”) at the European Network for the Cure of ALS (“ENCALS”) meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Entitled “Long-Term CNM-Au8 Treatment Reduces Neurofilament Light Levels and Improves Survival: Results from the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial,” the presentation data highlights up to 42 months (3.5 years) of survival follow-up and 76 weeks of long-term NfL biomarker results, including a responder subset who saw a 28% reduction in their biomarker NfL levels, from the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial in participants with ALS. All participants treated with CNM-Au8 30 mg, including ex-placebo participants who transitioned to CNM-Au8 in the OLE, with complete baseline co-variates were included in the survival analysis. “The clinical evidence of plasma neurofilament reduction, as well as the long-term improved survival results up to 3.5 years compared to an established multi-study ALS dataset of more than 12,000 patients across multiple clinical centers provides further evidence to strongly support CNM-Au8 as a potential treatment for ALS,” said Benjamin Greenberg, M.D., head of medical at Clene.
