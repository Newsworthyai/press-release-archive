# Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) Receives Order for Mullen Campus EVs

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, has received an order for four Mullen Campus electric vehicles from DB Schenker, one of the world’s leading transportation and logistics companies. According to the announcement, the vehicles will be used for mail and delivery on Intel’s technology campus in Chandler, Arizona. The order was received through one of Mullen’s commercial vehicle dealers, Randy Marion Automotive. The dealer has received payment for the vehicles, and the vehicles have been delivered to DB Schenker. According to the company, the Mullen Campus is a highly efficient electric van designed for low-speed, closed-campus use. It is similar to the Mullen One but is built specifically to support logistics in microenvironments and will play a central role in DB Schenker’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint while maintaining efficient operations. “DB Schenker is committed to sustainability and innovation, aligning perfectly with Mullen’s mission to accelerate the adoption of commercial electric vehicles,” said Mullen Automotive CEO and chair David Michery in the press release. “We are confident that our Campus EVs will provide DB Schenker with a clean, efficient and reliable transportation solution.”
