# CNS Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CNSP) Inks Exclusive License in ‘Transformational’ Step to Treating GBM

CNS Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CNSP), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel treatments for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and central nervous system, has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Cortice Biosciences Inc.

 Through the agreement, CNS Pharmaceuticals has acquired a license as well as the intellectual property rights to a potentially blood-brain-barrier, permeable microtubule inhibitor called TPI 287. The inhibitor is being developed for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”). In return for the license, CNS Pharmaceuticals will pay Cortice an up-front payment of 616,698 shares of its common stock, as well as the possibility of future success-dependent milestone payments of cash or the company common stock. According to the announcement, Cortice’s TPI 287 is highly synergistic with CNSP’s ongoing potentially pivotal Berubicin program, and the agreement demonstrates the company’s commitment to changing the treatment paradigm in GBM. CNS Pharmaceuticals noted that it anticipates seeking guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding advancing TPI 287 into a potential registration study for recurrent GBM. In addition, the company announced new corporate brand and website to more closely align with its dedication to addressing the most aggressive type of brain cancer, GBM. “For years, our team has searched for another drug candidate with the same high level of human data-supported therapeutic potential in GBM as Berubicin,” said CNS Pharmaceuticals CEO John Climaco in the press release. “The in-licensing of TPI 287 is a transformational step forward, and we are prepared for the next stage to execute our vision of CNS Pharmaceuticals being the leading biopharma company developing drugs for this devastating and currently inescapably fatal disease.”
