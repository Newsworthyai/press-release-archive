# Mullen (NASDAQ: MULN) THREE Approved for Massachusetts’ $15,000 Voucher Program

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, has received approval from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs’ Department of Energy Resources (“DOER”) for its Mullen THREE to qualify for the state’s $15,000 cash rebate voucher program. An all-electric Class 3 low cab forward truck, the Mullen THREE has a suggested MSRP of $68,500; however, when the Massachusetts state cash rebate of up to $15,000 is combined with the available $7,500 federal tax credit, the net effective price of the Mullen THREE totals an estimated $46,000. The MOR-EV program focuses on making electric vehicles more affordable for Massachusetts residents, businesses and nonprofit organizations. “Massachusetts’ $15,000 MOR-EV cash voucher on our 2024 Mullen THREE is another example of a great state-level incentive making our Class 3 electric truck even more affordable to meet cost of ownership requirements for fleet customers of all sizes,” said Mullen Automotive CEO and chair David Michery in the press release.
