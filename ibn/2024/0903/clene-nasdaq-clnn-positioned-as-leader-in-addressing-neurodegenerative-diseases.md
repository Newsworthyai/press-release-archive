# Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) Positioned as Leader in Addressing Neurodegenerative Diseases

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN), a biopharmaceutical company, is at the forefront of transforming the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). “Clene’s lead agent, CNM-Au8, targets the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (‘NAD+’) pathway to restore and protect neurological function. CNM-Au8 works by improving cellular energy production and utilization, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal health. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common pathway leading to neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. By targeting this dysfunction, CNM-Au8 aims to provide neuroprotection and promote remyelination, potentially altering the course of these debilitating conditions,” a recent article reads. “Clene has conducted extensive clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CNM-Au8… With over 650 years of cumulative subject exposure, CNM-Au8 has shown a strong safety profile with no serious adverse events linked to the drug… Clene is gearing up for phase three programs for both ALS and MS. The company’s innovative approach, backed by strong intellectual property with over 150 patients worldwide, positions it as a leader in addressing neurodegenerative diseases.”
