# SenesTech (NASDAQ: SNES) CEO Featured in Episode of The GotStocks Podcast

SenesTech (NASDAQ: SNES), the leader in fertility control to manage animal-pest populations, is spotlighted in the latest episode from The GotStock Podcast, which is released by IBN, a multifaceted communications organization engaged in connecting public companies to the investment community. SenesTech president and CEO Joel Fruendt is the featured guest on the most recent episode, which is hosted by IBN’s Carmel Fisher. During the interview, Fruendt provides an overview of the company and its business model, noting that SenesTech’s mission is to help manage animal-pest populations, particularly rodents, through fertility control. He explained that the company’s proprietary ContraPest(R) is based on a patented, proven technology that reduces or eliminates fertility in both females and males. Part of IBN’s commitment to provide specialized content distribution via widespread syndication channels, The GotStocks Podcast puts the small-cap sector in the limelight with in-depth interviews featuring executives in key companies. “Right now, we have labels for rats and mice, and we attack the problem at its root cause – reproduction,” said SenesTech president and CEO Joel Fruendt. “I’ll start out with this fact that usually leaves people with their jaws dropping: two rats, in one year, can become 15,000. That is really the basis for our product. You cannot poison, trap or drown rats fast enough without addressing the reproductive rate, and that is really why our product is in the news a lot right now and why we’re getting such success out in the marketplace.”
