# D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) to Bring New Quantum AI Solutions to Market

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, and the world’s first commercial supplier of quantum computers, announced that it is extending its product development roadmap to strengthen the connection between quantum optimization, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

 According to the announcement, the company plans to make enhancements to its Leap quantum cloud service that will bring new Quantum AI solutions to market. These enhancements include support for quantum-enhanced and energy-efficient AI model training as well as integrating AI and optimization to address important customer use cases. The announcement noted that the expansion to the existing product roadmap focuses on three key development areas: quantum distributions for generative AI, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (“RBM”) Architectures and GPU integration with the Leap quantum cloud service.

 “We’re seeing early evidence that annealing quantum computing could play a key role in helping AI/ML with more efficient model training, reduced energy consumption and faster time-to-solution,” said D-Wave CEO Dr. Alan Baratz in the press release. “With results demonstrating our annealing quantum computer’s ability to outperform classical techniques, coupled with rapidly increasing demand from our customers for Quantum AI solutions that integrate with their business optimization requirements, we believe the impact of D-Wave’s Quantum AI solutions could be transformative, bringing a powerful set of new computing tools for generative AI.”
