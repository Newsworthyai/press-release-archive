# MiningNewsBreaks – McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Begins Construction on Stock Mine Ramp to Lower Costs and Boost Gold Output

McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) announced the start of ramp construction at its Stock Mine, part of the Fox Complex in Ontario’s prolific Timmins gold district. The new ramp will provide underground access to the West, Main, and East zones and is expected to enable lower-cost-per-ounce gold production starting in the second half of 2025. CEO Rob McEwen highlighted the timing as ideal, with gold trading at record highs and the transition away from the Froome Mine unlocking key cost and efficiency advantages. Benefits include eliminating a burdensome metal stream, boosting mill throughput with softer ore, and reducing haulage costs by processing material on site.
