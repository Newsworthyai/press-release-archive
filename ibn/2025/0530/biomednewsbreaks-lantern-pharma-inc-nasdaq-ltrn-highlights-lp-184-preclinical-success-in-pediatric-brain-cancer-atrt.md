# BioMedNewsBreaks — Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) Highlights LP-184 Preclinical Success in Pediatric Brain Cancer ATRT

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) reported strong preclinical results for LP-184 in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (“ATRT”), a rare and aggressive pediatric brain cancer. Presented by Dr. Eric Raabe of Johns Hopkins at the Society for Neuro-Oncology’s Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Conference, the data showed LP-184 significantly improved survival in two mouse models, with one model achieving a 345% increase in median survival (20 to 89 days, p<0.0001). LP-184 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity across ATRT subtypes, high blood-brain barrier penetration, and a favorable safety profile. Lantern plans to launch a pediatric Phase I trial in late 2025 or early 2026, following the completion of its ongoing adult trial and pending consortium approvals. The findings reinforce LP-184’s potential as a novel therapy for ATRT, which is driven by SMARCB1 gene inactivation and currently lacks effective, low-toxicity treatments.
