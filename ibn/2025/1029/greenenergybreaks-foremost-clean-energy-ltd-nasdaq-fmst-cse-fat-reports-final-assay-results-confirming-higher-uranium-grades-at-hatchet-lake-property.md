Foremost Clean Energy (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT) announced final geochemical assay results from its 2025 winter drill program at the Hatchet Lake Uranium Property in Saskatchewan’s eastern Athabasca Basin. The results confirm and enhance previously reported radiometric data, showing a significant grade increase for drill hole TF-25-16—now returning 0.87% U₃O₈ over 0.45 meters from 149.75 meters, compared to an earlier estimate of 0.22% over 0.9 meters. Assays indicate 6.2 meters of total mineralization grading 0.10% U₃O₈ within a Graphitic Shear Zone and associated alteration features, suggesting proximity to a larger mineralizing system.
