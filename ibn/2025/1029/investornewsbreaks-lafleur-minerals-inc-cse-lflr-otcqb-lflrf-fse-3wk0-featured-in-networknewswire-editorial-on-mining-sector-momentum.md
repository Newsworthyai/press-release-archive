 LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) is a Canada-headquartered company developing approximately 18,304 hectares (45,230 acres) of the Swanson site it believes will yield gold, thanks to initial investigation and the amount of gold recovery nearby, along with extensive data and results from over 36,000 metres of historical drilling. In addition, “LaFleur has the potential to benefit from the upside of restarting production operations and revenue generation from its fully permitted and recently refurbished Beacon Gold Mill, an asset valued over C$71 million replacement cost. As gold prices have skyrocketed in recent months, other miners have seen an incentive to get their ore processed as quickly as possible to take advantage of the market’s optimism, and LaFleur serves as a valuable conduit to surrounding, regional deposits that want to jump start into production without a processing facility,” reads a recent article. “The 100%-owned mill is capable of processing over 750 metric tons per day once an estimated C$5 million in restart upgrades take place, highlighting the low restart cost and immense upside potential at hand for this easily accessible and strategically positioned asset. The Beacon Gold Mill had received more than C$20 million in equipment and other upgrades by the former owner before LaFleur purchased it in bankruptcy proceedings for a small fraction of its value.”
