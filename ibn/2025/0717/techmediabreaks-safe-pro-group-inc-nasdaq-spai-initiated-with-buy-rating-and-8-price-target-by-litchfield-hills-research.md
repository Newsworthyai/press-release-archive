# TechMediaBreaks – Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI) Initiated with Buy Rating and $8 Price Target by Litchfield Hills Research

Safe Pro Group (NASDAQ: SPAI), a developer of AI-powered drone imagery solutions for defense and security applications, has been initiated with a Buy rating and $8 price target by Litchfield Hills Research. Analyst Theodore R. O’Neill cited SPAI’s patented mine detection technology—proven in Ukraine—as a 21st-century answer to outdated demining methods. The company’s SpotlightAI(TM) platform, capable of detecting threats in under 0.2 seconds, operates via cloud or edge computing and has already processed over 1.6 million drone images. The company is further supported by strong intellectual property protections and growing demand from global humanitarian and military efforts.

 SPAI’s diverse operating units include Safe Pro AI, which develops its proprietary AI analysis engine; Airborne Response, which delivers drone-based critical infrastructure inspection and public safety solutions; and Safe-Pro USA, which manufactures body armor and EOD suits. Customers include Florida Power & Light, Motorola Solutions, and humanitarian organizations in Ukraine. The company is also expected to benefit from the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocates $33 billion in federal funding to AI and drone technologies. With forecasted revenue of $12.5 million in 2026 and projected breakeven by year-end, SPAI currently trades at a steep discount to peers, supporting the valuation thesis.

 According to O’Neill, SPAI’s proprietary AI ecosystem—spotlighting its SPOTD and SpotlightAI platforms—offers hyper-scalable image processing for a wide array of use cases including defense, infrastructure, and agriculture. The $8 target is based on a discounted earnings model that reflects anticipated revenue traction, supported by robust insider ownership (60%) and a unique technology moat. Given the accelerating demand for autonomous surveillance and threat detection tools, Litchfield Hills views SPAI as both undervalued and well-positioned to capture long-term upside across government and commercial markets.
