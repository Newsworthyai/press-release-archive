# MiningNewsBreaks – Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Featured in Article Highlighting Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex as Rare Earth Supply Chain Game-Changer

The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) an $18.4 million grant to accelerate its RapidSX(TM) rare-earth separation technology at the Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (“SMC”), underscoring a decisive shift toward reshoring critical minerals production. With China currently controlling roughly 80% of global rare-earth refining, the SMC project (aided by Louisiana’s $15 million incentive package) aims to produce 2,000 tonnes of rare-earth oxides annually by late 2024 and expand to 7,500 tonnes by 2027. The facility’s efficient RapidSX(TM) process delivers heavy rare-earth elements in days from a smaller footprint, directly challenging Chinese dominance and bolstering U.S. supply chain resilience.

 Beyond its industrial promise, the SMC is a geopolitical game-changer as it’s strategically positioned at England Airpark near Gulf Coast ports. It not only strengthens critical defense supply chains, powering everything from F35 engines to precision-guided weapons, but also delivers economic dividends by creating 100 direct jobs and nearly 300 ancillary roles in central Louisiana. For investors, this marks a rare alignment of federal, state, and military backing behind a domestic rare-earth venture.
