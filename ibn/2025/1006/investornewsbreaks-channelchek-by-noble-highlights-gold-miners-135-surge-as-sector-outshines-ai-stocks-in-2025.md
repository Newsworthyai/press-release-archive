# InvestorNewsBreaks – Channelchek by Noble Highlights Gold Miners’ 135% Surge as Sector Outshines AI Stocks in 2025

Channelchek, a Noble Financial Group platform, reports that gold miners have outperformed the broader market in 2025, soaring more than 135% and eclipsing even the high-flying semiconductor sector. Fueled by record central bank gold purchases, investor flight to safety, and Federal Reserve rate cuts, gold prices have gained over 45% this year — their strongest performance since 1979. Channelchek notes that while large-cap producers like Newmont Corp. and Agnico Eagle Mines have more than doubled, small-cap miners with scalable production and strong cost control are increasingly attracting investor attention, offering compelling opportunities beyond the AI-driven tech rally.
