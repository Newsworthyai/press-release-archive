# RockBreaks – Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) Welcomes Presidential Decision Granting Permits for Ambler Access Project

Trilogy Metals (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) announced that President Trump issued a decision under Section 1106 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), granting the permits for the Ambler Access Project (“Ambler Road”). The decision upholds an appeal by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) to reverse the Biden Administration’s June 2024 “No Action Alternative,” which had terminated the project’s right-of-way grant. President Trump directed federal agencies to reinstate and finalize all necessary permits to ensure feasible access to the Ambler Mining District for economic, industrial, and commercial purposes. Under Section 1106 of ANILCA, Congress mandated that transportation access “shall be granted” to the district, enabling AIDEA’s direct appeal and reaffirming the federal commitment to resource development alongside environmental stewardship in Alaska.
