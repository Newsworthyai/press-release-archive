# New York Issues Call for Clean Energy Projects

New York is launching an aggressive push to lock in large-scale renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire, opening a major solicitation that could generate over $5 billion in clean energy investments.

 Governor Kathy Hochul announced the 2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation this week, targeting shovel-ready wind, solar, and other renewable projects across the state. The timing reflects growing urgency as uncertainty surrounds federal climate policy and expiring tax incentives that have supported renewable development nationwide.

 The solicitation focuses specifically on late-stage projects ready for immediate construction, a strategic move designed to maximize use of federal tax credits before they disappear. New York officials are streamlining permitting, interconnection, and contracting processes to push eligible projects through the approval pipeline quickly.

 By concentrating on construction-ready developments rather than early-stage proposals, the state aims to get projects operational while federal incentives remain available, potentially saving ratepayers significant costs.

 Developers interested in participating face a tight timeline. Eligibility applications are due October 21st, with final proposals from qualified participants due December 4th. State agencies expect to issue conditional award notifications by February 2026, and the final project selections will be announced once contracts are executed.

 The accelerated schedule underscores New York’s determination to capture federal support before policy shifts eliminate these financial advantages.

 The solicitation incorporates several provisions aimed at ensuring equitable outcomes beyond simple energy generation. Requirements include component cost indexing to account for market fluctuations, labor standards for worker protections, stakeholder engagement protocols, commitments to disadvantaged communities, and agricultural land preservation measures.

 These stipulations reflect lessons learned from previous procurement rounds and address concerns that renewable development can negatively impact rural communities and farmland if not properly managed.

 New York currently has 102 renewable energy projects either operating or under development, representing over 9.7 gigawatts of clean power capacity. That’s enough electricity to supply more than 3 million homes across the state. The new solicitation aims to expand this pipeline substantially, with officials projecting the round will create over 2,500 jobs in addition to the billions in private investment.

 NYSERDA President Doreen Harris emphasized the solicitation serves as a ‘key building block’ for maintaining continuous project development as part of the state’s broader energy transition strategy.

 Hochul framed the initiative as New York refusing to let federal policy reversals derail state climate goals. By directing state agencies to expedite project approvals and maximize use of available federal incentives, New York is essentially racing against an uncertain policy clock while building what officials describe as a more resilient and sustainable energy grid for decades ahead.

 This forward-looking approach is likely to have beneficial trickle-down effects on other related verticals, such as battery tech where firms like PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FRA: 103) operate since the promotion of renewable energy projects in one way or another draws…
