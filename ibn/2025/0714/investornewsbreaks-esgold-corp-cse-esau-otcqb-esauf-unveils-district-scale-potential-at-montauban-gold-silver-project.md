# InvestorNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Unveils District-Scale Potential at Montauban Gold-Silver Project

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) announced results from its Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) survey at the Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec, revealing a vertically extensive and structurally complex system extending to depths of 1,200 meters—far beyond historically mined zones. The data suggest Montauban may be a district-scale Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) system, with multiple stacked mineralized lenses akin to globally significant deposits. The ANT survey, combined with historic drill results and VTEM data, is informing a new 3D geological model. With permits in place and tailings reprocessing underway, ESGold is pursuing both near-term production and long-term exploration upside, positioning Montauban as a potential multi-generational mining asset.
