# InvestorNewsBreaks – NanoViricides (NYSE American: NNVC) Finalizes Adaptive Trial Design for MPox Drug NV-387

NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE American: NNVC), a clinical-stage innovator in broad-spectrum antivirals, announced near-finalization of its adaptive clinical trial protocol for MPox Clade Ia and Ib, targeting about 80 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The two-part Phase II trial will assess safety, dosing, and efficacy of NV-387 oral gummies—formulated to ease administration for patients with painful oral lesions. NV-387 could become the first drug to show clinical efficacy against an orthopoxvirus in humans. If successful, NanoViricides plans to seek regulatory approvals in Africa, the U.S., and globally, including for smallpox. Existing treatments like Tecovirimat and Brincidofovir have shown poor efficacy or adverse events in trials, underscoring the potential significance of NV-387. The company also noted that Clade 1b MPox remains a transmissible epidemic threat in Africa and a potential risk to Western nations.

 About NanoViricides Inc.

 NanoViricides is a development-stage company that is creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The company’s novel nanoviricide(TM) class of drug candidates and the nanoviricide(TM) technology are based on intellectual property, technology and proprietary know-how of TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company has a Memorandum of Understanding with TheraCour for the development of drugs based on these technologies for all antiviral infections. The MoU does not include cancer and similar diseases that may have viral origin but require different kinds of treatments. The company has obtained broad, exclusive, sub-licensable, field licenses to drugs developed in several licensed fields from TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company’s business model is based on licensing technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. for specific application verticals of specific viruses, as established at its foundation in 2005. NanoViricides’ lead drug candidate is NV-387, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that the company plans to develop as a treatment of RSV, COVID-19, Long COVID, influenza, and other respiratory viral infections, as well as MPOX/Smallpox infections. The company is currently focused on advancing NV-387 into Phase II human clinical trials. NanoViricides’ other advanced candidate is NV-HHV-1 for the treatment of Shingles. The company cannot project an exact date for filing an IND for any of its drugs because of dependence on a number of external collaborators and consultants. NV-CoV-2 (“API NV-387”) is the company’s nanoviricide drug candidate for COVID-19 that does not encapsulate remdesivir. NV-CoV-2-R is NanoViricides’ other drug candidate for COVID-19 that is made up of NV-387 with remdesivir encapsulated within its polymeric micelles.
