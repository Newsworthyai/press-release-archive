Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) announced presentation of combined REPAIR-MS trial results at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis in Barcelona, showing CNM-Au8 significantly improved brain NAD+/NADH ratios, a key marker of energetic capacity, across relapsing and non-active progressive MS patients. Treatment also produced significant changes in brain NAD+ and NADH fractions, with correlations between baseline brain energy metabolism and disability, cognition, and motor function. CNM-Au8 was safe and well tolerated, reinforcing its potential to slow disease progression by addressing bioenergetic failure in MS.
