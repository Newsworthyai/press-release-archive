# BioMedNewsBreaks — Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) Aligns With Industry Call to Fix “Broken” Biotech Model

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), a Dallas-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its RADR AI platform to transform oncology drug development, was highlighted in a Dallas Innovates article covering the 2025 BioNTX iC3 Summit, where biotech leaders declared the traditional model “broken.” CEO Panna Sharma, serving as moderator and panelist, was quoted in the piece: “The process of actually making drugs is still largely manual. We have the technology to change that, but the industry hasn’t adopted it fast enough.”

 The article emphasized Sharma’s view that AI-driven platforms like RADR can streamline discovery, accelerate clinical timelines, and reduce costs, directly addressing the summit’s call for innovation and efficiency. By advancing a data-driven model, Lantern positions itself at the forefront of efforts to create a more sustainable future for biotech.
