# DefenseNewsBreaks – Datavault AI Inc. (NASDAQ: DVLT) Surges as Market Rethinks Its Story

Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT), has shaken off its “audio niche” label to become one of the market’s most closely watched disruptors. After months of trading under the radar, shares surged more than 102% this week as investors began recognizing the company’s broader vision: a patent-protected platform for authenticating, securing, and monetizing virtually any digital or physical asset. With Q2 revenue up 467% year-over-year and $2.5 million in licensing revenue booked but not yet recognized, Datavault has already proven it can convert its innovation into measurable growth.

 That momentum was amplified by a $150 million strategic investment from Scilex Holding Company (NASDAQ: SCLX), executed in Bitcoin. The deal provides Datavault with capital to accelerate its supercomputing infrastructure, scale its independent data exchanges, and expand into multiple billion-dollar verticals, from biotech to education to luxury goods. More than a simple cash infusion, the agreement aligns Datavault with a biotech heavyweight, giving it both the financial firepower and strategic partnerships needed to transform from an overlooked microcap into a scalable platform company.
