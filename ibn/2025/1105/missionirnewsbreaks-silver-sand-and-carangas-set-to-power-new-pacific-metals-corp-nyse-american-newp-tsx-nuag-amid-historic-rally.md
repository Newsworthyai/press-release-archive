 New Pacific (NYSE American: NEWP) (TSX: NUAG) is poised to benefit from 2025’s historic surge in precious metals. The company’s two flagship projects in Bolivia—Silver Sand and Carangas—together could produce nearly 19 million ounces of silver annually, positioning New Pacific among the top emerging silver producers. Carangas also offers substantial gold upside, enhancing project economics as gold hits record highs. With Bolivia remaining one of the world’s most mineral-rich yet underexplored regions, New Pacific is well positioned to advance its world-class assets and deliver strong leverage to the ongoing precious metals boom and the country’s long-term mining potential.
