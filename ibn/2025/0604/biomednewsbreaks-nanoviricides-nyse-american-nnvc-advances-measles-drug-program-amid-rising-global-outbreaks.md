# BioMedNewsBreaks — NanoViricides (NYSE American: NNVC) Advances Measles Drug Program Amid Rising Global Outbreaks

NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE American: NNVC) has initiated an animal trial to evaluate its clinical-stage antiviral candidate NV-387 for Measles, targeting a rising global health threat amid vaccine failures and declining immunization rates. Using genetically modified mice expressing the human CD150/SLAM receptor required for viral entry, the study aims to confirm NV-387’s potential as the first effective therapeutic for Measles. The drug previously cured lethal RSV infections in animals and is designed to mimic human cell surfaces, neutralizing viruses by binding and dismantling them. With U.S. cases surpassing 1,000 in 2025 and Europe reporting a tenfold increase last year, NanoViricides is positioning NV-387 to fill a critical unmet need as traditional vaccine strategies face mounting challenges.

 About NanoViricides Inc.

 NanoViricides is a development-stage company that is creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The company’s novel nanoviricide(TM) class of drug candidates and the nanoviricide(TM) technology are based on intellectual property, technology and proprietary know-how of TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company has a Memorandum of Understanding with TheraCour for the development of drugs based on these technologies for all antiviral infections. The MoU does not include cancer and similar diseases that may have viral origin but require different kinds of treatments. The company has obtained broad, exclusive, sub-licensable, field licenses to drugs developed in several licensed fields from TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company’s business model is based on licensing technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. for specific application verticals of specific viruses, as established at its foundation in 2005. NanoViricides’ lead drug candidate is NV-387, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that the company plans to develop as a treatment of RSV, COVID-19, Long COVID, influenza, and other respiratory viral infections, as well as MPOX/Smallpox infections. The company is currently focused on advancing NV-387 into Phase II human clinical trials. NanoViricides’ other advanced candidate is NV-HHV-1 for the treatment of Shingles. The company cannot project an exact date for filing an IND for any of its drugs because of dependence on a number of external collaborators and consultants. NV-CoV-2 (“API NV-387”) is the company’s nanoviricide drug candidate for COVID-19 that does not encapsulate remdesivir. NV-CoV-2-R is NanoViricides’ other drug candidate for COVID-19 that is made up of NV-387 with remdesivir encapsulated within its polymeric micelles.
