# BioMedNewsBreaks — Soligenix Inc. (SNGX) Highlights HyBryte Progress in CTCL via New Podcast Featuring Dr. Ellen Kim

Soligenix (SNGX) is spotlighting new interim data on HyBryte(TM) (synthetic hypericin) for early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in a recent podcast hosted by the Cutaneous Lymphoma Foundation. Featured guest Dr. Ellen Kim, Principal Investigator of the ongoing investigator-initiated study and Director of the Penn Cutaneous Lymphoma Program, reported a 75% treatment success rate at 18 weeks and up to 85% improvement in patients treated through 54 weeks. The study builds on prior results from the Phase 3 FLASH trial and mirrors the design of the current FLASH2 confirmatory trial, now enrolling patients. Dr. Kim emphasized HyBryte’s safety and tolerability, with no serious side effects reported and only one patient dropout due to logistical reasons.

 Designed to reflect real-world clinical practice, the open-label study eliminates rest periods and extends treatment duration—approaches that appear to boost efficacy. In the podcast, Dr. Kim underscored the limitations of existing skin-directed therapies and the urgent need for new options, particularly for early-stage CTCL. With its non-mutagenic mechanism and rapid response time, HyBryte is emerging as a potentially safer, faster-acting alternative to traditional treatments like steroids, chemotherapy, and phototherapy, offering renewed hope for patients with this chronic and underserved cancer.
