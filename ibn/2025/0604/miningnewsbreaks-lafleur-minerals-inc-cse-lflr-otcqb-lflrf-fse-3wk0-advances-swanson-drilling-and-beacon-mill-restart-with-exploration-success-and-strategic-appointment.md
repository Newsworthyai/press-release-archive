LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) (FSE: 3WK0) has unveiled plans for a 5,000-meter diamond drill program at its Swanson Gold Project in Québec’s Abitibi Gold Belt, supported by promising exploration results and strategic momentum toward restarting its 100%-owned Beacon Gold Mill by early 2026. The company has identified over 50 drill targets following geophysical surveys, soil sampling, and high-grade grab samples up to 11.7 g/t Au. Additionally, LaFleur announced the appointment of mining executive Peter Espig as Strategic Advisor to support project funding and expansion, leveraging his deep capital markets and mill operations experience. Advanced discussions are underway with institutional and private equity groups to finance the Beacon restart, estimated at C$5–6 million, with the goal of generating near-term cash flow through bulk sampling and toll milling.
