# InvestorNewsBreaks – Beeline Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLNE) Surpasses $1 Billion in Loans as AI Mortgage Platform Scales Nationwide

Beeline Holdings (NASDAQ: BLNE), a technology-forward mortgage and title platform, reported strong momentum in its first quarter as a public company, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative loan originations and achieving 38% year-over-year growth. Through its subsidiary Beeline Loans Inc., the company serves primary homebuyers and real estate investors with AI-driven tools including chatbot Bob, proprietary engine Hive, and a growing SaaS suite that enables loan closings in as little as 14–21 days—less than half the industry average. Since its October 2024 merger with Eastside Distilling, Beeline has advanced its vision of digitizing the mortgage process and now boasts a Net Promoter Score above 80.

 “Q1 marked our first as a public company and showed the full power of our AI-driven platform taking hold,” said Nick Liuzza, Co-Founder and CEO of Beeline Holdings. “Despite continued market challenges—including high interest rates and limited housing inventory—our performance validates the core strengths of our business and lays the groundwork for transformational growth. We’re especially excited about our upcoming equity product launch, which is interest-rate neutral and designed to unlock liquidity for homeowners in a constrained housing market without adding debt.”

 The Providence, Rhode Island–based company is scaling its digital lending platform nationwide.
