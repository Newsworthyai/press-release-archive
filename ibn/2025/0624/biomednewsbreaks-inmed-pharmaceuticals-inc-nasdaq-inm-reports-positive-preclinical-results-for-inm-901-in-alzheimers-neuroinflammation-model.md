# BioMedNewsBreaks — InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: INM) Reports Positive Preclinical Results for INM-901 in Alzheimer’s Neuroinflammation Model

InMed Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INM), a pharmaceutical company developing small molecule drug candidates for diseases with high unmet medical needs, announced new preclinical data showing that INM-901 significantly reduces inflammation in ex vivo models of neuroinflammation. The compound demonstrated a dose-dependent and statistically significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, IL-2, KC/Gro, and inflammasome marker NLRP3—key factors in Alzheimer’s disease progression. Notably, the effects were independent of amyloid beta or tau pathology, highlighting INM-901’s broader potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases. The orally administered compound also targets CB1/CB2 receptors and PPARs and has shown improvements in cognition and behavior in long-term animal studies. InMed plans to advance INM-901 through additional preclinical and IND-enabling studies with a lead indication in Alzheimer’s disease.
