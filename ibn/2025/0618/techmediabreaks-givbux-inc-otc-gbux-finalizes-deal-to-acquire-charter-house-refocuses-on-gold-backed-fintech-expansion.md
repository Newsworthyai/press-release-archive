# TechMediaBreaks – GivBux Inc. (OTC: GBUX) Finalizes Deal to Acquire Charter House, Refocuses on Gold-Backed Fintech Expansion

GivBux (OTC: GBUX), a publicly traded Super App and charitable giving platform, announced it has finalized a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire 100% of Charter House Financial AU, with the transaction set to close by July 13, 2025. The acquisition marks a shift in GivBux’s strategic focus toward gold-backed financial services, leveraging Charter House’s asset-backed infrastructure and global networks. The companies plan to integrate operations and jointly develop offerings that fuse precious metals with digital payments through the GivBux app. Charter House founder Anthony Capazze, a 25-year veteran in gold markets and finance, projected potential revenue of up to $200 million in the venture’s first full year. As part of the strategic shift, GivBux has also canceled previously announced deals, including a $39 million acquisition of VitorganAmerica.shop and a separate strategic investment, citing due diligence and funding issues.
