# BioMedNewsBreaks — Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) Reports Preclinical Success for Telomir-1 in Progeria Cell Lines

Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) announced new preclinical data demonstrating that its lead candidate, Telomir-1, prevented cellular aging in human progeria cell lines obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation. In studies conducted by Smart Assays, Telomir-1 improved cell viability, reduced oxidative stress, and restored mitochondrial function in cells from a child with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), an ultra-rare pediatric aging disorder. Unlike the only FDA-approved treatment, which modestly extends lifespan without reversing disease pathology, Telomir-1 targets key mechanisms of progeria at the molecular level. The results build on previous animal studies and mark a significant step as the company advances IND-enabling work and prepares for potential orphan drug designation.

 About Telomir Pharmaceuticals

 Telomir Pharmaceuticals is a preclinical stage pharmaceutical company seeking to lead development in longevity science in both humans and animals. The company is focused on the development of Telomir-1, a novel small molecule designed to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps, which are crucial in the aging process. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents humans and pet animals with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize Telomir-1, proposed to be dosed orally, with the broader aim of promoting longevity and enhancing overall quality of life.
