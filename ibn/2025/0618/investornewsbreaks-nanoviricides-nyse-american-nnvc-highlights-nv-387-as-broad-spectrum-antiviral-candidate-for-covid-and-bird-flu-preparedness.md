# InvestorNewsBreaks – NanoViricides (NYSE American: NNVC) Highlights NV-387 as Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Candidate for COVID and Bird Flu Preparedness

NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE American: NNVC) asserts that its antiviral candidate NV-387 is uniquely positioned to address rising global threats from emerging COVID-19 variants like NB1.8.1 “Nimbus” and evolving strains of Bird Flu, including highly pathogenic genotypes identified in the U.S. and Cambodia. NV-387, which has completed Phase I trials without adverse events, is designed as an oral, broad-spectrum antiviral that mimics heparan sulfate structures—an invariant viral binding mechanism—making viral escape unlikely. The company reports NV-387 significantly outperformed leading antivirals like Remdesivir, Tamiflu(R), and Xofluza in animal models of lethal lung infections. NanoViricides emphasized its U.S.-based cGMP manufacturing readiness and ability to stockpile the drug, noting NV-387’s potential to deliver rapid patient recovery and natural immunity while avoiding the limitations of vaccine-dependent strategies.

 About NanoViricides Inc.

 NanoViricides is a development-stage company that is creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The company’s novel nanoviricide(TM) class of drug candidates and the nanoviricide(TM) technology are based on intellectual property, technology and proprietary know-how of TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company has a Memorandum of Understanding with TheraCour for the development of drugs based on these technologies for all antiviral infections. The MoU does not include cancer and similar diseases that may have viral origin but require different kinds of treatments. The company has obtained broad, exclusive, sub-licensable, field licenses to drugs developed in several licensed fields from TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company’s business model is based on licensing technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. for specific application verticals of specific viruses, as established at its foundation in 2005. NanoViricides’ lead drug candidate is NV-387, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that the company plans to develop as a treatment of RSV, COVID-19, Long COVID, influenza, and other respiratory viral infections, as well as MPOX/Smallpox infections. The company is currently focused on advancing NV-387 into Phase II human clinical trials. NanoViricides’ other advanced candidate is NV-HHV-1 for the treatment of Shingles. The company cannot project an exact date for filing an IND for any of its drugs because of dependence on a number of external collaborators and consultants. NV-CoV-2 (“API NV-387”) is the company’s nanoviricide drug candidate for COVID-19 that does not encapsulate remdesivir. NV-CoV-2-R is NanoViricides’ other drug candidate for COVID-19 that is made up of NV-387 with remdesivir encapsulated within its polymeric micelles.
