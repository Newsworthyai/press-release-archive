# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp.’s (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) Revenue-Focused Approach Featured in Mining Podcast

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) is developing the Montauban Mine project with plans to profitably extract significant residue minerals, but the company’s near-term plans include building revenues before commencing significant exploration. “The revenue-generation plan is centered on the company’s tailings recovery operation, which is scheduled to begin in 2026. The tailings recovery will not only prove environmentally beneficial to the abandoned site and the surrounding communities, but it will allow ESGold to harvest residual gold and silver as well as mica that will be processed in a polymer for construction and road work projects,” reads a recent article, which highlights ESGold’s distinct strategy. “We’re not just exploring first and going down the same path that most exploration companies do,” new CEO Gordon Robb said during an interview with the Exploring Mining podcast. “That is why ESGold is so exciting to me, is we are fully permitted. We are very close to production — we have a mill onsite, we have tailings piles that are ready to be processed, and we just have a few more steps to get there to start producing, be cash-flow positive and then funnel that money into exploration.”
