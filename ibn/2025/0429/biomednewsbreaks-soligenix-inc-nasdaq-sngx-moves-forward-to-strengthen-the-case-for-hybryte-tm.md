# BioMedNewsBreaks — Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Moves Forward to Strengthen the Case for HyBryte(TM)

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, is advancing its phase 3 replication study (“FLASH2”) for HyBryte(TM), a novel photodynamic therapy designed to treat early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”). Building on the success of a prior phase 3 trial, HyBryte(TM)—which uses synthetic hypericin activated by safe visible light—offers a potentially game-changing approach by providing a noninvasive, well-tolerated alternative that targets malignant T-cells with precision. With patient enrollment underway and interim analysis expected in early 2026, the study is designed to potentially meet the stringent requirements of regulatory agencies in order to strengthen the case for HyBryte(TM) as a commercially available treatment. This milestone emphasizes Soligenix’s broader strategy of using innovative therapeutic approaches to tackle rare and difficult-to-treat diseases. The progress of HyBryte(TM) also underscores the importance of photodynamic therapy as a new and effective modality that could potentially be applied to other dermatological and oncological conditions.
