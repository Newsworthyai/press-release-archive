# How Battery Age, Weather Impact Your EV

On average, a battery electric vehicle (BEV) will lose a portion of its battery capacity over its lifetime. However, technological advancements have allowed BEVs to retain more capacity after several years of use. Electric cars manufactured from 2017 to 2018 will retain 93% of their battery capacity while even newer models from 2019 to 2023 will still have 96-97% of their original capacity.

 Even so, age typically causes electric vehicle battery performance to decline while cold weather can impact battery performance and reduce your vehicle’s efficiency. Although internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle performance is also affected by weather, EV batteries are much more susceptible to the cold. Cold temperatures slow down an EV battery’s performance and contribute to battery degradation, reducing life-spans for batteries that could have lasted longer under more ideal conditions.

 An electric vehicle battery slowly loses its ability to hold charge over time, a phenomenon referred to as capacity fade, due to cathode and anode degradation. High temperatures can exacerbate capacity fade by increasing internal resistance while low temperatures can result in lithium plating and impact both battery performance and life. Very cold weather can reduce an EV battery’s range by up to 50% as plenty of energy is used to heat the EV and maintain a comfortable temperature.

 Studies show that an EV with a 180-mile range will lose approximately 13 miles after seven years of use. If drivers lower their annual mileage to 6,000 miles, they could extend their EVs’ life-spans. This indicates that certain driving habits can help you keep your EV on the road longer, even in consistently cold climates. For instance, ‘pre-conditioning’ or heating your EV battery and interior cabin while the car is plugged in will prevent energy drain on the battery.

 To prevent heat-related battery degradation, make sure your EV is parked in a shaded location. Some electric cars also feature an ‘eco’ driving mode that optimizes energy use to increase total range. This feature is especially helpful during cold weather and can help you avoid range loss during winter trips.

 Additionally, don’t forget to optimize your tire pressure when the temperatures drop. Cold weather can reduce the pressure in your tires and increase rolling resistance, reducing your EV’s efficiency and increasing its energy consumption. Finally, be mindful of how you use your cabin heating. Air conditioning typically consumes around 2-4% of the battery’s stored reserves but can use over 20% of the charge during the winter.

 It is therefore imperative that drivers heed the different recommendations given by EV makers like Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) on how to optimize the performance of batteries during different weather conditions.
