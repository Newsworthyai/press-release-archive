# InvestorNewsBreaks – BioVaxys Technology Corp. (CSE: BIOV) (OTCQB: BVAXF) (FRA: 5LB), SpayVac-for-Wildlife Inc. Expand License Agreement

BioVaxys (CSE: BIOV) (OTCQB:BVAXF) (FRA: 5LB) and SpayVac-for-Wildlife announced an expansion of the fields of use in the current license agreement to include commercial aquaculture and the farm-raised fish market. With this expansion, SpayVac’s markets now include its no-booster fertility-control vaccines for aquaculture and overabundant feral/wild/invasive and select production and companion animals, which significantly increases its global revenue potential.

 “This presents a substantial addressable market for SpayVac’s contraceptive vaccines, which are being developed as an alternative to triploidy—a form of genetic manipulation commonly used in aquaculture to induce sterility,” said SpayVac-for-Wildlife CEO Thomas D’Orazio. “With only a single dose required, SpayVac’s immunocontraceptive approach offers producers a scalable and cost-effective solution for reproductive control in farmed fish, opening the door to meaningful vaccine sales across the global aquaculture sector.”

 About BioVaxys Technology Corp.

 BioVaxys is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient lives with novel immunotherapies based on its DPX(TM) immune-educating technology platform and its HapTenix(C) “neoantigen” tumor cell construct platform, for treating cancers, infectious disease, antigen desensitization for food allergy, and other immunological diseases. Through a differentiated and unique mechanism of action, the DPX(TM) platform delivers instruction to the immune system to generate a specific, robust, and persistent immune response. The company’s clinical stage pipeline includes maveropepimut-S (“MVP-S”), based on the DPX(TM) platform, in Phase IIB clinical development for advanced relapsed-refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and platinum resistant ovarian cancer. MVP-S delivers antigenic peptides from survivin, a well-recognized cancer antigen commonly overexpressed in advanced cancers, and also delivers an innate immune activator and a universal CD4 T cell helper peptide. MVP-S has been well tolerated and has demonstrated defined clinical benefit in multiple cancer indications as well as the activation of a targeted and sustained, survivin-specific anti-tumor immune response. BioVaxys is also developing DPX(TM)+SurMAGE, a dual-targeted immunotherapy combining antigenic peptides for both the survivin and MAGE-A9 cancer proteins to elicit immune responses to these two distinct cancer antigens simultaneously, DPX(TM)-RSV for respiratory syncytial virus, and DPX+rPA for peanut allergy prophylaxis, as well as several viral vaccines. BioVaxys has licensed its patented liposome-based delivery platform to Zoetis Inc. and SpayVac-for-Wildlife Inc. for selected animal health applications.
