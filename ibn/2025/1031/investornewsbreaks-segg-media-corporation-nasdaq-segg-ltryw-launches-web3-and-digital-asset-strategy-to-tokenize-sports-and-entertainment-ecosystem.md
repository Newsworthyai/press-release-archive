# InvestorNewsBreaks – SEGG Media Corporation (NASDAQ: SEGG, LTRYW) Launches Web3 and Digital Asset Strategy to Tokenize Sports and Entertainment Ecosystem

SEGG Media (NASDAQ: SEGG, LTRYW) announced the launch of its Web3 and Digital Asset Strategy, a two-year roadmap to build on-chain yield, drive tokenization across sports and entertainment, and embed blockchain infrastructure within its global media ecosystem. Supported by a newly formed Crypto Advisory Board and a $300 million Digital Asset and Tokenization Program, the initiative positions SEGG Media among the first Nasdaq-listed companies to integrate digital asset management into regulated operations. The roadmap features an 80/20 capital model balancing a multi-asset crypto treasury—focused initially on Bitcoin (BTC) and validator income from Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and ZIGChain (ZIG)—with strategic acquisitions in sports, media, and gaming. In partnership with ZIGChain, SEGG aims to develop a fully tokenized sports and entertainment platform anchored by Sports.com and Concerts.com, creating recurring on-chain yield and new investor participation opportunities through a planned “Stock Exchange for Sports and Music Lovers.”
