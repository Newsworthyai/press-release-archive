# InvestorNewsBreaks – Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI) and Equinor Joint Venture Receives Arkansas Approval for South West Arkansas Project Integration

Standard Lithium (NYSE American: SLI), through its 55:45 joint venture with Equinor known as Smackover Lithium, announced unanimous approval from the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (AOGC) for its Integration Application covering the Reynolds Brine Unit, the site of the JV’s flagship South West Arkansas (SWA) Project. The decision finalizes a major regulatory milestone, ensuring access to the 20,854-acre brine production area while protecting mineral owners’ rights and de-risking the project’s resource base. The SWA Project, which plans to produce 22,500 tonnes of battery-quality lithium carbonate annually beginning in 2028, previously received unanimous AOGC approval for unitization and a 2.5% lithium royalty—the first of its kind in Arkansas.
