# InvestorNewsBreaks – SuperCom Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: SPCB) PureSecurity(TM) Suite Sets New Standard Through Key Contract Win

SuperCom (NASDAQ: SPCB) has secured a national electronic monitoring contract in Germany valued at up to $7 million over four years, marking a major expansion into Europe’s largest economy and displacing the country’s longtime EM provider of more than 20 years. The agreement covers multiple programs—including GPS tracking, domestic violence prevention, home detention, and alcohol monitoring—using SuperCom’s advanced PureSecurity(TM) Suite. Germany is now the ninth nation to adopt SuperCom’s domestic violence solution, which includes mobile alerts for victims and real-time monitoring for law enforcement.

 “Securing this award after a highly competitive process is a powerful validation of our technology and execution capabilities globally. This is more than a contract win, it is a strategic milestone that demonstrates how our PureSecurity Suite meets the highest standards for modern public safety solutions,” Chief Executive Ordan Trabelsi said. “We look forward to supporting Germany in this important project and further strengthening our role as a trusted partner to governments worldwide seeking innovative and effective public safety solutions.”
