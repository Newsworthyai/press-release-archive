# InvestorNewsBreaks – Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Leveraging Positive Clinical Data to Shape Pivotal SGX942 Trial

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX) is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases with unmet medical need. The company’s SGX942 is a novel therapeutic aimed at alleviating oral mucositis, a debilitating side effect of cancer therapy with no FDA-approved treatment. “Severe oral mucositis (‘SOM’) often necessitates hospitalization, opioid pain management and feeding tube placement, lowering quality of life substantially. Because of these risks, effective treatment or prevention is critical to ensuring cancer therapies remain on schedule and patients maintain nutrition and comfort,” reads a recent article. In response, the company is advancing a promising candidate, SGX942 (dusquetide), which has shown promising outcomes in clinical trials. “Soligenix is in the process of analyzing the combined phase 2 and 3 datasets to design a second pivotal phase 3 study. The company is also in the process of identifying potential partners to continue this development program.”
