# RockBreaks – Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA, ASX: NVA, FRA: QM3) Gains Momentum With Senator Murkowski Visit to Estelle Project

Nova Minerals (NASDAQ: NVA, ASX: NVA, FRA: QM3)  reported further momentum after U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska visited the Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project, which has been independently identified as one of only two U.S. projects with near-term antimony production potential. The Senator’s support highlights Estelle’s role in bolstering U.S. mineral security at a time of growing federal emphasis on domestic critical minerals production. Nova has already accumulated surface stibnite stockpiles with potential to produce antimony trisulfide for U.S. military supply chains, while also advancing significant gold resources. CEO Christopher Gerteisen said policy alignment and international collaboration are helping position Estelle as a strategic dual-commodity asset with implications for both national security and economic growth.
