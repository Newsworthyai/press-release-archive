# InvestorNewsBreaks – Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) Poised as AI and Electrification Reshape Copper Markets

Trilogy Metals (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) is positioned for opportunity as AI data centers are projected to consume more than 4 million tonnes of copper by 2035, intensifying global demand. “Through Ambler Metals LLC, its 50/50 joint venture with South32, Trilogy controls the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District. The district hosts volcanogenic massive sulphide (‘VMS’) and carbonate replacement deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, silver, and cobalt,” reads a recent article. “AI-driven data centers, combined with renewable energy and electrification, are reshaping copper’s demand profile. With a 50% stake in one of North America’s most prospective copper districts, Trilogy Metals is well positioned to benefit. Its high-grade deposits, strong partnerships, and supportive policy environment provide a foundation to meet the challenges of a tightening copper market. As the global shortfall looms, projects like Arctic and Bornite could play a vital role in securing future supply.”

 About Trilogy Metals Inc.

 Trilogy Metals is a metal exploration and development company which holds a 50% interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which has a 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. On Dec. 19, 2019, South32, a globally diversified mining and metals company, exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy. The UKMP is located within the Ambler Mining District, which is one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant districts in the world. It hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”) deposits that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits, which have been found to host high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler Mining District – the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within a land package that spans approximately 190,929 hectares. Ambler Metals has an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. Trilogy’s vision is to develop the Ambler Mining District into a premier North American copper producer while protecting and respecting subsistence livelihoods.
