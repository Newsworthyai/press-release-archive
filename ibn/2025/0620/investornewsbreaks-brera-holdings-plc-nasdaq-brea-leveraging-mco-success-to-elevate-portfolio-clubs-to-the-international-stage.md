# InvestorNewsBreaks – Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA) Leveraging MCO Success to Elevate Portfolio Clubs to the International Stage

Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA), an Ireland-based company focused on expanding a global portfolio of men’s and women’s sports clubs, is successfully leveraging its multi-club ownership (“MCO”) approach, remaining bullish about S.S. Juve Stabia and its other portfolio clubs worldwide. “Brera is the first publicly traded MCO group through its Nasdaq IPO and continues to make waves in the industry. By providing a differentiated structure that combines professional management practices with public market transparency and governance standards, the company has demonstrated that disciplined, progressively advancing strategies can thrive, even in the competitive, ever-changing world of global football,” reads a recent article.

 “Brera made a move to acquire S.S. Juve Stabia S.r.l. following its promotion to Serie B, the 2nd division of Italian football. With its current performance, the club is already confirmed to make the playoffs to potentially get promoted to Serie A, which speaks to Brera’s ability to spot opportunity and capitalize on it. It also speaks to the company’s ambitions to scale the club’s operations and revenue streams, as evidenced by its move to grow its international presence with the live broadcast of two of its matches, one against Catanzaro and another against Brescia, live with color commentary in English, in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. via Destination Calcio TV.”
