# InvestorNewsBreaks – Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) Faces FTC Antitrust Trial Over Social Media Dominance

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) began its high-stakes antitrust battle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as the trial opened in federal court Monday. The FTC accuses Meta of illegally maintaining a social media monopoly through acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the agency argues were strategic moves to suppress competition. The outcome could reshape how tech giants operate and acquire competitors, with potential ripple effects across the digital advertising landscape. Meta contends the acquisitions were legal and enhanced consumer choice, setting up a closely watched legal showdown.

 Meta shares are trading at $488.47, down 0.6% as the trial’s implications weigh on investor sentiment across the tech sector.
