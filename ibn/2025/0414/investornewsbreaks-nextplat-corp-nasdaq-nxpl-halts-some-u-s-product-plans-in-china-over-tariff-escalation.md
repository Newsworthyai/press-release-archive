# InvestorNewsBreaks – NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL) Halts Some U.S. Product Plans in China Over Tariff Escalation

NextPlat (NASDAQ: NXPL, NXPLW), a global e-commerce provider, announced it will pause select initiatives within its e-commerce development program due to China’s recent tariff hikes on U.S.-produced goods. The affected efforts include the planned launch of the Florida Sunshine brand of vitamins and supplements, which would face high import costs and diminished competitiveness in the Chinese market. The company launched its cross-border program in April 2023 to help U.S. businesses reach Chinese consumers via platforms like Alibaba’s Tmall. Despite the setback, NextPlat will continue offering OPKO Health Europe’s (NASDAQ: OPK) non-U.S.-made products in China, including nutraceuticals, supplements and upcoming pet care items, which are not subject to the new tariffs.
