# InvestorNewsBreaks – Aditxt Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) Advances Autoimmune Therapy Following Positive Mayo Clinic Study on ADI-100

Aditxt (NASDAQ: ADTX) announced that a Mayo Clinic-led study has validated preclinical findings for ADI-100, the lead autoimmune therapy candidate developed by its subsidiary Adimune Inc. The study confirmed ADI-100’s ability to induce immune tolerance to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a key trigger in several autoimmune conditions including type 1 diabetes and stiff person syndrome. Results showed that ADI-100 did not enhance harmful immune activity and instead promoted antigen-specific suppression through tolerogenic dendritic cells. With GMP manufacturing completed and stability testing underway, regulatory filings in the U.S. and Germany are planned for the second half of 2025, supporting upcoming clinical trials.
