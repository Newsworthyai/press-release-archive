# BioMedNewsBreaks — Silo Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: SILO) Reports Positive Preclinical Data for SP-26 Ketamine Implant

Silo Pharma (NASDAQ: SILO) today announced favorable preclinical results for SP-26, its novel extended-release ketamine implant aimed at treating fibromyalgia. Conducted in minipigs, the study met all endpoints, including safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, with no implant-related adverse events and sustained ketamine release for up to 22 days. CEO Eric Weisblum said the results support SP-26’s advancement as a next-generation, abuse-deterrent pain therapy. Designed for subcutaneous delivery, SP-26 avoids the dissociative effects of IV ketamine and may offer a safer alternative to opioids, potentially becoming the first at-home injectable ketamine-based therapeutic.
