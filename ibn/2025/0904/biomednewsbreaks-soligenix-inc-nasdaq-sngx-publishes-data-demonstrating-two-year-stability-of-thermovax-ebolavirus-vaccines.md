# BioMedNewsBreaks — Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Publishes Data Demonstrating Two-Year Stability of ThermoVax Ebolavirus Vaccines

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare diseases, announced the publication of new data showing extended stability of its ebolavirus vaccines developed with the ThermoVax(R) platform. Bivalent and trivalent vaccines formulated from Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Marburg marburgvirus antigens retained full potency after two years of storage at up to 40°C (104°F), according to a manuscript accepted by Vaccine. Developed in collaboration with Dr. Axel Lehrer at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, the thermostable vaccines have demonstrated robust immune responses in animal models, with up to 100% protection in non-human primates. Soligenix noted that ThermoVax enhances protein subunit vaccines—long considered the gold standard for safety—by eliminating cold-chain requirements and improving global vaccine distribution and pandemic preparedness.
