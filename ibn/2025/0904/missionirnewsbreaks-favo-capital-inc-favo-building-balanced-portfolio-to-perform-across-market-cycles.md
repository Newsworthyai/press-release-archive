# MissionIRNewsBreaks – FAVO Capital Inc. (FAVO) Building Balanced Portfolio to ‘Perform Across Market Cycles’

FAVO Capital (OTC: FAVO) combines diversified, cash-flowing real estate with its established private credit platform in a dual-purpose strategy. This approach “strengthens the balance sheet, expands lending capacity, and creates sustainable advantages not typically available to pure-play lenders,” reads an article that discusses a recent move. “The acquisition of 1818 Park, a Class-A mixed-use property, brings stabilized cash flows from high-occupancy residential, office, and retail components secured under long-term leases. By structuring the deal as an all-stock transaction, FAVO added income-generating assets without reducing cash reserves earmarked for lending operations.”

 “By combining the predictable cash flows of high-quality real estate with the dynamic growth of our private credit business, we are creating a balanced portfolio designed to perform across market cycles.” Chief Strategy Officer Glen Steward said of the move amid FAVO’s broader vision.
