Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN), through its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine Inc., announced new preclinical data demonstrating that CNM-Au8(R) improved mitochondrial function, reduced inflammation, and restored cellular metabolism in a novel dopaminergic neuron model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The findings, presented at the Michael J. Fox Foundation H2 Therapeutics Stewardship Meeting in New York City, showed CNM-Au8 corrected metabolic imbalances, normalized dysregulated gene expression, and exhibited a favorable safety profile with no toxicity observed in PD neurons. Conducted in collaboration with the Salk Institute and supported by MJFF funding, the study underscores CNM-Au8’s potential as a neuroprotective therapy for both familial and sporadic PD.
