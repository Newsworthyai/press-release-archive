# BioMedNewsBreaks — Zacks Research Issues Business Update as Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Continues Enrollment in Confirmatory Phase 3 HyBryte Trial

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company targeting rare diseases, was spotlighted this week in a Zacks Small-Cap Research report that presented a favorable analysis, noting that the company’s Phase 3 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) study is continuing and that the trial has a high probability of success.

 According to the report, Soligenix is conducting a Phase 3 FLASH2 trial of HyBryte(TM) in patients with CTCL. The Zacks report noted that the FLASH2 trial is similar in design to the recently completed successful Phase 3 FLASH trial. The one key difference between the trials is that in the FLASH trial patients were treated for three cycles of six weeks each, with a two-week break in between cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint for the FLASH trial was measured after the first treatment cycle.

 “In the FLASH2 trial, patients will be treated for 18 consecutive weeks before the primary efficacy endpoint is assessed,” the report noted. “Based on the results from the FLASH trial, we believe the FLASH2 trial has a high probability of success, and we anticipate topline results in 2026.”
