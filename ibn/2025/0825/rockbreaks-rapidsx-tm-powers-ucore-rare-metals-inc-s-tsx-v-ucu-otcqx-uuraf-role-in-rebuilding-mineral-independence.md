# RockBreaks – RapidSX(TM) Powers Ucore Rare Metals Inc.’s (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Role in Rebuilding Mineral Independence

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF), leveraging its RapidSX(TM) separation technology, is strategically positioned to become the North American gatekeeper for magnet-grade rare earth oxides. This comes as recent trade agreements with the European Union and Japan are unlocking massive investment that could reshape U.S. manufacturing, particularly for critical components such as permanent magnet materials.

 A recent article discussing this reads, “While higher import duties shield domestic industry, the accompanying capital inflow is drawing OEMs to scale operations stateside, but they now urgently require a homegrown source of reliable heavy rare earth elements (‘HREE’). This is where Ucore’s proprietary RapidSX technology offers a compelling supply chain solution. RapidSX can separate HREE oxides about three times faster than conventional solvent extraction and uses only one-third the physical footprint. Ucore’s Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (‘SMC’) in Alexandria is slated to begin commercial feedstock production in 2026, supplying magnet-grade neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, all tariff-insulated by virtue of onshore U.S. production… With the demonstration plant de-risking feedstock and OEM qualifications already underway, Ucore is positioned not only as an REE separator but as a strategic industrial partner in rebuilding North American critical minerals independence at the nexus of trade policy, clean tech demand, and defense security.”
