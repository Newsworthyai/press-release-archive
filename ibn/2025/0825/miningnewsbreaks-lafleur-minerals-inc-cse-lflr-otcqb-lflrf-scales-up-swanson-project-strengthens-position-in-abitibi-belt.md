LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) continues to build scale in its exploration footprint. “The company recently staked an additional 32 mineral claims, extending the Swanson Project’s area to 18,304 hectares across 445 claims and one mining lease. This expansion increases the project’s strike length to over 33 kilometres and consolidates control over a major structural break in the Abitibi region… LaFleur’s ongoing work aims to integrate legacy data with new high-resolution surveys to define new mineralization zones,” reads a recent article.

 “Our technical team has also done an exceptional job integrating historical exploration data with new geophysical and geochemical datasets to define compelling drilling targets at Swanson. Receiving the required permits clears the way for us to advance one of the most exciting exploration and drilling campaigns in the region,” said LaFleur Minerals CEO Paul Ténière. “Not only are we launching a fully funded, data-driven drilling program, but we’ve also strategically expanded our land position in a way that meaningfully increases our discovery potential.”
