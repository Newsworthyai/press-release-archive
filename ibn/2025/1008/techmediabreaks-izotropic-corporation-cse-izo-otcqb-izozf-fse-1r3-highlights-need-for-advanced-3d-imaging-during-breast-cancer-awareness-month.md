# TechMediaBreaks – Izotropic Corporation (CSE: IZO) (OTCQB: IZOZF) (FSE: 1R3) Highlights Need for Advanced 3D Imaging During Breast Cancer Awareness Month

Izotropic (CSE: IZO) (OTCQB: IZOZF) (FSE: 1R3), a medical device company developing imaging-based technologies for more accurate breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, marked Breast Cancer Awareness Month by emphasizing the limitations of current imaging tools and the significant opportunity for its flagship IzoView Breast CT Imaging System. With more than 2.3 million new breast cancer cases reported globally each year—and over 315,000 expected in the U.S. in 2025—Izotropic underscored the urgent need for true high-resolution 3D imaging, especially for women with dense breast tissue, which affects roughly 50% of women and diminishes the accuracy of compression-based screening. As the global breast imaging market grows from $5.4 billion in 2024 to a projected $8.69 billion by 2030, IzoView aims to address the unmet demand for superior diagnostic precision, reducing missed cancers, false positives, and costly follow-up procedures that currently total an estimated $8 billion annually in the U.S.
