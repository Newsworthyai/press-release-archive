# MiningNewsBreaks – Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) Stock Surges on Reported 10% Trump Administration Stake and EO for Ambler Road Permits

A Yahoo! Finance article by Jake Conley reported that Trilogy Metals (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) surged more than 200% after news that the Trump administration purchased a 10% equity stake valued at $35.6 million, with warrants for an additional 7.5% interest. The article detailed that President Trump also signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to reinstate and approve all required permits for the Ambler Access Project, a 211-mile industrial road that would connect Alaska’s mineral-rich Ambler Mining District to the state highway system. The district hosts substantial deposits of copper, cobalt, silver, gold, lead, and other critical metals essential to U.S. supply chains. The decision reverses a 2024 “No Action” ruling under the Biden administration and signals a renewed federal focus on developing domestic sources of strategic minerals.
