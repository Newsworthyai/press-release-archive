# BioMedNewsBreaks — NRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP) Strengthens Pipeline with Dual Pathways for Ketamine-Based Therapies

NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, has re-filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for KETAFREE(TM), a preservative-free intravenous (“IV”) ketamine formulation intended for all currently approved ketamine indications. This follows FDA approval of NRx’s Suitability Petition… KETAFREE(TM) is designed to eliminate benzethonium chloride (“BZT”), a known neurotoxic and cytotoxic preservative still present in many ketamine formulations. NRx previously submitted a Citizen Petition urging the FDA to ban BZT from all IV ketamine products, citing long-term health risks and filing supporting toxicology evidence… In parallel, NRx is advancing NRX-100, a separate preservative-free ketamine formulation, under a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for treatment of suicidal depression, including bipolar depression. NRX-100 has received Fast Track Designation, and the company aims to qualify for the FDA’s National Priority Voucher Program. The two products—KETAFREE(TM) and NRX-100—will follow distinct regulatory and commercial paths. NRx is also developing NRX-101, an oral medication for suicidal bipolar depression, which holds Breakthrough Therapy Designation. With rising demand for ketamine and ongoing drug shortages, NRx aims to capture a significant market share while setting a new standard in preservative-free IV formulations.
