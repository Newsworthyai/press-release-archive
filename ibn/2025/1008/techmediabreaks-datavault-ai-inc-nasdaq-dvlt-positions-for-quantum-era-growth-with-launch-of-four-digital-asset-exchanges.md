With regulatory clarity from Washington’s Clarity and Genius Acts paving the way, Datavault expects two of these exchanges to go live before year-end 2025, reflecting what management calls “growth by intention.” By aligning artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing into one scalable system, Datavault continues to execute ahead of the curve, transforming information into currency and infrastructure into opportunity.
