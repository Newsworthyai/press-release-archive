# RockBreaks – Nicola Mining Inc. (TSXV: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) Advances Preparation for 2026 Exploration Drilling at Treasure Mountain Silver Project

Nicola Mining (TSXV: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) provided an update on 2025 preparation work at its wholly owned Treasure Mountain Silver Project, located 30 km northeast of Hope, British Columbia, and outlined plans for its 2026 exploration drilling program. The upcoming program follows years of groundwork, including an airborne magnetic geophysical survey, extensive soil sampling, and 2025 field reconnaissance focused on defining drill targets northwest of the currently suspended mine. Treasure Mountain, a fully permitted silver mine placed on care and maintenance in 2013 due to low silver prices, remains a core asset for Nicola. The Company recently received a multi-year area-based exploration permit allowing diamond drilling and trenching, as well as a 10-year mine lease extension through April 26, 2032, positioning it to advance exploration as silver market conditions strengthen.
