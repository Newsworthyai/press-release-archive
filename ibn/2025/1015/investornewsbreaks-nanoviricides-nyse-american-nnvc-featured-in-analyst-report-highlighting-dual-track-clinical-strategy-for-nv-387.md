# InvestorNewsBreaks – NanoViricides (NYSE American: NNVC) Featured in Analyst Report Highlighting Dual-Track Clinical Strategy for NV-387

NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE American: NNVC) announced that Proactive Investors published an analyst research report detailing the Company’s dual-track clinical development strategy for NV-387, its broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate targeting both MPox and respiratory viral infections, including influenza, coronaviruses, and RSV. The report notes NV-387’s nano-polymer micelle technology, which binds and neutralizes virus particles before they infect cells. Following completion of a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study in 2023, NanoViricides plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for MPox in Congo by late 2025 or early 2026, with ethics approval already secured. The report also highlights potential U.S. biodefense funding opportunities through BARDA based on successful trial outcomes.

 ABOUT NANOVIRICIDES

 NanoViricides, Inc. is a clinical-stage company creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The company’s novel nanoviricide(TM) class of drug candidates and the nanoviricide(TM) technology are based on intellectual property, technology and proprietary know-how of TheraCour Pharma Inc. NanoViricides has a Memorandum of Understanding with TheraCour for the development of drugs based on these technologies for all antiviral infections. The MoU does not include cancer and similar diseases that may have viral origin but require different kinds of treatments.

 NanoViricides has obtained broad, exclusive, sub-licensable field licenses to drugs developed in several licensed fields from TheraCour Pharma Inc. The company’s business model is based on licensing technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. for specific application verticals of specific viruses, as established at its foundation in 2005.

 Its lead drug candidate is NV-387, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug the company plans to develop as a treatment for RSV, COVID, long COVID, influenza and other respiratory viral infections, as well as MPOX/smallpox infections. Another advanced drug candidate is NV-HHV-1 for the treatment of shingles. The company cannot project an exact date for filing an IND for any of its drugs because of dependence on external collaborators and consultants. It is currently focused on advancing NV-387 into Phase II human clinical trials.

 NV-CoV-2 (API NV-387) is NanoViricides’ nanoviricide drug candidate for COVID-19 that does not encapsulate remdesivir. NV-CoV-2-R is another drug candidate for COVID-19 that is made up of NV-387 with remdesivir encapsulated within its polymeric micelles. The company believes that since remdesivir is already FDA approved, its drug candidate encapsulating remdesivir is likely to be approvable if safety is comparable. Remdesivir was developed by Gilead. NanoViricides developed both NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R independently.

 The company is also developing drugs against a number of viral diseases including oral and genital herpes, viral diseases of the eye including EKC and herpes keratitis, H1N1 swine flu, H5N1 bird flu, seasonal influenza, HIV, hepatitis C, rabies, dengue fever and Ebola virus, among others. NanoViricides’ platform technology and programs are based on the TheraCour(TM) nanomedicine technology of TheraCour, which TheraCour licenses from AllExcel. NanoViricides holds a worldwide exclusive perpetual license to this technology for several drugs with specific targeting mechanisms in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, rabies, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus, influenza and Asian bird flu virus, dengue viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Ebola/Marburg viruses and certain coronaviruses. The company intends to obtain a license for RSV, poxviruses and/or enteroviruses if the initial research is successful.

 As is customary, NanoViricides notes the risk that the path to typical drug development of any pharmaceutical product is extremely lengthy and requires substantial capital. As with any drug development efforts, there can be no assurance at this time that any of its pharmaceutical candidates will show sufficient effectiveness and safety for human clinical development. Further, there can be no assurance at this time that successful results against coronavirus in the lab will lead to successful clinical trials or a successful pharmaceutical product.
