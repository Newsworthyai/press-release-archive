# MissionIRNewsBreaks – Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Taps Greenland’s Massive Tanbreez Deposit to Fuel RapidSX(TM) Rare Earth Processing

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) recently signed a letter of intent with Critical Metals Corp. to secure up to 10,000 metric tons annually of heavy rare earth concentrate starting in 2027, anchoring a reliable feedstock for Ucore’s Department of Defense–backed Strategic Metals Complex in Louisiana. This arrangement aims to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical materials like dysprosium and terbium—vital for EVs, wind turbines, and defense tech—by leveraging Greenland’s Tanbreez Project, recognized as one of the world’s largest undeveloped rare earth resources and Ucore’s proprietary RapidSX(TM) separation technology. As global demand for rare earths surges, the agreement marks a pivotal move toward building a fully integrated, North American rare earth supply chain for technologies that will power the future and strengthen national security.
