# BluSky AI Inc. (BSAI) is Revolutionizing AI Computing with a Focus on Modular Data Center Design and the Neocloud

* BluSky AI is positioned to build AI-ready compute factories from the ground up to help entities with data-intensive requirements and low latency improve performance and boost efficiency
