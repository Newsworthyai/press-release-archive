# BioMedNewsBreaks – NRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP) Charts Dual-Path for NRX-100

NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for suicidal depression and PTSD, is accelerating its push toward regulatory approval of NRX-100, a preservative-free intravenous ketamine formulation. “The company recently filed an application under the newly created FDA Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher (‘CNPV’) program, which promises significantly shortened review timelines for drugs that meet urgent U.S. health priorities,” reads an article discussing NRx. “In parallel, the company has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (‘ANDA’) for NRX-100 with a request for priority review. The two pathways, CNPV and ANDA, are expected to complement one another. Should the CNPV be granted, the drug could enter a Commissioner-led review program with integrated oversight from key FDA offices.”
