# ESGBreaks – SolarBank Corp. (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) Leveraging Crypto to Bridge New World and Classic Industry

Disseminated on behalf of SolarBank Corporation

 SolarBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) is a premier developer and owner of renewable and clean energy projects, specializing in distributed and community solar initiatives throughout Canada and the U.S. The company recently announced plans to begin holding bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves, marking SolarBank as one of the early adopters of what is becoming an increasingly common approach among publicly traded firms. “The concept of a bitcoin treasury strategy involves companies allocating a portion of their cash or reserves into the cryptocurrency. While it remains a relatively niche approach, a report by Reuters notes that 61 publicly listed companies not primarily focused on digital assets have now adopted such strategies,” reads an article discussing the move. “SolarBank says the decision is designed to align the company with emerging digital asset infrastructure while differentiating its utility-focused profile from competitors.”

 “Traditionally, people invest in utilities as [an] afterthought. It’s a very low return. It’s a stable return,” CEO Richard Lu told Reuters. “So, how do we bridge the excitement of the new world and a classic industry? We feel that the crypto part of that is a bridge we need to cross.”
