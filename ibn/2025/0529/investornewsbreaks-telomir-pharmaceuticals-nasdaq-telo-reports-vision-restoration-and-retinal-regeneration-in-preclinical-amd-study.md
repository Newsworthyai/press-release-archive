Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) announced positive preclinical results demonstrating that its oral therapeutic candidate, Telomir-1, restored vision and reversed retinal degeneration in a genetically modified zebrafish model of age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”). In a 14-day study, Telomir-1 improved central vision response, restored retinal architecture across multiple critical layers, reduced oxidative stress by up to 50%, and eliminated mortality observed in untreated animals. The treated zebrafish showed full recovery of visual function and structural regeneration, including in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers, underscoring Telomir-1’s potential as a regenerative treatment for AMD.

 About Telomir Pharmaceuticals

 Telomir Pharmaceuticals is a preclinical stage pharmaceutical company seeking to lead development in longevity science in both humans and animals. The company is focused on the development of Telomir-1, a novel small molecule designed to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps, which are crucial in the aging process. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents humans and pet animals with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize Telomir-1, proposed to be dosed orally, with the broader aim of promoting longevity and enhancing overall quality of life.
