Nicola Mining (TSXV: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) a junior exploration company with near-term cash flow and district-scale copper potential, has been initiated with an Outperform rating and a price target of C$0.70 (US$0.50). The coverage highlights Nicola’s diversified asset base, including its flagship New Craigmont Copper Project, the high-grade Treasure Mountain silver-lead-zinc mine, and a 75% economic interest in the Dominion Creek gold project.
