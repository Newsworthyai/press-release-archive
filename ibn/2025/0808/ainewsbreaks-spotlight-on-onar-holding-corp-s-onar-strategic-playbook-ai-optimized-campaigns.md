# AINewsBreaks – Spotlight on ONAR Holding Corp.’s (ONAR) Strategic Playbook: AI-Optimized Campaigns

ONAR (OTCQB: ONAR) was featured in a recent article that discussed its strategy amid the AI era in marketing. “For years, speed was king in digital marketing. Agencies raced to deploy campaigns, iterate quickly, and exploit trends before they faded. But in 2025, this ‘move fast and break things’ mindset is showing its limits. The rise of AI and the complexity of today’s customer journeys require more than just agility; they demand a strategic foundation that connects data, technology, and creativity in a measurable way,” the publication reads. “That shift is giving rise to a new class of agencies focused less on speed for speed’s sake and more on cohesive systems that deliver reliable results. One such firm leading this evolution is ONAR Holding Corp… Cortex is ONAR’s proprietary internal analytics platform, built to forecast optimal advertising spend across channels by using multi-touch attribution data and blending multiple machine learning/AI algorithms. By predicting where ad dollars are likely to generate the highest return, Cortex helps ONAR’s agencies make more informed, data-backed budget decisions for clients. It’s designed to enhance media efficiency by providing clear, actionable insights on spending allocation.”
