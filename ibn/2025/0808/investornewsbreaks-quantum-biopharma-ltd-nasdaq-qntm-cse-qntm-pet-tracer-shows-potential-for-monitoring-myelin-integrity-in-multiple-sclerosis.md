# InvestorNewsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) PET Tracer Shows Potential for Monitoring Myelin Integrity in Multiple Sclerosis

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) announced that a Positron Emission Tomography (“PET”) tracer used in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) demonstrated the ability to detect differences across lesions in multiple sclerosis (“MS”) patients that are not visible on conventional MRI. Published Aug. 5, 2025, in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the NIH-funded study found the tracer, [18F]3F4AP—developed by MGH’s Dr. Pedro Brugarolas—shows strong potential as a biomarker for monitoring myelin integrity, demyelination, and treatment response. Quantum BioPharma aims to apply this imaging technology to evaluate its investigational neuroprotective drug, Lucid-21-302 (Lucid-MS), designed to protect the myelin sheath in MS.
