# InvestorNewsBreaks – Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) Reports Complete Response in Advanced NSCLC Patient in HARMONIC(TM) Trial

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) announced a remarkable clinical outcome in its Phase 2 HARMONIC(TM) trial, with a 70-year-old never-smoker with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) achieving a durable complete response following treatment with LP-300 in combination with standard chemotherapy. The patient, who had previously failed three lines of therapy including Keytruda(R), radiation, and Tagrisso(R), initially saw a 57% tumor reduction and later achieved full resolution of lung and adrenal lesions. Nearly two years after treatment initiation, the patient remains progression-free and has experienced no clinically significant adverse reactions across 21 cycles. This sustained response underscores the potential of LP-300, developed using Lantern’s RADR(R) AI platform, to address a critical unmet need in never-smoker NSCLC patients who have exhausted targeted kinase therapy options—a group representing a growing, underserved segment with limited approved treatments.
