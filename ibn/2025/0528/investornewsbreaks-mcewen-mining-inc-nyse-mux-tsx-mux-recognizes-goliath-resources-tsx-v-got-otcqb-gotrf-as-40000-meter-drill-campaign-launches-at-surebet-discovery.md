# InvestorNewsBreaks – McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Recognizes Goliath Resources (TSX-V: GOT) (OTCQB: GOTRF) as 40,000-Meter Drill Campaign Launches at Surebet Discovery

McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) extends congratulations to Goliath Resources Limited (TSX-V: GOT) (OTCQB: GOTRF) on mobilizing its largest drill program to date at the 100%-owned Golddigger Property in British Columbia’s prolific Golden Triangle. The 2025 campaign will consist of 40,000 meters of drilling focused entirely on the Surebet high-grade gold discovery, targeting expansion of the mineralized system laterally and at depth, and testing multiple feeder dykes and structural intersections.

 With over 92,000 meters drilled to date and extensive modeling supported by research from the Colorado School of Mines, Goliath is advancing a detailed plan to unlock further value from the vertically stacked vein system and associated Eocene-aged dykes—previously overlooked but now confirmed to host high-grade gold. McEwen Mining applauds this bold, data-driven approach and the continued technical momentum behind one of the Golden Triangle’s most compelling gold discoveries.
