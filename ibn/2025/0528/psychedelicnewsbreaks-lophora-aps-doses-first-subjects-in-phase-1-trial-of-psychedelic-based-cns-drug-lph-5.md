# PsychedelicNewsBreaks – Lophora ApS Doses First Subjects in Phase 1 Trial of Psychedelic-Based CNS Drug LPH-5

Lophora, a Danish biotech advancing next-generation psychedelic therapies, announced the first subjects have been dosed in its Phase 1 clinical trial of LPH-5, a novel serotonergic compound targeting central nervous system disorders. The trial, conducted by Biotrial in Rennes, France, is evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of both single and multiple ascending doses in healthy volunteers.

 LPH-5 is engineered for targeted serotonin receptor engagement and designed to provide therapeutic benefits without the hallucinogenic effects commonly associated with traditional psychedelics. A preliminary data review is scheduled for June 17, 2025, with topline results expected in Q4. Company executives described the milestone as a major validation of years of research and a first step toward addressing treatment-resistant depression and other neuropsychiatric conditions.
