ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF), a fully permitted pre-production resource company focused on clean mining innovation, was featured in a recent Investorideas.com snapshot highlighting Canadian gold companies advancing amid rising gold prices. ESGold reported the successful delivery of its Humphrey spiral concentrators to the Montauban site in Quebec, completing the gravity separation circuit required for gold and silver recovery from historic tailings. The circuit, designed for up to 1,000 TPD throughput, is a cornerstone of the company’s low-impact tailings-to-cash flow model. CEO Paul Mastantuono emphasized the significance of this milestone, noting construction is progressing on schedule with first production still targeted for year-end 2025. ESGold is also preparing an updated PEA and plans to release a 3D geological model in the coming weeks. The company’s progress was presented alongside strong Q1 2025 results from Canadian peers including Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, and B2Gold, as Canada solidifies its position as the fourth-largest gold-producing nation globally.
