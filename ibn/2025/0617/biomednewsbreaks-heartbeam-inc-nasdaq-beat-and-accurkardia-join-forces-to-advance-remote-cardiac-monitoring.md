# BioMedNewsBreaks – HeartBeam Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT) and AccurKardia Join Forces to Advance Remote Cardiac Monitoring

* HeartBeam to integrate AccurECG(TM), AccurKardia’s FDA-cleared ECG analysis software
* Collaboration enhances HeartBeam’s commercial offering with automated arrhythmia insights
* Combined platform aims to improve cardiac care access and speed time to diagnosis

 HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT) announced a strategic collaboration with AccurKardia, a leader in automated ECG diagnostics, to integrate its FDA-cleared AccurECG(TM) software into HeartBeam’s cable-free, credit card-sized 3D ECG device. The partnership unites two innovators in ambulatory cardiac monitoring to create a more scalable, accessible solution for arrhythmia detection and management.

 HeartBeam’s device captures electrical signals in three non-coplanar directions and synthesizes them into a 12-lead ECG for remote use. By incorporating AccurECG’s real-time, device-agnostic rhythm analysis, the platform will offer automated diagnostic feedback, helping patients and physicians respond faster to cardiac events.

 Both companies emphasized the impact of empowering patients with clinical-grade cardiac data outside traditional settings, especially as access to cardiology specialists continues to decline across the U.S.
