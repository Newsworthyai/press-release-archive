# InvestorNewsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) Begins First MS Patient Scan in MGH PET Imaging Study

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) has announced that the first multiple sclerosis patient has been scanned in a collaborative study with Massachusetts General Hospital to validate a novel PET imaging technique for tracking myelin integrity. The study uses the tracer [18F]3F4AP, developed by MGH’s Dr. Pedro Brugarolas, which has shown high sensitivity to demyelinated lesions. Scanning took place on a new GE Signa PET-MR scanner, enabling simultaneous PET and MRI imaging to enhance precision. The technique may become a vital biomarker for evaluating drug responses aimed at remyelination, including Quantum’s own candidate Lucid-21-302.
