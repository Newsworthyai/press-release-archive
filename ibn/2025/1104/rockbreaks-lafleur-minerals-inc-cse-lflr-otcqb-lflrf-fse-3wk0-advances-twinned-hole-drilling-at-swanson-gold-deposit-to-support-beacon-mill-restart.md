 LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) (FSE: 3WK0) announced progress on its twinned-hole drilling program at the Swanson Gold Deposit (“Swanson”) to support a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for restarting gold production at the Company’s wholly owned Beacon Gold Mill. The 10-hole program is designed to validate historical drilling, confirm the continuity and scale of the mineralized system, collect core samples for metallurgical testing, and enhance the current Mineral Resource Estimate. CEO Paul Teniere said the work, guided by Environmental Resources Management (“ERM”), aims to confirm data forming the basis of the resource model and position LaFleur to capitalize on record gold prices above $4,000 per ounce through a vertically integrated production scenario linking Swanson and Beacon.
