 Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) announced the completion of its 2025 work program at the Dominion project, including all mine development for the upcoming 10,000-tonne bulk sample scheduled to recommence in July 2026. The Company deferred initial shipments to its Nicola mill due to heavy rainfall and expanded project scope after discovering three new veins—Mid-West, West and 16 East—during the development phase. These new zones, located near historically known South Pit and 16 Veins, were sampled and sent to Paragon Geochemical for analysis, with results pending. CEO management noted the findings enhance confidence in the project’s scale and potential for expanded gold-bearing zones.
