Tonix recently announced that the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (“DTRA”) awarded it a contract for up to $34 million over five years to develop TNX-4200, small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting CD45 for the prevention or treatment of infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments. Tonix owns and operates a state-of-the art infectious disease research facility in Frederick, Maryland.
