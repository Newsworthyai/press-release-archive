# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Advances Toward First Production at Montauban Project

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) announced key construction and technical milestones at its fully permitted Montauban Project in Quebec, including the successful installation of the Humphrey Spirals, which anchor the plant’s gravity separation circuit. The system supports processing up to 1,000 tonnes per day of historic tailings for gold, silver, and mica recovery. Lab testing of spiral circuit concentrate is underway to optimize recovery and reduce reagent use, with final results expected this month.

 The company also finalized its Preliminary Economic Assessment, which will be released soon and is based solely on tailings material, excluding hard rock upside. ESGold expects to publish results from its Ambient Noise Tomography survey shortly, along with a new 3D geological model integrating seismic and historical data. CEO Paul Mastantuono called the coming weeks pivotal as ESGold targets a scalable clean redevelopment model for legacy mining sites.
