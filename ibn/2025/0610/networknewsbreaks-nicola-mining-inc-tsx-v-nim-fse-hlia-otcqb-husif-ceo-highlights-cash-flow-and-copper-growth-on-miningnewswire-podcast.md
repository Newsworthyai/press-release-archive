# NetworkNewsBreaks – Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) CEO Highlights Cash Flow and Copper Growth on MiningNewsWire Podcast

Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) CEO Peter Espig joined IBN’s MiningNewsWire Podcast to discuss the company’s focus on monetizing high-grade gold, silver and copper assets in British Columbia through a disciplined, cash-flow-first strategy. Espig highlighted Nicola’s unique position as owner of the only provincially permitted mill capable of accepting third-party gold and silver ore from across the province. He emphasized consistent production at the Merritt-based facility and Nicola’s role as a centralized hub for smaller, high-grade operations lacking their own processing infrastructure. With copper exploration advancing at the New Craigmont site and a plan to scale via strategic acquisitions, Espig positioned Nicola as a rare combination of producer and explorer with long-term upside.
