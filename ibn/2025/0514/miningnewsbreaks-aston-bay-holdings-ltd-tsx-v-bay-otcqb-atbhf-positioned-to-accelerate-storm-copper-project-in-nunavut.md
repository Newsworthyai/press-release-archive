# MiningNewsBreaks – Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) Positioned to Accelerate Storm Copper Project in Nunavut

Aston Bay (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF), through its joint venture with American West Metals, has secured a strategic partnership with Ocean Partners Holdings to significantly advance the Storm Copper Project in Nunavut, Canada. The deal includes up to 80% project development financing and a binding offtake agreement granting Ocean Partners exclusive rights to copper and silver products from near-surface mineralization. Backed by a US$3.5 million second tranche payment from Taurus Mining Royalty and C$0.996 million to Aston Bay, the funding will support aggressive exploration and pre-feasibility efforts in 2025.

 A recent article quotes Thomas Ullrich, CEO of Aston Bay, as saying, “We are thrilled to announce this strategic partnership and funding package for the Storm Copper Project. Ocean Partners is an experienced global leader in ore-sorting and direct shipping ore (‘DSO’) copper project development; they bring both funding and the technical know-how to advance the project. The partnership speaks to the quality of the project and the American West/Aston Bay joint venture team, validation of the project, and highlights a low-risk pathway to potential development.”

 About Aston Bay Holdings Ltd.

 Aston Bay is a publicly traded mineral exploration company exploring for high-grade copper and gold deposits in Virginia, USA, and Nunavut, Canada. The company is currently exploring the Storm Project property and Cu-Ag-Zn-Co Epworth property in Nunavut, as well as the high-grade Buckingham Gold Vein and critical metals prospects in central Virginia. The company is also in advanced stages of negotiation on other lands with high-grade copper potential in North America. The company and its joint venture partners, American West Metals Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. (collectively, “American West”), formed a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture in respect of the Storm Project property, which hosts the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit. Under the unincorporated joint venture, Aston Bay shall have a free carried interest until American West has made a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study, meaning American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such decision is made. After such decision is made, Aston Bay will be diluted in the event it does not elect to contribute its proportionate share and its interest in the Storm Project property will be converted into a 2% net smelter returns royalty if its interest is diluted to below 10%.
