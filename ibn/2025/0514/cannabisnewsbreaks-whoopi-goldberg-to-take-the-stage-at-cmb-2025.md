# CannabisNewsBreaks – Whoopi Goldberg to Take the Stage at CMB 2025

Cannabis Means Business (“CMB”) today announced that Whoopi Goldberg will participate in a fireside chat and launch her new hemp-derived beverage, Whoop-Tea, at CMB 2025, taking place on June 4–5 at the Javits Center in New York City. The Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award-winning entertainer and entrepreneur will join CNBC’s Tim Seymour on Wednesday, June 4, for an exclusive conversation in the Special Events Area on the CMB exhibit floor. The discussion will delve into the fast-rising cannabis beverage market and the vision behind Whoop-Tea, created in collaboration with leading cannabis beverage brand Pure Genesis.

 “I wanted to create something that’s fun, relaxing, and brings people together—without the hangover,” said Whoopi Goldberg. “Whoop-Tea is exactly that. It’s tea, it’s lemonade, it’s THC, and it’s all about unwinding and enjoying the moment. I’m excited to bring this to CMB and to be part of this incredible shift in wellness culture.”
