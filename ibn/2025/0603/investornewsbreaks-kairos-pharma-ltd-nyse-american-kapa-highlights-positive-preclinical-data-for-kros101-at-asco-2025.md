# InvestorNewsBreaks – Kairos Pharma Ltd. (NYSE American: KAPA) Highlights Positive Preclinical Data for KROS101 at ASCO 2025

Kairos Pharma (NYSE American: KAPA) presented new preclinical data at the ASCO 2025 Annual Meeting on its investigational small molecule GITR ligand agonist, KROS101. The study, titled “Effect of KROS 101, a small molecule GITR ligand agonist, on T effector cells, T reg cells and intratumoral CD8 T cell cytotoxicity,” demonstrated KROS101’s dual mechanism of enhancing effector T cell activity while reducing immune-suppressive T reg cells. Results showed that KROS101 outperformed TRX518, a prior anti-GITR antibody, in promoting tumor infiltration, boosting cytotoxicity, and preventing T cell exhaustion. CEO Dr. John Yu emphasized the potential of KROS101 to advance cancer immunotherapy by simultaneously stimulating immune response and tumor destruction.
