Disseminated on behalf of SolarBank Corporation

 SolarBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) announced the launch of a Bitcoin treasury strategy inspired by MicroStrategy and SharpLink Gaming, marking a first among North American clean energy developers. The company has applied to open a Coinbase Prime account for secure custody, USDC services, and self-custody of Bitcoin holdings. By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury, SolarBank aims to hedge against inflation, attract digitally savvy investors, and position itself as a pioneer at the intersection of renewable energy and decentralized finance. The strategy complements SolarBank’s core focus on solar and battery energy storage systems, backed by recent deals including a $100 million U.S. financing with CIM Group, $49.5 million with Qcells, a $41 million landfill-to-solar initiative with Honeywell, and a $25 million credit facility from RBC. Management noted that Bitcoin purchases have not yet begun and will be based on market conditions and liquidity needs.
