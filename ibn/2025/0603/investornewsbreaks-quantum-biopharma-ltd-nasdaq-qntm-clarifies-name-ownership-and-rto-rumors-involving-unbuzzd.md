# InvestorNewsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) Clarifies Name, Ownership, and RTO Rumors Involving unbuzzd

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) issued a formal clarification addressing recent misinformation on social media and stock trading platforms regarding a name change and reverse takeover (RTO) involving Unbuzzd Wellness Inc. Quantum confirmed it has not changed its name to unbuzzd and is not involved in an RTO transaction. The confusion followed a May 29, 2025, release. While Quantum is unbuzzd’s largest shareholder and debt holder, the two entities remain separate. Quantum currently holds 200 million shares of unbuzzd, a 7% royalty agreement on revenue up to $250 million, and a warrant to expand its stake to 25%. Quantum also loaned unbuzzd $1.3 million at 10% interest over three years. Unbuzzd, led by former Coca-Cola executive John Duffy and Celsius Holdings’ former CEO Gerry David, is preparing for a possible IPO with MNP LLP conducting PCAOB audits. Quantum also announced a pending $20,930 debt settlement with two vendors, to be completed in early June.
