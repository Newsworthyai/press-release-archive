# BioMedNewsBreaks — Nutriband Inc. (NASDAQ: NTRB) CEO Named EY Entrepreneur of the Year 2025 Finalist in Established Category

Nutriband (NASDAQ: NTRB) CEO Gareth Sheridan has been named a finalist in the Established category of the 2025 EY Entrepreneur of the Year Awards. Sheridan is one of 27 Irish entrepreneurs recognized for their leadership and impact, with finalists selected from across 24 companies generating more than €1 billion in annual revenue.

 Sheridan is being recognized for his role in transforming Nutriband from an early-stage startup into a U.S.-listed life sciences company focused on transdermal drug delivery and abuse-deterrent technologies. The company’s lead product, AVERSA, is designed to prevent the misuse and abuse of opioid patches—addressing a critical gap in pain management.

 Finalists in the EY program will participate in a CEO retreat in Japan and compete for the overall Entrepreneur of the Year title, to be awarded at a gala event in November.
