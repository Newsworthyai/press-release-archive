# LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) Moves Toward Beacon Gold Mill Restart and Bulk Sampling at Swanson Project

* LaFleur Minerals plans to restart its fully-permitted and recently refurbished Beacon Gold Mill in Val-d’Or, Quebec, by early 2026, offering many surrounding gold projects a much-needed nearby milling option.
