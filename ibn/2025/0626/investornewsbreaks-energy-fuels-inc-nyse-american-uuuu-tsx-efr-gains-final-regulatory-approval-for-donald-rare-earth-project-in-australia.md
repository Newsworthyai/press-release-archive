 Energy Fuels is a leading U.S.-based critical minerals company, focused on uranium, rare earth elements (“REEs”), heavy mineral sands (“HMS”), vanadium and medical isotopes. The company has been the leading U.S. producer of natural uranium concentrate for the past several years, which is sold to nuclear utilities that process it further for the production of carbon-free nuclear energy, and owns and operates several conventional and in siturecovery uranium projects in the western United States.
