# GreenCarNewsBreaks – Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN) Increases Ownership of Bollinger Motors to 95%, Resolves Receivership

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) has acquired an additional 21% stake in Bollinger Motors, bringing its total ownership to 95% and increasing shareholder equity by approximately $3.5 million. The move follows Mullen’s resolution of outstanding claims and debt that had placed Bollinger under court-ordered receivership, a case now dismissed with prejudice. Bollinger will continue operating independently under Mullen’s ownership, with its commercial EV lineup—led by the all-electric B4 Chassis Cab—receiving full support for sales, service, and warranty. Mullen plans to leverage synergies to accelerate the B4’s development and drive growth within the commercial EV space.
