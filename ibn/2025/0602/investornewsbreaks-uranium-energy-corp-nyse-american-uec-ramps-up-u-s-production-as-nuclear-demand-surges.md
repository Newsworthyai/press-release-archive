Uranium Energy (NYSE American: UEC) has filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2025, highlighting major operational progress as the U.S. pushes for a fourfold increase in nuclear capacity. CEO Amir Adnani emphasized the company’s alignment with national energy policy, citing new ISR production in Wyoming, ongoing construction at the Burke Hollow Project in South Texas, and preparation of Canada’s Roughrider Project for pre-feasibility. The quarter marked startup of Header House 10-7 at Christensen Ranch, expansion drilling across key wellfields, and infrastructure upgrades at both the Christensen Ranch and Irigaray plants. In Texas, 101 new holes were drilled at Burke Hollow’s Production Area One, while equipment installation and trunkline integration advanced at the site’s ion exchange plant. In Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, UEC is working toward a TRS report and Sweetwater permitting amendments to enable a scalable hub-and-spoke ISR platform. Meanwhile, metallurgical work and pre-feasibility planning are underway at the Roughrider Project in Saskatchewan.
