# InvestorNewsBreaks – Oncotelic Therapeutics Inc. (OTLC) Venture Begins Clinical Trials of Innovative Cancer Therapy

Oncotelic Therapeutics (OTCQB: OTLC) venture Sapu Nano recently secured approval from Australia’s Human Research Ethics Committee (“HREC”) to begin enrolling patients in clinical trials for Sapu003, an injectible form of Afinitor(R) (everolimus) for breast cancer treatment. Using Sapu Nano’s proprietary Deciparticle(TM) technology, Sapu003 delivers Everolimus directly into the bloodstream. “The approval of Sapu003 to enter human trials is a landmark moment. By enabling full drug absorption through intravenous delivery, this program has the potential to achieve meaningful tumor shrinkage where oral formulations have been limited,” said Dr. Sud Agarwal, CEO of Ingenu, a contract research organization in Australia. “We are proud to support Sapu Nano in advancing this therapy, potentially giving breast cancer patients better outcomes and improved quality of life.”
