# AINewsBreaks – ONAR Holding Corp. (ONAR) CEO Spotlights AI-Driven Marketing Strategy for the Middle Market

ONAR (OTCQB: ONAR) was recently featured on the TechMediaWire Podcast, where CEO Claude Zdanow shared his journey from musician to marketing innovator. “I started as a musician signed to a Warner Bros. imprint,” he explained. “That evolved into a music company, and eventually into advertising and marketing.”

 In 2007, Zdanow founded Stadiumred Studios, transforming a historic Harlem recording space into a Grammy-winning facility. He later expanded it into Stadiumred Group, a full-service marketing collective offering creative, digital, experiential, and influencer services.

 After exiting his last agency in 2021, Zdanow was tapped to lead ONAR Holdings. The company specializes in delivering AI-driven marketing strategies for middle-market businesses generating $50 million to $1 billion in revenue. Zdanow says there’s significant opportunity for innovative firms in this segment for which ONAR’s solutions tie directly to revenue and real outcomes.
