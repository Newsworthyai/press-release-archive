# InvestorNewsBreaks – Zacks Research Releases Updated Report as Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Eyes Upcoming ‘Key Catalysts’

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company targeting rare diseases, was spotlighted in a July 10 Zacks Small-Cap Research report that presented a favorable analysis, noting that the company is anticipating a number of key catalysts in the second half of 2025, including progress on its current phase 3 FLASH2 trial of HyBryte(TM) for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma (“CTCL”).

 According to the report, Soligenix is developing products to treat rare diseases within two business segments: Specialized BioTherapeutics and Public Health Solutions. The Specialized BioTherapeutics business segment currently has multiple products under development, and the report noted an expected update on enrollment in the phase 3 FLASH2 trial to come in the second half of 2025, with topline results expected in the second half of 2026. Another clinical update is expected in Q3 2025 for the ongoing investigator-initiated study (“IIS”), which is sponsored by Dr. Ellen Kim; that study is evaluating extended HyBryte(TM) treatment for up to 54 weeks. The report also noted that topline results are expected in the phase 2a trial of SGX302 in mild-to-moderate psoriasis and in the phase 2a proof-of-concept trial of Behcet’s disease (“BD”) with SGX945 in Q3 2025.

 “We look forward to the multiple upcoming catalysts for Soligenix in the second half of 2025,” reported Zachs. “The update on the IIS should provide additional read-through to the FLASH2 trial, which we already have high confidence in being successful based on the robust results announced thus far for the IIS and its similarity to the FLASH2 trial. The psoriasis and BD programs offer additional upside that is not being factored in to the current share price.”
