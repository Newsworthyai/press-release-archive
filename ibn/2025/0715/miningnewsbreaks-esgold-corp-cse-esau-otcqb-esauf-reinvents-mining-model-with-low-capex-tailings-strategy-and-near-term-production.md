# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Reinvents Mining Model With Low-Capex Tailings Strategy and Near-Term Production

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) a forward-looking mineral resource company, is challenging the traditional high-risk, high-capex mining model by redeveloping legacy mine sites with known volumes, historical grades and existing infrastructure. With its Montauban Project in Quebec now fully permitted and under construction, ESGold is poised for near-term gold, silver and mica production through clean, gravity-based tailings processing. The company has developed a scalable, repeatable cash-flow model that minimizes environmental impact and funds systematic exploration of legacy sites. Led by newly appointed CEO Gordon Robb, ESGold aims to transform forgotten assets into clean, cash-generating producers. As gold prices hit record highs and institutional capital prioritizes sustainability, ESGold stands ready to capitalize—joining an elite group of modern miners including BHP (NYSE: BHP), Barrick (NYSE: GOLD), Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) and Kinross (NYSE: KGC).
