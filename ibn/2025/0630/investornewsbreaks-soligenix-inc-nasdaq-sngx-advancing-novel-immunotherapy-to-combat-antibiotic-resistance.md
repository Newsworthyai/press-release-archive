# InvestorNewsBreaks – Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Advancing Novel Immunotherapy to Combat Antibiotic Resistance

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX) is at the forefront of the effort as the medical community urgently seeks alternative treatments for bacterial infections in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance. The company’s SGX943 therapy “is based on dusquetide, an Innate Defense Regulator (‘IDR’) that modulates the body’s immune response rather than directly targeting bacteria. By enhancing the innate immune system, SGX943 promotes the clearance of infections and reduces inflammation, offering a broad-spectrum approach to bacterial infections,” reads a recent article. “The company’s portfolio encompasses both specialized biotherapeutics and public health solutions, targeting areas with significant unmet medical needs.”

With successful completion of the second Phase 3 study, regulatory approvals will be sought to support potential commercialization worldwide. Development programs in this business segment also include expansion of synthetic hypericin (“SGX302”) into psoriasis, the company’s first-in-class innate defense regulator (“IDR”) technology, dusquetide (“SGX942”) for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including oral mucositis in head and neck cancer, and (“SGX945”) in Behçet’s disease.

 The company’s Public Health Solutions business segment includes development programs for RiVax(R), its ricin toxin vaccine candidate, as well as its vaccine programs targeting filoviruses (such as Marburg and Ebola) and CiVax(TM), the company’s vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2). The development of Soligenix’s vaccine programs incorporates the use of its proprietary heat stabilization platform technology, known as ThermoVax(R).
