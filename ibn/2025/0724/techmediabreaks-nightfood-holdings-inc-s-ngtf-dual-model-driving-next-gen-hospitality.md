# TechMediaBreaks – Nightfood Holdings Inc.’s (NGTF) Dual Model Driving Next-Gen Hospitality

Nightfood Holdings (OTCQB: NGTF) was featured in a recent article that discusses its distinction in combining AI-powered robotics technology with strategic hotel acquisitions, expanding into new vision for next-generation solutions for the hospitality sector. The piece reads, “Rather than simply selling robotics solutions to third parties, the company owns and operates the hotels where its technology is implemented, creating multiple revenue streams while demonstrating real-world performance… Technology is transforming operational efficiency through robotic housekeeping solutions, a major addressing matter to the industry’s labor challenge. The increased demand for hotel automation, driven by staff shortages, is leading to greater use of robotic services for tasks ranging from room sweeping to food and amenity delivery… The company’s approach creates a feedback loop where operational insights from its owned properties directly inform robotics development, ensuring solutions address real-world hospitality challenges rather than theoretical applications.”
