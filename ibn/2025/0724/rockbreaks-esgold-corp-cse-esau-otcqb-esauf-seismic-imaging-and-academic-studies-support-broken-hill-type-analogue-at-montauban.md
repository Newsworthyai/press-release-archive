# RockBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Seismic Imaging and Academic Studies Support Broken Hill-Type Analogue at Montauban

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has announced results from its Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) survey that validate earlier academic comparisons between its Montauban Gold-Silver Project and the globally significant Broken Hill deposit in Australia. Seismic imaging confirmed mineralized zones down to 1,200 metres, reinforcing a vertically stacked model previously described in peer-reviewed research from the University of Calgary and University of British Columbia. The studies identify sulphide melting, hydrothermal activity, and structural deformation as key remobilization mechanisms for precious metals—findings now echoed by ESGold’s deep geophysical data. The Montauban project is being repositioned as a complex, multi-lens system with district-scale potential and similarities to both Broken Hill and Scandinavian massive sulfide systems. ESGold is integrating academic and geophysical data into a 3D model to guide exploration and advance its near-term production and tailings-to-cash-flow strategy.
