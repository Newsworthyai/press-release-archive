# TechMediaBreaks – D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) and North Wales Police Announce D-Wave’s Hybrid-Quantum Application Outperforms Classical Results in Proof-of-Technology Project Optimizing Police Vehicle Placement

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) and North Wales Police (NWP) completed a joint proof-of-technology project using a hybrid-quantum application to optimize police vehicle placement, cutting response times by nearly 50% and reducing coordination planning from four months to four minutes. The test also demonstrated that NWP could respond to at least 90% of incidents within their target response time using the hybrid-quantum application. Following the successful project, the UK Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser for Policing recognized it to be of national cross-government departmental interest with opportunity for future development and deployment. The project highlights the importance and value of cross-border collaboration, with D-WaveTM technology—developed in Canada by a U.S. company—addressing a key UK public sector challenge.
