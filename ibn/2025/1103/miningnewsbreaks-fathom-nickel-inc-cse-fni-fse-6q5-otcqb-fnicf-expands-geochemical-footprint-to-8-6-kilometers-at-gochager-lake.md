# MiningNewsBreaks – Fathom Nickel Inc. (CSE: FNI) (FSE: 6Q5) (OTCQB: FNICF) Expands Geochemical Footprint to 8.6 Kilometers at Gochager Lake

This article has been disseminated on behalf of Fathom Nickel Inc. and may include paid advertising.

 Fathom Nickel (CSE: FNI) (FSE: 6Q5) (OTCQB: FNICF) announced preliminary results from its 2025 soil geochemistry program at the Gochager Lake project, revealing an expanded favorable geochemical footprint extending over 8.6 kilometers of strike length. CEO and VP Exploration Ian Fraser said the findings support the company’s belief that the historic Gochager Lake deposit is part of a much larger mineralized trend with potential to host multiple magmatic Ni-Cu-Co sulphide deposits. Final rock assays from the fall prospecting program remain pending, with further updates to be released following data interpretation.

 About Fathom Nickel Inc.

 Fathom is an exploration company that is targeting magmatic nickel sulphide discoveries to secure the supply of North American Critical Minerals and to support the global green energy transition. The Company now has a portfolio of three high-quality exploration projects located in the prolific Trans Hudson Corridor in Saskatchewan:

 1) The Albert Lake Project, a 90,000+ hectare project that hosts the historic Rottenstone Mine1. Fathom exploration to date at the Albert Lake project confirms:

 * The high-grade Ni-Cu-Co+3E Rottenstone deposit mineralization extends to the south a minimum 40m and remains open.

 * The Rottenstone deposit is potentially offset and continues within the footwall of a prominent fault defined by drilling.

 * A new Rottenstone-like discovery (similar host rock, and similar mineralization) by drilling 500-550m W-NW of the historic mine; the 300+m Bay Island Trend, remains open along strike.

 * Similar Rottenstone-like host rock and mineralization intersected by drilling approximately 1.5km S-SW of the historic mine (the Nic5-Tremblay-Olson area).

 2) The 33,000+ hectare Gochager Lake Project that hosts the historic Gochager Lake deposit2. Fathom exploration to date at the Gochager Lake project confirms:

 * Vertical extension of Ni-Cu-Co mineralization a minimum of 150m below the historic Gochager Lake deposit interpreted boundary, and very good potential for expansion of mineralization in all directions.

 * Multiple high-grade vertically oriented Ni-Cu-Co sulphide breccia mineralization zones and chutes occur within the historic deposit, and the zones, chutes remain open for further expansion and delineation in all directions.

 * Surface mapping and soil / rock geochemistry has confirmed the Gochager Lake deposit host rock; the container rock and mineralization style extends a minimum 3.5km to the east-northeast and remains open for expansion along strike.

 3) The 10,000+ hectare Friesen Lake Project located 40km southwest of the historic Rottenstone Mine and 30km northwest of the historic Gochager Lake deposit.

 The Friesen Lake property hosts the Olsen Cu-Ni-Pt Showing also referred to as the Friesen Lake Cu-Ni-Pt showing and is described as an ultramafic dyke that historic trenching and drilling demonstrates Cu-Ni-Pt-Pd and Au mineralization within the ultramafic dyke (Saskatchewan Mineral Deposit Index (SMID) #0928a). To date Fathom has not performed any exploration at the Friesen Lake Project.
