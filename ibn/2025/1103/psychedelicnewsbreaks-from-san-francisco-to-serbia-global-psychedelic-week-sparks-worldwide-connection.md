# PsychedelicNewsBreaks – From San Francisco to Serbia: Global Psychedelic Week Sparks Worldwide Connection

Global Psychedelic Week (GPW) 2025, taking place Nov. 3–9, 2025, marks the world’s first distributed psychedelic conference, connecting over 5,000 participants across 100 countries through a hybrid model of online and in-person gatherings. Featuring more than 100 leading voices—including Rick Doblin, Robin Carhart-Harris, and Dr. Pamela Kryskow—GPW’s powerful vision is to create a global dialogue on psychedelic science, therapy, and culture. Nearly 60 local events in countries such as India, Serbia, Jamaica, Colombia, and Argentina will foster community-based connection.

 “During Global Psychedelic Week, over 100 in-person events will take place around the world. We’re decentralizing the conversation and meeting people where they are, in their own communities. Rather than gathering in a single location, we’re fostering the space for local connection, reflection, and dialogue. These gatherings feature deeper engagement rooted in local culture and relationships. This is how a truly global movement grows, from the ground up.” —Milica Radovic Mandic, Co-founder, Global Psychedelic Week.
