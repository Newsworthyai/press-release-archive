Calidi Biotherapeutics (NYSE American: CLDI), a clinical-stage biotech company developing systemic oncolytic targeted immunotherapies, released a shareholder letter from CEO Eric Poma, PhD, outlining a transformative year for the company. Since Poma’s appointment in April 2025 and the addition of Dr. Guy Travis Clifton as Chief Medical Officer, Calidi has streamlined operations and advanced its RedTail platform—a systemically delivered virotherapy designed to target metastatic cancers and deliver genetic payloads. Preclinical data presented at AACR and ASCO showcased RedTail’s tumor selectivity and immune modulation potential, driving partnership discussions and IND-enabling studies for lead candidate CLD-401, with a filing expected by end of 2026. Calidi also opened an IND for its intratumoral virotherapy, CLD-201, with Phase I trials anticipated by year-end. The company ended Q1 with $10.6 million in cash and a significantly reduced burn rate, aiming to rapidly advance its pipeline while enhancing shareholder value.
