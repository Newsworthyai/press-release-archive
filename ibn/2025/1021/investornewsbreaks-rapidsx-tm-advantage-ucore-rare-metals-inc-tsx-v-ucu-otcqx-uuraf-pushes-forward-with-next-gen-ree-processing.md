# InvestorNewsBreaks – RapidSX(TM) Advantage: Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Pushes Forward with Next-Gen REE Processing

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) is emerging as a Western-aligned player in the race to establish secure rare earth element (“REE”) supply chains. While Russia pushes for rapid domestic development of its vast REE reserves, Ucore is building momentum with its RapidSX(TM) separation technology and U.S.-backed Strategic Metals Complex (“SMC”) in Louisiana, aiming to begin commercial REE output by the second half of 2026. With a $18.4 million U.S. Department of Defense grant, government prioritization status under the Defense Production Act, and a feedstock agreement with Greenland’s Tanbreez project, Ucore is strategically positioned to reduce Western reliance on Chinese supply chains. Its RapidSX platform offers a smaller, faster, and potentially cleaner alternative to conventional separation methods, making Ucore a serious contender in reshaping the global REE processing landscape.
