# BioMedNewsBreaks — Oragenics Inc. (NYSE American: OGEN) Regains NYSE Compliance, Strengthens Balance Sheet for Clinical Advancement

Oragenics (NYSE American: OGEN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing brain-targeted therapeutics via proprietary intranasal delivery technology, announced it has regained full compliance with NYSE American’s continued listing standards. Effective Oct. 20, 2025, the exchange confirmed compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii), removing the below-compliance indicator and restoring the company to the roster of compliant issuers. “Regaining compliance represents more than a regulatory milestone—it reflects our commitment to transparency, financial discipline, and restoring investor confidence,” said CEO Janet Huffman. The achievement follows the July 2, 2025, closing of a $16.5 million public offering of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, which restored stockholder equity and funds advancement of ONP-002 through key Phase II milestones in Australia and upcoming Phase IIb trials in the U.S.

 About Oragenics Inc.

 Oragenics is striving to revolutionize neurological care through proprietary intranasal delivery technology that has the potential to enable targeted, non-invasive therapeutics for brain-related conditions. Our lead candidate, ONP-002, is advancing with the goal of becoming the first FDA-approved treatment for concussion, while our platform technology has the potential, we believe, to open pathways to address neurodegenerative diseases, CNS disorders, and other neurological conditions.

 We’re building more than a pharmaceutical company—we’re creating a movement around brain-first recovery that transforms how patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems approach neurological trauma.
