Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) announced a complete metabolic response in a heavily pretreated patient with aggressive Grade 3 non-germinal center B-cell DLBCL during its ongoing Phase 1 trial of LP-284—the first such response observed with the candidate. The patient had failed three prior regimens, including CAR-T and bispecific antibody therapy, before responding after just two cycles of LP-284, a next-generation acylfulvene developed using Lantern’s RADR(R) AI platform. This outcome highlights LP-284’s synthetic lethal mechanism and potential as a paradigm-shifting therapy for refractory lymphomas, supporting accelerated development and strategic expansion in the $4 billion global B-cell cancer market.
