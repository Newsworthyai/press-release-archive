# InvestorNewsBreaks – G Mining Ventures Corp. (TSX: GMIN) (OTCQX: GMINF) Clears Key Regulatory Hurdle for Gurupi Gold Project in Brazil

G Mining Ventures Corp. (TSX: GMIN) (OTCQX: GMINF) announced that a Brazilian federal court has annulled outdated 2011 permits tied to its Gurupi Gold Project, closing a longstanding public civil action and enabling the company to launch a new environmental licensing process. The ruling removes legacy permitting risks and clears the way for disciplined development of the ~1,900 km² district-scale asset, which hosts 1.83 Moz of indicated and 0.77 Moz of inferred resources. GMIN is advancing a USD $2–4 million exploration program in 2025 and reaffirmed its broader strategy, including environmental permitting and a construction decision at Oko West later this year.
