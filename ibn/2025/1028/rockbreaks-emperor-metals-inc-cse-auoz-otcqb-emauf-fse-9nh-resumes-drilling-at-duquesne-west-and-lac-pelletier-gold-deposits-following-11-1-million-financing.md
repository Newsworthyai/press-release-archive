 Emperor Metals (CSE: AUOZ) (OTCQB: EMAUF) (FSE: 9NH) announced the resumption of drilling at its Duquesne West and Lac Pelletier Gold Deposits, following the release of its Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MMRE) update and the successful closing of an $11.1 million financing. CEO John Florek said the funds will drive exploration and development, noting that only about 15–20% of the drilling needed to fully delineate Duquesne West above 1,000 meters has been completed, leaving significant resource expansion potential. The deposit hosts multiple high-grade gold zones within a broader bulk-tonnage envelope, with 44% of the 1.46-million-ounce resource considered amenable to open-pit extraction and the remainder suitable for underground development.
