Operating under a recurring revenue model, the project reflects growing national demand for modern alternatives to incarceration. Since August 2024, SuperCom has signed over 30 U.S. contracts and 11 reseller partnerships, leveraging its modular EM solutions including PureOne(TM), PureShield(TM), PureProtect(TM), and PureMonitor(TM).
