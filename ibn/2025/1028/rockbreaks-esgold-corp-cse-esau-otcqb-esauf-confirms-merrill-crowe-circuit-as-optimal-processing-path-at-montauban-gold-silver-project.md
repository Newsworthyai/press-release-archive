 ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) reported that metallurgical work at its fully permitted Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec has validated the Company’s processing strategy for all site feedstock, including railway tailings, confirming the Merrill Crowe closed circuit as the optimal processing path. Gravity separation tests showed concentrate grades were insufficient for direct gold and silver pouring, leading to confirmation that all material will be processed through the Merrill Crowe system during the final construction phase. The results, supervised by Edmond St-Jean, P.Eng., and analyzed by ALS Global in Val-d’Or, de-risk equipment procurement and support ongoing mill construction, which is ahead of schedule. ESGold also noted continued infrastructure expansion, including the gold room and laboratory, and completion of advanced 3D geological modeling to guide an expanded exploration program.
