# MiningNewsBreaks – Regulatory Breakthroughs Further Position Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ) in Critical Minerals Supply Chain

This article has been disseminated on behalf of Trilogy Metals and may include a paid advertisement.

 Trilogy Metals (NYSE American: TMQ) (TSX: TMQ), leveraging its copper-rich assets in Alaska, is strategically positioned amidst a wave of favorable policy changes. “First, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution to overturn restrictive land designations in central Yukon, opening up millions of acres previously locked from development. Second, federal executive action has advanced the proposed Ambler Access Road in Northwest Alaska, a long-sought industrial corridor that Trilogy has noted is essential to accessing its mining assets in the Ambler Mining District. Together, these moves reduce key regulatory obstacles for Trilogy Metals and sharpen the prospects for its copper-dominant polymetallic projects,” reads a recent article. “As demand for metals essential to clean energy and electrification increase, companies such as Trilogy are in the spotlight. With government action now aligning more toward unlocking mineral lands and facilitating infrastructure, Trilogy has an opportunity to progress from exploration toward full development—and possibly transform its projects in the Ambler Mining District into leading contributors to the mineral security of both Alaska and the United States.”

 About Trilogy Metals Inc.

 Trilogy Metals is a metal exploration and development company which holds a 50% interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which has a 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. On Dec. 19, 2019, South32, a globally diversified mining and metals company, exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy. The UKMP is located within the Ambler Mining District, which is one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant districts in the world. It hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”) deposits that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits, which have been found to host high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler Mining District – the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within a land package that spans approximately 190,929 hectares. Ambler Metals has an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. Trilogy’s vision is to develop the Ambler Mining District into a premier North American copper producer while protecting and respecting subsistence livelihoods.
