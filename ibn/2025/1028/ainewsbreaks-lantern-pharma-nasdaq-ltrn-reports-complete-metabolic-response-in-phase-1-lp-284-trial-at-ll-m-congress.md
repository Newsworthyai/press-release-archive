# AINewsBreaks – Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) Reports Complete Metabolic Response in Phase 1 LP-284 Trial at LL&amp;M Congress

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using its RADR(R) AI platform to transform oncology drug discovery and development, presented clinical data from its ongoing Phase 1 trial of LP-284 at the 25th Annual Lymphoma, Leukemia & Myeloma Congress in New York City, showing a confirmed complete metabolic response in a 41-year-old patient with aggressive Grade 3 non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after failure of four prior regimens, including CAR-T and bispecific antibody therapies. The response, achieved after two 28-day cycles of LP-284, supports the drug’s synthetic lethal mechanism and potential to fill a critical post-immunotherapy treatment gap. Lantern CEO Panna Sharma said the results validate the company’s AI-driven approach and highlight LP-284’s dual potential as a monotherapy and in combination with FDA-approved agents such as rituximab. Lantern noted LP-284’s favorable early safety profile, multiple FDA Orphan Drug Designations, strong IP protection through 2039, and partnership opportunities for expanding hematology portfolios.
