# BioMedNewsBreaks — Scinai Immunotherapeutics Ltd. (NASDAQ: SCNI) Publishes Peer-Reviewed Data Supporting PC111 as Potential Disease Modifier

Scinai Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: SCNI), a biopharmaceutical company developing inflammation and immunology biological products and providing boutique CDMO services, announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article in the Journal of Dermatological Treatment confirming the disease-modifying potential of PC111, a first-in-class human anti-Fas Ligand monoclonal antibody. The study demonstrated PC111’s ability to prevent blister formation in humanized models of pemphigus by targeting soluble Fas Ligand, offering a differentiated, non-immunosuppressive approach. Data also highlighted potential use in SJS/TEN, a life-threatening dermatological condition. CEO Amir Reichman said the findings reinforce PC111’s potential to transform treatment for these high unmet-need indications and deliver meaningful value to patients and shareholders.
