# AINewsBreaks – Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) CEO Discusses AI-Driven Cancer Drug Development in FintechTV Interview at NYSE

• Lantern’s AI platform “learns, reads, models, and predicts” to identify new drugs and indications • CEO Panna Sharma says AI is compressing development timelines and cost structures across oncology

 Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), an AI-driven cancer drug developer, is using large-scale machine learning to discover new therapies, reposition existing molecules, and target high-unmet-need oncology indications. CEO Panna Sharma told FintechTV the company’s proprietary platform now self-learns, reads scientific papers, models molecules, predicts patient response, and suggests new indications — significantly reducing the time and cost of drug development.

 Lantern has three clinical-stage oncology candidates, including a Phase 2 trial for non-smoker non-small cell lung cancer and a program targeting cancers with DNA damage repair deficiency using synthetic lethality. The company expects upcoming data milestones from its LP-184 program and plans to roll out its AI platform commercially to drug developers worldwide. Sharma said Lantern aims to help usher in a “golden era of medicine,” where AI, data and robotics enable faster, cheaper, and more personalized treatments.
