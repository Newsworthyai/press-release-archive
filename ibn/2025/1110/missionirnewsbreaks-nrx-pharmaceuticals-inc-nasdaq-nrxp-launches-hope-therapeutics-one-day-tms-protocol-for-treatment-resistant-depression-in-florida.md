# MissionIRNewsBreaks – NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP) Launches HOPE Therapeutics’ One-Day TMS Protocol for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Florida

NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), announced that its subsidiary, HOPE Therapeutics(TM), has initiated patient care using the Ampa “one day” (ONE-D) protocol for treatment-resistant depression—the first deployment of its kind in Florida and among the first nationwide. The Ampa device combines a single day of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with physician-prescribed D-cycloserine and lisdexamfetamine, which in peer-reviewed studies have shown response rates of 87% and remission rates of 72% in nonrandomized trials. Under the direction of Medical Director Dr. Rebecca Cohen, HOPE clinics in Sarasota, Naples, and Fort Myers are now offering the protocol, with six Florida locations expected by year-end. Dr. Cohen said the results “have the potential to change the paradigm of TMS therapy” from months-long regimens to a rapid, one-day approach that may transform care for millions battling depression and PTSD.
