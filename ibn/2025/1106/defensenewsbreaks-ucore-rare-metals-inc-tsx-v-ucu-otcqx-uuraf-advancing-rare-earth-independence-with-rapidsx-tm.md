 Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) is accelerating efforts to build a North American rare-earth supply chain using its RapidSX(TM) separation technology. With $18.4 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, Ucore is developing its Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana, aiming for early production in 2026. RapidSX offers a more efficient, modular, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional separation methods, positioning Ucore as a potential cornerstone in reducing Western dependence on China-sourced materials. Supported by state tax incentives and feedstock partnerships, Ucore’s initiative could help stabilize critical supply lines for industries ranging from defense and aerospace to electric vehicles and electronics, all facing mounting pressure amid China’s tightened export controls.
