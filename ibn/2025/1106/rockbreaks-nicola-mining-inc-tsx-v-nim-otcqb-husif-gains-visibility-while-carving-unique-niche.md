Disseminated on behalf of Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) and may include paid advertising.

 Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) gained exposure among global investors through its participation in the prestigious 2025 Precious Metals Summit in Beaver Creek, Colorado—considered one of the world’s premier independent investment forums for precious metals. A recent article discussing this reads, “Nicola’s participation at Beaver Creek comes at a crucial time. Based in British Columbia, Nicola Mining has positioned itself as a diversified junior with projects spanning gold, silver and industrial minerals. The company’s Treasure Mountain silver project and its Merritt Mill and Tailings facility stand out as strategic assets, particularly because the permitted mill provides processing capabilities that most junior miners lack. This infrastructure advantage not only differentiates Nicola but also positions the company as a potential hub for third-party ore processing, creating revenue opportunities beyond its own exploration success.”
