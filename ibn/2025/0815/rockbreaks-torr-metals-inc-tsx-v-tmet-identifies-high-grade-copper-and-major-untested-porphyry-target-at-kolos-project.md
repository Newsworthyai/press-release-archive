# RockBreaks – Torr Metals Inc. (TSX.V: TMET) Identifies High-Grade Copper and Major Untested Porphyry Target at Kolos Project

Torr Metals Inc. (TSX.V: TMET) reported results from an induced polarization survey and rock grab sampling at the Bertha Zone within its 332 km2 Kolos Copper-Gold Project in British Columbia. Sampling from the historical Bertha pit returned up to 16.9% copper and 8.48 g/t silver along a 30 m strike, with mineralization extending more than 450 m between the Bertha and Bertha South showings where no drilling has been recorded. The high-grade copper sits on the margin of a newly defined greater than 900 m by greater than 500 m IP chargeability anomaly that remains open in multiple directions. All six grab samples exceeded 1% copper, four topped 3%, and mineralization is hosted in the Nicola Group volcanic unit, suggesting a broad supergene-style blanket near a porphyry core. Torr also outlined a prime untested porphyry target southeast of the Bertha pit, where overlapping chargeability and resistivity anomalies coincide with a large hydrothermal alteration footprint.
