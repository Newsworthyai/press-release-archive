# MiningNewsBreaks – Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) Advances Integrated Approach in Broader Growth Strategy

Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) recently took a significant step in fostering industry collaboration and bolstering regional gold development with its $2 million line of credit to strategic partner Blue Lagoon Resources Inc. “The move reflects Nicola’s mission to support responsible mining initiatives in British Columbia and aligns with its vertically integrated approach that combines milling capabilities with financial facilitation,” an article discussing this reads. “This move exemplifies Nicola’s strategic model, which links its Merritt milling infrastructure and tailings facility to British Columbian projects. Merritt Mill stands as the only facility in British Columbia permitted to process third-party gold and silver mill feed from across the province. Since 2016, Nicola has entered into several profit-share agreements with mining companies, allowing its fully permitted mill to act as a critical partner, processing ore and providing liquidity for regional exploration partners. Extending a $2 million credit facility further advances this integrated approach by providing Blue Lagoon a flexible financial buffer as the company accelerates its growth.”
