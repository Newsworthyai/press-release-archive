# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) CEO Shares Bold Strategy on Exploring Mining Podcast

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) was recently featured on the Exploring Mining podcast, where new CEO Gordon Robb discussed a strategy that sets the company apart. As ESGold enters a transformational phase, Robb’s investor acumen and proven track record in scaling resource companies make him ideal to take the company to the next level, according to COO Paul Mastantuono.

 “The last four years that I’ve been doing this, the consistent theme of raising money, drilling holes, hoping the market recognizes it for an increased market cap, to continue to do it again, has seemed very repetitive, so this new approach has been very exciting,” Robb said during the podcast. He said that global instability resulting in higher prices for gold is creating a space where ESGold can thrive. “What investors are looking for is risk-off… We are fully permitted. We are very close to production — we have a mill onsite, we have tailings piles that are ready to be processed, and we just have a few more steps to get there to start producing, be cash-flow positive and then funnel that money into exploration…”
