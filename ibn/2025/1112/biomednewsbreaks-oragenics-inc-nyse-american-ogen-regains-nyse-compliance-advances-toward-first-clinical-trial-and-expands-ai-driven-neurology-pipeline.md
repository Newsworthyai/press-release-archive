 About Oragenics, Inc.

 Oragenics is striving to revolutionize neurological care through proprietary intranasal delivery technology that has the potential to enable targeted, non-invasive therapeutics for brain-related conditions. Our lead candidate, ONP-002, is advancing with the goal of becoming the first FDA-approved treatment for concussion, while our platform technology has the potential, we believe, to open pathways to address neurodegenerative diseases, CNS disorders, and other neurological conditions.

 We’re building more than a pharmaceutical company—we’re creating a movement around brain-first recovery that transforms how patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems approach neurological trauma.
