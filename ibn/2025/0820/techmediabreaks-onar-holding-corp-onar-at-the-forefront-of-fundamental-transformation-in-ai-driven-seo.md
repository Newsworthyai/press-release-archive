# TechMediaBreaks – ONAR Holding Corp. (ONAR) at the Forefront of ‘Fundamental Transformation’ in AI-Driven SEO

ONAR Holdings (OTCQB: ONAR) was featured in a recent Forbes article that highlights a new era of AI-driven search and advertising. In the interview, the company’s CEO Claude Zdanow explained how ONAR is leveraging its AI-powered technologies to help mid-market brands thrive in the age of conversational AI search. Speaking of the seismic pivot from traditional Google search toward AI-enhanced platforms, he explained, “We’re shifting from gaming Google’s algorithm to engaging in real-time AI searches that respond directly to what we ask. That’s the fundamental transformation unfolding right now… Language model optimization is about creating content that’s actually relevant and useful so that AI, not just a search engine, can interpret it, trust it, and serve it up as the best answer. It’s no longer about finessing the system. It’s about genuinely solving a user’s problem. . . . This shift isn’t just about changing tactics, it’s about changing intent. We must stop thinking in terms of algorithms and start thinking in terms of audiences. Moving forward, the question won’t be ‘How do I get ranked?’ but rather: ‘How do I help someone?’”
