# MissionIRNewsBreaks – Newton Golf Company Inc. (NASDAQ: NWTG) Is Pushing the Boundaries of Performance in Growing Market

Newton Golf Company (NASDAQ: NWTG) is positioned for opportunity as the global golf equipment market is on track to expand from $28.55 billion in 2024 to $35.29 billion in 2029. “Specialty categories, such as custom shafts and premium putters, are among the fastest-growing segments, as seasoned players invest in performance upgrades and new golfers seek accessible, game-improving gear. Against this backdrop of unprecedented growth, Newton Golf is emerging as a brand that both reflects and accelerates the industry’s evolution. Known for its precision-engineered shafts and patented putter technologies, Newton Golf is redefining modern golf performance,” reads a recent article. “The company’s Newton Motion Shaft, launched in late 2023, has become a favorite shaft of Tour Champions. In part, this popularity is due to the shaft’s proprietary DOT System(TM), a flex redefinition that adapts to player swing speed for improved accuracy and distance. Meanwhile, the Gravity Putter, introduced in fall 2024, features Ultra Low Balance Point (‘ULBP’) technology for elite putting control and tighter roll dispersion.”
