# NetworkNewsBreaks – Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA) Highlighted in Italian Press for Juve Stabia Player Development, Market Value Surge

Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA), an Ireland-based company pursuing a multi-club football ownership strategy, was recognized in Gazzetta dello Sport for the strong youth development results of its majority-owned Serie B club Juve Stabia. Known as “The Other Team of Naples,” Juve Stabia advanced to the Serie A promotion playoffs last season under sporting director Matteo Lovisa and coach Ignazio Abate, while fielding one of Serie B’s youngest squads with an average age of 24.3. Separately, Virgilio Sport reported the club achieved the highest market value increase in Serie B, up 245% year over year to about $32 million, driven by on-field success and social media engagement. Brera said the gains underscore Juve Stabia’s growing competitiveness and provide investors exposure to the club’s rising valuation through Brera’s Nasdaq-listed shares.

Building on the legacy of Brera FC, which it acquired in 2022, the Company aims to create opportunities for tournament prizes, sponsorships, and professional consulting services. Brera FC, recognized as “The Third Team of Milan,” has been crafting an alternative football legacy since its founding in 2000. The club also organizes the FENIX Trophy, a nonprofessional pan-European tournament acknowledged by UEFA. This tournament, which has been referred to as “the Champions League for Amateurs” by BBC Sport, has garnered significant media coverage, including from ESPN.

 In its efforts to broaden its reach, Brera expanded into Africa in March 2023 by establishing Brera Tchumene FC in Mozambique, which quickly rose to the First Division after winning its post-season tournament. In April 2023, the Company acquired a 90% stake in the North Macedonian first-division team Fudbalski Klub Akademija Pandev, now known as Brera Strumica FC. Additionally, in June 2023, Brera made a strategic investment in Manchester United PLC, realizing a 74% gain. The Company further diversified its portfolio in July 2023, assuming control of Bayanzurkh Sporting Ilch FC, a Mongolian National Premier League team, which became Brera Ilch FC, and in September 2023 by establishing a joint stock company for the North Macedonian women’s football club Tiverija Strumica, now known as Brera Tiverija FC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brera Strumica FC, in June 2024.

 On December 31, 2024, Brera executed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in the corporate capital of SS Juve Stabia srl, the company which manages the Italian Serie B football club Juve Stabia, also known as “The Other Team of Naples”.
