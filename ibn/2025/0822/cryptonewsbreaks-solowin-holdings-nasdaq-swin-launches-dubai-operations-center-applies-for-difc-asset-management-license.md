# CryptoNewsBreaks – Solowin Holdings (NASDAQ: SWIN) Launches Dubai Operations Center, Applies for DIFC Asset Management License

Solowin (NASDAQ: SWIN), a financial services firm providing solutions across traditional and digital assets, announced the launch of its Dubai Operations Center and the start of its application for a Category 3C asset management license from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). The move builds on Solowin’s recent collaboration with CITIC Construction in Saudi Arabia and expands the Company’s compliant financial services footprint in the Middle East. Solowin also signed a memorandum of understanding with a UAE-based enterprise to accelerate market entry through established client networks. DIFC was chosen for its regulatory advantages, including a mutual recognition framework with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, which could streamline approval in as little as three months. CEO Peter Lok said the new hub strengthens connectivity between the Middle East and Asia and supports Solowin’s vision for a cross-regional “digital financial silk road.”
