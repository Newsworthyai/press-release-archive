# Researchers Say Gravity Energy Storage is Possible in High-Rise Buildings

Researchers from the University of Waterloo in Canada have introduced an exciting idea that could change how energy is stored in cities. They believe that high-rise buildings can be used to store renewable energy through a gravity-based system. This technology could work together with solar panels, small wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries to make buildings more energy-efficient and less dependent on the grid.

 Who knows, the cutting-edge technologies that are being focused on by enterprises like D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) could make this energy system a…
