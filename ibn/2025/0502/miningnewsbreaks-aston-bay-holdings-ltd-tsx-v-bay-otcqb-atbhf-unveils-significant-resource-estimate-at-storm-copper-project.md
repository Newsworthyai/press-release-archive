# MiningNewsBreaks – Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) Unveils Significant Resource Estimate at Storm Copper Project

Aston Bay (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF), a mineral exploration company focused on high-grade metals deposits, is emerging as a key player in the critical copper and silver sectors. The company recently announced its Initial Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) for its Storm Copper Project on Somerset Island in Nunavut, Canada. With copper and silver playing vital roles in the global transition to clean energy and advanced technologies, the project’s substantial near-surface mineralization—8.2 million tonnes of indicated resources and 3.3 million tonnes of inferred resources—positions Aston Bay to capitalize on this growing demand. The project’s strategic importance cannot be overstated, particularly as the world faces growing concerns over securing critical mineral supply chains. As Aston Bay advances exploration and development, the Storm Copper Project is poised to become a contributor to meeting future supply needs.
