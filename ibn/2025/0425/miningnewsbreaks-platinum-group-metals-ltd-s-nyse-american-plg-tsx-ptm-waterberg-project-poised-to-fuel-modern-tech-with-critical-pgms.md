Platinum Group Metals (NYSE American: PLG) (TSX: PTM) is strategically positioning itself to become a key player in the expanding platinum group metals (“PGMs”) sector, driven by the essential role of PGMs in next-gen technology and industrial applications. PGMs serve critical functions in catalytic converters, fuel cells, catalysts in various industrial processes, electronics and the medical sector. These metals are also expected to play an even more crucial role in advancing sustainable technologies amid global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The company’s Waterberg Project, located in South Africa’s renowned Bushveld Complex, is a large-scale, low-cost, bulk-mineable deposit with a particular focus on palladium, platinum, rhodium and gold as well as byproduct copper and nickel. Expected to be a game-changer for Platinum Group Metals, the project offers a substantial resource base and the opportunity to develop a high-margin operation that can supply PGMs to meet growing global demand.
