The collaboration embeds NVIDIA’s GPU and simulation technologies deep within Micropolis’s robotics ecosystem, enhancing the performance, safety, and adaptability of its autonomous platforms… As part of the partnership, Micropolis is integrating NVIDIA’s GPUs and Orin edge computing modules into its unmanned ground vehicles. These systems handle core robotic functions, including perception, decision-making, and navigation, directly onboard rather than through cloud servers… By processing data in real time, the robots can detect objects, plan paths, and predict environmental behaviors with low latency. This enables safe and efficient operation even in bandwidth-limited or remote settings such as industrial sites, border zones, and urban environments.”
