 Fairchild Gold (TSX.V: FAIR) (OTC: FCHDF) recently announced a memorandum of understanding to acquire the Golden Arrow Project in Nevada’s Walker Lane Belt for US$5 million, “adding 420,000 ounces of historic gold resources” and expanding its Nevada landholding by 170%. An article discussing this forecasts gold to reach $5,000 an ounce gold within a year, creating strong conditions for exploration companies. The Golden Arrow Project, discovered in 1905 and located “just 96 kilometers east of Kinross Gold Corporation’s Round Mountain Gold Mine,” will join Fairchild’s Nevada Titan Project to form a consolidated portfolio in a Tier-1 jurisdiction. Executive Chairman Nikolas Perrault stated, “Our approach is simple—build value through high-quality, strategically located assets, advance them responsibly, and align exploration with strong market fundamentals.” With recent financing of C$1.1 million and a strengthened technical team led by Guy Lauzier, Fairchild is “positioned for a new gold paradigm” as it builds a scalable, technically sound presence in Nevada’s prolific gold district.
