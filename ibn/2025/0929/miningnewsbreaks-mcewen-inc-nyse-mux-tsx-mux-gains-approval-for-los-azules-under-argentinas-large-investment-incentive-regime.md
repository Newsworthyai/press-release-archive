# MiningNewsBreaks – McEwen Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Gains Approval for Los Azules Under Argentina’s Large Investment Incentive Regime

McEwen (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) announced that its Los Azules copper project in San Juan Province has been approved to participate in Argentina’s Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), as confirmed by Minister of Economy Luis Caputo. The designation consolidates a US$2.672 billion investment plan covering exploration, construction, and operations, marking a historic step for the project, which is set to become Argentina’s first producer of high-purity copper cathodes.

 The RIGI approval affirms both the technical and financial strength of Los Azules and its sustainability model, which emphasizes renewable energy, minimal water use, and long-term contributions to local development. Los Azules is projected to generate over US$30 billion in export revenues, create significant employment, and boost provincial and national tax inflows. “This approval reinforces McEwen Copper’s long-term commitment to Argentina and the Province of San Juan,” said Michael Meding, Vice President of McEwen Copper and General Manager of the Los Azules Project.
