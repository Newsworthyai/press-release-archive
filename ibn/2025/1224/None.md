# CryptoNewsBreaks – Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) Says Reg A Offering Nearly Fully Subscribed

Metavesco (OTC: MVCO) announced that its Regulation A offering is approximately 99% subscribed, an uncommon outcome for an OTC-listed issuer given that the offering was priced at $0.0008 per share, matching the Company’s closing market price at qualification in July rather than being discounted. The Company said its common stock is now trading at roughly double the original offering price, with subscription interest coming from both existing and new shareholders, including several larger retail investors, reflecting continued engagement with Metavesco’s strategy, communications, and development of its OTCfi ecosystem.
