 Lahontan Gold (TSX.V: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) was featured in a recent article that discussed acceleration of its flagship Santa Fe Mine, located in Nevada. The company is “organizing a reverse-circulation drill rig to conduct a strategic drill program aimed at upgrading and expanding the project’s shallow oxide reserve. Lahontan, known for its position within the Walker Lane trend, is shifting its focus from broad resource definition to more technical groundwork that precedes mine planning and permitting, indicating progress in Santa Fe’s efforts towards mineral exploitation… Lahontan currently has a program of 25 drill holes summing up to 4,000 meters with a focus on the York and Slab zones. These areas contain near-surface oxidation mineralization where previous drilling has shown extensive silver-gold potential. The coming RC campaign is designed to transform resources from the inferred to the indicated category while spreading its overall resource tentacles, setting the company up for economic and engineering evaluation in 2026.”
