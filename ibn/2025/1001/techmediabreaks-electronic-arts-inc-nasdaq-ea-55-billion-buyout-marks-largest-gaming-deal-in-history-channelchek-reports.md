# TechMediaBreaks – Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) $55 Billion Buyout Marks Largest Gaming Deal in History, Channelchek Reports

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), publisher of Madden NFL, Battlefield and The Sims, will be acquired for $55 billion in the largest leveraged buyout ever attempted, according to Channelchek, a Noble Financial Group digital market platform. Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners will pay $210 per share to take EA private, surpassing the $32 billion TXU utility buyout in 2007. If completed, the transaction would end EA’s 36-year history as a publicly traded company, which began with its 1989 IPO at a split-adjusted 52 cents per share.

 The deal comes as EA faces stagnant revenues and growing competition, particularly following Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023. The move highlights accelerating consolidation across the gaming industry and positions EA to restructure under private ownership without the short-term pressures of public markets.
