# TechMediaBreaks – Vision Marine Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: VMAR) Sets Standard in High-Performance E-Boat Space

Vision Marine Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: VMAR) was featured in a recent article that discusses its positioning and commitment to revolutionizing the boating experience. The company “has long demonstrated its leadership in marine electrification, with its E-Motion(TM) 180E-powered vessel holding the world record for the fastest electric boat. Set at the annual Lake of the Ozarks Shootout in Missouri, the record shows that VMAR’s craft reached an astonishing speed of 116 mph, surpassing its own previous record of 109 mph, set in 2022. This enduring achievement continues to underscore Vision Marine’s commitment to innovation and excellence in the electric marine industry.”

 “We’re in a bold new development and training phase, and Vision Marine is becoming the reference in America for electric boating,” said VMAR CEO and cofounder Alexandre Mongeon. “When we broke the record, we proved that electric boating can compete at the highest levels of performance. Today, that same technology is validated and available to customers through Florida’s strongest dealer platform. We remain faster than 80% of ice boats at the Ozarks, underscoring our enduring performance edge, while building a sustainable foundation that creates lasting value for investors. Once the record is challenged, we will return with determination to push the boundaries even further.”
