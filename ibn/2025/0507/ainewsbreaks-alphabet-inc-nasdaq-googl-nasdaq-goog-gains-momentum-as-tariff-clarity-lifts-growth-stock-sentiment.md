# AINewsBreaks – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Gains Momentum as Tariff Clarity Lifts Growth Stock Sentiment

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw its stock decline following reports that Apple is in discussions to integrate OpenAI’s artificial intelligence technology into its Safari browser, a move that could challenge Google’s dominance in web search. Apple is reportedly exploring the incorporation of AI search features in the upcoming iOS 18, and while talks with Google continue regarding its Gemini AI, a potential shift to OpenAI’s technology could disrupt the long-standing partnership that currently makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices. Investors are reacting to the possibility that Apple may diversify or even reduce its reliance on Google’s search tools.

 As of the latest trading session, Alphabet’s Class C shares are down 2.8%, trading near $165.12.
