# AINewsBreaks – Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) Slips After Buyback Cut, but Analysts See Long-Term Strength

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares pulled back following news that the company reduced its share repurchase activity in the March quarter, triggering concern among short-term investors. While Apple still authorized a record $110 billion in future buybacks, the actual spending in the most recent quarter was lower than prior periods. Analysts argue that the stock reaction may be shortsighted, as the company continues to generate substantial cash flow and remains focused on long-term capital return strategies. The pullback also comes as Apple prepares to unveil new AI features and potentially reshape its search partnerships, further boosting its strategic positioning.

 As of the latest session, Apple shares are trading at approximately $185.47, down about 0.9% from the previous close.
