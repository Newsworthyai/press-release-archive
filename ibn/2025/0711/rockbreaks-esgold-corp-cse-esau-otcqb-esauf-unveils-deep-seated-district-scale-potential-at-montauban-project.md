# RockBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Unveils Deep-Seated District-Scale Potential at Montauban Project

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) announced results from its recent Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) survey at the Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec, revealing deep geological structures that suggest district-scale mineralization potential. The survey, conducted by Caur Technologies, exceeded initial targets by imaging down to 1,200 meters and identifying vertically extensive, laterally continuous features indicative of a possible Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) system. Preliminary interpretations highlight a north-central feeder zone and structural contrasts across the project, offering high-priority exploration targets. ESGold is integrating these findings with over 950 historic drill holes and VTEM data into a new 3D geological model. Director André Gauthier noted that Montauban could evolve from a shallow deposit into a vertically integrated system with global-scale potential.
