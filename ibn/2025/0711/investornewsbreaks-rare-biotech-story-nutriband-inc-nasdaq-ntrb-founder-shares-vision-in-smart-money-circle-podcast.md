# InvestorNewsBreaks – Rare Biotech Story: Nutriband Inc. (NASDAQ: NTRB) Founder Shares Vision in Smart Money Circle Podcast

Nutriband (NASDAQ: NTRB) was recently featured on the Smart Money Circle Show, where Serguei Melnik, NTRB’s founder and president, unveiled his no-nonsense approach to biotech entrepreneurship. Standing in stark contrast to the conventional playbook are his grounded tone and unwavering focus on long-term value. An article discussing this reads, “Unlike most early-stage biotech companies, Nutriband generates revenue today. The company operates a manufacturing facility in North Carolina that produces the Active Intelligence tape used by Reebok, among others. The company also recently launched a mosquito-repelling patch, now approved for sale in Costa Rica. Melnik and his team personally tested the product by trekking through the Talamanca Mountain range without a single mosquito bite in four days… Melnik isn’t just a president; he’s a founder with skin in the game… His grounded mindset, passion for innovation, and unwillingness to compromise on shareholder value position Nutriband as a rare biotech story, one led by integrity, resilience, and vision that is nearing some critical milestones that could serve as significant catalysts to corporate value.”
