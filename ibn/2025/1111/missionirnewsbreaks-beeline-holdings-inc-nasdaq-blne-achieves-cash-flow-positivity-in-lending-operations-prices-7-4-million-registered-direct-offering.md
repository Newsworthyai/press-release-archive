# MissionIRNewsBreaks – Beeline Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLNE) Achieves Cash Flow Positivity in Lending Operations, Prices $7.4 Million Registered Direct Offering

Beeline Holdings (NASDAQ: BLNE), the emerging digital mortgage lender and SaaS platform, today announced that its lending entity achieved cash flow positivity in October, positioning the company to reach overall cash flow positivity by Q1 2026. The company also priced its $7.4 million registered direct offering of 4,620,000 shares of common stock, expected to close on or about Nov. 12, 2025, subject to customary conditions. Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. acted as sole placement agent. With a debt-free balance sheet since September, Beeline does not anticipate further capital raises to fund operations. Its scalable, AI-driven SaaS mortgage platform has produced roughly 30% quarterly revenue growth and a 91% year-to-date unit increase. “Our diversified platform is attracting a lot of attention from borrowers and partners,” said Nick Liuzza, co-founder and CEO. “With our recent financial developments, I can now focus almost exclusively on generating revenue.” Proceeds will support general corporate purposes, working capital, warehouse requirements, and redemption of Series E Preferred Stock, avoiding the issuance of approximately 800,000 shares through non-dilutive execution.
