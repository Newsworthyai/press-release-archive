# GreenEnergyBreaks — Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) Achieves Breakthrough With U.S.-Produced NdPr Oxide Validated for EV Motors

Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), a leading U.S. producer of uranium, rare earth elements and other critical minerals, announced that high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide from its White Mesa Mill in Utah has been successfully manufactured into commercial-scale rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) by South Korea’s largest drive unit motor core producer. The REPMs passed all QA/QC benchmarks for use in EV drive units sold to major automakers worldwide. This milestone establishes a U.S.-based “mine-to-magnet” supply chain independent of China, with Energy Fuels’ NdPr oxide validated for high-temperature drive units expected in EVs and hybrids within months. CEO Mark Chalmers said the achievement demonstrates Energy Fuels’ ability to deliver commercial-grade rare earth materials, with plans to add heavy rare earth oxide capacity at White Mesa in 2026.
