# BioMedNewsBreaks — VolitionRx (NYSE American: VNRX) Signs Deal with Worldwide Leader in Specialized Diagnostics

VolitionRx Ltd. (NYSE American: VNRX) (“Volition”), a multi-national epigenetics company, announced a Research License and Exclusive Commercial Option Rights Agreement with Werfen’s Immunoassay Technology Center to assess antiphospholipid syndrome (“APS”) using Volition’s Nu.Q H3.1 Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (“NETs”) assay on Werfen platforms.

 “We are proud to have entered into this agreement with Werfen, as we implement our strategy to out license our proprietary Nu.Q NETs test to large worldwide companies to leverage their knowledge of specific diseases, product development, regulatory experience and their installed base of proprietary analyzers,” said Gael Forterre, Chief Commercial Officer at Volition.

 Marta Palicio, Werfen’s Immunoassay Technology Center Innovation R&D Director, commented, “We have already successfully transferred the Nu.Q NETs assay to our ACL AcuStar platform. Early results in NETs levels detection in APS patients with the Nu.Q test are encouraging. We are excited to validate further and complete a clinical utility study to determine the potential role of this marker as a risk indicator of thrombosis in APS patients, allowing a better management of this very complex syndrome. This could open the possibility to enlarge Werfen’s portfolio in APS testing.”

 APS is a complex autoimmune disorder affecting around 4 million people and typically diagnosed via two positive antibody tests at least 12 weeks apart. Volition believes its Nu.Q® NETs test is the first CE-IVD biomarker being investigated in APS and could improve both decision-making and ongoing patient monitoring.
