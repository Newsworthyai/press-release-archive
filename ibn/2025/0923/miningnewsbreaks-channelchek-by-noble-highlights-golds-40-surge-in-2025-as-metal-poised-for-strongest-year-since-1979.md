# MiningNewsBreaks – Channelchek by Noble Highlights Gold’s 40% Surge in 2025 as Metal Poised for Strongest Year Since 1979

Channelchek, a Noble Financial Group, Inc. product and service, reports that gold futures climbed near $3,750 per ounce and spot bullion held above $3,700 on Monday, extending a rally that has pushed prices more than 40% higher year-to-date. The surge, fueled by Federal Reserve rate cuts, a weaker U.S. dollar, record inflows into gold ETFs, and steady central bank buying, has positioned gold for its strongest annual performance in nearly half a century. Against this backdrop, companies such as ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) and LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) continue to attract investor attention as part of the broader gold exploration and development landscape. Analysts, including Goldman Sachs, see potential for the metal to reach $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026 as investors increasingly turn to gold for safety and diversification.
