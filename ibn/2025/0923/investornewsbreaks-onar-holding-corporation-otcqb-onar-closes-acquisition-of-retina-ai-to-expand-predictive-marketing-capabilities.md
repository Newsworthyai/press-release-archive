# InvestorNewsBreaks – Onar Holding Corporation (OTCQB: ONAR) Closes Acquisition of Retina AI to Expand Predictive Marketing Capabilities

Onar (OTCQB: ONAR), an AI-powered marketing technology company and agency network, announced it has closed the acquisition of Retina AI, a marketing intelligence platform specializing in early, individual-level customer lifetime value prediction. Structured as an all-stock, 100% preferred share deal, the transaction follows ONAR’s recent acquisition of JUICE, a top-ranked performance agency. Retina, which previously generated more than $2 million in annual recurring revenue, brings advanced deep-learning CLV and ROI modeling to ONAR’s technology stack. The Company plans to drive adoption by integrating Retina’s models across existing agency clients, including JUICE’s enterprise roster, while re-engaging historical Retina customers. CEO Claude Zdanow said the back-to-back acquisitions create immediate cross-sell opportunities, enhance ROI visibility for clients, and position ONAR for scalable revenue growth.
