# BioMedNewsBreaks – HeartBeam Inc.’s (NASDAQ: BEAT) First-of-Its-Kind Cable-Free ECG Offers Multi-Angle Signal Capture

As clinicians increasingly recognize the value of accurate at-home electrocardiogram (“ECG”) capture, HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT) is positioned at the forefront of this transformation. The company’s FDA-cleared HeartBeam System is the first cable-free ECG device that captures the heart’s signals from three distinct directions and is designed to be a groundbreaking solution for at-home detection and monitoring of arrhythmias. “HeartBeam’s proprietary system allows for high-fidelity measurements without the complexity of conventional equipment. Unlike standard devices that capture electrical signals from limited perspectives, HeartBeam’s patented approach records from three distinct angles, enabling a more complete view of the heart’s electrical activity. This expanded data capture is intended to improve diagnostic precision, particularly for arrhythmias that may be missed with traditional methods. Additionally, the patient can always have the device with them and take a recording at the time of symptom onset, potentially reducing any delays in care.”
