# MiningNewsBreaks – Foremost Clean Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT) Begins Radon Survey at Wolverine Uranium Site in Athabasca Basin

Foremost Clean Energy (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT) has launched a radon geochemical survey at its Wolverine Uranium Property in northern Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, near the Cigar Lake Mine. The program targets a known structural offset in the sub-Athabasca unconformity—an area linked to high-grade uranium deposits. CEO Jason Barnard said the initiative aims to refine subsurface models and define key drill targets. Wolverine spans 12,444 acres and is part of a collaboration with Denison Mines Corp. (TSX: DML, NYSE American: DNN). Historical drilling has revealed uranium in faulted basement pegmatite, with unconformity depths between 140 and 300 meters.
