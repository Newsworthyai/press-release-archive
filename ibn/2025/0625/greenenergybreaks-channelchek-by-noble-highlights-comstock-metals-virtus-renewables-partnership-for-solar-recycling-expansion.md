# GreenEnergyBreaks — Channelchek by Noble Highlights Comstock Metals–Virtus Renewables Partnership for Solar Recycling Expansion

Channelchek, a Noble Financial Group, Inc. product and service, highlights the latest strategic developments from companies across the small and microcap space.

 Comstock Metals has entered a strategic partnership with Virtus Renewables Service Group Inc. to jointly offer recycling, decommissioning, and logistics solutions tailored to the renewable energy sector. By combining Comstock’s certified zero-landfill solar panel recycling capabilities with Virtus’s expertise in solar and battery storage operations, the alliance will provide full-lifecycle, environmentally responsible services across the U.S. renewable market.

 The partnership builds on Comstock’s April 2025 agreement with RWE Clean Energy, one of the largest renewable operators in the U.S., and marks another milestone in Comstock’s rapid commercial expansion. The company recently secured local approval for expanded solar panel storage near its upcoming industrial-scale facility in Silver Springs, Nevada, which is expected to begin commissioning in Q1 2026.
