# MiningNewsBreaks – Foremost Clean Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT) Launches Airborne Survey at Athabasca Basin Uranium Property

Foremost Clean Energy (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT), an emerging uranium and lithium exploration company, has engaged Expert Geophysics Surveys Inc. to conduct a 771 line-kilometer MobileMT airborne geophysical survey over its CLK Uranium Property in northern Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin. The survey aims to refine subsurface mapping and identify deep conductive trends associated with uranium mineralization, building on 1997 drilling that intersected mineralization at depths exceeding 860 meters. The MobileMT system offers 1–2 kilometer depth penetration and is designed to detect basement conductors, structural breaks, and other features essential to Athabasca-style uranium exploration. Results will guide a planned 2,000-meter drilling program in Q3 2025. Foremost holds an option to acquire up to a 70% interest in the CLK Property from Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE American: DNN).
