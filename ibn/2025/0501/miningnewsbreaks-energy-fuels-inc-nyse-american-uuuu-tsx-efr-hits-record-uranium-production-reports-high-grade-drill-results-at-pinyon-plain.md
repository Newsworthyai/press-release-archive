Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) reported record uranium mining rates at its Pinyon Plain mine in April, extracting 4,604 tons of ore containing approximately 151,400 pounds of uranium at an average grade of 1.64% eU₃O₈. This marks the highest monthly production since mining began and suggests significantly greater uranium yields than previously estimated. The company also released promising drill results from the Juniper Zone, including intercepts as high as 20.11% eU₃O₈. CEO Mark Chalmers stated these results could lead to increased reserves, lower costs and position Pinyon Plain as the leading U.S. uranium mine in the coming years.
