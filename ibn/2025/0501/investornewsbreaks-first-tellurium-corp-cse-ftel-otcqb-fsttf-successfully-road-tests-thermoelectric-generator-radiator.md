First Tellurium (CSE: FTEL) (OTCQB: FSTTF) announced that its majority-owned subsidiary, PyroDelta Energy, has completed over 800 miles of successful road testing for its thermoelectric generator/radiator, which uses tellurium to convert waste heat into electricity. The device, which replaces both the alternator and radiator in combustion engine vehicles, features no moving parts, improves fuel efficiency, and can be installed without modifying vehicle designs. CEO Tyrone Docherty said the results exceeded expectations, and Head Engineer Michael Abdelmaseh highlighted its adaptability for both new and existing vehicles. The company also noted potential applications in data centers and EVs. A shareholder luncheon will be held May 21 in Vancouver to discuss the innovation and exploration plans at the Deer Horn property.
