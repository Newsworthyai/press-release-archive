# NetworkNewsBreaks – HeartBeam Inc.’s (NASDAQ: BEAT) ECG System Offers Real-Time Cardiac Insights

HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT) is positioned amid limitations of traditional 12-lead electrocardiogram (“ECG”) systems, often including cumbersome setups and restricted accessibility. The company “is addressing these challenges by developing the HeartBeam System, the first cable-free, high-fidelity ECG system that captures the heart’s electrical signals from three distinct directions and synthesizes the signals into a 12-lead ECG, enabling comprehensive arrhythmia assessment outside clinical settings. This innovative approach aims to revolutionize cardiac care by providing patients with the ability to monitor their heart health conveniently and accurately,” reads a recent article. “The HeartBeam System’s design emphasizes user friendliness and portability. The device is the size of a credit card, making it easy for patients to use at home or on the go. Patients can capture their ECG by placing the device on their chest for 30 seconds, after which the data is transmitted securely to an on-call cardiologist for review. This streamlined process enables timely interventions when necessary.”
