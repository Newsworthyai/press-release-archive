# InvestorNewsBreaks – Copper’s Moment: Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) Taps Rising Demand with BC Projects and Custom Mill

Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF), a junior exploration and custom milling company, is poised for opportunity as copper emerges as the “gold standard” for strategic investments. A recent article discussing this reads, “With its growing project portfolio in British Columbia and a renewed focus on copper alongside precious metals, Nicola Mining brings both mission and method to a sector defined by urgency and opportunity… Copper’s rise from industrial workhorse to investment favorite is driven by its critical role in the global clean-energy and infrastructure transition. According to the International Energy Agency, global power grid investment is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025, building on a record $390 billion spent in 2024… The combination of copper’s ascendancy as a strategic asset, clear demand pressures and evolving supply dynamics means that juniors with promising copper acreage and scalable infrastructure stand to benefit significantly. Nicola already brings a custom mill into play, plus staking in high-potential terrain.”
