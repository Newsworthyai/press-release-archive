# RockBreaks – Fairchild Gold Corp. (TSX-V: FAIR) Reports Copper Grades up to 34% at Nevada Titan Project

Fairchild Gold (TSX-V: FAIR) announced the discovery of numerous high-grade copper values, including assays up to 34% Cu with associated anomalous molybdenum, at its Nevada Titan Project in the historic Goodsprings Mining District. Recent fieldwork has also outlined a 1.5-kilometer copper corridor and identified a hydrothermal breccia pipe consistent with porphyry-related systems, reinforcing the project’s large-scale mineral potential.

 The company has engaged MWH Geophysics to conduct a drone magnetic survey beginning Sept. 30, 2025, to refine future exploration targeting. CEO Luis Martins said the results, combined with elevated molybdenum assays, highlight the strong porphyry affinity of the system, while Executive Chairman Nikolas Perrault noted the Nevada Titan project represents a powerful mineralized environment “hiding in plain sight, misunderstood and overlooked” for decades.
