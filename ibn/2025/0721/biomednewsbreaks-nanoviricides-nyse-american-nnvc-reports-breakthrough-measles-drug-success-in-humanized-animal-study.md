# BioMedNewsBreaks — NanoViricides (NYSE American: NNVC) Reports Breakthrough Measles Drug Success in Humanized Animal Study

NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE American: NNVC), a clinical-stage developer of broad-spectrum antivirals using host-mimetic nanomedicine, announced promising results for NV-387, its lead drug candidate, in treating Measles. In a lethal respiratory infection model using humanized mice, NV-387 increased survival by 130%—from 7.4 to 17 days—with no observed toxicity and dose-dependent efficacy. The drug mimics human cell features to bind and neutralize viruses, targeting over 90% of human pathogens. With global Measles cases surging and vaccine coverage declining, the Company emphasized the urgent need for a therapeutic option. “NV-387 is on its way to become the very first drug to treat Measles,” said Anil R. Diwan, PhD.

 About NanoViricides Inc.

 NanoViricides is a development-stage company that is creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The company’s novel nanoviricide(TM) class of drug candidates and the nanoviricide(TM) technology are based on intellectual property, technology and proprietary know-how of TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company has a Memorandum of Understanding with TheraCour for the development of drugs based on these technologies for all antiviral infections. The MoU does not include cancer and similar diseases that may have viral origin but require different kinds of treatments. The company has obtained broad, exclusive, sub-licensable, field licenses to drugs developed in several licensed fields from TheraCour Pharma, Inc. The company’s business model is based on licensing technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. for specific application verticals of specific viruses, as established at its foundation in 2005. NanoViricides’ lead drug candidate is NV-387, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that the company plans to develop as a treatment of RSV, COVID-19, Long COVID, influenza, and other respiratory viral infections, as well as MPOX/Smallpox infections. The company is currently focused on advancing NV-387 into Phase II human clinical trials. NanoViricides’ other advanced candidate is NV-HHV-1 for the treatment of Shingles. The company cannot project an exact date for filing an IND for any of its drugs because of dependence on a number of external collaborators and consultants. NV-CoV-2 (“API NV-387”) is the company’s nanoviricide drug candidate for COVID-19 that does not encapsulate remdesivir. NV-CoV-2-R is NanoViricides’ other drug candidate for COVID-19 that is made up of NV-387 with remdesivir encapsulated within its polymeric micelles.
