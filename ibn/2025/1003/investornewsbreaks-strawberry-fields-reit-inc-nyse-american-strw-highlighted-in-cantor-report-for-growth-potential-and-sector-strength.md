The report pointed to the company’s strict investment criteria, including minimum lease rates, long-term agreements and strong rent coverage, as a foundation for stable cash flows and disciplined growth.

 Cantor emphasized Strawberry Fields’ unique access to capital via the Tel Aviv exchange and noted that M&A opportunities could provide further upside if organic growth is limited. With consistent revenue growth, a dividend yield above 5% and demonstrated rent collection strength, the firm described STRW as an “incubating micro-cap story” offering distinct appeal within the Skilled Nursing REIT sector and trading at an attractive valuation relative to peers.
