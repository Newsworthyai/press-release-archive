# Web3MediaBreaks – Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani at All-In Summit Highlights Future of Internet Capital Markets

At the 2025 All-In Summit, hosted by the All-In Podcast team of Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg, Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani outlined his vision for the future of internet capital markets. He described how scalable blockchains, new regulatory frameworks, and SEC modernization efforts are aligning to replace outdated financial intermediaries with 24/7, permissionless, global systems secured by cryptography.

 Samani emphasized that internet capital markets will converge traditional securities, tokenized assets, and DeFi protocols into unified “super apps,” expanding real-time access to investors worldwide. He noted that 2025 marks a generational inflection point where technology and regulation are finally synchronized, creating the foundation for finance to become an internet-native primitive embedded across media, sports, and social platforms.
