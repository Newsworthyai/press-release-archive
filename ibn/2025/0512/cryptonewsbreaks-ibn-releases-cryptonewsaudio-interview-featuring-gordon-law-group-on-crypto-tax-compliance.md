# CryptoNewsBreaks – IBN Releases CryptoNewsAudio Interview Featuring Gordon Law Group on Crypto Tax Compliance

IBN, is pleased to announce the latest CryptoCurrencyWire audio production featuring Andrew Gordon, Managing Attorney of Gordon Law Group, a firm that focuses on helping individuals and businesses navigate the intricate world of digital asset taxation, including NFTs and DeFi. In the interview, Gordon outlines key steps for maintaining tax compliance in the crypto space, stressing that investors using multiple exchanges must take responsibility for gathering and organizing all relevant records. He notes that recordkeeping is a basic but crucial element of compliance, especially in a space where standardization across platforms is lacking.

 Gordon also highlights the longstanding IRS requirement to report crypto as property, dating back to 2014, and the increasing visibility the agency now has into digital transactions. He explains how individuals can come into compliance by amending prior tax returns or using formal channels like the IRS Voluntary Disclosure Program. With the IRS now receiving data from a growing number of sources, including foreign exchanges, Gordon warns that enforcement efforts are ramping up—many taxpayers are already receiving warning letters. He encourages those affected to act proactively and seek professional guidance before more serious actions are taken.
