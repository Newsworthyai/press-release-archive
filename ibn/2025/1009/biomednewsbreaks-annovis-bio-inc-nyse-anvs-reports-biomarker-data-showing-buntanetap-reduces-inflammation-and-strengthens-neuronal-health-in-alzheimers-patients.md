Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS), a late-stage clinical drug platform company developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, announced new results showing that buntanetap reduced key inflammatory biomarkers and improved neuronal integrity in Alzheimer’s patients. Data from the Phase 2/3 study demonstrated lower levels of IL-5, IL-6, S100A12, IFN-γ, and IGF1R in treated patients versus placebo, along with reduced neurofilament light chain (NFL), suggesting improved cellular health and potential disease-modifying effects. CEO Maria Maccechini said the findings confirm buntanetap’s multi-targeted mechanism and validate earlier preclinical and clinical results, advancing confidence in its potential to deliver meaningful therapeutic benefit.
