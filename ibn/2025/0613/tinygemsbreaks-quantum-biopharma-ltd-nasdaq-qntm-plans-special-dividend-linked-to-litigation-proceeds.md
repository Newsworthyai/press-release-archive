# TinyGemsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) Plans Special Dividend Linked to Litigation Proceeds

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) announced plans to issue a special dividend in the form of Contingent Value Rights (“CVRs”) to holders of its Class B Subordinate Voting Shares on a 1:1 basis. The CVRs will entitle shareholders to a pro rata share of between 10% and 50% of any net proceeds recovered from the company’s pending $700 million+ litigation against several banks over alleged stock manipulation. The payout percentage will be set by the board at a later date. CEO Zeeshan Saeed stated the CVRs aim to align shareholder interests with potential legal outcomes. The CVRs will be non-tradable, non-voting, and only payable in cash if funds are ultimately recovered. The record date has yet to be announced.
