Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) announced new preclinical data showing its lead candidate, Telomir-1, significantly reversed neurological, liver, and kidney symptoms in a genetic animal model of Wilson’s disease, a rare disorder caused by copper accumulation. In zebrafish mimicking human pathology, Telomir-1 delivered a 4- to 5-fold reduction in tremors, normalized movement behaviors, cut liver copper levels by 50%, improved organ histopathology, and restored key liver biomarkers to wild-type levels. The drug also improved survival under copper stress, supporting its copper-regulating mechanism. Telomir plans to file its first IND by year-end and begin human trials in 2026.

 About Telomir Pharmaceuticals

 Telomir Pharmaceuticals is a preclinical stage pharmaceutical company seeking to lead development in longevity science in both humans and animals. The company is focused on the development of Telomir-1, a novel small molecule designed to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps, which are crucial in the aging process. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents humans and pet animals with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize Telomir-1, proposed to be dosed orally, with the broader aim of promoting longevity and enhancing overall quality of life.
