# InvestorNewsBreaks – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Trades Below S&amp;P 500 Amid “Value Trap” Debate

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is currently valued at ~19× forward earnings—below the S&P 500 average of 22.5×—making it the cheapest of the “Magnificent Seven” and sparking discussion about whether its low price represents value or a potential trap. While its search dominance is under siege from AI challengers like ChatGPT and regulatory pressure could force asset divestitures, Alphabet also boasts strong assets—YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo—plus a $70 billion share buyback plan and reliable dividend yield that suggest hidden upside.

 As of 5:00 p.m. ET on June 11, 2025, Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) is trading at $179.13, down $0.88 (―0.49%), with intraday highs and lows between $181.88 and $178.85, on volume of 9.97 million shares.
