# MiningNewsBreaks – American Tungsten Corp. (CSE: TUNG) (OTCQB: DEMRF) (FSE: RK9) Publishes NI 43-101 Report and Outlines Summer 2025 Drill Plans for Ima Mine

American Tungsten (CSE: TUNG) (OTCQB: DEMRF) (FSE: RK9) has released its NI 43-101-compliant technical report for the Ima Mine in Idaho and is finalizing the scope and budget for its summer 2025 exploration program. The program will include rehabilitation of the D level to support underground drilling and bulk sampling for metallurgical testwork. Exploration targets include extensions of the No. 5 and No. 7 veins, the southwest continuation of the West Ima vein, the Eastern Vein system, and deeper portions of the main Ima vein, with additional upside potential across Patterson Creek. CEO Ali Haji noted that historical drilling by Gentor and Inspiration outside previously mined zones presents compelling, low-risk opportunities for expanding known mineralization. The company emphasized that target grades and tonnages are conceptual, based on unverified historical data, and that further exploration is needed to define any mineral resources.
