# RockBreaks – Fathom Nickel Inc. (CSE: FNI) (FSE: 6Q5) (OTCQB: FNICF) Expands Gochager Lake Property, Postpones Field Program Due to Saskatchewan Wildfires

Fathom Nickel (CSE: FNI) (FSE: 6Q5) (OTCQB: FNICF) has expanded its Gochager Lake Property in Saskatchewan through additional staking, driven by reinterpretation of historic VTEM survey data and regional geological analysis identifying new nickel-copper-cobalt, VMS-style zinc-lead-silver, and gold exploration opportunities. The newly acquired claims include targets along the Gochager Trend and Borys VMS Trend, as well as gold-bearing quartz veins reporting up to 2.68 g/t Au. However, due to ongoing wildfires in north-central Saskatchewan, the company has postponed its planned summer field program. CEO Ian Fraser emphasized the strategic importance of the expansion and expressed support for residents and first responders affected by the wildfire crisis.
