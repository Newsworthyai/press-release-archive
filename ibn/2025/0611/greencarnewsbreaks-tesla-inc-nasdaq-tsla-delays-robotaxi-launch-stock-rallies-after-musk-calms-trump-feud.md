# GreenCarNewsBreaks – Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Delays Robotaxi Launch, Stock Rallies After Musk Calms Trump Feud

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced a tentative June 22 debut of its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, following Elon Musk’s temporary retreat from a public spat with former President Trump. Musk indicated the launch date could shift as the company remains “super paranoid about safety.” Investor optimism returned, with analysts pointing to the rollout as a pivotal step toward scaling its autonomous ride-hailing ambitions—even as questions remain about regulation, cost structure, and execution.

 As of market open on June 11, 2025, TSLA traded at around $??? (insert exact number via live data), up approximately X% from the previous close, marking its third consecutive day of gains fueled by the narrowed Musk–Trump feud and renewed confidence in the upcoming robotaxi launch.
