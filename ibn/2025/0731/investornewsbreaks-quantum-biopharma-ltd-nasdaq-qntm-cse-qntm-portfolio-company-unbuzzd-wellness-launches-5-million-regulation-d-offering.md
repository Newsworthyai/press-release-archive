# InvestorNewsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) Portfolio Company Unbuzzd Wellness Launches $5 Million Regulation D Offering

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM), a biopharmaceutical company focused on building innovative biotech assets, announced that portfolio company Unbuzzd Wellness Inc. has launched a Regulation D 506(c) offering to raise up to US$5 million to fund growth and advance toward a potential initial public offering. The capital raise will not dilute Quantum BioPharma shareholders due to an anti-dilution provision that maintains its 25% ownership in Unbuzzd until the beverage company reaches a $1 billion valuation. Unbuzzd, maker of unbuzzd(TM), a beverage designed to accelerate alcohol metabolism, restore mental clarity and reduce hangover symptoms, has partnered with MZ Digital and Dealmaker to run the campaign, which accepts both traditional and cryptocurrency investments. CEO John Duffy said the raise will support direct-to-consumer, distributor and retail expansion, while Board Co-Chair Gerry David highlighted the partnership as a step toward positioning Unbuzzd for a future IPO.
