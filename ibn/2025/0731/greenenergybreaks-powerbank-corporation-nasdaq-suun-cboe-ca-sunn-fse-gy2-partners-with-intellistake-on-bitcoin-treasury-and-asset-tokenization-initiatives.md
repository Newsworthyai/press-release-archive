# GreenEnergyBreaks — PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) Partners with Intellistake on Bitcoin Treasury and Asset Tokenization Initiatives

Disseminated on behalf of PowerBank Corporation

 PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2), a leader in clean energy infrastructure, has entered a strategic partnership with Intellistake Technologies Corp. (CSE: ISTK) to pursue initiatives at the intersection of digital assets, energy and tokenized finance. The collaboration includes establishing a Bitcoin-based Digital Asset Treasury Program, with Intellistake providing custody and treasury management support, and exploring the tokenization of PowerBank’s clean energy assets or shares as a financing alternative. PowerBank CEO Dr. Richard Lu said the partnership aims to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the emerging digital economy as institutions move toward tokenized real-world assets. Intellistake CEO Jason Dussault called tokenization “an inevitability,” aligning the effort with forecasts projecting the RWA (“Real-World Assets”) market to reach $30 trillion by 2034.
