# BillionDollarBreaks – D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) Launches Advanced Cryogenic Packaging Initiative to Scale Quantum Processor Development

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software and services, announced a strategic initiative focused on advanced cryogenic packaging to accelerate development of both its gate-model and annealing quantum processors. The effort builds on D-Wave’s superconducting packaging expertise and aims to expand multichip capabilities and manufacturing processes to support larger, more powerful quantum systems.

 Leveraging superconducting bump-bond technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, D-Wave has demonstrated end-to-end superconducting interconnects between chips, which D-Wave believes is a key step in scaling its annealing and fluxonium-based gate-model architectures. Chief Development Officer Trevor Lanting said the initiative positions D-Wave to advance its product roadmap toward 100,000 qubits and further extend its leadership in quantum systems technology.
