# BioMedNewsBreaks — Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) Completes Targeted Enrollment for Phase 2 HARMONIC Trial in Japan

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), an AI-driven developer of targeted cancer therapies using its proprietary RADR(R) platform, has completed targeted enrollment for its Phase 2 HARMONIC(TM) clinical trial in Japan ahead of schedule, enrolling 10 patients across five sites including the National Cancer Center Japan. The trial evaluates LP-300 with carboplatin and pemetrexed in never-smoker non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have progressed after tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CEO Panna Sharma said the milestone validates the company’s international expansion strategy into regions with higher prevalence of never-smoker NSCLC such as Japan and Taiwan, where enrollment continues alongside U.S. sites. The global trial aims to enroll approximately 90 patients and builds on early U.S. data showing an 86% clinical benefit rate, including a durable complete response lasting nearly two years.
