# ESGBreaks – Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) Launches Summer Field Program at Epworth Copper-Silver-Zinc-Cobalt Project

Aston Bay (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) has begun its summer field program at the Epworth sediment-hosted copper-silver-zinc-cobalt project, located 80 km southeast of Kugluktuk, Nunavut. The campaign will focus on the southern portion of the property where a 2024 Mobile MagnetoTelluric survey outlined deep conductors up to 900 m below surface and near-surface anomalies interpreted as potential traps for metal-bearing fluids within the Recluse Group shales. Exploration will also target dolomites of the Lower Rocknest Formation and clastic rocks of the Upper Odjick Formation, both prospective for sediment-hosted copper mineralization. Initial mapping and prospecting have identified multiple copper zones associated with the MT anomalies, with further work planned over several high-priority areas in the coming weeks.

 About Aston Bay Holdings Ltd.

 Aston Bay is a publicly traded mineral exploration company exploring for high-grade copper and gold deposits in Virginia, USA, and Nunavut, Canada. The company is currently exploring the Storm Project property and Cu-Ag-Zn-Co Epworth property in Nunavut, as well as the high-grade Buckingham Gold Vein and critical metals prospects in central Virginia. The company is also in advanced stages of negotiation on other lands with high-grade copper potential in North America. The company and its joint venture partners, American West Metals Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. (collectively, “American West”), formed a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture in respect of the Storm Project property, which hosts the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit. Under the unincorporated joint venture, Aston Bay shall have a free carried interest until American West has made a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study, meaning American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such decision is made. After such decision is made, Aston Bay will be diluted in the event it does not elect to contribute its proportionate share and its interest in the Storm Project property will be converted into a 2% net smelter returns royalty if its interest is diluted to below 10%.
