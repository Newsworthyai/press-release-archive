# InvestorNewsBreaks – Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Achieves Biological Efficacy in Phase 2a SGX945 Study for Behçet’s Disease

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing products for rare diseases, has completed its Phase 2a proof of concept study evaluating SGX945 (dusquetide) in Behçet’s Disease, meeting the objective of demonstrating biological efficacy. In the open-label trial, SGX945 achieved a 40% improvement in the primary ulcer endpoint versus a historical placebo group from the apremilast (Otezla(R)) Phase 3 study, matching or exceeding apremilast outcomes despite treatment stopping at four weeks. Seven of eight patients reported reduced ulcer duration, number and pain, with benefits persisting through the follow-up period and no treatment-related adverse events reported. CEO Christopher J. Schaber said the results support advancing SGX945, including reformulation for home-based subcutaneous administration, as part of a broader strategy to address unmet needs in Behçet’s and other innate immune-related inflammatory conditions.
