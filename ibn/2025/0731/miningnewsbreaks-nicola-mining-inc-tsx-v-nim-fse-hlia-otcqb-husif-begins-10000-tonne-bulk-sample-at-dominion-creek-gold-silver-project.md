The Company has completed site preparations, including installation of a 14-man camp, bridge construction, equipment mobilization and roadwork, with extraction scheduled to begin following road improvements expected to conclude by August 10. Nicola received a draft permit in March to extract 10,000 tonnes of high-grade gold and silver ore from Dominion, where earlier surface and chip samples returned assays of 62.1 g/t Au and 320 g/t Ag along with significant lead and zinc values. CEO Peter Espig said the launch marks the culmination of years of work and underscores growing support for small high-grade projects in BC from First Nations, local communities and provincial ministries.
