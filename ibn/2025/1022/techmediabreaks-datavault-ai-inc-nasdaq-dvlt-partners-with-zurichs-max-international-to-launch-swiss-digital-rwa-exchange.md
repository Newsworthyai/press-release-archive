# TechMediaBreaks – Datavault AI Inc. (NASDAQ: DVLT) Partners with Zurich’s Max International to Launch Swiss Digital RWA Exchange

Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT), a pioneer in turning data into measurable, tradeable assets, announced a strategic partnership with Zurich-based Max International AG to launch the Swiss Digital RWA Exchange, a next-generation marketplace for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The collaboration unites Switzerland’s century-old financial precision and regulatory trust with Datavault AI’s patented data-tokenization technology. Max International will operate and manage the exchange under Swiss digital regulatory frameworks, providing institutional investors with a secure, compliant entry point into digital asset markets. For Datavault AI, the initiative marks another step in its mission to monetize previously untapped assets—from unmined commodities to digital likeness rights—by addressing long-standing barriers of regulation, scalability, and fiduciary trust. Armed with global patents for secure data tokenization and automated compliance, Datavault AI aims to transform how real-world value is authenticated, verified, and transacted at the speed of data.
