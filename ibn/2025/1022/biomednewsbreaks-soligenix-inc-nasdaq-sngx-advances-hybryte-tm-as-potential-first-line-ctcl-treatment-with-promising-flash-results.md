# BioMedNewsBreaks — Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Advances HyBryte(TM) as Potential First-Line CTCL Treatment with Promising FLASH Results

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX) is continuing to build momentum in the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) through promising results from its pivotal FLASH trial and ongoing FLASH 2 confirmatory study. HyBryte(TM)—a novel, non-UV light-activated therapy using synthetic hypericin—has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy and safety, offering hope in a field where therapeutic innovation has lagged. In the original FLASH study, nearly half of patients showed meaningful response at 18 weeks, and interim results from an independent University of Pennsylvania study reported a 75% response rate. FLASH 2 builds on these findings with improved design while addressing regulatory requirements for confirmatory evidence. If successful, “HyBryte could become the first approved front-line therapy for early-stage CTCL, reshaping standards of care and strengthening Soligenix’s position as a leader in rare dermatologic oncology.”
