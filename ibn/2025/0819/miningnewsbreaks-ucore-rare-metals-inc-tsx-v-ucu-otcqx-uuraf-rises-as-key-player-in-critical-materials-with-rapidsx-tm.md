# MiningNewsBreaks – Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Rises as Key Player in Critical Materials with RapidSX(TM)

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) was featured in a recent article that discussed its positioning as the U.S. military faces mounting global tensions and technological threats, and a quiet revolution unfolds in North America’s critical materials landscape, one powered by rare earth elements and a bold new refining technology. The piece indicates that Ucore “has emerged as a central player in this effort with its cutting-edge RapidSX(TM) platform, a next-generation separation technology now backed by the U.S. Department of Defense through an $18.4 million award. This investment underscores the Pentagon’s push to strengthen domestic supply chains for essential components used in missiles, fighter jets and radar systems — and Ucore is poised to deliver… By establishing a rapid-response, scalable HREE processing chain in North America, Ucore supports defense-grade magnet commodity security, broad-based high-tech manufacturing and geopolitical resilience. This model aligns perfectly with the Pentagon’s strategic objectives under its Industrial Base and Sustainability program, while reducing reliance on adversarial-state supply chains. The company is steadily advancing from demonstration to full commercial readiness, aiming to integrate RapidSX machines in both Canada and the United States, including planned future strategic metals complexes.”
