# AINewsBreaks – Helping SMEs Think Big: BluSky AI Inc. (BSAI) Bridges Infrastructure Gap

BluSky (OTC: BSAI) is focused on enabling small and mid-sized businesses to join the AI revolution. The company was featured in a recent article that discusses this, stating, “According to Forbes, three out of five SMBs plan to deploy AI within two years, but many lack access to the infrastructure required to do so. BluSky’s modular approach helps solve that. Whether it’s a startup training for its first large model or a university researching new applications, SkyMod units offer right-sized solutions that can grow with demand, and without the overhead of building and managing a traditional data center… BluSky AI’s modular data centers offer more than convenience. They represent a fundamental shift in how computing infrastructure is deployed, managed, and scaled; and they may be one of the most important building blocks in the entire AI value chain. As more AI use cases enter the mainstream, and as energy constraints continue to mount, BluSky’s forward-thinking approach is timely and vital.”
