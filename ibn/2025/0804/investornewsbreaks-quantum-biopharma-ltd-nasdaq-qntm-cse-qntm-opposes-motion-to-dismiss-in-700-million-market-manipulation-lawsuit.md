# InvestorNewsBreaks – Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) Opposes Motion to Dismiss in $700 Million Market Manipulation Lawsuit

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) has filed a memorandum of law opposing a joint motion to dismiss submitted by CIBC World Markets and RBC Dominion Securities in U.S. District Court. The filing responds to a June motion to dismiss Quantum’s amended complaint, which alleges that the defendants and others engaged in market manipulation through “spoofing” between January 1, 2020, and August 15, 2024, violating federal securities laws. Quantum seeks more than $700 million in damages. The case is being pursued on a contingency basis by Christian Attar and Freedman Normand Friedland LLP, who allege the defendants spoofed the market hundreds of times, artificially depressing Quantum’s stock, which once traded above $460 per share. The company believes additional banks or brokers may be involved and remains open to a potential resolution.
