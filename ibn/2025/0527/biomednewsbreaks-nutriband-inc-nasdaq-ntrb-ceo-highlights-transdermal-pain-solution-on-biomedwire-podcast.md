# BioMedNewsBreaks – Nutriband Inc. (NASDAQ: NTRB) CEO Highlights Transdermal Pain Solution on BioMedWire Podcast

Nutriband (NASDAQ: NTRB) is featured in the latest episode of The BioMedWire Podcast, part of IBN’s expanding podcast network focused on biotech and pharmaceutical innovation. In a conversation with host Carmel Fisher, Nutriband Co-Founder and CEO Gareth Sheridan outlined the company’s focus on transdermal drug delivery systems, particularly in the underserved area of pain management. Sheridan emphasized the impact of the opioid crisis on patient access to effective medications, noting that the stigma and liability concerns surrounding opioids have left many pain patients without adequate care. He introduced AVERSA(TM), Nutriband’s internally developed platform designed to deter abuse of opioid patches by making them difficult to manipulate for non-medical use.

 Sheridan highlighted the dramatic contraction in the fentanyl patch market—from $4 billion in 2016 to under $1 billion today—despite the persistent size of the patient population needing these therapies. Nutriband aims to close this care gap by improving safety while maintaining accessibility. The interview offers insight into the company’s development pipeline and how AVERSA(TM) may help restore prescriber and payer confidence in transdermal opioid therapies. The podcast episode reflects IBN’s continued commitment to showcasing innovators across the life sciences industry.
