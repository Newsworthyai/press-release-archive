# MiningNewsBreaks – LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) Eyes Sulphide-Rich Mineralized Zone in Swanson Drill Core

LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) is advancing its two gold projects in the heart of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt close to Val-d’Or, Québec, a globally renowned gold district. The company began drilling in early July, recently announcing that it had completed seven diamond drill holes totaling 1,764 meters. Three of these “had been sampled, sawn, and sent to the assay laboratory for analysis of the geological, geophysical, and geochemical targets up to 3 km from the Swanson Gold Deposit and along strike of a major structural break,” reads an article discussing this. “We are very encouraged by the early progress of the Swanson drilling program and the geological and mineralization similarities seen in the recent drill core to the known Swanson Gold Deposit,” LaFleur CEO Paul Ténière stated. “We’re particularly optimistic about the mineralized zone encountered in hole SW-025-038 (a sulphide-rich zone known to be at least 17.9 meters wide) and we look forward to releasing assay results in the near future.”
