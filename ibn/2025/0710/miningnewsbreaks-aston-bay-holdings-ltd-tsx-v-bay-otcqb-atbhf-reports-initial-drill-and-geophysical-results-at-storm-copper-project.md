# MiningNewsBreaks – Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) Reports Initial Drill and Geophysical Results at Storm Copper Project

Aston Bay (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) today announced preliminary results from its 2025 exploration program at the Storm Copper Project on Somerset Island, Nunavut, operated by American West Metals under a 20/80 joint venture. Early results from a magnetotelluric (MMT) geophysical survey identified several large conductive anomalies aligned with known copper mineralization, reinforcing the project’s potential. Initial diamond drilling at the Cyclone Deeps target intersected 47 meters of visual sulfide mineralization, consistent with the distal edge of the Cyclone Deposit, suggesting proximity to a fault-offset continuation. The program benefits from support through Nunavut’s Discover Invest Grow (DIG) program, emphasizing both regional backing and copper’s strategic importance to the energy transition.

 About Aston Bay Holdings Ltd.

 Aston Bay is a publicly traded mineral exploration company exploring for high-grade copper and gold deposits in Virginia, USA, and Nunavut, Canada. The company is currently exploring the Storm Project property and Cu-Ag-Zn-Co Epworth property in Nunavut, as well as the high-grade Buckingham Gold Vein and critical metals prospects in central Virginia. The company is also in advanced stages of negotiation on other lands with high-grade copper potential in North America. The company and its joint venture partners, American West Metals Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. (collectively, “American West”), formed a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture in respect of the Storm Project property, which hosts the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit. Under the unincorporated joint venture, Aston Bay shall have a free carried interest until American West has made a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study, meaning American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such decision is made.
