# InvestorNewsBreaks – Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) Secures $3M Equity Investment to Advance Age-Reversal Pipeline

Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO) announced a $3 million equity investment from The Bayshore Trust, the company’s largest shareholder, through the purchase of 1 million restricted shares at $3.00 each—an 18% premium to the stock’s prior closing price. The raise brings total equity investment from affiliated entities to $4 million, complemented by an undrawn $5 million non-dilutive credit line. CEO Erez Aminov emphasized the company’s commitment to shareholder-friendly financing with no warrants or toxic structures. Telomir is advancing two key drug candidates: Telomir-1, a first-in-class age-reversal molecule with broad therapeutic potential, and Telomir-Ag2, a stabilized Silver(II) compound targeting drug-resistant infections. An IND submission for Telomir-1 is planned by year-end, with a focus on rare disease indications to demonstrate early efficacy.

 About Telomir Pharmaceuticals

 Telomir Pharmaceuticals is a preclinical stage pharmaceutical company seeking to lead development in longevity science in both humans and animals. The company is focused on the development of Telomir-1, a novel small molecule designed to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps, which are crucial in the aging process. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents humans and pet animals with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize Telomir-1, proposed to be dosed orally, with the broader aim of promoting longevity and enhancing overall quality of life.
