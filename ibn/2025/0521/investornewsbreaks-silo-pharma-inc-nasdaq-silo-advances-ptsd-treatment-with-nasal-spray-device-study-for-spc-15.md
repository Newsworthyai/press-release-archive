# InvestorNewsBreaks – Silo Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: SILO) Advances PTSD Treatment with Nasal Spray Device Study for SPC-15

Silo Pharma (NASDAQ: SILO) announced a service agreement with Resyca BV to conduct a drug-device study on the microchip-enabled nasal spray system used in its lead PTSD treatment candidate, SPC-15. The study is intended to provide the final device data needed for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA later this year. CEO Eric Weisblum noted the device’s ability to bypass the blood-brain barrier, potentially allowing faster and safer therapeutic delivery. Silo is also progressing two other SPC-15 studies, including a GLP-compliant toxicology study and a 7-day large animal safety trial requested by the FDA.
