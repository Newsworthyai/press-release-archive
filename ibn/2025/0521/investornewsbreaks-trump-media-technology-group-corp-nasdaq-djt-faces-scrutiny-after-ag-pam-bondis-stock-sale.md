# InvestorNewsBreaks – Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT) Faces Scrutiny After AG Pam Bondi’s Stock Sale

Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) is under scrutiny following revelations that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of the company’s shares on April 2, 2025—the same day President Donald Trump announced significant new tariffs that led to a market downturn. Bondi’s financial disclosure forms indicate the transactions occurred on that date, though it’s unclear whether they were made before or after the market closed. The timing has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, especially given Bondi’s prior consultancy role with Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that merged with Trump Media to take it public. While Bondi was obligated to divest her holdings within 90 days of her confirmation as attorney general, the specific timing of the sale has prompted calls for further investigation.

 As of 1:17 PM EST on May 21, 2025, Trump Media & Technology Group’s stock is trading at $19.45, reflecting a 2.1% increase from the previous close.
