# GreenCarNewsBreaks – Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Plans Geofenced Robotaxi Launch in Austin Amid Safety Concerns

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is set to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June 2025, starting with a limited fleet of approximately 10 vehicles and aiming to scale up to 1,000 within a few months. The rollout will be invite-only and will utilize teleoperators to assist when the autonomous system encounters difficulties. CEO Elon Musk emphasized that the robotaxis will be geofenced to operate only in selected safe areas and will avoid complex intersections unless the system is highly confident in their safety. This cautious approach follows a Business Insider report detailing a test where Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Supervised software ran a red light in San Francisco. Musk criticized the comparison, arguing that the test did not accurately reflect the performance of the autonomous software intended for robotaxis, which will be FSD Unsupervised.

 As of 1:29 PM EST on May 21, 2025, Tesla’s stock is trading at $354.11, reflecting a slight decrease of $1.73 (0.49%) from the previous close.
