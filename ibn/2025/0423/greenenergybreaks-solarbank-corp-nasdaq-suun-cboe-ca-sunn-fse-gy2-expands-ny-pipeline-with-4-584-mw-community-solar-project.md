Disseminated on behalf of SolarBank Corporation

 SolarBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) announced plans to develop a 4.584 MW DC ground-mount solar project in upstate New York, known as the Forest Hill Rd project. The site lease is secured, and an interconnection study is in progress. Once completed, the project will operate as a community solar initiative and is eligible for New York’s VDER rate mechanism and NYSERDA NY-Sun incentives. SolarBank emphasized its supply chain resilience, noting that its operations are unaffected by the U.S. tariff hikes on Southeast Asian solar imports. The company continues sourcing panels from cost-competitive regions such as the Middle East and North America.
