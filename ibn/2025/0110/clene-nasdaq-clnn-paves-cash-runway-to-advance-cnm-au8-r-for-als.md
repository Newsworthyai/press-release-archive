# Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) Paves Cash Runway to Advance CNM-Au8(R) for ALS

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Clene Nanomedicine Inc., is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving mitochondrial health and protecting neuronal function to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The company recently secured a new $10 million debt facility, which enables the payoff of another higher interest rate loan and the finance of operations to generate additional data to support the new drug application of lead drug candidate CNM-Au8 for ALS.

 “We believe that the proceeds from this new debt facility, including an extended interest-only period, will allow Clene the cash runway to generate the additional data the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has requested from our expanded access programs,” said Clene CEO and President Rob Etherington. “The data are being gathered to support the existing clinical study data for inclusion in an application seeking approval of CNM-Au8 for ALS through the accelerated regulatory pathway.”
