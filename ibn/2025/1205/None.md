 * Powermax Minerals has completed a 1,409-line-kilometre high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric survey over its Atikokan REE Property in northwestern Ontario.
* The survey, conducted by Geo Data Solutions GDS Inc., met Natural Resources Canada and IAEA standards for data quality.
* Results will help refine structural and lithological interpretations and guide exploration targeting in an underexplored segment of the Atikokan metasedimentary belt.
* The Atikokan project is one of four REE properties Powermax is advancing across Canada and the United States.
* Rising global demand for rare earth elements continues to strengthen the case for new domestic supply in stable jurisdictions.

 Powermax Minerals (CSE: PMAX) (OTCQB: PWMXF), a Canadian mineral exploration company, has taken another step forward in its rare earth exploration efforts in northwestern Ontario, announcing the completion of a high-resolution airborne geophysical survey at its Atikokan REE Property. The helicopter-borne magnetic and radiometric survey, carried out by Geo Data Solutions GDS Inc., covered 1,409 line kilometers and was designed to improve geological understanding and identify potential mineralized zones across the 9,416-hectare property, according to a recent company release (https://ibn.fm/Sj3NY).

 The survey used 50-meter line spacing and 500-meter tie lines to generate detailed magnetic and gamma-ray spectrometric datasets. The Eurocopter Astar 350BA+ maintained an average clearance of 44 meters, allowing for consistent data acquisition across varied terrain. All work was completed under Natural Resources Canada and International Atomic Energy Agency airborne spectrometry standards, the company said.

 Magnetic noise levels remained within acceptable limits, GDS reported, while GPS accuracy and drape-following performance contributed to stable readings. Calibration of potassium, thorium, and uranium signatures produced consistent results likely to support the identification of lithological changes and possible mineralized systems within the Atikokan metasedimentary belt.

 Powermax CEO Paul Gorman said the dataset would help define structural trends that influence rare earth mineralization. “Completion of this high-resolution airborne survey marks a major step forward in advancing our Atikokan REE Property. The quality of the data is excellent and will allow us to enhance our understanding of the structural framework that controls mineralization in this underexplored part of the Atikokan metasedimentary belt,” Gorman added. “We look forward to integrating these geophysical results with ongoing geological interpretation and ground follow-up work.”

 Post-flight data processing was conducted using Geosoft Montaj and Praga NASVD software to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Deliverables include digital databases, GeoTIFF maps, and terrain models at 1:30,000 scale. Powermax plans to use the combined datasets to establish drill-ready targets for trenching or diamond drilling in a subsequent phase of exploration.

 The Atikokan property lies within a structurally active corridor between the Wabigoon and Quetico sub-provinces, areas known for granitic rare earth and lithium-bearing pegmatites. The company optioned the project as part of a broader strategy to develop rare earth assets across multiple North American jurisdictions.

 Powermax is currently progressing four rare earth element projects. In British Columbia, its Cameron project sits south of Revelstoke and has returned total rare earth oxide values of up to 1,943 ppm in Phase 1 sampling. In Wyoming, the company’s Ogden Bear Lodge project borders the Bear Lodge district, an area receiving interest from the U.S. Department of Energy and export credit agencies. Powermax also recently optioned the Pinard property in Ontario, located within a prospective alkaline intrusive complex.

 The company’s exploration portfolio is expanding against a backdrop of intensifying rare earth demand. Global market projections point to substantial growth, with the sector expected to increase from US$3.95 billion in 2024 to US$6.3 billion by 2030 (https://ibn.fm/RwOyh). Consumption of rare earth oxides is forecast to rise from 59,000 tonnes in 2022 to 176,000 tonnes by 2035 as electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics manufacturing continue to scale (https://ibn.fm/Nq7a0).

 Supply concentration remains high. China accounts for about 60% of mining output and 90% of processing capacity. Recent export curbs have heightened supply-chain risks and reinforced the strategic value of rare earth development in stable jurisdictions such as Canada and the United States.

 Policy support is strengthening as well. In 2025, Canada continued deploying capital through its Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, while the U.S. expanded Defense Production Act funding to stimulate domestic rare earth and magnet supply chains. These initiatives aim to accelerate project development and reduce reliance on foreign processing.

 Powermax’s multijurisdictional rare earth strategy, combined with policy momentum, positions it to benefit from a market increasingly driven by electrification and security-of-supply considerations. The company expects to complete further data interpretation in the coming months, followed by ground-based work to assess identified anomalies. Whether the Atikokan property advances toward drilling will depend on the integration of the current survey with geological and geochemical findings already underway.
