# DefenseNewsBreaks – Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI) Highlighted in Northland Capital Markets Report on AI Integration With Red Cat Black Widow Drone

Safe Pro Group (NASDAQ: SPAI) was featured in a Northland Capital Markets research report that reaffirmed its Outperform rating and $13 price target. The report, authored by analyst Michael Latimore, detailed Red Cat’s announcement to embed Safe Pro’s small object threat detection AI into its Black Widow drone, significantly expanding its ability to detect over 150 types of small threats including landmines and unexploded ordnance.

 Northland noted the integration could allow real-time battlefield threat mapping and communications without requiring drones to return to base, creating strong demand potential among military customers. The firm expects Safe Pro to generate licensing fees similar to Palantir’s VNav software, with upgrade opportunities across Red Cat’s Army SRR program and future drone deployments.
