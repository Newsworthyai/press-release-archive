ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) is featured in a NetworkNewsAudio release titled “When the Dollar Blinks, Real Assets Take Center Stage,” which examines renewed investor focus on miners and metals as inflation and currency volatility reshape market dynamics. The segment highlights that miners-focused ETFs have attracted strong inflows as institutional investors reassess earnings power and valuation multiples across the sector. ESGold’s tailings-first strategy at its Montauban project in Quebec positions it to capitalize on this environment, offering a low-capex, high-margin model that aims to generate early cash flow while minimizing dilution risk—key traits increasingly rewarded in a strengthening metals cycle.
