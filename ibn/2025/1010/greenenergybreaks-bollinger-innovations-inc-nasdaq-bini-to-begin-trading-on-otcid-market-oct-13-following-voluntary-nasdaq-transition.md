# GreenEnergyBreaks — Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) to Begin Trading on OTCID Market Oct. 13 Following Voluntary Nasdaq Transition

Bollinger Innovations (NASDAQ: BINI), an electric vehicle manufacturer, announced that its common stock will begin trading on the OTCID market, part of the broader OTC Markets, effective Oct. 13, 2025, under the same ticker symbol, BINI. The move is designed to provide greater operational flexibility and reduce compliance-related costs while maintaining transparency and investor engagement through the OTC’s enhanced disclosure standards. The transition follows the company’s decision to withdraw from the Nasdaq hearings process after receiving notice of noncompliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). Bollinger expects its stock to be suspended from Nasdaq at the open on Oct. 13 and immediately commence trading on OTCID. The company said the shift will enable more efficient resource allocation to expand its commercial EV footprint while continuing to evaluate OTC market tiers, potential international listings, and a possible future return to a national exchange.
