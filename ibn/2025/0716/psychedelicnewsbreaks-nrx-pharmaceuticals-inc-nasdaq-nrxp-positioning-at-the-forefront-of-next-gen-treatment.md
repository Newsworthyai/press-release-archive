NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is executing a dual growth strategy focused on expanding its national network of mental health clinics through its subsidiary, HOPE Therapeutics, and advancing its proprietary NMDA-based therapies toward FDA approval. HOPE recently announced plans to deploy $10.3 million in total acquisition capital to purchase clinics that provide interventional psychiatric care focused on neuroplastic therapies like transcranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) and ketamine. The clinics are projected to generate $15 million in 2025 revenue, with additional acquisitions in discussion that could add another $20 million. At the same time, NRx is progressing NRX-100, a preservative-free IV ketamine therapy for suicidal depression, and NRX-101, an oral therapy for bipolar depression with suicidality or akathisia—both of which have received expedited regulatory designations from the FDA.
