Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) is positioning as the U.S. takes aggressive steps to secure domestic sources of rare earth elements (“REEs”)—materials essential for defense systems, electronics and clean energy. A recent article discusses Ucore’s significant milestone in this effort, indicating the company secured an $18.4 million funding agreement from the U.S. Department of Defense (‘DoD’) to support the development of its domestic rare earth processing facility. “The project represents a major step toward American independence in the global REE supply chain, which is currently dominated by China… Ucore’s Strategic Metals Complex (‘SMC’) in Alexandria, Louisiana, aims to become a cornerstone of American rare earth processing capability. The SMC will utilize Ucore’s Proprietary RapidSX(TM) technology, which offers a more efficient and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional solvent extraction methods… The plant is designed to separate both light and heavy REEs, including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, which are crucial for permanent magnets used in electric motors and defense systems.”
