# MissionIRNewsBreaks – RADR(R) Platform Powers Lantern Pharma Inc.’s (NASDAQ: LTRN) Push Into Rare Pediatric Brain Cancer Treatment

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) is developing a number of clinical trials, using its proprietary drug candidates and computational biology and machine learning platform, to target conditions with unmet medical needs. The company was featured in a recent article that discussed its preparation for the launch of a trial targeting a rare pediatric disease, planned for Q1 2026. This comes “in the wake of its optimistic meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) to receive critical guidance on the company’s trial design and the FDA’s regulatory pathway… Lantern Pharma is developing its clinical trial with the hope of demonstrating the efficacy of its investigational therapy LP-184/STAR-001 in combatting central nervous system (‘CNS’) cancers, including Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (‘ATRT’). The LP-184/STAR-001 therapy is designed to work synergistically with diuretic (water pill) spironolactone and other potential combination regimens in treating the childhood brain cancers,” reads the article. “Lantern’s program for ATRT has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, and the company is preparing to submit an investigational new drug (‘IND’) amendment.”

 “We are thrilled with the constructive dialogue and positive feedback from our Type C meeting with the FDA,” said Lantern President and CEO Panna Sharma. “This guidance not only reinforces our trial design but also highlights the potential of our AI platform, RADR(R), in identifying and optimizing combination regimens like spironolactone for these devastating pediatric CNS cancers.”
