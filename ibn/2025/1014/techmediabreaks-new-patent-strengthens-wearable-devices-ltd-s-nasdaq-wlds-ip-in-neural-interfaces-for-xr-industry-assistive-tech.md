# TechMediaBreaks – New Patent Strengthens Wearable Devices Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: WLDS) IP in Neural Interfaces for XR, Industry, Assistive Tech

Wearable Devices (NASDAQ: WLDS, WLDSW) was granted a new U.S. patent that protects groundbreaking neural interface technology that measures weight, torque, and force directly from wrist-based sensors with applications spanning XR, industrial automation, and assistive technology. This was featured in a recent article that reads, “The patent encompasses voice-controlled interfaces and innovations in brain-computer interfaces, strengthening the company’s intellectual property position in the rapidly expanding $260 billion AI wearables market… WLDS’s newly granted patent titled ‘Gesture and Voice-Controlled Interface Device’ represents significant advancement in neural interface intellectual property. Unlike typical gesture patents focused on movement recognition, this protection covers neural measurement of physical forces: weight estimation, torque measurement for rotating objects, and applied force quantification for precise assembly tasks. These capabilities transform neural interfaces from entertainment accessories into industrial tools… The patent protects technology that can measure torque when fastening screws, estimate object weight during lifting operations, and quantify connector seating force in cable harness assembly. Such applications address real operational challenges in manufacturing, logistics, and maintenance environments where precise force feedback improves quality and safety.”
