# TinyGemsBreaks – NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL) Narrows Q2 Loss 66% as E-Commerce Growth Offsets Healthcare Headwinds

NextPlat (NASDAQ: NXPL, NXPLW), a global consumer products and services company in healthcare and technology, reported Q2 2025 revenue of $13.2 million versus $17.0 million a year ago, reflecting strong e-commerce growth offset by declines in healthcare operations from lower prescription volumes and reduced 340B contract revenue. Gross margin fell to 21.8% from 34.5% on mix shifts and industry drug price pressures. Operating expenses dropped to $4.7 million from $16.8 million on the absence of prior-year non-recurring charges and cost-cutting measures, producing a net loss of $1.8 million, or ($0.07) per share, compared to a $5.3 million loss last year. The company ended the quarter with $16.6 million in cash and expects over $1 million in annual expense savings. Recent initiatives include technology upgrades, talent recruitment, and sales expansion in 340B and long-term care, along with growing connectivity service contracts and OPKO product sales in China. Management expects to announce further operational and strategic developments within 60 days
