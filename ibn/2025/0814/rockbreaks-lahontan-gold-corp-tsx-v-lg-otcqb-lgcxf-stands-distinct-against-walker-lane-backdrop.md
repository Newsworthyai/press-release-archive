Lahontan Gold (TSX.V: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) is positioned as investors view the Walker Lane corridor in Nevada as a prime destination for gold development. A recent article discussing this reads, “Lahontan Gold Corp. stands out, not only for its robust land position, but also for the company’s focus on projects that blend historical production with scalable exploration and metallurgy. LGCFX’s flagship project is the Santa Fe Mine, a former producer in operation from 1988 to 1995, yielding 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver via open-pit heap leach. Santa Fe holds a NI 43-101 indicated resource of 1.539 million ounces of gold equivalent, with an additional 0.411 million ounces inferred… Lahontan’s portfolio extends beyond Santa Fe to include West Santa Fe, Moho and Redlich — each offering distinct geology and upside potential.”
