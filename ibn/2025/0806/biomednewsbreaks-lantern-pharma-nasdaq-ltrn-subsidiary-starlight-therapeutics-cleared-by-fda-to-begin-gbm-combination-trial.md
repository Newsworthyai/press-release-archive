# BioMedNewsBreaks — Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) Subsidiary Starlight Therapeutics Cleared by FDA to Begin GBM Combination Trial

Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Starlight Therapeutics, has received FDA clearance for an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to initiate a Phase Ib/2a clinical trial of STAR-001 (LP-184) in combination with spironolactone for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) at first progression. The study will evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in recurrent GBM, a highly aggressive brain cancer with limited treatment options. STAR-001 is a brain-penetrant DNA-damaging agent designed to exploit DNA repair deficiencies through synthetic lethality, and its effect is enhanced by spironolactone, which induces NER deficiency in tumor cells. The therapy has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. The program builds on data from an ongoing Phase 1a trial and is being advanced using Lantern’s AI-driven RADR(R) platform to identify optimal patient populations and accelerate development timelines.
