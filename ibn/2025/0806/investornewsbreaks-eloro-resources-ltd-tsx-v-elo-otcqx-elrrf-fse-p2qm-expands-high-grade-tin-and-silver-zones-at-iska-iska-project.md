# InvestorNewsBreaks – Eloro Resources Ltd. (TSX.V: ELO) (OTCQX: ELRRF) (FSE: P2QM) Expands High-Grade Tin and Silver Zones at Iska Iska Project

Eloro Resources (TSX: ELO) (OTCQX: ELRRF) (FSE: P2QM) announced assay results from the first five holes of its restarted definition drilling program in the Santa Barbara starter pit area at the Iska Iska silver-tin polymetallic project in Bolivia. The drilling highlights include 0.89% Sn over 16.5m and 0.90% Sn over 13.5m in hole DSB-78, along with 401.65 g/t Ag over 3.0m in hole DSB-79. All five holes intersected significant tin and silver mineralization, mostly hosted in intrusion breccias, with visible cassiterite likely amenable to gravity separation. Results confirm lateral and downdip continuity, supporting further infill and step-out drilling to expand and upgrade resources ahead of the planned preliminary economic assessment.
