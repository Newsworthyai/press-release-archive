# MissionIRNewsBreaks – Platinum Group Metals Ltd. (NYSE American: PLG) (TSX: PTM) Advances Waterberg Amid Platinum’s Historic Rally

Platinum Group Metals (NYSE American: PLG) (TSX: PTM) is strategically positioned to benefit from a historic surge in platinum prices, which have risen more than 40% in 2025 amid global supply constraints and growing industrial and investor demand. With its flagship Waterberg project in South Africa, the company is advancing production of platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, copper, and nickel to meet rising needs in automotive, hydrogen fuel cells, aerospace, and defense sectors. Supply disruptions in South Africa, including power outages and refinery maintenance, have contributed to significant output declines, tightening the market just as demand intensifies. By focusing on mechanized, low-cost, and sustainable operations, Platinum Group Metals aims to provide a reliable source of critical metals, capitalizing on strong price momentum and positioning itself for long-term growth amid evolving global supply and demand dynamics.
