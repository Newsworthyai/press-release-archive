# BioMedNewsBreaks — Clene Inc. (NASDAQ: CLNN) Builds Momentum to Bring New Hope to Neuro Patients

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN), together with its subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine Inc., is preparing to initiate neurofilament biomarker analyses for its lead drug candidate CNM-Au8(R) in ALS, following feedback from the FDA during a recent Type C meeting. Slated for early Q4 2025, the analyses will assess changes in neurofilament light chain (“NfL”)—a recognized marker for neurodegeneration—among nearly 200 patients treated through the Expanded Access Program for CNM-Au8.

 “We are encouraged by the FDA’s collaborative approach and their constructive feedback on our NfL biomarker analysis plan from the ongoing NIH-sponsored EAP program,” said Benjamin Greenberg, MD, Head of Medical at Clene. “With two additional FDA meetings scheduled to discuss long-term ALS survival results and the End-of-Phase 2 MS results, we are advancing our ALS and MS programs to deliver an innovative therapy for people living with neurodegenerative diseases.”
