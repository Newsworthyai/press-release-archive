# BioMedNewsBreaks — Targeting the Unmet: Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Building Portfolio for Rare Conditions

According to a recent article, “Behçet’s disease is rare, with prevalence estimates varying from 0.12 to 7.5 per 100,000 in the United States and Europe… Behçet’s disease is believed to be an autoimmune illness with both genetic and environmental components. Symptoms are most severe in young adulthood and generally ameliorate with age… Treatment involves medications designed to ease symptoms and prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Even with treatment, oral and genital flares can continue to occur for many patients and significantly affect quality of life and productivity. In addition, treatments can be associated with adverse effects, underscoring the need for more targeted and effective therapies.”

 “Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX) is addressing this therapeutic gap through the development of SGX945, an investigational drug designed to modulate the body’s innate immune response. SGX945 is a synthetic peptide that enhances the resolution of inflammation and promotes tissue healing without suppressing the immune system. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its potential in reducing inflammation and accelerating healing in various models… Soligenix’s commitment to advancing SGX945 aligns with its broader mission to develop and commercialize products that address unmet medical needs in rare diseases. The company’s pipeline includes a range of product candidates targeting inflammatory conditions and biodefense indications.”
