# RockBreaks – Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) Poised for Steady Production, Long-Term Success in British Columbia

Amid the rising value of precious metals, Nicola Mining (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) began processing high-grade gold and silver ore at its Merritt Mill facility, highlighting a key step forward in its growth. “Nicola expects to cumulatively process 60,000 (tn) of ore and produce 21,000 (oz) of gold-equivalent concentrate at full production capacity annual rate. The Merritt Mill provides accessible, reliable revenue to not only its British Columbian partners, but it also sustains its own copper, gold and silver projects across the province,” reads a recent article.

 “We are excited to realize that Nicola is morphing into a steady and long-term producer. It is rare for junior miners to reach the production pinnacle and to monetize current precious metal prices with our partners,” said Nicola CEO Peter Espig. “We are also witnessing firsthand augmented efficiencies in British Columbia’s permitting of underground mining operations, which characteristically minimize environmental impact, as well as the strategic significance of our fully permitted mill. In addition to production, we have boosted our geological team and are ramping up activities for what we believe to be an exciting exploration campaign, not only at the New Craigmont Project, but also our fully permitted silver mine, Treasure Mountain.”
