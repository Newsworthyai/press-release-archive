# NetworkNewsBreaks – Oncotelic Therapeutics Inc. (OTLC) Positioned to Fill Critical Gaps in Cancer Care with RNA and Small-Molecule Therapies

Oncotelic Therapeutics (OTCQB: OTLC) was featured in a recent article that discussed its efforts to pioneer RNA candidates and strategic programs aimed at some of the most lethal and overlooked cancers. “Immunotherapy and RNA-based approaches have begun to reshape the understanding of cancer treatment. The FDA approved 17 new immunotherapies in 2024 alone, spanning multiple cancer types and delivering breakthroughs such as checkpoint inhibitors and individualized vaccines. Yet despite this progress, significant unmet needs persist, particularly in rare pediatric cancers, resistant solid tumors and underserved population. Oncotelic is strategically positioned to fill gaps where traditional treatments fall short,” the article reads. “Oncotelic’s mission focuses on developing first-in-class RNA therapeutics and small-molecule drugs to serve high-unmet-need cancers and rare pediatric diseases. Its lead candidate, OT-101, is a pioneering anti-TGF-β RNA therapeutic that has demonstrated single-agent activity in relapsed and refractory cancers. OT-101 also exhibits activity against SARS-CoV-2, underscoring its versatile potential. Importantly, OT-101 has received rare pediatric designations for aggressive diseases such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (‘DIPG’), melanoma (via CA4P) and acute myeloid leukemia (via OXi4503), highlighting the company’s focus on underserved populations.”
