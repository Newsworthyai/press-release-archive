# InvestorNewsBreaks – Izotropic Corporation (CSE: IZO) (OTCQB: IZOZF) (FSE: 1R3) Unveils IzoView: A Game-Changing Platform for Next-Gen Breast Cancer Detection

Izotropic (CSE: IZO) (OTCQB: IZOZF) (FSE: 1R3) is leading a transformation in breast cancer screening with its flagship IzoView Breast CT Imaging System, a next-generation technology designed to overcome the long-standing limitations of traditional mammography. Unlike compression-based 2D imaging, IzoView delivers true 360-degree, 3D visualization without discomfort, enabling clearer detection—especially in dense breast tissue, which often obscures lesions in standard scans. With a rapid 10-second scan time, high spatial resolution surpassing MRI, and radiation levels comparable to conventional mammography, the system streamlines diagnosis while enhancing patient safety and experience. Built as a scalable platform, IzoView supports future software-driven clinical applications—from screening to treatment monitoring—maximizing ROI for healthcare providers. Its self-shielding design also eliminates the need for facility retrofits, expanding accessibility across diverse imaging environments.
