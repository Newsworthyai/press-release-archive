# RockBreaks – Lahontan Gold Corp. (TSX.V: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) Advances Portfolio in Walker Lane Hotspot

As Nevada’s Walker Lane becomes a prime target for mineral exploration, Lahontan Gold (TSXV: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) is strategically positioned to capitalize, owning and developing four high-potential exploration properties in the area. “With a vision to evolve into Nevada’s premier silver and gold producer, Lahontan has built a robust portfolio of assets across this geologically diverse and historically rich trend,” reads a recent article. “The company controls four properties in the heart of Walker Lane: Santa Fe, West Santa Fe, Moho and Redlich. The company’s flagship project, the Santa Fe Mine, is a 26.4 km2 past-producing, oxide-hosted gold-silver property. Between 1988 and 1995, Santa Fe produced 356,000 ounces of gold and 784,000 ounces of silver via open-pit mining and heap-leach processing. Since 2021, Lahontan has drilled 13,118 meters across 50 holes, contributing to a pit-constrained NI 43-101 resource estimate of 1.539 million indicated ounces and 0.411 million inferred ounces of gold equivalent.”
