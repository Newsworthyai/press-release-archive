# InvestorNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) Advances Construction at Montauban, Eyes Expansion Across the Americas

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) was featured in a recent article that discussed its continued construction of production facilities at its eastern Canada mine tailings reclamation site and examination of other potential sites for similar recovery and revenue generation throughout North and South America. “The traditional exploration model has eroded more capital than it’s created,” ESGold CEO Gordon Robb was quoted as saying. “Our approach reverses that equation. We begin with production — monetizing what others left behind — then reinvest from a position of strength into exploration. Montauban is our proof-of-concept. We believe this model can scale to dozens, even hundreds of other tailings sites across the Americas and elsewhere.”
