# InvestorNewsBreaks – Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: OTLC) Joint Venture Sapu Nano Receives Approval to Begin Phase 1 Trial of Injectable Everolimus for Breast Cancer

Oncotelic Therapeutics (OTCQB: OTLC) announced that its joint venture through GMP Biotechnology Limited, Sapu Nano, has received approval from Australia’s Human Research Ethics Committee to begin enrolling patients in a Phase 1 human clinical trial of Sapu003, an injectable form of Everolimus for breast cancer. Everolimus, marketed as Afinitor(R), is FDA-approved in oral form but has limited absorption of about 10%. Using Sapu Nano’s Deciparticle(TM) technology, Sapu003 is delivered intravenously, allowing full drug absorption into the bloodstream. Preclinical data suggest this approach could improve efficacy over the oral version. The trial will determine optimal dosing for future studies, including a potential Phase 3, aiming to provide longer-lasting disease control and improved outcomes for breast cancer patients.
