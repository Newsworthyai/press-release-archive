# NetworkNewsBreaks – Game On: Brera Holdings PLC’s (NASDAQ: BREA) MCO Strategy Draws Analyst Support

Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA) is an Ireland-based international holding company focused on expanding its global portfolio of men’s and women’s sports clubs through a multi-club ownership (“MCO”) strategy. The company was featured in a recent article that discusses its Outperform rating from PartnerCap Securities. “The firm assigned a price target of $11.50 in a new report, ‘Kicking off a Global Value Play: Early Entry into the World’s First Public MCO Platform.’ The coverage initiation highlights Brera’s role as the first publicly listed multi-club ownership company, positioning it within an expanding asset class where football franchises are increasingly treated as financial investments. PartnerCap argues that Brera’s current valuation fails to reflect either its recent acquisitions or the broader synergies expected from its portfolio strategy,” reads the article. “PartnerCap estimates Brera will generate $15.2 million in revenue in fiscal year 2026. Based on current trading levels, the company is valued at roughly 1.0x EV/revenue, well below the 2.7x peer average. The $11.50 target reflects a multiple of 2.25x on those projections.”
