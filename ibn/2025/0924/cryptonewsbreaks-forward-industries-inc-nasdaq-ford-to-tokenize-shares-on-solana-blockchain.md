# CryptoNewsBreaks – Forward Industries Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD) to Tokenize Shares on Solana Blockchain

Forward Industries Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD) is partnering with fintech firm Superstate to enable tokenization of its common shares on the Solana blockchain through the Opening Bell platform. The initiative will allow shareholders to move FORD stock on-chain for 24/7 trading, real-time settlement, and enhanced global liquidity. Forward also plans to take an equity stake in Superstate and collaborate on future product development, reinforcing its commitment to building on-chain capital markets infrastructure. The company is working with Solana-based protocols Drift, Kamino, and Jupiter Lend to establish tokenized FORD equity as eligible collateral across their platforms.

 “This partnership reflects the continued execution of our vision to make Forward Industries an on-chain-first company, including tokenizing our equity directly on the Solana mainnet,” Kyle Samani, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Forward Industries, stated in the news release. “By bringing public shares of FORD onto the Opening Bell platform and taking an equity stake in Superstate, we are reinforcing our conviction that Solana will sit at the core of capital markets while giving our shareholders direct participation in the future tokenized economy.”
