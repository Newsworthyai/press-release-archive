# TechMediaBreaks – Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI) Price Target Raised to $12 in Updated Litchfield Hills Research Report

Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI), a leader in AI-powered defense and security solutions, is the subject of an updated research report from Litchfield Hills Research, which reaffirmed its Buy rating and raised its 12-month price target from $8 to $12. The increase reflects reduced perceived risk following SPAI’s recent collaborations with Ondas, Unusual Machines, and Red Cat Holdings—most notably a deal to integrate SPAI’s AI-driven explosive detection technology into Red Cat’s Black Widow drones. This growing traction with defense partners led the analysts to lower their discount rate, increasing confidence in future earnings and justifying the upward revision in valuation.
