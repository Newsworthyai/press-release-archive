# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) Unveils New Exploration Target, Boosting Montauban Project Potential

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D), a fully permitted, pre-production resource company on a clear path to near-term gold and silver production, recently reported the identification of a significant geophysical anomaly in the southwest portion of its Montauban Project in Quebec. “According to a company press release, internal analysis of historical VTEM (Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic) survey data and drill records has highlighted this area as a high-priority exploration target,” reads a recent article. “The zone, which has not yet been tested by drilling, displays a strong combination of electromagnetic conductivity and magnetic response, a dual signal often associated with buried, sulfide-rich VMS (volcanogenic massive sulfide) deposits. These types of systems are typically high in base and precious metals, including copper, zinc, and gold.”

 “The southwest anomaly represents a technically interesting and previously untested zone at Montauban,” said ESGold President Brad Kitchen. He added that while the near-term focus remains on production, the expanded land position and evolving dataset “are beginning to reveal a much broader opportunity… With a growing dataset, disciplined exploration approach, and a pathway to self-funded discovery, ESGold is well positioned to pursue both production and the longer-term potential of the Montauban system,” he said.
