# TechMediaBreaks – Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) Eyes Opportunity at Intersection of Real Estate, Robotics, and AI

Nightfood Holdings (OTCQB: NGTF) is embracing the shift head-on as automation reshapes hospitality, and hotel operators are under pressure to find cost-effective, scalable solutions that combat labor shortages, streamline operations, and elevate guest experiences. The company holds an ambitious plan to lead the industry through artificial intelligence (“AI”)-powered hotel automation and strategic acquisitions. Recent moves in key California markets were featured in an article that reads, “Nightfood announced a $36.93 million LOI to acquire the Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, California, a 120-room hotel adjacent to Disney’s forthcoming Cotino residential resort community… Situated in a high-traffic tourist corridor, the Rancho Mirage hotel is set to become a site for showcasing Nightfood’s RaaS technology – including its currently deployed Skytech Laundry helper – and will serve as a future model for retrofitting other full-service hotels… This move follows Nightfood’s April announcement of a $41 million acquisition of a Holiday Inn in Victorville, California… the Victorville location will become Nightfood’s first RaaS model hotel, demonstrating how automation can improve profitability, reduce staffing burdens, and optimize service delivery.”
