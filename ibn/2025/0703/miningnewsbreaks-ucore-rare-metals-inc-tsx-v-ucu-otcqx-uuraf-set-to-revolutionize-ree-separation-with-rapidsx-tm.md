# MiningNewsBreaks – Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Set to Revolutionize REE Separation with RapidSX(TM)

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF), a critical metals technology company developing scalable rare earth element (“REE”) refining infrastructure in North America, marked a significant milestone in the development of a domestic REE supply chain. Ucore was featured in a recent article that discussed the groundbreaking of its Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (“SMC”) in Alexandria. “This facility represents the company’s first commercial REE refining operation and is poised to play a pivotal role in reducing North America’s reliance on foreign sources for critical minerals… The Louisiana SMC is designed to utilize Ucore’s proprietary RapidSX(TM) technology, an advanced solvent extraction process that offers a more efficient and environmentally friendly method for separating REEs… The U.S. Department of Defense (‘DoD’) has recognized the strategic importance of the Louisiana SMC by providing $18.4 million in funding to accelerate the installation of the RapidSX technology at the facility. This investment underscores the DoD’s commitment to strengthening the domestic supply chain for critical minerals essential to national security and technological advancement.”
