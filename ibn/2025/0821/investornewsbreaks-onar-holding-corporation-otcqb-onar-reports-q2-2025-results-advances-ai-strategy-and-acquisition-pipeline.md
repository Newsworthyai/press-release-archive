Onar (OTCQB: ONAR), an AI-powered marketing agency network, announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, highlighting 28% year-to-date revenue growth compared to the prior year. The Company reported a Q2 net loss, primarily from compliance and non-operating expenses, while converting $142,000 of debt into equity and repaying nearly $300,000 in principal. ONAR began closing its Series E financing round and appointed Scott Kauffman as Chairman along with new independent directors Mark Gazit and Reda Raad. Strategic initiatives included partnering with IQSTEL’s Reality Border to co-develop a multi-agent AI platform for Cortex, signing a definitive agreement to acquire Retina.ai to expand predictive analytics capabilities, and evaluating a divestiture of its pool construction subsidiary. The Company is also pursuing debt refinancing, converting $1 million of related-party debt into a long-term note, and enhancing financial controls to address a material weakness.
