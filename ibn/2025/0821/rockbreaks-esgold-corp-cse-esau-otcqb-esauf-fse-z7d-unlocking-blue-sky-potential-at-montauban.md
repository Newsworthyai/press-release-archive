# RockBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) Unlocking Blue-Sky Potential at Montauban

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (FSE: Z7D) recently announced the results of its Ambient Noise Tomography (“ANT”) survey, highlighting the potential for metals discovery at the historic Montauban gold and silver mine site covering 13,116 hectares (about 32,410 acres) of abandoned exploration 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) west of Quebec’s capital city. An article discussing this reads, “The ANT survey reaffirms that Montauban’s mineral system remains open at depth — both vertically and laterally, according to the company. Multiple zones across the property remain completely untested.”

 “The continuity, depth, and scale of the structures we’re seeing suggest that the original mine was just the tip of the iceberg. As we build toward production from the tailings, we’re simultaneously unlocking the blue-sky potential beneath,” said CEO Gordon Robb. “This data confirms Montauban may be just the first chapter in a much larger district-scale opportunity, and we’re excited to share that story with the world.”
