# MiningNewsBreaks – Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) Produces First Kilogram of Dysprosium Oxide at White Mesa Mill

Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), a leading U.S. producer of uranium, rare earths, and critical minerals, announced it has completed production of its first kilogram of dysprosium (Dy) oxide at pilot scale at the Company’s White Mesa Mill in Utah. The material achieved 99.9% purity, exceeding the 99.5% commercial specification, and the Mill expects to continue producing Dy oxide at a rate of two kilograms per week. Energy Fuels believes it is the first U.S. company to both produce high-purity Dy oxide and publicly disclose actual production volumes and purities. Produced from monazite mined in Florida and Georgia, the oxides demonstrate the viability of a fully non-Chinese rare earth oxide supply chain. Multiple magnet manufacturers and OEMs have already expressed strong interest in obtaining samples to accelerate validation processes.
