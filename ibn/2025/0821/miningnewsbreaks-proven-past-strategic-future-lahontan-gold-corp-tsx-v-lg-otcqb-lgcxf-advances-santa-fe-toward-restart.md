# MiningNewsBreaks – Proven Past, Strategic Future: Lahontan Gold Corp. (TSX.V: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) Advances Santa Fe Toward Restart

Lahontan Gold’s (TSX.V: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) competitive advantage lies in controlling an asset with demonstrated production capabilities rather than theoretical potential. “The Santa Fe Mine operated successfully from 1988 to 1995, producing 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver through open-pit mining and heap leach processing, the lowest-cost production method available for oxide gold deposits. The mine’s closure in 1995 resulted purely from economics, as gold prices at $340 per ounce made operations uneconomical. However, the cessation of mining left substantial mineralization in the ground, creating the foundation for Lahontan’s current development strategy,” reads a recent article.

 “We have enough to have mine again now and we’re fast tracking it,” said Lahontan CEO Kimberly Ann during a recent interview. “We started this process about two and a half years ago because we all know permitting takes a long time. We need to do it responsibly. We’re now deep in the weeds of it and we’ll be breaking ground in early 2027, if not sooner.”
