Aditxt (NASDAQ: ADTX), a social innovation platform advancing health innovations, announced that its subsidiary Pearsanta Inc. has initiated enrollment in a prospective clinical study evaluating the Mitomic (R) Endometriosis Test (MET(TM)), a novel blood-based diagnostic for early detection of endometriosis. The study will compare MET’s performance to laparoscopic diagnosis, the current gold standard, across up to 1,000 participants referred for surgery. The first site, Dedicated to Women OB/GYN in Dover, Del., has begun enrollment. Pearsanta President Chris Mitton said the milestone supports validation of a non-invasive diagnostic alternative that could enable earlier and more accurate detection of endometriosis.
