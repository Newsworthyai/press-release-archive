# MiningNewsBreaks – McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Backed Goliath (TSX-V: GOT) Hits Visible Gold at Golddigger, Expands 2025 Drill Program

McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) portfolio company Goliath Resources Limited (TSX-V: GOT) (OTCQB: GOTRF) (FSE: B4IF) reported six new visible gold occurrences in a 96.5-meter mineralized interval from drill hole GD-25-302 at the Bonanza Zone of its Golddigger Property in British Columbia’s Golden Triangle. The hole, targeting a deep magnetic anomaly linked to the theorized Motherlode source, is still underway and expected to reach 1,000 meters. The mineralization closely resembles Goliath’s highest-grade intercept to date and significantly extends the gold-rich system. Based on this and ongoing discoveries, Goliath has expanded its fully funded 2025 drill program from 40,000 to 60,000 meters, focusing on unlocking the full extent of the Surebet system and its Reduced Intrusion Related Gold (RIRG) potential.
