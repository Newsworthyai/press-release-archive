# MiningNewsBreaks – Lahontan Gold Corp. (TSXV: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) Expands Nevada Land Position with Acquisition of York Claims Adjacent to Santa Fe Mine Project

Lahontan Gold (TSXV: LG) (OTCQB: LGCXF) announced the completion of its purchase of 27 unpatented lode mining claims, known as the York claims, from Emergent Metals Corp. The York claims adjoin the southeast corner of Lahontan’s Santa Fe Mine Project in Nevada’s Walker Lane and present significant potential to expand oxide gold and silver resources identified at the York deposit. Recent drilling, including hole YOR25-001R intercepting 89.9 meters grading 0.23 g/t gold, supports mineralization extending onto the new claims. “The gold and silver resource expansion potential, combined with the ability to further lay back the York pit in future operations, makes this a strategic acquisition,” said Kimberly Ann, Founder, Chair, CEO, and President. With the addition, Lahontan now controls 506 claims totaling over 2,832 hectares across one of the world’s premier gold belts. Terms include a US$10,000 payment, a US$50,000 promissory note, 2 million Lahontan shares to Emergent, and a 1% NSR royalty on the York claims, buyable for up to US$1 million within seven years.
