# InvestorNewsBreaks – McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) Recognizes Major Advancement at Surebet with New Geological Model Confirming RIRG Source and High-Grade Gold Expansion Potential

McEwen Mining (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) recognizes the significance of new geological findings from the Colorado School of Mines on Goliath Resources’ Surebet discovery within the Golddigger Property in British Columbia’s Golden Triangle, which confirm a Reduced Intrusion-Related Gold (RIRG) source and point to exceptional untapped potential. The study identifies two high-grade gold settings—shear-hosted quartz-sulfide veins and gold-bearing felsic to intermediate dykes—each featuring widespread visible gold that increases in abundance and coarseness with depth. Notably, mineralization ages of 50.7 to 52.0 million years confirm a common Eocene-age magmatic origin, with melt droplet inclusions and fluid textures revealing a newly recognized phase separation process in CO₂-rich hydrothermal fluids. With intercepts as high as 34.52 g/t AuEq over 39 meters and consistent mineralization across 243 drill holes, the findings validate the scale of this gold system and underscore the overlooked potential of Eocene-aged mineralization in a region historically dominated by Jurassic targets. McEwen Mining views these results as reinforcing the regional prospectivity and relevance of RIRG systems and supports further exploration guided by this emerging geological model.
