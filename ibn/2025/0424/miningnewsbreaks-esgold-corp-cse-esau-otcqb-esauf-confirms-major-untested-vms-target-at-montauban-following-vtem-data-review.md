# MiningNewsBreaks – ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) Confirms Major Untested VMS Target at Montauban Following VTEM Data Review

ESGold (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has identified a large-scale, high-conductivity geophysical anomaly in the southwestern portion of its Montauban Project following an internal review of its 2015 VTEM survey and historical drill data. This zone, now fully enclosed within ESGold’s expanded 255-claim package totaling 13,116 hectares, remains undrilled and is considered a high-priority target due to its strong conductive and magnetic signature, typical of buried sulfide-rich VMS environments. The Company is finalizing the first-ever 3D geological model of the project, integrating VTEM and TMI data, over 950 historical drillholes, and upcoming ANT survey results to guide future drilling. While ESGold advances toward near-term production through tailings reprocessing, the southwest anomaly marks a strategic shift toward unlocking district-scale discovery potential.
