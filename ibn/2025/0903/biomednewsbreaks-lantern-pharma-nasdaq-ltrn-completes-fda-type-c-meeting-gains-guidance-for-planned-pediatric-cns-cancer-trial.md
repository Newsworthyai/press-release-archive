Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), an AI-driven clinical-stage oncology company, announced the completion of a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which provided guidance on the regulatory pathway and design of a planned pediatric trial targeting CNS cancers, including Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT). The FDA supported Lantern’s proposal for a parallel ATRT cohort and the potential inclusion of spironolactone as a combination agent with LP-184/STAR-001, the company’s lead investigational therapy. Lantern, through its subsidiary Starlight Therapeutics, will submit an IND amendment reflecting the feedback, with trial initiation targeted for Q1 2026. The program holds Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations, and the planned multi-site study will focus on progression-free survival, overall response rate, and quality-of-life outcomes.
