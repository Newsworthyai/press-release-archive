# InvestorNewsBreaks – Clene Inc. (NASDAQ: CLNN) Builds Late-Stage Momentum in Neuro Pipeline

Clene (NASDAQ: CLNN), together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Clene Nanomedicine Inc., is advancing its lead candidate CNM-Au8®, a unique and needed oral treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), toward a potential FDA accelerated approval. “Clene’s technology targets mitochondrial dysfunction, a novel approach to neurodegenerative diseases, and key FDA meetings in the coming months could be major valuation catalysts for investors… Clene is preparing to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 ALS trial in the first half of 2026, with a separate MS (multiple sclerosis) program in late-stage development,” reads a recent article. “For investors, Clene’s value lies in its multiple shots on goal: regulatory catalysts in both ALS and MS, ongoing data generation, and a novel therapeutic platform. While clinical-stage biotechs carry inherent risks, the company’s unique approach could significantly shorten its path to commercialization and generate early revenue from a patient population with limited options… Clene’s differentiated technology and advancing clinical programs position it as a company to watch with important investment potential in the evolving neurodegenerative therapy space.”
