# InvestorNewsBreaks – Alliance Global Partners Maintains Buy Rating, Increases Price Target as Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) Advances Proprietary Clinical Programs

Soligenix (NASDAQ: SNGX), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company targeting rare diseases, was spotlighted last week in a report from Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”), which maintained its Buy rating for Soligenix and raised SNGX’s price target to $10 per share. According to the report, the increase was based on the increasing valuation of HyBryte(TM) for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) and new estimated valuation for Soligenix’s SGX945, a treatment for Behçet’s disease.

 According to the report, SNGX’s phase 3 FLASH2 trial is on track to have topline results announced next year. AGP noted that in December 2024, Soligenix initiated the confirmatory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 FLASH2 clinical trial of HyBryte in CTCL patients. The FLASH2 study is continuing the research from the initial phase 3 FLASH trial, with the main difference being a longer treatment duration of 18 weeks; the initial FLASH clinical trial had a six-week treatment duration.

 In addition, the report stated that Soligenix had recently reported compelling data from its open-label phase 2a study of aphthous ulcers in Behçet’s disease. AGP noted that the study had achieved the study objective of demonstrating biological efficacy and that SGX945 showed outcomes similar to (if not superior to) Amgen’s Otezla(R) (apremilast) in decreasing

 oral ulcers at 4 weeks (Otezla’s Behçet’s approval endpoint), with the effect continuing

 through weeks 5–8 even with SGX945 dosing stopping at the 4th week.

 “We value SNGX at $10/share based primarily on our expectations for HyBryte (“SGX301”) launch in 2028 and subsequent sales growth through 2036,” the report stated. “We project a 2028 launch of HyBryte with U.S. sales of $75M by 2035 and with ROW sales of $50M by 2036, with a 3x sales multiple discounted back 9 and 10 years, respectively, at 20% for our $6/share valuation for this program.

 “We project dusquetide (“SGX945”) for oral/genital ulcers associated with Behçet’s disease could reach $50M in sales by 2035, which we discount back 9 years at 25% for our $3/share valuation,” the report continued. “We estimate that SNGX can ultimately secure a U.S. government contract to produce RiVax(R) for the Strategic National Stockpile valued at $25M by 2035, to which we apply a 2x multiple (based on competitive valuations of vaccine companies supplying the USG) discounted 9 years at 30% for a $0.50/share valuation. We value cash (end-’26E) and technology value at $0.50/share for our $10/share valuation.”
