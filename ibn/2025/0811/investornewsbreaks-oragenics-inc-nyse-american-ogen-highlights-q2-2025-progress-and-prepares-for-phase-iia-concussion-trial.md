Oragenics (NYSE American: OGEN), a biotechnology company developing brain-targeted therapeutics via proprietary intranasal delivery technology, reported strategic and financial milestones for Q2 2025 as it advances its lead candidate, ONP-002, toward becoming the first FDA-approved pharmacological treatment for concussion.
