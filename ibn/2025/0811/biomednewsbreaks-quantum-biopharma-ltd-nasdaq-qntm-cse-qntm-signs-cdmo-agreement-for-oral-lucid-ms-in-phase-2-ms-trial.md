# BioMedNewsBreaks — Quantum BioPharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) Signs CDMO Agreement for Oral Lucid-MS in Phase 2 MS Trial

Quantum BioPharma (NASDAQ: QNTM) (CSE: QNTM) announced that its subsidiary, Huge Biopharma Australia Pty Ltd., has signed an agreement with a leading contract development and manufacturing organization to produce an oral formulation of Lucid-MS for the company’s upcoming Phase 2 clinical trial. The trial will evaluate Lucid-MS as a potential treatment to help restore mobility in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), building on a decade of preclinical studies in which the therapy enabled animals to regain their ability to walk. Lucid-MS is a patented, first-in-class, non-immunomodulatory neuroprotective compound that has demonstrated the ability to prevent demyelination, a hallmark of MS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The agreement marks a key step toward filing an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA for Lucid-21-302 in MS.
