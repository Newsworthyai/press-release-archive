SEGG Media (NASDAQ: SEGG, LTRYW) announced that sponsored drivers Callum Ilott, Louis Foster, and Seb Murray were set to compete this past weekend in the 2025 NTT INDYCAR and INDY NXT by Firestone Grand Prix of Portland, the final road course before the season-ending oval double-header. The 12-turn, 1.964-mile Portland International Raceway is known for its multiple overtaking zones and unpredictable action through Turn 1’s ‘Festival Curves.’ Ilott, racing for PREMA and carrying Lottery.com branding, returned to the venue where he debuted in IndyCar, aiming to build on consistent performances. Foster, with Sports.com logos, entered the event leading the Rookie of the Year standings and looking to extend his strong road course record. Murray, representing Andretti Cape and backed by Lottery.com and Sports.com, was making his Portland debut after a career-best P5 at Monterey, seeking to carry that momentum into the season’s closing stretch.
