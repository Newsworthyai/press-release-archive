Knightscope (NASDAQ: KSCP), a developer of autonomous security robots and emergency communication devices, reported second-quarter 2025 revenue of $2.7 million, down from $3.2 million in the prior-year period, as higher autonomous security robot service revenue was offset by lower emergency communication device sales due to component shortages. Gross loss widened to $0.9 million, while operating expenses fell 14% to $5.4 million. Net loss remained $6.3 million, or $(0.90) per share, versus $(2.68) per share last year. Cash and equivalents rose to $8.2 million at quarter-end, with $24.2 million on hand as of Aug. 8, 2025, aided by ATM share sales. Recent milestones include full repayment of a $3 million senior secured note, signing a lease for a 33,355-square-foot Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters, increasing production efficiency, and growing recurring service revenue 7% year-over-year. The company continues to invest in its K7 platform, AI analytics, and next-generation products.
