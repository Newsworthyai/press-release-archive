# InvestorNewsBreaks – Silo Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: SILO) Expects SPC-15 PTSD Study Results Within 90 Days

Silo Pharma (NASDAQ: SILO), a developmental-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced it expects data from two key preclinical studies of its lead candidate SPC-15 within 30 to 90 days. SPC-15 is an intranasal prophylactic designed to boost stress resilience and prevent Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The ongoing studies include IND-enabling GLP-compliant toxicology and toxicokinetic testing, as well as a large animal safety study requested by the FDA. Results will inform a planned IND application, potentially before year-end, with a Phase 1 clinical trial anticipated in 2026. Silo aims to pursue the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway to expedite development of the therapy, which represents a novel approach in a field that has seen no new FDA drug approvals for PTSD in nearly 25 years.
