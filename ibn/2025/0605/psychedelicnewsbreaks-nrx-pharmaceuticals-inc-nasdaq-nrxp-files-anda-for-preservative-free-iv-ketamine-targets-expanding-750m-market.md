# PsychedelicNewsBreaks – NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP) Files ANDA for Preservative-Free IV Ketamine, Targets Expanding $750M Market

NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), has submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA for NRX-100, its preservative-free intravenous ketamine formulation aimed at approved indications such as anesthesia and pain management. With the U.S. ketamine market valued at $750 million and global demand projected to reach $3.35 billion by 2034, the company is seeking priority review amid an ongoing national shortage. NRx also plans to petition the FDA to mandate preservative-free ketamine formulations, citing safety concerns over benzethonium chloride. This filing complements its broader strategy to expand ketamine’s label to include treatment for suicidal depression, backed by clinical data from more than 1,000 patients.
