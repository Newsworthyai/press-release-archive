# MiningNewsBreaks – Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) Reports Promising Copper Targets at Epworth Project in Nunavut

Aston Bay (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) has released results from its 2024 exploration program at the Epworth Project in Nunavut, highlighting surface samples with copper grades up to 61.2% and silver up to 5,600 g/t. The company’s MobileMT airborne geophysical survey identified extensive conductive bodies—interpreted as potential reductants such as pyrite or graphite—within the Proterozoic Recluse Group rocks. CEO Thomas Ullrich stated these findings support the potential for a large-scale, sediment-hosted copper system, drawing parallels to successful models used in Central Africa and Aston Bay’s Storm Copper Project. Targets span tens of kilometers and are largely within 300 meters of the surface, with drilling under consideration for later this season.

 About Aston Bay Holdings Ltd.

 Aston Bay is a publicly traded mineral exploration company exploring for high-grade copper and gold deposits in Virginia, USA, and Nunavut, Canada. The company is currently exploring the Storm Project property and Cu-Ag-Zn-Co Epworth property in Nunavut, as well as the high-grade Buckingham Gold Vein and critical metals prospects in central Virginia. The company is also in advanced stages of negotiation on other lands with high-grade copper potential in North America. The company and its joint venture partners, American West Metals Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. (collectively, “American West”), formed a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture in respect of the Storm Project property, which hosts the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit. Under the unincorporated joint venture, Aston Bay shall have a free carried interest until American West has made a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study, meaning American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such decision is made. After such decision is made, Aston Bay will be diluted in the event it does not elect to contribute its proportionate share and its interest in the Storm Project property will be converted into a 2% net smelter returns royalty if its interest is diluted to below 10%.
