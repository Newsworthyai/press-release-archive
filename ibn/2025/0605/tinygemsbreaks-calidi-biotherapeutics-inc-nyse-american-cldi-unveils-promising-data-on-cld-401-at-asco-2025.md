# TinyGemsBreaks – Calidi Biotherapeutics Inc. (NYSE American: CLDI) Unveils Promising Data on CLD-401 at ASCO 2025

Calidi Biotherapeutics (NYSE American: CLDI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of systemic oncolytic targeted immunotherapies with the ability to deliver genetic payloads. The company unveiled promising new data on its lead RedTail platform candidate, CLD-401, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting. The announcement reads, “Calidi has previously demonstrated its pioneering efforts in developing an enveloped form of its proprietary oncolytic virus that is significantly more resistant to immune clearance than non-enveloped forms, allowing for systemic delivery and efficacy in syngeneic tumor-bearing pre-clinical models. Calidi has further advanced this technology with CLD-401, its first therapeutic candidate from the RedTail platform. New data presented at the meeting demonstrate a novel genetic modification in which a chimeric CD55 receptor is incorporated into the envelope shielding the virus. Because CD55 receptor expression acts as a robust inhibitor of complement, this modification further enhances the virus’s resistance to rapid clearance by the humoral immune system following intravenous administration.”
