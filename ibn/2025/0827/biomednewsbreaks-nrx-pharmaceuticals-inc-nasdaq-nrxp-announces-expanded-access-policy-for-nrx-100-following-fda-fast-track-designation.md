# BioMedNewsBreaks — NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP) Announces Expanded Access Policy for NRX-100 Following FDA Fast Track Designation

NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced its expanded access policy for NRX-100 (preservative-free ketamine) after receiving FDA Fast Track designation for the treatment of suicidal ideation in patients with depression, including bipolar depression. The designation reflects FDA’s determination that NRX-100 may address an unmet need based on preliminary data. Eligible patients may access the investigational therapy under specific conditions, including lack of response or tolerance to approved treatments and sufficient supporting clinical data. Chairman and CEO Dr. Jonathan C. Javitt said the company is committed to making NRX-100 available to patients with suicidal depression who have limited options, while continuing to advance its clinical development program.
