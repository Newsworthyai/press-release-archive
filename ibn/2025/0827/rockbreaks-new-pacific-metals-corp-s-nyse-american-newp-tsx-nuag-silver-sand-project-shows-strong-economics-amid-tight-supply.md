# RockBreaks – New Pacific Metals Corp.’s (NYSE American: NEWP) (TSX: NUAG) Silver Sand Project Shows Strong Economics Amid Tight Supply

New Pacific (NYSE American: NEWP) (TSX: NUAG), a Canadian exploration and development company, is poised for opportunity as global demand for silver intensifies, largely fueled by industrial applications such as solar panels and electric vehicles, while supply remains constrained. “New Pacific Metals has positioned itself as a first mover in this environment. The company’s flagship Silver Sand project is among the most advanced silver developments in Bolivia,” reads a recent article. “A preliminary feasibility study released in June 2024 outlines a 13-year mine life producing 12 million ounces of silver annually, 15 million ounces in the initial years. The economics are robust: at a silver price of US$24 per ounce, the project yields a post-tax NPV of US$740 million and a 37% IRR, with an all-in sustaining cost (‘AISC’) of just US$10.69 per ounce. Payback is expected in under two years.”
