# DefenseNewsBreaks – Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI) Positioned for Growth as War Department Launches Billion-Dollar Push for U.S. Drone Dominance

Safe Pro Group (NASDAQ: SPAI), a mission-driven provider of AI-powered defense and security solutions, is aligned with a major federal shift as the War Department moves to acquire roughly 300,000 low-cost drones under President Trump’s “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” initiative. The department’s new request for information outlines a $1 billion procurement program beginning in early 2026 that will fund four production “gauntlets,” starting with 12 vendors delivering 30,000 drones at $5,000 per unit and scaling toward 150,000 units at reduced costs. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the program aims to rebuild U.S. industrial capacity, integrate unmanned systems into all combat training, and ensure the military can field inexpensive battlefield drones at scale—tens of thousands in 2026 and hundreds of thousands by 2027.

 Safe Pro Group’s drone-agnostic, AI-powered threat-detection computer vision technology positions the company to benefit from the War Department’s expanding focus on unmanned systems, as a rapid increase in drone deployment will sharply accelerate demand for advanced imagery analysis. Its patented SpotlightAI platform has processed more than 2.26 million battlefield images and can identify over 150 types of mines and unexploded ordnance, delivering a field-proven capability directly aligned with federal priorities in unmanned intelligence, force protection, and scalable drone operations. As an American-made AI solution, Safe Pro further aligns with government efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains and advance next-generation AI and drone technologies, supporting potential deployment across military, humanitarian, and public safety missions.
