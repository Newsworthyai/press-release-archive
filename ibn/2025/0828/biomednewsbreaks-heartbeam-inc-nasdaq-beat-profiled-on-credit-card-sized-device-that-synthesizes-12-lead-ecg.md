# BioMedNewsBreaks — HeartBeam Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT) Profiled on Credit-Card-Sized Device That Synthesizes 12-Lead ECG

HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT) is the focus of a piece by Susan Shepard for MD+DI detailing how the company’s credit-card-sized ECG device captures three-dimensional signals to synthesize a full 12-lead output. Cleared by the FDA last December, the portable system is designed for patients to carry in a wallet or purse for on-demand readings, providing hospital-level arrhythmia evaluation outside traditional settings. CEO Rob Eno explained that the device records up-down, side-to-side, and front-to-back signals, which the company’s algorithm then converts into a 12-lead ECG. HeartBeam expects FDA clearance for the algorithm later this year.

 The coverage also highlights HeartBeam’s partnership with AccurKardia to integrate its FDA-cleared AccurECG software for automated rhythm interpretation and streamlined physician workflows. Patients can use the app for both routine and symptom-triggered recordings, with data routed to on-call cardiologists when necessary. While reimbursement pathways are still developing, HeartBeam intends to focus its commercial strategy on preventive cardiology and concierge practices, with further research underway to expand adoption and demonstrate cost-effectiveness.
