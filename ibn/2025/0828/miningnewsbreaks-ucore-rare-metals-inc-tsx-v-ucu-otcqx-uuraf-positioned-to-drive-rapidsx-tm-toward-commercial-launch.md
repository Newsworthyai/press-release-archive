# MiningNewsBreaks – Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) Positioned to Drive RapidSX(TM) Toward Commercial Launch

Ucore Rare Metals (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) recently secured an $18.4 million phase 2 award from the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) to accelerate the engineering, procurement and site work for its Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (“LA SMC”), reinforcing its leadership in domestic heavy rare earth element (“HREE”) supply. “Ucore’s RapidSX(TM) column-based solvent extraction platform, already proven under phase 1 funding, is central to the company’s mission to break reliance on China-controlled legacy REE separation methods,” reads a recent article. “The phase 2 award expands an earlier $4 million phase 1 demonstration project and supports detailed engineering, long-lead equipment procurement and early-stage construction at the LA SMC in Alexandria, Louisiana… Phase 2 is intended to scale RapidSX to commercial readiness and position Ucore for mechanical completion of the facility in late 2026 with minimal equity dilution.”
