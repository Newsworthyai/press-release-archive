# MiningNewsBreaks – LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) Eyes Golden Opportunity in MiningNewsWire Podcast

LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) was featured in a recent episode of the MiningNewsWire podcast, where its CEO Paul Ténière and Chairman Kal Malhi discussed the company’s short-term production strategy and its long-term positioning. “We’re an interesting company in the fact that we have an advanced gold project in Québec’s Abitibi Gold Belt and a nearby permitted mill. That puts us in a strong position as a near-term gold producer,” Ténière said, adding that today’s prices create favorable conditions for restarting operations and accelerating project timelines. “We have a mining lease at Swanson, which allows us to get into production much faster than we could otherwise. With gold hitting over $3,000 an ounce, it makes a lot of these deposits potentially economically viable… It’s an exciting time to be in gold, and we’re in a great position to move quickly.”

 About LaFleur Minerals Inc.

 LaFleur Minerals is focused on the development of district-scale gold projects in the Abitibi Gold Belt near Val-d’Or, Québec. The company’s mission is to advance mining projects with a laser focus on our resource-stage Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill, which have significant potential to deliver long-term value. The Swanson Gold Project is approximately 18,304 hectares (183 km(2)) in size and includes several prospects rich in gold and critical metals previously held by Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. LaFleur has recently consolidated a large land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits and several other showings which make up the Swanson Gold Project. The Swanson Gold Project is easily accessible by road allowing direct access to several nearby gold mills, further enhancing its development potential. Lafleur Minerals’ fully permitted and refurbished Beacon Gold Mill is capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day and is being considered for processing mineralized material from Swanson and for custom milling operations for other nearby gold projects.
