 About Nightfood Holdings, Inc.

 Nightfood Holdings, Inc. is an emerging robotics company focused on developing and deploying AI-powered automation across industries.

Nightfood’s long-term vision is to expand into additional verticals requiring similar automation solutions, delivering scalable robotics that improve safety, efficiency, and reliability across multiple sectors.

 As part of its vertically integrated model, Nightfood is also strengthening its balance sheet through ownership of asset-rich real estate, beginning with hotel acquisitions that double as live deployment sites for robotics testing and operational benchmarking.
