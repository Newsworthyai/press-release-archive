# MiningNewsBreaks – Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) Holds Significant Potential Inventory, Unlike Any Comparable Uranium Miner

Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), the largest uranium mining company in the United States, has created diverse cash-flow-generating opportunities and holds key assets as the world looks to sources to generate clean power. A recent article discussing this indicates that Energy Fuels anticipates 640,000 to 690,000 pounds of uranium inventory by the end of 2020 and quotes the company’s president and CEO Mark S. Chalmers. In the piece, Chalmers states, “I can think of no other comparable uranium miner anywhere in the world that has the potential to have over $30 million of inventory value at the end of 2020 — and possibly much more if uranium and/or vanadium prices improve.”
