 About GoldHaven Resources Corp.

 GoldHaven is a Canadian junior exploration company active in the Maricunga Gold Belt of Northern Chile. The Maricunga measures 150 km north-south and 30 km. east-west and is host to discoveries in the last 10 years of 100M oz. gold; 450M oz. silver and 13 billion lbs. copper. The company has agreements in place to acquire seven projects with extensive surface study. GoldHaven has identified four of its seven properties as being “high-priority targets,” three of which the company plans to drill commencing January 2021. These priority targets were designated as such due, first, to the analytical work that has been completed on all the properties and, second, to their relative locations in respect to existing deposits. One such existing project is Coya, located approximately 16 km. northeast of the La Coipa mine, where Kinross extracted over 6.2 million oz. Other existing projects include Rio Loa and Alicia, which are respectively 25 km. and 30 km. distance from GoldHaven’s Salares Norte deposit with a discovery of 5M oz. gold, 450M oz. silver and 13B oz. copper.
