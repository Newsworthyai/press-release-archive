# The Press Release Archive

Archive of All Press Releases via Newsramp.com

## Justification

News has unique requirements and demands on provenance and authenticity. [David McInnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmcinnis/), the founder of [Newsworthy.ai](https://newsworthy.ai) and [NewsRamp.com](https://newsramp.com) has been working on this problem since 2017. Prior to this repository, The Press Release Archive, David began registering all of the press releases coming through his sites on the Blockchain. Blockchain provides an inmutable storage vehicle that allows us to verify news provenance. But it has a shortcoming. It can only show what happened at a specific moment in time. 

**The Github Solution** 
By publishing press releases to Github, we gain advantages not available through simple blockchain registration. 

1. Editable and Trackable - By publishing to Github, we have full transparency to all changes made to news over time.
2. Collaboration - We can allow a crowd sourced entry point for individuals wishing to contribute. Imagine being able to create a pull request on news item?
3. Expandable - Easy to add assets, commentary, comments and other content to each press release record. Pull requests?

## Rules

1. You may clone the repo for any valid research use or for your private use.
2. You may create a pull request to update or 'fix' anything in this repository. As will all pull requests, it may take time for your changes to be merged into the main branch.
3. You cannot spam the system. Pull requests deemed by reviewers to be spam in nature will be rejected.
4. You can republish the original press releases, but you must include all links and images included in the repository document.
