 NEW YORK, NY — February 26, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Canela Media, a leading multicultural media company driven by technology and innovation and home to Canela.TV, the only free Spanish-language streaming app with a fully integrated rewards program, Club Canela, spotlights International Women’s History Month this March with a bold and thoughtfully curated celebration highlighting women’s voices and stories. This reflects Canela.TV’s year-round commitment to recognizing and uplifting women through content that celebrates their strength, impact and legacy.

 Canela.TV invites audiences to explore specially curated collections and fan-favorite titles spanning Canela Originals, Cine de Oro classics, international novelas, including popular Turkish series and female-led films that place women at the center. Together, these stories bring to life powerful, inspiring and unforgettable women who break barriers, challenge conventions and continue to resonate across generations. Joining Canela.TV’s extensive Cine de Oro collection is Señora Ama, featuring the legendary Dolores del Río, widely recognized as the first major Latin American female crossover star in Hollywood. Del Río broke cultural and industry barriers, achieving mainstream success in American cinema and becoming a defining figure of Mexico’s Golden Age of Film. Her trailblazing career helped open doors for future generations of Latina actresses and reshaped how Hispanic women were portrayed on screen, making this female-led classic a powerful addition to the month’s celebration.

 One of the best ways to experience the month is alongside Canela.TV’s diverse and powerful latinas Luz Blanchet, Natalia Valenzuela, and Suly Castillo on Café con Canela. The inspiring daily lifestyle show they’ve built with talent, charisma, and a genuine connection to audiences explores every aspect of life with openness, transparency and confidence. Leaving no topic off-limits, makes it the perfect centerpiece for celebrating women this month. Additionally, there will be a special game-show edition of Club Canela, where the hosts will compete in a trivia challenge to win the prizes of the month.

 Experience Canela Deportes’ FutFem celebrating the great figures of women’s soccer, such as Alexia Putellas and Rebeca Bernal, who have transformed the sport by winning titles, breaking barriers, and leaving a lasting impact both on and off the pitch. A tribute to athletes who inspire new generations around the world.

 Celebrating women across genres and generations, Canela Music’s lineup features curated playlists and Originals, including En el Estudio with Camila Fernández, Canela Music Talks with Las Migas, Mirella Cesa, Kika Edgar and Litzy (Doble Traición). Featured music video playlists include Mujeres Poderosas featuring Danna Paola, Puras Reinas featuring Jenni Rivera and Selena and Íconos, a series spotlighting Yuri (Secretos de las Indomables), Lupita D’Alessio, among others. Together this content showcases the depth, talent and impact of women in music and culture.
