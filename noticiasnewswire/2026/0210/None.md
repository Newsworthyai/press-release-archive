# inGroup Co-Founder and CEO Receives Honorary Award from the Kyiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry

GUAYNABO, PR — FEBRUARY 10, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — inGroup International proudly announces that its Co-Founder and CEO, Michael Hutchison, has been awarded the Honorary Award of the Kyiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry in recognition of his significant personal contributions to charitable initiatives and his active, sustained cooperation with the Chamber during one of Ukraine’s most challenging periods.

 The honor, the highest granted to foreign nationals, acknowledges Michael’s unwavering support for Ukraine, Ukrainian inCruises Partners and Members, and the charitable foundation Stand with Ukraine, established under the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine. The foundation provides critical psychological and physical rehabilitation services for children affected by the ongoing war.

 “On behalf of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the leadership of the Stand with Ukraine Charitable Foundation, and our friends in Ukraine, we would like to thank Michael for his continued support and humanitarian efforts over the last few years,” said Valeriy Korol Vice President for International Relations of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “His assistance has directly helped more than 800 Ukrainian children who have been deeply affected by the war. Together with the families of these children, we recognize Michael’s civic commitment and the humanist principles he upholds.”

 The children helped with this program are evacuated from frontline regions or returned from occupied territories—many having lost their homes, their sense of safety, and, in some cases, one or both parents.

 “Receiving this honor from the Kyiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry is humbling and meaningful,” expressed Michael Hutchison, inGroup CEO and Co-Founder. “The courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people, especially the children who have endured so much, continue to inspire me every day. I’m grateful for the opportunity to support the Stand with Ukraine foundation and work alongside so many dedicated individuals helping restore hope, healing, and a sense of possibility for these children.”

 Beyond financial support Mr. Hutchison has traveled twice to Ukraine to visit the children’s rehabilitation camp. During these visits, he spent meaningful time with the children, participating in therapeutic activities and workshops, engaging in creative and recreational programs, and sharing moments of connection designed to foster healing, hope, and resilience.
