# Nancy Clara, CEO of Hispanic Target, Joins Christopher Ruddy and Argentina’s Business Elite at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires

BUENOS AIRES, AR — February 9, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — In a move that underscores the growing strategic alliance between Washington and Buenos Aires, Nancy Clara, CEO of Hispanic Target Inc., participated in an exclusive gathering at the Palacio Bosch, invited by the U.S. Embassy. The event, hosted by Ambassador Peter Lamelas, celebrated the 61st birthday of Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax, serving as a high-level summit for Argentina’s “Círculo Rojo.”

 The presence of Nancy Clara alongside titans such as Paolo Rocca (Techint), Facundo Gómez Minujín (J.P. Morgan) and Eduardo Verástegui, highlights her role as a pivotal bridge between the U.S. Hispanic market and Latin American leadership. During the evening, Ruddy—whose media empire recently debuted on the NYSE—shared his perspective on Argentina’s emerging opportunities. His interest suggests a landscape where Newsmax could expand its influence, positioning itself as a key platform for a narrative where cultural values and information integrity are central.

 “Participating in this dialogue at the U.S. Embassy confirms that Argentina is at a turning point,” stated Nancy Clara. “For Hispanic Today, it is essential to amplify these synergies that redefine the media and business relationship between our nations.”
