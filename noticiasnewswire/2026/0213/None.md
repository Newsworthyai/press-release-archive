# America’s Debt Burden Deepens as Balances and Financial Stress Reach New Highs

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Feb. 13, 2026 /Noticias Newswire/ – As household debt continues its upward climb—driven by record-high credit card balances, rising auto and retail financing, and persistent student loan obligations—millions of Americans are feeling the squeeze. Instead of making meaningful progress toward financial freedom, many consumers are stuck managing minimum payments, unaware of how long it may take to break free from the cycle of debt.

 For consumers, these trends point to a growing reliance on multiple forms of high-cost borrowing, making it harder to reduce balances and increasing the risk of long-term financial strain. Debt Awareness Week, held Feb. 16-22, highlights the urgency of helping consumers move beyond minimum payments and understand their options for regaining control of their finances.

 “Too many Americans are stuck paying just enough to survive their debt, not escape it,” says [Howard Dvorkin](https://www.howarddvorkin.com/) chairman of Debt.com. “When households rely on minimum payments, debt quietly becomes a long-term financial trap, and that’s exactly why Debt Awareness Week matters.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Howard Dvorkin](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banners-v4-a-mo-150x150.jpg)

 * U.S. non-housing balances grew by $49 billion in a single quarter.
* Credit card balances jumped $24 billion in Q3 of 2025, reaching $1.23 trillion outstanding—nearly 6% higher than a year ago.
* Auto debt stands at $1.66 trillion, reflecting the ongoing cost of transportation amid elevated prices and interest rates.
* Retail and consumer finance borrowing is expanding. Balances rose by $10 billion, totaling $550 billion, often driven by buy-now-pay-later-style financing and store cards.
* Student loan debt is growing again with balances increasing $15 billion, bringing the total to $1.65 trillion.

 To help consumers take meaningful steps toward financial control, Debt Awareness Week also offers a series of practical 7-Day Action Steps that anyone can start implementing immediately. Each day focuses on a specific task, from listing debts and identifying interest rates to reviewing spending, calculating your debt-to-income ratio, checking your credit report, and setting short- and long-term debt goals, giving people a clear way to begin improving their finances and understanding their debt picture.

 Debt-Free Day Calculator

 The cornerstone of Debt Awareness Week is Debt.com’s Debt-Free Day Calculator, an interactive tool designed to help consumers visualize how much of their working life is dedicated to paying off debt.

 For the average American earning $62,000 annually, paying off $15,000 in debt would require over three months of full paychecks, assuming every dollar went toward debt and nothing else.

 “Our Debt-Free Day Calculator gives users clarity and a true picture of their financial well-being,” says [Don Silvestri](https://www.debt.com/author/dsilvestri/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral), President of Debt.com. “It shows how many days you must work just to pay off debt, and that realization can be powerful.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Don Silvestri](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Don-150x150.png)

 * Users input total amount of personal debt
* Annual income is factored in
* The calculator converts the results into the number of days needed to work to pay off the debt
* A personalized “Debt-Free Day” displays on a calendar

 “It’s a real wake-up call when you realize a significant portion of your year, is spent working just to pay down your debt,” Silvestri added.

By promoting education and practical tools, the initiative aims to give Americans the clarity they need to take control of their financial future.
