 LAS VEGAS, NV — January 13, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Avanti Green Eco Cleaning, a residential and commercial cleaning company serving Las Vegas and Henderson, has earned Green Seal certification, an independent, third-party designation for environmentally responsible cleaning practices.

 Green Seal, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit devoted to environmental sustainability, is a member of ISEAL, a London-based organization that sets standards for sustainability certifications.

 To achieve Green Seal certification, companies must meet rigorous, science-based criteria showing they use eco-friendly products, reduce waste, improve energy and water efficiency, and manage chemicals responsibly.

 Green Seal Certification isn’t just a badge. It reflects how we operate everyday, said Avanti Green Eco Cleaning founder and Chief Executive Office Claudia Meneses, whose company is marking its 15th year in business. “Our clients must trust us with their buildings, their employees, and their residents. This certification validates that our cleaning practices are proven, responsible, and aligned with long-term health, sustainability, and asset value.”

 Research suggests sustainability can also offer a competitive advantage. In a September 2023 Harvard Business Review report, researchers Ashley Reichheld, John Peto, and Cory Ritthaler wrote that eco-friendly brands appear positioned to gain market share.

 “Our research suggests we’re on the brink of a major shift in consumption patterns, where truly sustainable brands — those that make good on their promises to people and the planet — will seize the advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or that have not invested sufficiently in sustainability,” they wrote.

 Business leaders have echoed those findings. Forbes Business Council member Mikhail Kadymov wrote in 2023 that eco-friendly businesses can reduce costs while strengthening consumer trust.

 “Staying ahead of the curve and implementing green initiatives early on, businesses can position themselves as leaders within their industries,” Kadymov wrote.

 For commercial buildings, schools, health care sites, and office environments, Avanti Green’s Green Seal-certified services support environmental, social, and governance initiatives, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design credit requirements, and sustainability reporting goals.

 Meneses said research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows that improved indoor air quality leads to fewer employee sick days and increased productivity, while Green Seal and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-aligned findings show that properties prioritizing wellness and sustainability are more attractive to tenants and buyers, supporting higher retention rates, stronger leasing performance, and increased property value.
