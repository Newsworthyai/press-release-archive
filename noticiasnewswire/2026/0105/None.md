# Debt.com Spanish Division Rebrands as “Deudas en Español” to Empower U.S. Latino Families

Fort Lauderdale, FL – January 5, 2026 /Noticias Newswire/ – Debt.com has officially relaunched its resources for the Hispanic market under a new domain: Deudas en Español (https://DeudasEnEspanol.com). With over ten years of experience helping millions resolve their debts, this move solidifies the company’s pledge to Spanish speakers.

 The new platform focuses on providing the clear, trustworthy guidance necessary for the community to overcome debt, delivered entirely in their own language.

 “The new Spanish-language domain is a strategic investment in accessibility and impact,” said [Don Silvestri](https://www.debt.com/our-story/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral). “With Deudas en Español, we want anyone who speaks Spanish to more easily find clear, trustworthy information and real paths to resolve their debts, without language being a barrier.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Don Silvestri](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Don-150x150.png)
