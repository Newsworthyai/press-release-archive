 LOS ANGELES, CA — January 5, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Dreamer Cinderella, a romance drama with an ambitious studio-level rollout, is making a strong case for independent films competing on the same theatrical stage as major releases. Ahead of its nationwide theatrical release on January 23, the film has completed a successful series of high-profile advance screenings across Los Angeles and Texas, combining red-carpet events, celebrity attendance, and meaningful community impact.

 Rather than following traditional distributor-led marketing—often not resonating with our target audience or inattentive to the diversity within Latino audiences—the filmmakers behind The Dreamer Cinderella are taking an independent, self-directed approach. This strategy reflects a growing movement among Latino creators who are choosing to advocate for their work directly, dismantling systemic barriers and asserting greater control over how their stories are positioned and promoted.

 Designed to mirror the marketing playbook of major studios on a smaller budget, the campaign surrounding The Dreamer Cinderella signals a shift in how independent films can be launched theatrically—with intentional press outreach, grassroots audience-building, and national visibility. The film’s rollout includes cross-country screenings, targeted media engagement, and a virtual press junket scheduled for January 15, 2026, giving outlets direct access to the cast and creative team.

 Written, produced and directed by Jose Luis Ruiz (The First Cowboy, Holy Cash) for Dr. Ruiz Productions, The Dreamer Cinderella tells a modern romance rooted in resilience, identity, and emotional connection, offering a contemporary reimagining of a classic fairytale through a culturally resonant lens.

 The ensemble cast includes Tara Reid (American Pie), Anakaren Chablé (Troop Dragonfly), , Paul Johansson (One Tree Hill, Van Helsing), Paul Rodriguez (Holy Cash, Blood Work, Ali), Anthony W. Preston (Billionaire’s Borrowed Bride), Abigail Stanton (Ex-Convict Nanny & Billionaire Single Dad), Selena Ringel (You, Me & Her, Single Mother by Choice), and Victoria del Rosal (Lolita, Strange Love, #sorrynotsorry).

 By taking ownership of its marketing and distribution, The Dreamer Cinderella exemplifies a new model for independent filmmaking—one that prioritizes visibility, audience connection, and long-term cultural impact.

 The Dreamer Cinderella opens theatrically nationwide on January 23.
