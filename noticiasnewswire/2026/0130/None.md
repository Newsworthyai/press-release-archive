# Texas State University’s New Program Helps ‘LIFT’ Small Business Growth

AUSTIN, TX — January 29, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — More than 300 small business leaders recently completed Texas State University’s Learning and Insights for Forward Traction (LIFT) accelerator, a six-week program designed to strengthen marketing skills and help small businesses grow. LIFT was developed by Texas State’s Sustainable Cultivation and Advancement of Local Enterprises with University Partnerships (SCALEUP) initiative and delivered in collaboration with the Texas Association of Mexican American Chambers of Commerce (TAMACC) and other community partners.

 Results from the inaugural LIFT cohort show gains in marketing confidence. After completing the program, 98% of participants reported actively setting social media goals—an increase of 52 percentage points. Confidence using social media for business growth increased by 45 percentage points. The share reporting “good” or “expert” social media knowledge increased by 92 percentage points, from 5% to 97%.

 Small businesses are a driver of the economy. “The economic strength of Texas and other states depends on small businesses having practical tools they can use now,” said Pauline E. Anton, President and CEO of TAMACC. “Through our statewide chamber network, TAMACC shares resources, like the LIFT program, with entrepreneurs across Texas to advance their businesses and enhance economic prosperity.”

 SCALEUP developed LIFT by pairing research with applied training. “SCALEUP conducts research to better understand the challenges small businesses face when growing. Then, we use those insights to develop practical tools small business leaders can use,” said Dr. Josh Daspit, director of SCALEUP and associate professor at Texas State University.

 To broaden access, SCALEUP and its partners attracted more than 3,000 applicants. The first LIFT cohort included over 350 business owners, most based in Texas (82%), with 24 additional states also represented. Participants advanced from foundational marketing principles to topics such as platform analytics, content strategy, and goal setting.

 “LIFT helped me realize that your brand is more than a logo. It’s what customers feel,” said Rebecca Acosta-Ojeda, owner of Salon One 12 in Buda, Texas. Participants also had access to an AI Business Coach trained to address growth-related challenges with guidance tailored to each participant’s business and goals.

 “When business owners have practical tools to improve customer access, they’re better positioned to grow revenue, create jobs, and stabilize local economies,” said Dr. Marlene Orozco, LIFT program lead and SCALEUP research fellow.

 LIFT was developed with financial support from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Future opportunities are currently being planned. To receive updates on upcoming programs, visit https://scaleup.txst.edu/.
