# Peter Lamelas and Luis Savino: Forging a ‘New Golden Age’ for U.S.-Argentina Trade

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA / WASHINGTON D.C. — February 11, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSIRE) – Within the framework of a new and ambitious trade agreement between Argentina and the United States, the hemispheric business landscape has taken a definitive turn toward what experts call a “New Golden Age.” At the epicenter of this diplomatic and commercial relaunch, two fundamental figAures stand out: Luis Savino, Director of the Center for American Studies (CEA), and Peter Lamelas, U.S. Ambassador to Argentina.

 During the recent 35th-anniversary celebration of the CEA Foundation, Ambassador Lamelas—a renowned physician and prominent Florida businessman—described the current bond as a “unique moment.” With the explicit backing of the Donald Trump administration, Lamelas has been identified as the ideal figure to lead this transition, bringing a pragmatic vision that combines high-level diplomacy with the dynamism of the U.S. private sector.

 Meanwhile, Luis Savino, leading the CEA since its inception under the wing of Terence Todman, has successfully positioned the institution as the critical catalyst for companies looking to land in the Southern Cone. “This is a historic moment,” stated Savino, who has worked tirelessly to create institutional “bridges” that now allow for an unprecedented flow of investment in energy, technology, and agribusiness sectors.

 Washington’s support was underscored by the participation of Bruce Friedman, a high-ranking State Department official, who reaffirmed that under Savino’s leadership at the CEA and Lamelas’s management at the embassy, the bilateral relationship has reached strategic maturity. For the Miami business community and U.S. financial centers, this alignment represents a guarantee of legal certainty and market openness.
