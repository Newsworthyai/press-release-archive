MIAMI, FL — January 15, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Dr. Anna Chacón will participate in the Hispanic Prosperity Gala 2026, a high-profile event organized by Latino Wall Street, which will take place on February 10, 2026, at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.

 The Hispanic Prosperity Gala is an annual gathering that brings together business leaders, public figures, entrepreneurs, and influential personalities from the economic, cultural, and social spheres, with the goal of promoting the development, visibility, and prosperity of the Hispanic community in the United States.

 The 2026 edition will feature the participation of renowned personalities from sports, entertainment, business, and public life, solidifying its position as one of the most relevant events within the Hispanic business and leadership ecosystem. Dr. Anna Chacón’s presence at this event reinforces her commitment to dialogue, representation, and the promotion of initiatives that strengthen the impact of the Latino community in the country.

 Dr. Anna Chacón is, at her core, a physician who blends vocation, technology, and a personal touch. Her objective is clear: that no one should have to wait months or travel long distances to receive expert and empathetic dermatological care. From Miami to the entire country, she continues to expand her reach with the same passion that led her to become a doctor from day one.

 One of Dr. Chacón’s most notable achievements is her active medical license in all 50 states of the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as in the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This national coverage allows her to offer her services to patients across the country through a highly efficient telemedicine model. More than 50% of her consultations are conducted online, many of them with same-day appointments, through a concierge-style service system that has revolutionized access to dermatological treatments.

 Beyond her medical credentials, Dr. Anna Chacón has become a symbol of female leadership. As the founder and director of her own clinic, she combines her deep medical knowledge with a clear and effective business vision. She has successfully positioned herself in a highly competitive environment like Miami, creating a strong brand based on quality service, technological innovation, and a profoundly human approach.
