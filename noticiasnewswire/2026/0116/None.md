# Premium Finance Group on The Cover of Negocios Magazine

MIAMI, FL — January 16, 2026 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Negocios magazine launched its new edition with Premium Finance Group (PFG) on the cover. PFG is a firm specializing in life insurance premium financing for high-net-worth individuals and families, as well as for financial institutions and corporations, both in the United States and in international markets. The company distinguishes itself by structuring sophisticated solutions that optimize liquidity, preserve capital, and efficiently plan wealth transfer, integrating life insurance with carefully designed financing strategies.

 Almost forty years ago, a young and ambitious Manny Vidal entered the life insurance industry with a simple mission: to help people protect what matters most. What began as a visionary endeavor has become one of the most respected premium financing firms in the United States and international markets.

 The leadership team at Premium Finance Group reflects decades of experience in the global financial and insurance sectors. Having worked with top-tier institutions, regulators, and insurers, the company’s executives bring a deep and sophisticated understanding of the life insurance landscape.

 Manny Vidal’s legacy at Premium Finance Group is not only sustained by his founding vision but also by the active involvement of the second generation of his family in the firm’s leadership. Alongside his father, Manuel Alejandro “Chino” Vidal has become a key player in the company’s strategic and technical management. His role combines a strong analytical approach with a deep focus on long-term relationships, developing detailed financial models that allow for the evaluation of policy performance, optimization of coverage strategies, and support for informed decision-making.

 For her part, Danielle “Dani” Vidal, Vice President of Premium Finance Group, embodies the company’s future vision and the consolidation of its international growth. With experience in financial services, underwriting, and global insurance markets, Dani has been instrumental in expanding banking and carrier relationships, strengthening the firm’s negotiating power and ensuring access to the best products and terms for clients. Their “white-glove” service approach supports each client from the beginning of the process to the ongoing maintenance of the policy, reinforcing PFG’s reputation for excellence and reliability.
