 LOS ANGELES, CA — November 3, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — LATINAFest, the largest outdoor festival in the U.S. celebrating and empowering Latinas, has partnered with Dr. Ruiz Productions for a special fundraising screening of the feature film The Dreamer Cinderella. The event will take place on November 24, 2025, at the Harmony Gold Theater in Hollywood, with proceeds benefiting Proyecto Pastoral and the Survivor Justice Center, two Los Angeles–based nonprofits that provide essential services and advocacy for the immigrant community.

 Written, directed, and produced by Dr. Jose Luis Ruiz, The Dreamer Cinderella follows Xochitl, a Mexican-American fruit vendor whose life is upended when a powerful Hollywood director makes her the subject of a bold bet with his career rival. The film explores themes of identity, resilience, and self-worth against the backdrop of the immigrant experience in the U.S. It is set for nationwide release on January 23, 2026.

 “I could not be more thrilled to partner with LATINAFest to bring this story to thousands of powerful Latinas—like Xochitl, our Dreamer Cinderella—who embody courage and perseverance,” said Dr. Ruiz. “This film celebrates their spirit and determination.”

 The film stars Anakaren Chablé (Troop Dragaonfly) in her first leading role, alongside Tara Reid (American Pie, The Big Lebowski, Urban Legend), who plays the producer tasked with overseeing Xochitl’s transformation. The story mirrors the struggles of many immigrants navigating life in America while holding on to their dreams.

 “It’s imperative to support Latino filmmakers who tell our stories authentically—because our stories matter and deserve to be seen,” said Bel Hernández Castillo, Co-Founder of LATINAFest. Co-founder Naibe Reynoso added, “The Dreamer Cinderella beautifully captures the triumphs, challenges, and resilience of Latinas and all immigrants striving for a better life. This partnership aligns with LATINAFest’s mission to uplift our community and use storytelling as a catalyst for change.”

 The Survivor Justice Center’s Executive Director, Carmen E. McDonald, emphasized the importance of this cause: “As an organization serving immigrants and Dreamers, we witness firsthand the courage it takes to build a new life while preserving one’s heritage. The Dreamer Cinderella is an inspiring reflection of that strength, and we are proud to stand behind its message,” adding “We are proud to support The Dreamer Cinderella and its mission to uplift Latina voices through an inspiring story of courage, dedication, and love.”

 The fundraising evening will begin at 6:00 PM with red carpet arrivals, followed by a reception featuring food, refreshments, cultural vendors, spirits, and fun activities—including a transformational “make-up spruce-up.” The screening begins at 7:30 PM Tickets are $30 general admission and $100 VIP with exclusive perks
