# Mainspring Expands Channel Network with Leading Resellers as Linear Generator Installations Grow

MENLO PARK, CA — February 11, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Mainspring Energy today announced the expansion of its channel sales network into new markets and geographies, accelerating adoption of the company’s Linear Generators with the addition of three new resellers. The program welcomes dGEN Energy Partners, Gould Group, and INF Associates to the team of partner companies bringing Mainspring’s advanced power generation solutions to commercial and industrial companies.

 The addition of these leading power resellers expands Mainspring’s reach into more projects and vertical markets such as hotels and commercial buildings, EV charging infrastructure, cold storage facilities, and other industrial operations. It also opens the door to delivering projects in new regions for the company, particularly in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, which are prone to extreme weather events and extended power disruptions. As in the fast-growing U.S. linear generator market, commercial and industrial companies in this region are exploring linear generator solutions for greater control over their energy resources and costs. Mainspring’s products provide resilient, low-emission, rapidly installed power capacity with market-leading flexibility in siting, project scope, load profiles, and fuel types.

 “In an era of unprecedented load growth, demand is spiking globally for reliable, efficient power,” said Wissam Balshe, Senior Director of Channel Partnerships at Mainspring. “dGen, Gould Group and INF bring valuable expertise to our reseller team in deploying advanced power infrastructure in commercial and industrial markets. Together we are expanding our reach and accelerating the transition to cleaner, more efficient power.”

It builds on the launch of the Mainspring reseller network last year and Mainspring’s strategic partnerships with global power leaders Schneider Electric and ABM.
