# Minivela Launches Jam-Packed Summer Slate of Drama Shorts with Premiere of ‘Cholita Takes L.A.’ and ‘The Cholos of Beverly Hills’

MIAMI, FL — May 6, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Minivela, the first bilingual drama shorts platform dedicated to serving Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America, announced that its jam-packed summer slate (#MinivelaSummer) has launched with the Cinco de Mayo premiere of ‘Cholita Takes L.A.’

 Cholita Takes L.A. follows a bold Bolivian fashionista and Lucha Libre queen as she heads to Los Angeles to reconnect with her ailing Mexican-American abuela — and along the way, she finds love, rediscovers her roots, and surprises a crew of Cholas who never saw her coming! Created by Manuel Ruiz-Barrera, and written and directed by rising Chicana star Sylvia Ray, the dramatic short was produced in partnership with Chicano Hollywood and features cinematography by Abe Martinez, the acclaimed DP behind Cobra Kai, The Lincoln Lawyer, and Queen of the South.

 Produced and launched weekly in collaboration with actor and co-founder Carlos Ponce, viral influencer Haydita Veloz, and Chicano Hollywood, Minivela’s English and Spanish-language stories are live on MinivelaTV across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and X.

 A Packed #MinivelaSummer

 In late May, Minivela and Chicano Hollywood will also premiere the launch of their irreverent co-production mini shorts series, ‘The Cholos of Beverly Hills.’ The Cholos of Beverly Hills follows the Aguila family, whose accidental success in bitcoin catapults them from the gritty streets of East L.A. to the luxurious world of Beverly Hills. As they clash — and blend — their unapologetic Cholo roots with the posh culture of 90210, the Aguilas navigate gated mansions, uptight neighbors, and a lifestyle they never imagined, all with humor, heart, and authenticity. From lowriders in valet lines to block-party barbecues, The Cholos of Beverly Hills proves that real wealth comes from staying true to who you are.

 “Cholita, Cholos, robots, Haydita Veloz’s dramas…our #MinivelaSummer marks phase two of our evolution with a burst of creativity, and universal storytelling that is uniquely ours,” said Ruiz-Barrera, co-founder of Minivela, and creator of ‘Cholita Takes L.A.’ and the ‘The Cholos of Beverly Hills’.

 Inspired by telenovelas but also drawing on other genres, Minivela’s fast-paced, TikTok-style shorts deliver a mix of romantic comedies, original series, supernatural stories, and other intriguing dramas. The family-friendly content is designed for English, Spanish, and bilingual Latinos aged 18-34, reaching audiences through Minivela’s social media channels, connected TV (CTV), and strategic distribution partnerships with adtech giant Numatec and Brilla Media’s proprietary Nuestro Media network.
