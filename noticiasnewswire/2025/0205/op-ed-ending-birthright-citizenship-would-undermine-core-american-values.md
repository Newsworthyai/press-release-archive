# OP-ED: Ending Birthright Citizenship Would Undermine Core American Values

By Maribel A. Pizá, Attorney at Law

 Introduction

 As the Trump administration considers ending birthright citizenship, a policy enshrined in the 14th Amendment for over 150 years, the implications extend far beyond immigration.  This cornerstone of American identity and equality faces a significant challenge, raising profound legal, social, economic and international concerns.

 Legal Implications

 The automatic acquisition of U.S. citizenship by children born on American soil has been upheld by courts for generations.  Restricting it would require a constitutional amendment or a dramatic reinterpretation of the Citizenship Clause, potentially destabilizing other legal protections.  Moreover, children denied citizenship may become stateless, stripping them of fundamental rights and creating a permanent underclass within U.S. borders.

 Social Consequences

 This policy risks reinforcing xenophobia and deepening societal divides.  Children born to undocumented parents may face stigma, restricted access to public services, and psychological harm, compounding challenges already faced by mixed-status families.

 Economic Impacts

 Economically, restricting birthright citizenship would hinder labor force growth and reduce long-term contributions to the U.S. economy.  Additionally, the policy would impose significant administrative cost on hospitals and government agencies burdening taxpayers.

 International Ramifications

 This shift would tarnish America’s global reputation as a beacon of opportunity and equality, straining relations with countries heavily impacted by immigration.

 Conclusion

 Rather than eroding a cornerstone of constitutional and societal stability, policymakers should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that aligns with American values of equality, opportunity, and justice.
