# Hispanics Plan to Spend Up to $500 on Online Holiday Shopping Despite Carrying Credit Card Debt as High as $20,000

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Nov. 25, 2025 /Noticias Newswire/ – Year after year, online shopping gains ground among the Hispanic community, and 2025 is no exception. A new survey of more than 300 adults in the United States and Puerto Rico reveals that 63% prefer to shop online rather than go to physical stores, even in the midst of a holiday season marked by rising credit card debt.

 The convenience of the “virtual cart” is transforming consumer habits, but it can also put family finances at risk. According to the survey, 34% of participants shop online 2 to 3 times a month and 8% do so 2 to 3 times a week. Without a clear monthly budget, these frequent purchases can easily lead to crossing the “red line” of the family economy.

 How much do they plan to spend this holiday season? Despite financial challenges, most respondents plan to spend some amount on year-end festivities. The survey found that:

 * 44% plan to spend between $100 and $500
* 26% will spend between $50 and $100
* 15% will invest between $500 and $1,000
* 11% do not plan to spend anything
* Only 3% plan to spend more than $1,000

 Regarding payment methods for online purchases, debit cards represent 25% of preferences and credit cards 13%.

 High Debt… And Yet More Shopping One of the findings that most concerns experts is the level of credit card debt that respondents already hold. The results show that:

 

 Even so, many of them plan to spend between $100 and $500 on holiday shopping, which could aggravate their financial situation if they don’t handle their debts with care.

 “When people don’t know their debt-to-income ratio and get carried away by the emotion of discounts, it is very easy to fall into the cycle of debt,” explained Shirley Bolano, a financial journalist expert at Consolidated Credit. “Enjoying the holidays is important, but doing so at the expense of your financial peace of mind can turn the celebration into a problem that lasts all year.”

 Using credit cards for online shopping carries a risk to watch out for: every transaction can generate interest if the total balance is not paid at the end of the month, transforming small and frequent purchases into a large and difficult-to-manage debt. In fact, most respondents stated that they are already arriving at this season with credit card debt.

 Planning: The Key to Not Feeling Like You live on a “Dead-End Street” The survey reinforces the importance of financial planning as a tool to prevent year-end purchases from becoming a burden. Creating a realistic budget, knowing how much is owed and how much is earned, and establishing clear limits before taking advantage of sales like Black Friday can make the difference between closing the year with stability or with more debt.
