# The New York Latino Film Festival Marks 25 Years September 13-21, Opening With Joel Alfonso Vargas’ ‘Mad Bills To Pay’ and Celebrating Michelle Rodriguez With an Encore of ‘Girlfight’ and The NYLFF Impact Award

NEW YORK, NY — August 28, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The New York Latino Film Festival (NYLFF) celebrates its 25th anniversary September 13-21, 2025, with a weeklong showcase of film, music, and culture. The nation’s premier Latino film festival will screen 120 films from 15 countries at Regal Union Square (850 Broadway, NYC), along with a special presentation at United Palace (4140 Broadway, NYC).

 As part of its milestone festivities, NYLFF will present an encore screening of Girlfight (USA, 110 min., 2000), followed by a post-screening Q&A and full cast reunion. Karyn Kusama’s Sundance-winning debut—starring Michelle Rodriguez (Fast & Furious) as a fierce Brooklyn teenager who defies expectations to pursue boxing—honors the festival’s roots and mission to champion bold Latino storytelling. Rodriguez, who made her screen debut in Girlfight and won the Independent Spirit and Gotham Awards for Best Debut Performance, will also receive NYLFF’s Impact Award in recognition of her influential legacy and representation of Latinos in film.

 This year’s festival officially opens with the Sundance Award-Winning film Mad Bills to Pay (or Destiny, Dile Que No Soy Malo) (USA, 101 min., 2025), a gritty Bronx tale of young love, hustle, and community directed by Joel Vargas and starring Juan Collado and Destiny Checo. Presented by Amazon MGM Studios, the weeklong celebration culminates with a free block party in Quisqueya Plaza (Broadway and Dyckman Street), featuring a live performance by 2x Latin Grammy nominee J Noa (Nohelys Jiménez), a 19 year-old Dominican rapper, singer, and songwriter from San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic.

 “Marking 25 years of NYLFF is profoundly personal for me. This milestone celebrates the people, stories, and culture that have shaped who we are. Since the beginning, we’ve fought to create a space where Latino voices are seen, heard, and valued. It’s a testament to our community’s resilience, creativity, and power. This year’s lineup is our most ambitious yet—a love letter to the audiences, artists, and supporters who’ve stood with us every step of the way. I am deeply grateful to our corporate and studio partners whose belief in our mission has fueled our growth and impact,” said Calixto Chinchilla, Founder, New York Latino Film Festival.

 In celebration of this anniversary year, the iconic United Palace in Washington Heights will host a special screening of A Tiro Limpio (Dominican Republic, 100 min., 2025), the pulse-pounding action drama directed by Jean Gabriel Guerra and starring Frank Perozo, Manny Pérez, and Celinés Toribio, who also serves as executive producer. Set against the gritty streets of the Dominican Republic, the film follows a tense collision of loyalty, vengeance, and survival, brought to life through explosive action and layered storytelling. Adding to the festival’s musical heartbeat, La Salsa Vive (2024, 102 min., USA) charts the electrifying journey of Afro-Antillean salsa from its New York roots to its revival in Cali, Colombia. A project supported by Warner Bros. Discovery’s OneFifty and NYLFF Cinematics, the film weaves together archival treasures, legendary voices—including Rubén Blades, Henry Fiol, Johnny “Dandy” Rodríguez, Samuel Formell, Ángel Lebrón, and Willie Rosario—and high-energy performances to honor the genre’s enduring legacy.

 “WBD is proud to return to NYLFF as the presenting sponsor, especially in this milestone 25th anniversary year, and honored to have been the founding sponsor since day one. We’re thrilled to continue celebrating the richness of Latino filmmaking with its audiences and community,” said Dennis Williams, SVP and Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at Warner Bros. Discovery.

 “We are proud to support the New York Latino Film Festival, which provides a rich and diverse slate of programming representing several countries, as part of the city’s celebration of Latino Heritage Month,” said Commissioner of the NYC Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, Pat Swinney Kaufman. “A huge congratulations to Calixto Chinchilla and his entire team on the festival’s continued expansion and 25th anniversary milestone! We look forward to not only this year’s festival, but another 25 years to come.”

Music lovers can also enjoy Papota (2025, 17 min., Argentina/Uruguay), Martín Piroyansky’s wild, wacky ride following trap/hip-hop duo CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso as they bask in their Tiny Desk fame while falling under the sway of a sinister Svengali.
