# Believing in Youth, Investing in the Future — The Jaime &amp; Blanca Jarrín Foundation and Los Defensores Launch 2025 Scholarships to Empower Future Leaders in Law and Journalism

LOS ANGELES, CA — June 23, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Jaime & Blanca Jarrín Foundation (JBJF), in partnership with Los Defensores, is proud to announce the opening of its 2025 Scholarship Application Program. From June 23 through July 20, the Foundation will accept applications from college students pursuing degrees in Law and Journalism.

 This year’s program theme, “The Power of Believing,” celebrates the transformative effect of being seen, supported, and believed in. Hearing someone say, “I believe in you”, especially from a trusted mentor or guide, can be a turning point. It fuels resilience, awakens self-confidence, and affirms that your dreams are worth pursuing. That belief isn’t just encouraging; it’s empowering. Rooted in cultural pride and personal perseverance, the theme resonates with the emotional journey of students from underserved communities, who often carry the weight of generational sacrifice while striving to find their voice, their place, and their path forward.

 As JBJF’s founding fiscal corporate partner, Los Defensores, a trusted brand dedicated to empowering the Latino community through legal access, joins in advancing this mission through its Siempre Contigo community initiative. Together, JBJF and Los Defensores are committed to closing educational gaps and championing the next generation of Latino leaders in law and journalism, fields where their stories, perspectives, and voices are sorely needed.

 “The Power of Believing is about how life-changing it can be to hear the words, ‘I believe in you,’ especially when they come from someone who truly sees you and stands beside you through every obstacle,” said Nicole Cordero, Vice President of Community Affairs and Marketing at Los Defensores. “That kind of belief can light a fire within, unlocking strength, hope, and the courage to keep going. It reminds you that you’re not alone, and that someone is willing to invest in your future. That’s why we support scholarships, because when we believe in students, we help them believe in themselves and take the steps to truly “salir adelante.”

 The Jaime and Blanca Jarrín Foundation was founded to support the next generation of changemakers, college students from underserved communities, through meaningful scholarship opportunities. “When we invest in our youth’s education, we’re investing in stronger, more vibrant communities for us all. By offering meaningful financial support, we help protect students’ hard-earned dreams while reinforcing a powerful message: we believe in their potential to succeed, thrive, and lead,” said Jaime Jarrín, MLB Hall of Famer and former legendary Los Angeles Dodgers Spanish-language broadcaster.

 “Receiving the JBJF scholarship was truly transformative for my educational journey. It allowed me to focus on using the scholarship to fund the remainder of my bachelor’s degree at CSULB. Leaving my rural hometown of Salton City to chase bigger dreams in Long Beach wasn’t easy, or affordable, but it was the best investment I could make in myself. I’m deeply grateful to JBJF and Los Defensores for easing that path and empowering me to inspire others through my story,” stated Cruzzanna Hernandez, 2023 JBJF Scholarship Recipient, BA in Communications with a Minor in Public Relations, CSULB
