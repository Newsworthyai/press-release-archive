# Consolidated Credit Highlights Misuse of Credit Cards Among Hispanics as a Silent Threat to Their Finances

Fort Lauderdale, FL — June 16, 2025 [Noticias Newswire] — A recent survey conducted by Consolidated Credit reveals an uncomfortable truth about credit cards: for many Hispanic families, this essential financial tool has become a double-edged sword—when mismanaged, it turns into a silent trap of debt and financial stress.

 More Access, More Risk According to the study, over 90% of Hispanic participants own at least one credit card. Surprisingly, 42% have between two and three cards, and 28% between four and five. Although the Hispanic Community in the U.S. prioritizes eliminating debt in 2025, the level of access to credit, without proper education, significantly increases the risk of over-indebtedness.

 In the U.S., total credit card debt reached $1.18 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This trend reflects more than just a pattern of consumption—it highlights a worrying lack of financial literacy: 61% of respondents reported learning how to manage credit cards only after falling into debt.

 The Impact Goes Beyond Numbers The survey found that 51% of participants feel that credit card use has negatively impacted their financial situation, and 14% regret having used them. Alarmingly, 8% stated that their misuse “ruined their lives.”

 These figures reveal that beyond unnecessary spending, many Hispanic families rely on credit cards to cover real needs: emergencies, basic living expenses, and maintaining their credit scores.

 What Do Hispanics Look for in a Credit Card? The study shows that when choosing a credit card, the most valued factors are:

 * Low or 0% interest rate for several months: 72%
* No annual fee: 64%
* Rewards and travel miles: 54%
* No international fees: 18%

 However, using more than 30% of available credit can seriously hurt credit scores and make it harder to access loans, housing, or even jobs.
