# Smart Swaps and Budget-Friendly Ingredients for Heart-Healthy Meals

MISSION, KS — June 13, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Rising food costs can make healthy eating a challenge for many families. In fact, a poll conducted by Research!America found about 60% of Americans cite the cost of healthy food as their single biggest barrier to achieving better nutrition.

 “Food is deeply rooted to family and community,” said Arlen Vanessa Marin, M.S., R.D., a national volunteer for the American Heart Association. “Recipes are passed down through generations, but as grocery prices rise, finding creative ways to stretch your budget while maintaining a nutritious diet is key. Simple swaps – like homemade vinaigrettes instead of sugary bottled dressings, frozen veggies instead of fresh or lentils instead of processed meat – can make a big difference without sacrificing flavor.”

 Consider these simple tips from the experts at the American Heart Association, devoted to changing the future to a world of healthier lives for all, to help you enjoy your favorite meals while keeping both your heart and wallet happy.

 Protein without the price tag

 If you’re looking to add more protein without overspending, try these affordable, nutrient-packed options:

 * Beans and other legumes are protein-packed, high-fiber choices for heart-healthy meals. Add them to soups, stews or salads, or enjoy them as dips with whole-grain crackers or tortillas. Choose canned, no-salt-added varieties for a quick and healthy option.
* Tofu and tempeh are versatile, plant-based staples that are rich in protein. Add silken tofu to miso soup, stir-fry firm tofu with garlic for a heart-smart meal or add tempeh to noodle dishes and curries.
* Ground turkey or chicken are leaner, often more affordable alternatives to ground beef. For a budget-friendly twist, try them in dishes like turkey picadillo or homemade tacos.

 Better grains for your heart

 White rice is a staple in many diets, but it can spike blood sugar. When refrigerated and reheated, it can increase resistant starch while also raising the risk of harmful bacteria. Consider these ways to keep it heart-smart:

 * Brown rice is a fiber-rich alternative to white rice that pairs well with almost any dish.
* Quinoa is another protein-rich grain that works in soups, salads and side dishes.
* Barley is used in many Asian soups as a whole-grain swap.

 Canned, dried and frozen alternatives

 Healthy eating doesn’t mean you have to buy everything fresh, especially when fresh food isn’t readily available. Canned, dried and frozen foods can be just as nutritious and help eliminate costly food waste from spoilage as they stay edible longer. Check nutrition labels for low-sodium, no-salt-added and no-sugar-added options.

 * Frozen fruits and vegetables are picked at peak ripeness and frozen to lock in nutrients. Use them in stir-fries, soups, smoothies or as quick side dishes.
* Canned tuna is packed with omega-3s, wallet-friendly and easy to mix with salads, sandwiches or in brown rice bowls.
