 CINCINNATI, OH — November 19, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — If you’re a parent or caregiver of an infant or young child, you probably know the challenges of properly installing a car seat. In fact, three out of four car seats on the road today are installed incorrectly. Now a new online service allows parents and caregivers to meet virtually with a specially trained safety expert who can help ensure they are choosing and correctly using the right car seat or booster seat.

 Anyone can use this free service. It allows users to meet virtually and confidentially with a safety professional in their own driveway during a day and time that is most suitable for them.

 For Ana, proper car seat installation is a big concern. She is expecting a baby in the spring and knows that installing a car seat can be complicated.

 “I know how difficult it can be to install a car seat, but I also understand how important it is to know how to do it correctly,” Ana said. “So, utilizing this virtual service with my cell phone, having a safety expert assist me from my home, is a tremendous service. And it gives me great peace of mind.”

 The free car seat check is made possible by a grant from Buckle Up for Life to the National Safety Council.

 “We all know installing a car seat can be difficult,” said Gloria Del Castillo, senior specialist of community engagement for Buckle Up for Life. “So, it is important that parents and caregivers aren’t shy about asking for help. But they often don’t know where to turn to get that help. With this program, parents can meet with experts at their convenience and make sure their children’s seats are installed correctly.”

 Buckle Up for Life is a child passenger safety education program whose safety experts work in communities throughout the nation and check thousands of car seats each year. It was created by Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and Toyota. Motor vehicle crashes are one of the leading causes of unintentional child deaths.

 The team at National Safety Council providing the virtual education through the grant says the platform is a game changer.

 “No matter where you live and regardless of your schedule, this platform allows you to meet with an expert, have them view your car seat and get guidance on proper installation,” said Rosana Rivera, a child passenger safety technician with NSC. “After all, every parent deserves to have the confidence of knowing they are doing all they can to help keep their children safe.”
