# Secure your Children’s Future with a Temporary Guardian

SANTA MONICA, CA — March 11, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — World Voices Media, a California non-profit organization, in partnership with HCN Global (hcnglobal.com), has launched Protege a tus Niños (Protect your Children), an initiative that aims to help millions of immigrant parents take proactive steps to designate a guardian and keep their children out of the foster care system. This initiative aims to inform families on how to appoint Temporary Guardians for their children, ensuring legal and emotional safeguards in the event of detention or deportation.

 There are still over a thousand children who were separated from their parents during the first Trump Administration; children who remain unaccounted for and have never been reunited with their families.

 Protege a tus Niños empowers immigrant and undocumented parents with the knowledge and tools to legally appoint a Temporary Emergency Guardian for their children. It explains the rationale and shows practical steps, such as writing emergency contact information inside children’s shoes. Additionally, establishing a temporary guardianship is a proactive step to ensure your children’s well-being during a parent’s temporary absence, allowing a trusted person to make decisions in the child’s best interest.

 “There are approximately 5.4 million U.S.-born children who are now at risk of being placed in foster care if their undocumented parents are detained or deported,” explains Patricia Frausto-Rodriguez, Executive Director of World Voices Media. “Our Latino immigrant communities face frightening times, with real threats of families being separated and children losing their parents and getting lost in foster care. Through this initiative, we hope to help immigrant families access resources and information so they can legally appoint a temporary guardian for their little ones and be prepared to deal with the worst-case scenario.”

 The campaign includes a series of radio and television spots and social media ads explaining what Temporary Guardianship is and directing families and nonprofits to free resources at Protegeatusninos.org and Keepyourkids.org.

 In addition, the campaign will include:

 * Bilingual YouTube tutorials to serve as a guide for parents on how to establish legally valid guardianships.
* A state-by-state database with downloadable forms, allowing parents to complete the process before the child is separated from his or her parents.
* Links to local immigrant rights advocacy organizations for direct assistance.
* Outreach through community-based organizations and partner schools, ensuring that parents, including farm workers and other at-risk populations, receive these essential materials.
