# Minivela Launches YouTube Drama Shorts Platform, MinivelaTV, Featuring Soaps, Rom-Coms…and even Malas Suegras and Strange Happenings!

MIAMI, FL – March 11, 2025 – (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) – Minivela, the bilingual drama shorts platform dedicated to serving Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America, officially launched today on YouTube as MinivelaTV with a debut lineup of digital shorts featuring soaps, rom-coms…and even malas suegras (monster-in-laws) and strange happenings.

 Produced in collaboration with actor and Minivela co-founder Carlos Ponce, viral influencer Haydita Veloz, and Chicano Hollywood, the platform’s English and Spanish-language stories are now live on MinivelaTV across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and X.

 “Even in this initial phase, Minivela is built to scale exponentially, offering advertisers a sophisticated, creative, and innovative platform to engage young Latinos and crossover audiences,” said Manny Ruiz, Minivela Co-Founder and Chief Content Officer.

 Ponce added, “For content creators and filmmakers, Minivela represents a terrific opportunity to evolve as actors, writers, directors—and, in some cases, to develop stories that can grow into full series or feature films. This unique approach is one of the things that most excites us.”

 Inspired by telenovelas, Minivela’s fast-paced, TikTok-style shorts deliver a mix of romantic comedies, original series, supernatural stories, and other intriguing dramas. The family-friendly content is designed for English, Spanish, and bilingual Latinos aged 18-34, reaching audiences through Minivela’s social media channels, connected TV (CTV), and strategic distribution partnerships with adtech giant Numatec and Brilla Media’s proprietary Nuestro Media network. Both Numatec and Brilla Media are key partners in the Minivela joint venture.

 Programming Points

 Produced primarily in Miami, Los Angeles, and Texas, and debuting twice weekly, the original scripted Minivelas are the works of content creators who collectively have millions of followers.  A cross-section of the Latino diaspora representing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, and South Americans are among the producers, and actors who are regularly participating in the Minivelas. See the trailer.

 The initial group of English and Spanish-language Minivelas includes such titles as “Woman Finds Love on the TV Dating Show from Hell”, “Hombre compra novia robot para creer celos a su ex”, “Chica gamer huye de casa y cae en una trampa peligrosa”, and “Never Forget Valentine’s Day.”

 As part of a partnership with Noticias Newswire, the nation’s leading U.S. Hispanic press release wire service, all future drama shorts will be promoted with individual press release distributions that feature more than 200 online guaranteed placements.

 “Our approach to promote our stories and our talent will be as broad as it will be relentless,” said Ruiz.
