# The 50: Voices of a Nation, a Groundbreaking Look at American Democracy in Action

CHICAGO, IL — December 19, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — CAN‑TV, in partnership with The Fulcrum, and Latino News Network, announce the premiere of The 50: Voices of a Nation, an unprecedented hour‑long television special capturing the lived experiences, concerns, and civic engagement of communities across the United States.

 The program aired on Thursday, December 18 at 7 p.m. CST on CAN‑TV Channel 19 in Chicago and can be streamed in its entirety HERE.

 Hosted by Hugo Balta, Executive Editor of The Fulcrum and Publisher of the Latino News Network, The 50 is part of a four‑year national reporting initiative documenting how Americans navigated life under the Trump administration. The series explores a central question: What drove voters to the ballot box in 2024, and how is the administration responding to their hopes, fears, and demands?

 “This special is more than a broadcast — it’s a journey into the heart of America,” said Balta. “By listening to communities from coast to coast, we uncover how democracy is lived every day: through resilience, through struggle, and through the voices that demand to be heard.”

 The first eleven episodes already published by The Fulcrum showcase the diversity of challenges and resilience across America. In Rhode Island, families highlight the strain on education and social services. Shannon Gormley, a teacher in Rhode Island Public Schools, is concerned. “Nervous. My students come to me and say, ‘Miss, are we still going to be able to have free lunch?’ I think about our students who are in special education, and how the Department of Ed really helps our students in terms of individual education plans. So, for me, I guess the word would be nervous, worry.”

 In Iowa, Latino-majority communities grapple with immigration crackdowns while organizing for civic power. “The reality is that ICE is in Iowa, but the tactics that they’re using, the level which they’re in our community, the fear that they have, the weaponized fear that they are able to utilize…it’s all things that we are continuing to work with our communities right now,” said Elena Casillas Hoffman, Communication Specialists with Iowa MMJ.

 Additional episodes explore rural towns confronting deportation raids, cities reimagining public safety, and immigrant workers organizing for civic power. Together, these stories offer a rare, unfiltered look at democracy as it is lived — one story, one state, one voice at a time.
