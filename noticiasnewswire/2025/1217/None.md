 CHICAGO, IL — December 17, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Latino News Network (LNN) is proud to announce that journalist and multimedia storyteller Britton Struthers-Lugo is joining the newsroom as the network’s new Digital Producer. In this role, Struthers will oversee all of LNN’s social media platforms, lead digital strategy, and create original content designed specifically for LNN’s rapidly growing online audience.

 Struthers is already a familiar name to LNN readers. Her reporting has appeared across the network, including on Latino News Network and Illinois Latino News, where she has covered community-centered stories. Her previous work includes a solutions‑focused piece on flooding challenges in Illinois communities and a widely shared article exploring how to support immigrant families during heightened ICE activity. Her storytelling reflects the values that have defined LNN since its founding.

 “I’m very excited to be joining LNN’s newsroom and be part of a team that uplifts voices that deserve more attention in the media,” Struthers-Lugo said. “I love serving my Latino-Hispanic community and am grateful to Hugo (Balta) and LNN for the opportunity to continue doing so through meaningful journalism.”

 Founded in 2012 to address the persistent underrepresentation of Latino voices in mainstream media, the Latino News Network has grown into a trusted regional and national source for community-driven journalism. LNN’s mission is rooted in equity, accountability, and service, with a commitment to reporting that reflects the lived experiences, challenges, and achievements of Latino communities across the United States. Through its state-based outlets—including Illinois Latino News, Connecticut Latino News (flagship), and others—LNN elevates stories that too often go untold.

 “Struthers-Lugo’s addition marks an important step in LNN’s continued expansion,” said Hugo Balta, Publisher of LNN. “As digital platforms become central to how audiences consume news, her leadership will help strengthen LNN’s presence across social media and ensure that its journalism reaches readers where they are. Her background in community reporting, combined with her passion for digital storytelling, positions her to play a key role in shaping the network’s next chapter.”

 With Struthers-Lugo at the helm of digital production, Balta said LNN is poised to deepen its engagement, broaden its reach, and continue fulfilling its mission: to inform, empower, and uplift Latino communities through high-quality, community-centered journalism.

 Struthers-Lugo begins her new position in January 2026.
