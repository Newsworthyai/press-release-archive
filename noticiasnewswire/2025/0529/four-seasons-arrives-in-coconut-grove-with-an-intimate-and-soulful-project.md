# Four Seasons arrives in Coconut Grove with an Intimate and Soulful project

MIAMI, FL — May 29, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Coconut Grove, with its vibrant history and bohemian spirit, becomes the setting for the first private residence of the Four Seasons in Coconut Grove, Miami. This is an elegant 20-story building with just 70 residences, developed by CMC Group and Fort Partners, which seeks to offer much more than ocean views: a living experience connected to nature and the history of the place.

 The design, by architect Luis Revuelta, takes direct inspiration from the Grove’s landscape—banyan trees, mahogany trees, and the area’s slow pace. The building’s curved forms not only give it a distinctive profile but also convey a sense of calm that is very much in tune with its surroundings.

 The project celebrates the soul of the neighborhood: its past as Miami’s oldest neighborhood, its multicultural heritage, and a vibrant cultural scene, ranging from art festivals to local markets. All of this is part of the lifestyle this new community seeks to offer.

 Wellness with a European Signature

 The interior design will be led by renowned Italian designer Michele Bönan, who has worked on iconic projects around the world. Additionally, the building will include a 10,000-square-foot spa with amenities such as a sauna, cold plunge pool, ice fountain, and other experiences inspired by ancient Roman baths.

 The idea behind the project is simple: to create a home where luxury feels natural, where every space invites you to linger. Close to the water, distinctive restaurants, independent boutiques, and outstanding schools, this new residence seeks to be an authentic extension of the lifestyle that makes Coconut Grove unique.
