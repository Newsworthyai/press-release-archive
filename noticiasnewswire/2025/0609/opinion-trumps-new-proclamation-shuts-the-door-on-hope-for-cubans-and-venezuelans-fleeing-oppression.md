# Opinion: Trump’s New Proclamation Shuts the Door on Hope for Cubans and Venezuelans Fleeing Oppression

South Florida — June 9, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — President Donald Trump’s recent proclamation seeking to restrict the entry of Venezuelan and Cuban nationals into the United States is a deeply troubling development for communities already burdened by hardship. This measure not only criminalizes the human need to seek protection but also turns a blind eye to the political and humanitarian crises that force these individuals to flee their countries.

 Cubans and Venezuelans are not arriving at our borders out of convenience—they are escaping authoritarian regimes, economic collapse, persecution for their beliefs, and deteriorating living conditions. Many already have family in the United States, contribute meaningfully to our economy, and are actively trying to regularize their immigration status through lawful means. This proclamation disregards their reality and sends a cruel message of exclusion.

 Historically, the United States has stood as a beacon of liberty for those escaping tyranny. How, then, can we justify a policy that effectively turns away those most in need of refuge? Such action dehumanizes thousands and undermines the very foundations of our asylum system and moral leadership.

 This measure will not dismantle the dictatorships in Havana or Caracas. It will not stop desperate families from seeking safety. What it will do is place more lives at risk, force many to take more dangerous routes, and prolong the suffering of families separated by violence and poverty.

 As an immigration attorney with nearly two decades of experience, I have listened firsthand to the harrowing stories of those who have crossed jungles, rivers, and deserts to reach the United States with the hope of being heard. We cannot allow that hope to be extinguished.

 I urge our leaders and fellow Americans to consider the human impact of these decisions. Compassion and justice should not be partisan. They are the values that must guide our immigration policies and our nation’s future.
