# Nova University Honors Actress Adriana Bianco with an Exclusive Space Showcasing Her Career in the Film Industry

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL — September 22, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — In an unprecedented event, the prestigious Nova University has granted a permanent tribute to distinguished Argentine actress Adriana Bianco, promoter and founder for 24 years of the Argentine and Latin Film Festival in South Florida.

 The University has dedicated an exclusive space in its central library to her artistic and cultural journey, making her the first Argentine actress to receive this honor. The tribute features a permanent exhibition with photographs, original posters from the film “La niña y el gato”—the role that earned her the highest distinction, the “Silver Condor Award”, which is also on display. Historical documents are part of the collection, including a personal letter addressed to Bianco by former Argentine President Juan Domingo Perón, as well as audiovisual materials that reflect more than five decades of her career and her tireless work in promoting Latin American cinema in the United States.

 The ceremony was attended by Marcelo Gilardoni, Consul General of Argentina in Miami, academic authorities, filmmakers, acclaimed actress Lupita Ferrer, Hispanic Target Magazine editor Nancy Clara, students, and members of the cultural community.

 For his part, Consul Gilardoni emphasized the invaluable contribution of “Adrianita” Bianco (as she is affectionately known in the industry) as a cultural ambassador and bridge between Argentina, Latin America, and the United States.

 Adriana Bianco stated: “This recognition is a dream come true. I feel honored and deeply grateful that Nova University has decided to dedicate a space to my career. It is a source of pride for me, for my country Argentina, and for Latin American cinema, which we celebrate every year.”

 The Argentine and Latin Film Festival 2025 will be held every Sunday throughout September at Nova University, featuring film screenings, Latin art exhibitions, and reception cocktails, consolidating itself as a multicultural gathering point for the South Florida community.
