# Lights, camera, finance! The 2025 FinTalk Awards spotlight the leaders of digital money education

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – Sept. 22, 2025 /Noticias Newswire/ — The spotlight returns to money’s brightest voices. Debt.com is unveiling the 2025 FinTalk Awards—refreshed and rebranded—to celebrate creators who are redefining how the world talks about personal finance.

 Formerly the FinTok Awards, this annual initiative has moved past TikTok-only roots. Today, the FinTalk Awards span every major platform—from YouTube to Instagram Reels—honoring personal finance creators who engage audiences with smart, approachable, and truly transformative money guidance.

 According to [Don Silvestri](https://www.debt.com/our-story/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral) “these creators are far more than influencers; they act as mentors and motivators, giving everyday people the knowledge to maximize their money and build a more secure future—an impact worthy of recognition.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Don Silvestri](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Don-150x150.png)

Voting is open from September 22 through October 6, and the winners announced in October.

 “There’s no shortage of financial noise on social media—but these nominees cut through it. They’re not selling gimmicks or get-rich-quick schemes. They’re giving practical, honest advice that can change lives,” adds [Howard Dvorkin](https://www.debt.com/author/hdvorkin/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral), CPA and Chairman of Debt.com. “That’s why the FinTalk Awards matter—because the winners aren’t just collecting likes, they’re helping people get their financial house in order.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Howard Dvorkin](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banners-v4-a-mo-150x150.jpg)
