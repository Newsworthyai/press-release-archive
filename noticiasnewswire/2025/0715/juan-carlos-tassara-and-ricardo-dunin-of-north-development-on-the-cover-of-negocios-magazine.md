# Juan Carlos Tassara and Ricardo Dunin of North Development on The Cover of Negocios Magazine

MIAMI, FL — July 15, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Negocios magazine launched its new edition with a cover featuring two real estate giants: Ricardo Dunin, founder of Oak Capital, and Juan Carlos Tassara, co-founder of Edifica, one of the most important development firms in Peru. In this context, North Development emerged, where Tassara and Dunin formed a strategic alliance by combining their knowledge and vision to introduce a new offering to the luxury residential market in Miami, focusing on a flexible rental model that adapts to the demands of an increasingly dynamic and globalized environment.

 “We decided to develop an innovative concept that would meet buyers’ expectations: being able to rent their units short-term when they’re unoccupied and enjoy high-end hospitality services when they’re in the city. FLATS is the result of that vision,” said Ricardo Dunin, founder of Oak Capital.

 Miami’s real estate market is constantly evolving, driven by a growing demand for innovative projects that redefine the way people live, invest, and experience the city. With its vibrant urban lifestyle, its appeal to international investors, and its key role as a financial and cultural epicenter, Miami has established itself as one of the most dynamic cities for real estate development in the United States.

 “Our strength lies in our specialization in micro rental units, a model we have perfected with more than 60 projects in Peru and adapted to Miami with Domus. Unlike other developers, we have know-how in efficient design, construction, and operational management, which allows us to offer an optimized product for investors and end-users. Furthermore, our commitment to a flexible and profitable short-term rental model responds to growing demand in Brickell”, said Juan Carlos Tassara, co-founder of Edifica.
