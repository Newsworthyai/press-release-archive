 LOS ANGELES, CA — December 2, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Hispanic Motor Press announced the winners of the 2026 Hispanic Motor Press Awards (HMPA) during AutoMobility LA at the Los Angeles Convention Center, the opening day of the world-famous Los Angeles Auto Show. The 16th annual HMPA program recognized the best new model year 2026 vehicles in 5 categories for Hispanic car buyers, with awards presented to executives from each winning manufacturer.

 “With so many brands and models to choose from, and manufacturer advancements in technology, safety features, infotainment, and cleaner mobility, we help guide Hispanic car buyers who represent 1 in 4 of new-vehicle purchases,” states Ricardo Rodriguez-Long, founder and president of the Hispanic Motor Press. “The United States is the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, making it culturally vital to reach this consumer in their own language.”

 The 2026 HMPA vehicle winners as best of their class are:

 * Best EV: Hyundai IONIQ 9
* Best Family Car: Kia Carnival
* Best SUV: Toyota RAV4
* Best Pick-up Truck: RAM 1500
* Best Luxury: Lincoln Navigator

 “We are proud to help the consumer find the right car for their need,” said Gil Silva, one of the judges, who works at Mitchell reviewing the repairs and longevity of car components.

 “Any of these five vehicles deliver excellent value overall,” said Camilo Alfaro, judge and CEO of the Hispanic Consortium, an organization that assists OEMs in reaching Hispanic publications.

 “There is always a bit of tension choosing ‘THE’ winner of a class. Personally, I am confident that the top 3 of each category will reward the consumer,” said Carlos Hernandez, judge, and publisher of Latinos News newspaper.

 All 2026 HMPA finalist vehicles offer a positive overall ownership experience and are considered the most significant automobiles in the market, as they meet the needs and desires of Hispanic consumers. The 16 auto manufacturers voluntarily submitted their entries, and the 16-member jury panel evaluated vehicles during an 8-month testing period from January to September 2025.
