# HPRA Names Julio Ricardo Varela 2025 ¡BRAVO! Awards Journalist of the Year

MIAMI, FL — September 23, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) proudly announced today that independent media journalist Julio (Julito) Ricardo Varela will be honored as 2025 ¡BRAVO! Awards Journalist of the Year honoree. Varela will be recognized as a pioneer of independent, Latino-led media, having served as a leading voice on Latino issues and built a lasting digital space for journalism and community over the past 20 years.

 Varela will be recognized alongside this year’s DEI Champion honoree and Cannes Can: Diversity Collective founder Adrianne C. Smith and Pioneer of the Year honoree and DRAFTED cofounder Karina Martínez during the ¡BRAVO! Awards gala taking place on November 13, 2025, at The Drake Hotel in Chicago, Illinois.

 “Long before it was a part of our norm, Julio built one of the first Latino-led independent news spaces online, proving that a small, community-rooted outlet could shape coverage and defend editorial freedom,” said HPRA National President Sonia V. Diaz. “His ability to invent and reinvent the space over time is both inspiring and critical at a time when inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation are on the rise and local newsrooms are under threat.”

 Varela’s trajectory spans reporting, editing, and building platforms that center community. He founded Latino Rebels in 2011 and grew it into a nationally recognized digital outlet, becoming one of the top independent Latino digital news sites in the world. He later served as President of Futuro Media, supporting Latino USA, In The Thick, and Latino Rebels across both audio and digital platforms. He also led new business for Futuro Studios to expand premium audio partnerships. Today, he serves as Senior Producer and Strategist at Free Press, writes as a columnist for MSNBC, and publishes The Latino Newsletter, launched in May 2024, which has quickly become a daily home for reporting and analysis through a clear Latino lens.

 His reporting and commentary have appeared in The New York Times and various outlets, including The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, ESPN, NBC News, Univision, and Telemundo. He received the National Association of Hispanic Journalists’ (NAHJ) inaugural DALE Award for advancing fair and accurate portrayals of Latinos in media.

 Varela is a Harvard College graduate, cum laude, where he served as Sports Editor for The Harvard Crimson. He credits community voices for shaping his work and mission. He will join a prestigious group of former ¡BRAVO! Journalist of the Year honorees, including Alicia Menendez, Ilia Calderón, León Krauze, María Elena Salinas, María Hinojosa, and Teresa Rodríguez, among others.
