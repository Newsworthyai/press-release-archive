# 4 Everyday Ways to Keep Your Brain Sharp

MISSION, KS — August 12, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Staying in shape goes beyond physical fitness – keeping your brain health top of mind is crucial for your overall well-being, too. To sharpen your mind, consider these everyday ways for prioritizing brain health.

 Stimulate Your Mind

 While “exercising” typically refers to running, walking or biking, remember you can give your brain a workout as well. Provide a boost for your brain with easy and enjoyable activities like reading, puzzles, math games like sudoku or artistic challenges such as drawing or crafting.

 Eat Healthy Foods

 Establishing a strong foundation for brain health can start in the kitchen by preparing healthy foods. Adding whole grains, fish, legumes, healthy fats and fruits and vegetables, including grapes and leafy greens, can encourage better brain wellness.

 Research suggests grapes help maintain a healthy brain. UCLA researchers, in a human study of elderly subjects with mild cognitive decline, found consuming 2 1/4 cups of grapes every day preserved healthy metabolic activity in regions of the brain associated with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.

 This Walnut Sunflower-Crusted Salmon with Honey-Lemon Grapes is a flavor-packed way to add California grapes to the menu while simultaneously supporting brain and heart health. Salmon, rich in omega-3s, is topped with a crunchy walnut-sunflower seed crust for a savory, nutty bite. Pair with juicy grapes and onions marinated in honey and lemon for a burst of sweetness and tang to balance the rich salmon in this nutritious meal.

 Prioritize Mental Health

 Reducing anxiety may be easier said than done, but it starts with healthy everyday habits. Practice mindfulness by meditating or simply turning off distractions like social media. Get outside for fresh air or find a hobby you enjoy. Join a support group, reach out to loved ones and, if you feel you’re experiencing negative mental health systems, talk with a mental health professional.

 Exercise Regularly

 Physical activities that increase your heart rate also increase blood flow to the brain and throughout your body. It doesn’t have to be rigorous or strenuous – go for a walk around the neighborhood, dance in the living room, tend to your garden or enjoy a bike ride when the weather cooperates. Remember to replenish your energy and hydration – California grapes are an easy way to deliver both.
