LOS ANGELES, CA — June 11, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Minivela, the first bilingual drama shorts platform dedicated to serving Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America, today announced that media executive Cristina Sarnoff has joined the company as a shareholder and strategic partner leading Brand Partnerships, Productions, and Distribution.

 Sarnoff, a seasoned media executive and former senior executive at Warner Bros.

 “As a Cuban American, my love for novelas began on the couch with my abuela – those stories have stayed with me. Minivelas is a tribute to that legacy, reinvented for the mobile-first, short-form world Latinos dominate today. We’ve seen the explosive rise of micro-dramas in China, a billion-dollar industry now setting global trends. With Brilla Media, we’re building cultural highways in front of and behind the camera, and inviting brands to authentically show up in this powerful new format – meeting Hispanics where they are, with stories made con sazón y corazón,” said Cristina Sarnoff, CEO and Founder of Sarnoff Media Co.
