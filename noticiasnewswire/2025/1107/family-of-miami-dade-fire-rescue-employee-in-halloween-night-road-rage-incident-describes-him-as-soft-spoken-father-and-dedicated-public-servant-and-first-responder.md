# Family of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Employee, in Halloween Night Road-rage Incident, Describes Him as ‘Soft-Spoken Father’ and Dedicated Public Servant and First Responder

MIAMI, FL — November 6, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The family of Emilio Humberto Rodriguez, the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue employee accused in a Halloween night road-rage shooting, is speaking out, describing him as a devoted father, longtime public servant, and first responder who “felt genuinely afraid for his life” in a confrontation that turned violent.

 Rodriguez, 54, has worked for Miami-Dade County for 18 years and currently serves as a fire safety supervisor with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. Court records show he has no prior criminal history.

 “He’s quiet, kind, soft spoken, and always the one helping others,” said a relative who attended Rodriguez’s daughter’s Sweet 16 party just weeks before the incident. “We still can’t believe this happened. He’s the dad who shows up for everything — PTA meetings, school events, even dance rehearsals.”

 “Emilio isn’t just a great dad, he was a great son to our mother,” his sister adds. “He would visit her literally twice a week and every weekend, making sure she had quality time with her grandkids.”

 According to the Miami-Dade Police Department, officers responded around 7:45 p.m. on October 31 to Northwest 87th Avenue and 64th Street following reports of a shooting during an apparent road-rage dispute.

 Investigators say Rodriguez and another driver, identified as 27-year-old Eury Cerda, exited their vehicles after a verbal exchange. Rodriguez allegedly pulled out a gun and fired, grazing Cerda’s head.

 Cerda was treated at a local hospital and later released. Rodriguez was arrested on charges of attempted second-degree murder.

 During his bond hearing, Rodriguez’s family joined via Zoom, along with a lieutenant from the fire department, to show support. His attorney argued that Rodriguez acted in self-defense after feeling threatened when the other man approached his car.

 Little is publicly known about Cerda, though a Change.org petition circulating online describes him as a “deadbeat dad,” a claim that has not been independently verified.

 For Rodriguez’s family, the viral headlines have painted only part of the story.

 “People see a mugshot,” another family member said, “but not the man who’s been saving lives for 18 years. He’s a great dad who made a split-second decision because he was scared. We just pray people remember that he’s human too.”

 To help the family during this difficult time, Rodriguez’s sister has organized a GoFundMe campaign to assist with household expenses while he is unable to work.

 “Many of you have been reaching out to offer assistance and support for my brother Emilio at this extremely difficult time,” Mariela Porcello wrote. “If you could, please offer your generosity in helping us cover his monthly expenses. It would be a blessing indeed. We ask above all that you continue to pray for his strength and resilience as we navigate this unprecedented challenge.”

 The family expressed their gratitude for the community’s compassion and prayers, emphasizing their hope that the public will remember Rodriguez’s long record of service and dedication to others.
