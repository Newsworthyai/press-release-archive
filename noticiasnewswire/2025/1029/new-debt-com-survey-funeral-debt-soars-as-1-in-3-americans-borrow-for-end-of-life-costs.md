# New Debt.com Survey: Funeral Debt Soars as 1 in 3 Americans Borrow for End-of-Life Costs

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – Oct. 29, 2025 /Noticias Newswire/ — For an increasing number of American families, the emotional toll of losing a loved one is now accompanied by significant financial hardship. Data from the annual Death and Debt survey by Debt.com reveals that the percentage of Americans incurring debt after a death surged from 14% in 2024 to 37% in 2025.

 Credit cards are the most frequent funding method for these final expenses, highlighting the immense financial pressure families face when managing funeral arrangements.

 “Funeral costs have become a new financial crisis,” explains [Howard Dvorkin, CPA and Chairman of Debt.com](https://www.debt.com/author/hdvorkin/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral). “Families want to honor their loved ones, but too often, compassion outweighs affordability — and credit becomes the only way to say a final goodbye.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Howard Dvorkin](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banners-v4-a-mo-150x150.jpg)

 [Howard Dvorkin](https://www.debt.com/author/hdvorkin/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral) [CPA and chairman](https://www.debt.com/author/hdvorkin/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=english&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral) of Debt.com The survey of 1,000 Americans found that among those who borrowed to cover funeral-related expenses:

 * 59% used credit cards
* 38% relied on personal loans
* 22% turned to funeral-specific financing

 The data highlights a troubling financial vulnerability among households as nearly 3 in 5 (57%) say they could not afford a loved one’s funeral costs today, without incurring debt.

 The Financial Repercussions Are Significant and Long-Lasting

 The debt doesn’t end when the service does. The emotional burden of loss is compounded by long-term financial stress. Over one-third (36%) of Americans said they would delay paying other essential bills such as rent, credit cards, or utilities, to cover funeral costs.

 Following the service, 25% reported feeling anxious due to funeral-related debt, 19% struggle to keep up with payments, and 17% had already postponed other bills to manage this debt. The share of Americans taking on larger amounts of debt for funeral expenses continues to climb:

 * Americans taking on less that $1,000: 6% in 2024, 13% in 2025
* Americans taking on $1,000 – $5,000: 6% in 2024, 17% in 2025
* Americans taking on more than $5,000: 2% in 2024, 7% in 2025

 The survey also uncovered insights on how Americans are handling end-of-life finances. Half of all Americans have not discussed how their debt or funeral expenses will be handled, and while still higher than in 2023, the level of knowledge regarding what happens to someone’s debt after they die has decreased. In 2025, 55% of Americans reported knowing, a 6-point drop from 61% in 2024, but still 10 points higher that the 45% recorded in 2023.

 A Generational Look at End-Of-Life Expenses

 Generation X, the generation balancing both children and aging parents, is also carrying the most debt from loss. Gen X is most likely to have taken on debt after a loved one’s death, while baby boomers are the least likely. Gen X most often turned to credit cards to cover funeral expenses, Millennials leaned on personal loans more than other age groups, and Baby Boomers outpaced other generations using funeral loans.
