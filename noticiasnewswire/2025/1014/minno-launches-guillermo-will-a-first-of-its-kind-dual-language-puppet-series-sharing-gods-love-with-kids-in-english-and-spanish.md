 NASHVILLE, TN — October 14, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Minno, the global leader in Christian kids’ media, is proud to announce its newest original series, Guillermo & Will, which debuted on the streaming platform October 10. Guillermo & Will is a groundbreaking, dual-language puppet show designed to help children engage with God’s world in both English and Spanish.

 Created by Emmy-nominated puppeteer Donna Kimball, co-written by Dan Garza, and co-produced with the award-winning Family Theater Productions, Guillermo & Will introduces two lovable puppet friends whose adventures reflect the joy and beauty of cross-cultural friendship. The series combines creative storytelling, a biblical world view, and developmental expertise to help kids see themselves reflected on screen—while learning about God in a personal and relatable way.

 “At Minno, we’re honored to create a platform for world-class creators like Donna and Dan—talented artists who bring heart, humor, and deep meaning to children’s storytelling. Guillermo & Will is a joyful expression of God’s love and friendship across cultures, and it reflects our broader vision to raise the bar in Christian children’s media. We’re especially grateful to partner with Family Theater Productions, whose legacy of redemptive storytelling aligns beautifully with our mission to help kids and families experience Jesus every day,” said Erick Goss, CEO and Co-Founder of Minno.

 With Spanish-language content consistently ranking among the top 10 performers across Minno’s platforms, Guillermo & Will meets a vital need. Millions of families around the world are Spanish-speaking or bilingual, and this series gives children the gift of seeing their language and culture represented in Christian media.

 “For more than 75 years, Family Theater Productions has created media to help families grow in faith. Guillermo & Will carries that legacy forward—offering joyful, faith-filled storytelling for children, with special care for families, including Catholic and Spanish-speaking audiences, who seek content that reflects their culture and values,” says Father David L. Guffey, C.S.C., National Director of Family Theater Productions.

 By designing the show with input from early childhood development specialists and language education experts, Minno ensures Guillermo & Will resonates with early learners—whether they are native English speakers, Spanish speakers, or both.

 Working with top-tier talent such as Kimball—whose career spans Emmy-nominated performances—and Garza, Guillermo & Will reflects Minno’s vision to raise the bar in Christian kids’ content.
