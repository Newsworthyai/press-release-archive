 FDA Approves bioLytical’s INSTI® HIV Self Test

 RICHMOND, BC — October 14, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — HIV testing just became faster, easier, and more accessible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the INSTI® HIV Self Test from bioLytical Laboratories Inc. (bioLytical), making it the first one-minute HIV self-test available in the U.S.

 “HIV testing should be simple, fast, and accessible for everyone,” said Robert Mackie, CEO of bioLytical. “By offering accurate results in just 60 seconds, we are empowering people to take control of their health, without waiting for clinic appointments or lab results.”

 With its discreet and portable design, the INSTI® HIV Self Test allows people to test for HIV anywhere, anytime, privately and on their own terms.

 Why rapid HIV testing matters

 HIV remains a serious public health challenge in the U.S.:

 * An estimated 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV.
* Approximately, 13% of people living with HIV don’t know they have it.
* Most new HIV infections come from individuals who are unaware of their status.
* Over 30,000 new infections occur each year in the U.S.
* Early detection improves treatment outcomes and significantly reduces transmission risk.

 By making HIV self-testing faster, easier, and more accessible, the INSTI® HIV Self Test helps address critical gaps in screening, especially for those who face barriers to traditional healthcare due to stigma, cost, or location.

 “The FDA approval of the INSTI® HIV Self Test reflects both the scientific integrity of our work and our commitment to expanding access to rapid, reliable diagnostics,” said Ana Subramanian, Vice President of Scientific Affairs at bioLytical. “This milestone ensures that more people across the U.S. can confidently access accurate HIV testing when and where they need it most.”
