# ‘Milagros Tour 2025’ Transforms Lives Across The Midwest: Free Immigration Consultations Bring Hope to Families

SEATTLE, WA — October 16, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — After an inspiring multi-city journey, the Milagros Tour has completed its 2025 Midwest edition, leaving a lasting impact on thousands of Latino families. Led by immigration attorney Alexandra Lozano, known as “The Miracle Lawyer,” the tour brought free legal consultations directly to communities in Kansas City, Milwaukee, Detroit, Columbus, and Indianapolis.

 Across five stops, nearly 2,000 families registered, and more than 1,000 received in-person consultations — each representing a new beginning on the path to security and legal status in the United States.

 “These numbers are not just statistics; they are miracles of hope,” said Lozano. “Every consultation means a family was seen and heard. Every case started is a step toward dignity, safety, and a future full of faith.”

 The Milagros Tour was created to break down barriers of distance, fear, and misinformation by meeting families where they are. Each stop offered not only free legal guidance but also a safe space filled with resources, food, and community connections where inspirational stories unfolded.

 One of the many stories that reflect our impact is that of Marina González*. She arrived in the United States at the age of 42, and for two decades lived without legal protection. At 64, after connecting with our team, she regained her faith and is ready to continue pursuing her dreams.

 Community leaders, local organizations, and media joined the effort, witnessing firsthand the faith-driven movement of empowerment and justice that defines the Milagros Tour.

 For families unable to attend in person, the mission continues through Lozano’s nationwide “Oficinas de los Milagros” and free virtual consultations, ensuring help is always within reach.
