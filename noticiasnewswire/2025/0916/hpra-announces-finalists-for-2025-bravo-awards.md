 Methodology

 Campaigns conducted between January 1, 2024 and March 31, 2025 were eligible for consideration. Finalists are selected from submissions ranking in the top 75th percentile of their categories. Each submission was scored on a 1-5 scale across twelve evaluation pillars, including goals and objectives, strategy, resources, budget efficiency, originality/creativity, and outcomes. Agency of the Year finalists are evaluated on business growth, employee/client retention, talent development, and industry-wide engagement.

 Each submission was reviewed by three judges, with Agency of the Year scored collectively by each of the 17 judges in this year’s jury pool. The judging panel represented brand, agency, media, industry, and academia, ensuring that finalists were evaluated with diverse expertise and according to criteria of innovation, impact, and overall excellence.

 ¡BRAVO! Awards Honorees are nominated by the event committee and approved by the national board of directors.
