# Brilla Media Celebrates 3 Years of Innovation with New Logo, Website, and Renewed Commitment to Flagship Platforms Nuestro Stories and Minivela

MIAMI, FL — April 8, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Brilla Media is celebrating its third anniversary today with a new logo and website that showcase the media and entertainment company’s innovations, and flagship content platforms, Nuestro Stories, and Minivela.

 Brilla Media’s new logo and website (www.BrillaMedia.com) put the spotlight on Brilla—a symbol of the light and strength within the Latino community. With vibrant gradients and a sparkling star, the new design reflects the company’s mission to inspire through fresh, dynamic storytelling rooted in culture, creativity, and positivity.

 “Three years ago Brilla launched with Nuestro Stories’ mission to tell the full stories about our heritage, history, and origins, and today we have evolved into a company that is powered by adtech, and is also producing digital shorts for the American Latino market,” said Brilla Media CEO Angela Sustaita-Ruiz.

 Across its vibrant website and social platforms—Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube—Nuestro Stories has amassed a growing portfolio of thousands of stories celebrating Latino heritage from food and fashion to music, landmarks, icons, and culture. The platform’s mission remains clear and evolving: to be the most comprehensive and dynamic digital platform EVER dedicated to Latino heritage, always rooted in storytelling—not politics.

 In March, Brilla Media joined forces with actor Carlos Ponce, and adtech partner Numatec to launch its other boldest, and most creative innovation yet: Minivela.  In the spirit of Brilla, Minivela is not only the first digital shorts platform created for the U.S. Hispanic market but is also developing an approach that will open more production doors for Latino directors, writers, producers, actors, and influencers alike.

 “Nuestro Stories, and Minivela are not only siblings in the same parent company, but also the main drivers of our growth and innovations for years to come,” said Manny Ruiz, who as Brilla Media’s Co-Founder oversees both platforms.  “We’re proud of the adtech and influencer-based solutions we have to serve clients but our storytelling platforms are what make us distinctly Brilla.”

 This year, Brilla Media and Creator Sports Network (CSN) also announced they are joining forces to revolutionize live sports for young audiences with VibraStream, delivering unparalleled access to live sporting events. This partnership leverages Brilla Media’s expertise in Hispanic audience engagement and CSN’s robust social live-streaming technology and sporting content to create a dynamic platform. The timing could not be more perfect as U.S. prepares to host the 2026 World Cup. This exclusive collaboration promises to captivate millions of Hispanic viewers with seamless, interactive sports experiences like never before.
