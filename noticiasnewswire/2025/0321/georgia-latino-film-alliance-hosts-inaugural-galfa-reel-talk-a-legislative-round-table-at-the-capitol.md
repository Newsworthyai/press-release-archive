 ATLANTA, GA — March 21, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Georgia Latino Film Alliance (GALFA) hosted its first-ever GALFA Reel Talk: A Legislative Round Table at the Georgia State Capitol, bringing together over 15 state representatives and more than 70 GALFA members for a powerful discussion on the future of film in Georgia.

 The event featured industry leaders and policy-makers engaging in candid conversations about diversity, financing, tax credits, and the rapid evolution of AI in film. Elizabeth Strickler provided critical insights on AI’s impact, emphasizing the importance of mastering the technology rather than resisting it. Robin Watson and Chiquita Banks led discussions on GALFA initiatives and the expanding roles of Latino and African American creators in the Georgia film industry.

 Financing and tax incentives took center stage as Erik Gordon and Katy Morecraft underscored the necessity for filmmakers to grasp financial strategy early in the production process. Keely Moore delivered an essential update on Georgia’s tax credit system, streamlining access for filmmakers and advocating for Georgia Studios to maintain a strong national presence.

 “This first annual Reel Talk was a resounding success,” said Dr. José Marquez, PhD, CEO of GALFA. “Not only did we foster meaningful discussions, but we also had a strong legislative presence, proving that our voices are being heard at the highest levels.”

 Adding to the celebration, Governor Brian Kemp officially recognized GALFA’s contributions to the film industry and honored José Marquez and Yvette Moise for their unwavering leadership. New GALFA Board Member Catherine Jones reflected, “As a newcomer to Atlanta, it was an honor to stand with fellow Latino filmmakers at the Capitol. It was a monumental day I will never forget.”

 Reflecting on the impact of the event, Yvette Moise, President of GALFA, said: “The energy in the room was electric. To see so many passionate filmmakers, executives, and legislators coming together to discuss the future of Georgia’s film industry was truly inspiring. This is just the beginning of a greater movement to ensure our diverse voices are not just included, but leading the way.”

 The evening concluded with a special honor as actor French Stewart received the GALFA Presidential Ally Award for his dedication to supporting multicultural filmmakers. His latest film, “Bob Treviño Likes It,” premiered at the Tara Theater ahead of its theatrical release on March 28th.

 Lastly, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our incredible sponsors—Vensure HR, Contineo Group, and American Family Insurance—for their unwavering support in making this event possible. Your commitment to our mission is helping open doors for the next generation of filmmakers and industry leaders.

 A day filled with networking, education, advocacy, and fun., GALFA’s Reel Talk reinforced the importance of creating a blueprint for Latino and multicultural filmmakers to thrive in Georgia’s evolving industry. As Dr. Marquez put it, “Together, we are stronger.”
