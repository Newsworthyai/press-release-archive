 NEW YORK, NY — February 27, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Verizon today announced an industry-leading converged offer for Mobile and Home Internet customers, providing savings for myPlan mobility and myHome internet joint customers. Customers who combine their mobile and home services with Verizon can now unlock incredible savings as well as exciting entertainment options and premium customer support in a simplified experience.

 Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmynarayan Sampath shared:  “We built the Verizon model of convergence to meet the changing habits of our customers’ lives and provide them with the most choice in the industry. Customers deserve an amazing network experience at home and on the go, and value on entertainment they cannot get anywhere else. You get more value from Verizon across our full portfolio of products and services versus anyone else in the industry.”

 Combining Verizon’s Mobile and Home Internet services gives customers $15 off home internet every month, ways to save on entertainment they love and priority customer treatment.

 Here’s how it works:

 * Simplicity and Savings: Customers with Verizon Home Internet will be eligible for a $15/mo discount when combined with any postpaid mobile phone plan. That means access to Verizon Home Internet for as low as $35/mo2. This discount can be combined with the discounts Verizon offers to Military, First Responders, Students, and Teachers to save even more, and Verizon doesn’t reduce the device offers available to these segments like some other carriers do.
* The best of entertainment, on us: Verizon mobile customers who add a premium home internet plan3 are eligible for a perk credit on us – up to $10/mo toward great entertainment options like Netflix & Max (With Ads). That’s up to $215/year3 in savings when you are a mobile and home customer with Verizon!
