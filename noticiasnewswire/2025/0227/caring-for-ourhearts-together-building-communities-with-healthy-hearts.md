# Caring For #OurHearts Together: Building Communities With Healthy Hearts

WASHINGTON, DC — February 27, 2025 — (NEWS WIRE) — While heart disease is largely preventable, it remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease affects millions of people, and its impact is not equal across all communities.

Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native communities show higher rates of both heart disease and risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and smoking. Research supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has shown that you can reduce your individual risk of heart disease by taking preventive steps: staying physically active, following a healthy diet, managing stress, not smoking, getting enough sleep, and controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. All of this can improve your heart health, but the impact may be even greater if you team up with friends and family to lead healthier lives together.

Studies have shown that having positive and close relationships and feeling connected to others benefits your blood pressure, weight, and overall health, among other things. The The Heart Truth® program from the NHLBI suggests some ways you can connect with friends, neighbors, and coworkers to promote heart health in your own community:

1. Organize an online support group to motivate each other as you work toward your health goals.
2. Create a virtual bulletin board where your community can post motivational messages and share heart-healthy recipes, along with other tips.
3. Coordinate community walks to stay active together.
4. Ask a healthcare provider in your area, a community health worker, or a health educator to organize educational sessions on heart health or to check blood pressure.

Connecting with others in the places where you live, work, and enjoy your leisure time can help foster heart-healthy lifestyles and build healthier communities. Learn more about heart health and find resources to share in your community at www.hearttruth.gov (in English).
