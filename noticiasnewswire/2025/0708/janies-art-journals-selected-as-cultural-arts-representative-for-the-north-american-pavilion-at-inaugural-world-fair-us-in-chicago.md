 CHICAGO, IL — July 8, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Following a successful 2024 arts and crafts season in southeastern Wisconsin and being awarded the prestigious Craft Industry Alliance Scholarship, Janie’s Art Journals has cemented its place in the Chicago arts scene with an exciting new honor: selection as the Cultural Arts Desk Representative of the North American Pavilion at the inaugural World Fair US in Chicago.

 Running from July 7 through July 28, the World Fair US is one of the most anticipated events of the summer — a destination festival for families and cultural enthusiasts alike, featuring an extraordinary showcase of music, rides, cuisine, and artistic traditions from around the world. The SeatGeek Stadium has been transformed into a global playground.

 In 2025, Janie’s Art Journals continues its mission of exploring sustainability through art, creating fresh, fun, and meaningful works designed to inspire self-discovery, healing, and connection. Each piece combines discarded books, reclaimed papers, vintage textiles, and other materials destined for landfills — demonstrating how upcycling and repurposing can transform waste into beauty and purpose.

 “As an emerging artpreneur, securing the resources to fund equipment, technology, and steep entry fees remains a challenge,” said founder Janie Flores. “I’m deeply grateful to the arts and crafts markets and festivals that give emerging artists opportunities to reach new audiences, supporters, and patrons. Being selected for the World Fair US is a dream come true.”

 Tickets to the World Fair US are available at worldfairus.com, with special promotions for seniors and families. Venue hours are from 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm daily at SeatGeek Stadium, 7000 S. Harlem Avenue, Bridgeview, IL 60455.
