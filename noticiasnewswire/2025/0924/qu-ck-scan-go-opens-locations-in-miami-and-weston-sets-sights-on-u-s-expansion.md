# QU!CK Scan&amp;GO Opens Locations in Miami and Weston, Sets Sights on U.S. Expansion

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL — September 24, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — With a concept that is reshaping customer service, QU!CK Scan&GO, the company led by Argentine entrepreneur Marcos Acuña, has strengthened its presence in South Florida with the opening of new locations in both Miami and the city of Weston.

 Already operating more than 50 sites worldwide, the company stands out for its innovative model of fast, automated service, where technology takes over routine tasks to deliver an experience without waiting lines or intermediaries. “Our goal is to transform the way people interact with services: faster, more efficient, and with no delays,” explained Acuña.

 Miami was the first stop on the company’s U.S. journey, chosen for its energy and multicultural spirit. The expansion to Weston reflects a strategy focused on fast-growing communities with strong development and international profiles. “Weston is a strategic point: it allows us to connect with a diverse public that values innovation and practicality in everyday life,” said the CEO.

 Acuña arrived in Florida with his wife Noelia and their three daughters, turning this challenge into both a business and family project. “This is not just about business: we are building a future in a place we already feel at home,” he shared.

 Looking ahead, the company plans to continue its expansion across the United States, capitalizing on a market that increasingly demands immediacy and tech-driven solutions. “This is just the beginning. Miami and Weston are the foundation of a larger plan that will take us to new cities nationwide,” Acuña concluded.
