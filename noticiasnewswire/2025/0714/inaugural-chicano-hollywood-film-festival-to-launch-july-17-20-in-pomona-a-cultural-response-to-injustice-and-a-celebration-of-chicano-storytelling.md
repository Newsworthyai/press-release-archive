# Inaugural Chicano Hollywood Film Festival to Launch July 17–20 in Pomona — A Cultural Response to Injustice and a Celebration of Chicano Storytelling

POMONA, CA — July 14, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Chicano Hollywood Film Festival will make its powerful debut July 17–20, 2025, at The Union (350 Garey Ave, Pomona, CA). Launching at a time when ICE raids are targeting undocumented farm laborers across Southern California, the festival positions itself as both a cultural celebration and a platform for protest—amplifying the stories, struggles, and strength of the Chicano and Latino communities.

 The festival opens with “The Last Brown Beret”, a gripping and timely feature directed by Del Zamora, based on the book by Alfredo Ramos. The film revives the legacy of the Brown Berets, Civil Rights activists whose fight for justice in the 1960s echoes today’s urgent need for protection, dignity, and unity within the Chicano community amid fear of raids, riots, and mass arrests.

 “This festival isn’t just about watching films—it’s about answering the call,” said Johnny Murillo, founder of Chicano Hollywood. “The Brown Berets stood up for our people. It’s time to do the same—with cameras, stories, and truth.”

 In addition to spotlighting powerful features, the Chicano Hollywood Film Festival will showcase over 90 short films, television pilots, music videos, and digital projects from emerging Chicano/Latino filmmakers across the U.S. and Latin America. The diverse lineup highlights stories of identity, resistance, humor, and healing.

 Featured films include:

 “Ugly Little Monkey” – A powerful documentary produced by Chicano legend Enrique Castillo (Montana in American Me), exploring the journey from trauma to healing.

 “Horchata With Oat Milk” – A viral, culture-clash comedy directed by Christian “LV” Leyva, addressing the issue of gentrification and offering fresh laughs with a Chicano twist.

 “A Little Family Drama” – A layered and emotional dramedy directed by Nadia Zoe that brings generational conflict to light.

 “Cholita Takes LA” – Directed by Sylvia Ray, a bold exploration of female empowerment within Chicana culture and a Bolivian Cholita Wrestler seeking identity.

 “Lost in the Barrio” – Directed by Alberto Portillo, a gritty, heartfelt story of survival and loyalty in the urban neighborhood. Starring Fabian Alamar (Flamin’ Hot).

 Festivalgoers can also expect live “DJ” sets, Q&A panels, networking events, and the launch of the Chicano Hollywood Academy, an initiative to train the next generation of Latino creatives in acting, directing, production, and content monetization.

 “This is the first of many,” said Festival Director, Francisco Roel. “We’re building a movement where Chicanos and Latinos own their stories, their space, and their future in entertainment.”
