# Ejecutiva Viajes: Your New Ally in Corporate Travel

MIAMI, FL — July 14, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Do you want your next trip to be the trip of your dreams? I’m Karen Blanco, with more than 14 years of experience in media and 6 years in education. Traveling has always been one of the greatest passions of my life. I started very young: first with friends, then alone, then with my son, later with my partner—who is now my husband—and with my family.

 I’m very excited to introduce you to Ejecutiva Viajes, the new travel platform from Ejecutiva Magazine, supported by Cruises and Tours Unlimited, an agency with more than 25 years of experience, creating unforgettable experiences.

 Although I’m new to this profession, I’ve been traveling and exploring the world for many years. I’ve had the opportunity to visit more than 25 countries, which has allowed me to understand different cultures, travel styles, and ways of exploring each destination.

 This personal experience allows me to help you from a real, practical perspective, with a passion for detail.

 Traveling has transformed my life, and now I want to help you plan your own adventures in a safe, personalized, and easy way.
