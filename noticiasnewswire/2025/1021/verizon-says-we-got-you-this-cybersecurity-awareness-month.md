# Verizon says ‘We Got You’ This Cybersecurity Awareness Month

NEW YORK, NY — October 21, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Verizon is giving you a greater sense of protection at home and on the go with the introduction of the new Digital Secure Home service, along with a major refresh of the Verizon Protect app.

 “Our customers trust us to connect them to the things and people they love the most, and securing that connection sits at the heart of our promise,” said Che Phillip, Senior Vice President of Consumer Device Marketing at Verizon. “This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re not just talking about security; we’re delivering it directly into our customers’ hands, because everyone gets more with Verizon — more security, more peace of mind and unparalleled support.”

 Elevating your home network security with Digital Secure Home The sheer number of connected devices in the modern home means your Wi-Fi network is a primary target for digital threats. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that exploitation of vulnerabilities as an initial access vector for breaches grew by 34% from last year, making the need for digital security more important than ever.

 Managed through the Verizon Home app, Digital Secure Home and Digital Secure Home Plus protect devices connected to a home network from online threats and vulnerabilities. The entry tier, available at no additional cost with Fios Home Internet service, provides Vulnerability Assessments and Malicious Website Protection. Digital Secure Home Plus, at just $5.99/mo, adds advanced services that defend against botnet and brute force attacks, detect abnormal device behavior, and safeguard sensitive data on router-connected devices from cyber hazards.

 Verizon Protect: for an added layer of protection  For an added layer of protection, Verizon Protect, a comprehensive app designed to enhance mobile security and privacy protection, has also undergone a major refresh, to provide customers with more insight into their online safety. Alongside essential tools like Digital Secure and Identity Secure, the app’s new features include:

 * Security Rating: A dynamic score that shows you how secure your personal data is, providing personalized insights to improve your rating.
* Security Categories: See how you measure up across four key areas: Identity, Device, Network and Online — and take recommended actions to strengthen your security.
