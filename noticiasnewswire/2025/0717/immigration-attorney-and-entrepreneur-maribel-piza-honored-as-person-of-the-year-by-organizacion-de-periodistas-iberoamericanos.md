# Immigration Attorney and Entrepreneur Maribel Piza Honored as ‘Person of the Year’ by Organización de Periodistas Iberoamericanos

MIAMI, FL — July 17, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — On Saturday, July 12, 2025, the Organización de Periodistas Iberoamericanos (OPI) awarded Maribel Piza the prestigious title of “Personalidad del Año” (Person of the Year) during a commemorative ceremony held at Florida International University’s Graham Center. This distinguished recognition honors her remarkable work as an immigration attorney, media entrepreneur, and tireless advocate for immigrant rights.

 Ms. Piza, who has served the South Florida immigrant community since 2006, was recognized for her dual contributions to both the legal and media landscapes. As the founder and principal attorney of her immigration law practice with offices in Ft. Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, she has helped thousands of immigrant families find legal pathways to stability and safety.

 Beyond her legal work, Ms. Piza is also a senior investor and majority shareholder of Noticias Newswire, a Hispanic press release distribution platform that is principally female owned. Through this entrepreneurial endeavor, she has empowered countless Latino voices, businesses, and organizations to amplify their reach in both English- and Spanish-speaking media markets.

 In her acceptance speech, Ms. Piza highlighted her commitment to justice and information equity: “This award is not only a personal honor but a tribute to every immigrant family whose story I’ve had the privilege to tell, defend, or empower. Whether in the courtroom, in print, or over the airwaves, I will continue to use every tool available to uplift our community.”

 A respected thought leader, Ms. Piza authors a monthly op-ed column distributed through Noticias Newswire and is a frequent guest on local and international television and radio broadcasts in both English and Spanish. Since 2008, she has hosted her own Spanish-language radio show, “Encontrando una Luz en su Caso,” broadcast weekly on El Universo 1420 AM, where she educates the public about immigration policy changes, legal rights, and community resources.

 Her leadership extends into service organizations as well—she is an active member of the Rotary Club of Fort Lauderdale/Cypress Creek, embodying the Rotary motto of “Service Above Self.”

 The OPI’s “Personalidad del Año” award celebrates individuals who demonstrate extraordinary commitment to their community and who serve as influential voices in Latin American and Hispanic public life. Ms. Piza’s unique combination of legal excellence, media advocacy, and business leadership exemplifies that mission.
