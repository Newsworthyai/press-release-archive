# Manny Ruiz Named CEO of Minivela as Platform Scales for Leadership of U.S. Hispanic and Latin American Vertical Shorts Markets

MIAMI, FL — November 5, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Minivela, the first bilingual vertical shorts platform serving the U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets, today announced that Brilla Media co-founder and former Hispanicize CEO Manny Ruiz has been appointed Chief Executive Officer.

 Ruiz, who most recently served as Minivela’s Chief Content Officer, will now lead the company’s strategic growth as it scales to become the leading producer of vertical shorts for U.S. Hispanic and Latin American audiences.

 Ruiz’s appointment comes at a pivotal point of expansion for Minivela, following its recent partnership with Nueva Network, which has strengthened the company’s distribution capabilities, sales operations, and advertiser reach across key Latin markets. Under Ruiz’s leadership, Minivela is developing an ambitious slate of original short dramas designed to reflect the bilingual, bicultural experiences of modern Latino audiences in the U.S. and abroad.

 “Our recent partnership with Nueva Network, and evolving distribution and content slate, require Manny’s innovative leadership, and focus,” said Angela Sustaita-Ruiz, CEO of Brilla Media, Minivela’s parent company. Prior to Brilla, Manny’s 25-year career included founding, leading, and later selling Hispanic PR Wire and Hispanicize.

 “This second stage of Minivela is all about scaling and building partnerships across producers—and even competitors—who need the content, production, and/or adtech capabilities we’re developing for ourselves and others,” said Ruiz. “This is the first company I’ve built that is made to work with everybody, and that’s both fascinating and liberating for Minivela. We’re going to impact a lot of creative careers, brands, and businesses.”

 Since its founding, Minivela has distinguished itself through its unique vertical drama formats, combining the emotional storytelling of telenovelas with the viral engagement of short-form digital media. Through its own ecosystem—and through collaborations with other platforms—Minivela’s vertical shorts blend entertainment with social connection, resonating deeply with young, multicultural viewers.
