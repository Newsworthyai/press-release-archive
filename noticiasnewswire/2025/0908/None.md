# Get Smart About Your Heart

MISSION, KS — September 8, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — A crucial component of overall well-being, heart health can be a barometer for living a long, healthy and happy life. Because heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taking steps to reduce your controllable risk factors – including poor diet, stress and inactivity – can set you on the right path.

 From regular checkups and reducing stress to eating well – including heart-healthy snacks like grapes – and exercising regularly, these simple steps can help boost your heart health.

 Know Your Numbers

 Knowing key health metrics such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels and body mass index can help you and your health care provider identify potential risks early. Schedule annual checkups and discuss any concerns you may have about your heart health. Early detection and risk factor management can reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease.

 Eat More Fruits and Vegetables

 Incorporating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables into your diet can ensure you get a broad range of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, all of which contribute to a healthy cardiovascular system. For example, leafy greens like spinach and kale are high in potassium, which helps manage blood pressure. Fresh grapes contain 7% of the daily recommended intake of potassium, are a good source of vitamin K and are also a natural source of beneficial antioxidants and other polyphenols, including flavonoids, that can help relax blood vessels and promote healthy circulation. Some studies also suggest grapes have a beneficial impact on blood lipids and more.

 In fact, one study found women who consumed 1 1/4 cups of grapes every day benefited from reduced blood triglyceride levels, LDL cholesterol levels, inflammatory proteins and other markers of heart disease.

 Bright, juicy and bursting with flavor, Grapes from California can be enjoyed by the handful or blended with rich bananas, tangy Greek yogurt and a hint of almond in The Great Grape-Acai Smoothie Bowl for a delicious blend of fruity flavors at breakfast, lunch or snack time – it not only tastes great, but supports a healthy heart.

 Get Moving

 Regular physical activity is one of the most effective ways to improve heart health. Exercise strengthens the heart muscle, improves blood circulation and helps maintain a healthy weight. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, as recommended by the American Heart Association, such as walking, jogging or swimming with strength training exercises like lifting weights or using resistance bands mixed in to help reduce the risk of heart disease and improve overall cardiovascular health.

 Manage Stress

 Consider your stress level: chronic stress can negatively impact heart health, increasing blood pressure and other risk factors for heart disease. Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga and regular physical activity can help manage stress levels and maintain a healthy heart. Additionally, taking time to engage in hobbies, spending time with loved ones and ensuring adequate sleep are stress-reducing activities that improve overall well-being and heart health.
