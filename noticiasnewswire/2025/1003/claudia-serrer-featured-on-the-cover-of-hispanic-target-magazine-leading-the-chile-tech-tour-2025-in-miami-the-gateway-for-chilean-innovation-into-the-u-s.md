# Claudia Serrer Featured on The Cover of Hispanic Target Magazine: Leading The Chile Tech Tour 2025 in Miami, The Gateway for Chilean Innovation Into The U.S.

MIAMI, FL — October 3, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) —  Hispanic Target Magazine  spotlights Claudia Serrer, Trade Commissioner of ProChile in Miami , on its latest cover, recognizing her leadership in driving the Chile Tech Tour 2025 , which will take place in Miami from October 6 to 10 .

 The initiative brings together 17 Chilean startups , the largest delegation from Latin America this year, to showcase solutions in FinTech, HealthTech, and EdTech . The program will feature business roundtables, meetings with investors, accelerators, and visits to tech incubators, creating bridges between Chilean innovation and Miami’s thriving tech ecosystem.

 “Miami has become a natural meeting point for Latin talent, offering not only geographic proximity but also a multicultural environment that facilitates the integration of our startups,” highlighted Claudia Serrer , underscoring the city’s strategic role.

 Participation has grown steadily over the years: “We started with a prospecting visit, then five companies participated, and this year we reached 17. This confirms that Miami is the strategic entry and development point for Chilean entrepreneurship and innovation,” added Serrer.

 While other hubs like New York, San Francisco, and Austin are also important, Serrer emphasizes Miami’s role as the ideal starting point: “Each state has its own characteristics. Miami is perfect to begin with, as it connects with Latin America and Europe while offering an open and expanding ecosystem. From here, many companies can later scale into more specialized markets such as California or Texas.”

 For entrepreneurs still hesitant about entering the U.S. market, Serrer sends a clear message: “The invitation is to leverage all the networks and tools available in Miami. The U.S. is a competitive but opportunity-rich market. What matters most is exploring responsibly and daring to take the first step.”

 With this new edition of the Chile Tech Tour , Chile reinforces its commitment to innovation and internationalization , while Claudia Serrer emerges as a key figure connecting Santiago and Miami and positioning Chilean startups on the global stage.
