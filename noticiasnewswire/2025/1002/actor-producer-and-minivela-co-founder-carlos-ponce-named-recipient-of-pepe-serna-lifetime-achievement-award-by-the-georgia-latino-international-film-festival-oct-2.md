# Actor, Producer, and Minivela Co-Founder Carlos Ponce Named Recipient of Pepe Serna Lifetime Achievement Award by The Georgia Latino International Film Festival, Oct. 2

ATLANTA, GA — October 1, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Award-winning actor, producer, music artist, entrepreneur, and Minivela co-founder Carlos Ponce will be honored with the Pepe Serna Lifetime Achievement Award at the Georgia Latino International Film Festival (GALIFF) on October 2, 2025, during the Opening Night Gala at the Fox Theatre.

 The award recognizes Ponce’s groundbreaking contributions to film, television, and music, his philanthropic impact, and his latest entrepreneurial venture, Minivela — the first U.S. Hispanic micro-shorts platform that is redefining Latino storytelling for the digital age.

 “Carlos embodies the pioneering spirit that this award celebrates,” said Jose Marquez, CEO of the Georgia Latino Film Alliance. “Like Pepe Serna, he has opened doors for generations of Latino artists while remaining deeply committed to his community. With Minivela, he is not only extending his legacy but also empowering a new generation of Latino filmmakers to tell authentic stories in innovative ways.”

 A Legacy of Entertainment Excellence

 With a career spanning more than three decades, Ponce is one of the most beloved Latino entertainers in the world. He began in the early 1990s as host of the Spanish-language variety show Control and went on to star in telenovelas, Hollywood films, and hit series including Santa Diabla, Couples Retreat, 7th Heaven, and Beverly Hills, 90210. He has also made his mark as a voice actor in animated favorites like Rio and Ice Age: Collision Course.

 As a music artist, his 1998 debut album went Double Platinum, topping the Latin Billboard charts. Over the years, Ponce has released six albums, won Best Pop Album in 1999, and recorded multiple chart-topping singles, including Disney’s “Bella Notte” for Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure.

 Philanthropy and Community Impact

 Beyond entertainment, Ponce is a dedicated philanthropist, supporting initiatives in education, children’s health, and cultural development. His unwavering commitment to using his platform for good has established him as both a role model and humanitarian.

 Minivela at the Georgia Latino Film Festival

 Ponce’s newest venture, Minivela, is a groundbreaking platform for Latino micro-shorts. To showcase its impact, the festival will screen two of his latest Minivela productions:

 * El Clavito – a prestige micro short making waves across the festival circuit.
* Cholita Takes L.A. – a breakout cultural comedy-drama blending indigenous heritage and modern urban flair.

 These screenings highlight Minivela’s mission to amplify Latino voices in film while building an ecosystem for emerging creators.

 Honoring a Trailblazer
