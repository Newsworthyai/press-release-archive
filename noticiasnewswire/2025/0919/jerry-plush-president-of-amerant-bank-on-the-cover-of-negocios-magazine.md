# Jerry Plush, President of Amerant Bank, on The Cover of Negocios Magazine

MIAMI, FL — September 19, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Negocios magazine launched its new edition with a cover story featuring Jerry Plush, President of Amerant Bank. Plush has strengthened the bank’s connection with customers in Florida and Latin America, strengthened its international expansion strategies, and has played a key role in sports partnerships in brand development and generating business opportunities.

 Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Miami, Amerant Bank has established itself as a leading community bank in South Florida. Over more than four decades, it has built a solid reputation based on a customer-centric approach and its strong commitment to local communities. Unlike large banks, Amerant stands out for offering more personalized and accessible service, geared toward meeting the specific needs of each customer.

 One of Amerant Bank’s most notable pillars is its close relationship with the Latino community. This connection is no coincidence: the bank has its origins in Latin America, allowing it to deeply understand the cultural, social, and economic needs of this population. Today, 83% of its workforce is comprised of Latino employees, further reinforcing its inclusive approach and its ability to provide contextually sensitive service to its customers.

 Amerant Bank’s commitment to the community extends beyond the financial sphere; it is also strongly expressed in the world of sports and entertainment. As the official bank of iconic teams such as the Miami Heat, the Florida Panthers, the Tampa Bay Rays, the Miami Marlins, and Fort Lauderdale United FC, Amerant has found a powerful platform to connect emotionally with its customers, especially the Latino community in South Florida.

 “To attract international customers, especially those in Latin America, Amerant has implemented a multifaceted approach. First, we are expanding our presence in key new markets, such as Argentina and Guatemala, which offer strong growth potential. Second, we are focused on strengthening our presence in Central and South America, targeting high-net-worth individuals seeking personalized banking solutions,” highlighted Jerry Plush.
