# Puerto Rico’s Day at The Ballpark Wraps 2025 Season

PUERTO RICO — October 6, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — 21 Events, in collaboration with Discover Puerto Rico, proudly concluded the 2025 edition of Puerto Rico’s Day at the Ballpark, a series of cultural celebrations at select professional baseball stadiums honoring Puerto Rico’s 127-year baseball legacy and its legendary players.

 Since debuting in 2023, the series has grown into a marquee cultural activation, showcasing Puerto Rico’s rich heritage through baseball, music, art, and community. This year’s events, held between July 22 and September 6, took place at Citi Field (New York Mets), Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia Phillies), Truist Park (Atlanta Braves), Rate Field (Chicago White Sox), and PNC Park (Pittsburgh Pirates).

 Celebrating Puerto Rican players and culture

 Honorees for the 2025 season included Edwin Díaz, Francisco Lindor, Carlos Baerga, JC Romero, Joe Jiménez, Félix Millán, José Valentín, and John Candelaria, each recognized in on-field tributes. In Pittsburgh, actor Luis Guzmán delivered a memorable ceremonial first pitch before John Candelaria was honored on-field.

 At every stop, fans experienced in-stadium activations that brought Puerto Rican culture to life. These included scoreboard videos, stadium-wide takeovers, Puerto Rican music, announcer tributes, interactive kiosks with giveaways, and internal stadium TV spots. Guests received giveaways like commemorative shirts, and curated activations designed to immerse fans in Puerto Rico’s vibrancy.

 Adding an artistic dimension to the celebrations, each honored player received an official framed print of “Ritmo y Sazón,” an adaptation of a mural by acclaimed Puerto Rican artist Juan Salgado, originally commissioned by Discover Puerto Rico for the Wynwood Mural Festival at Art Basel. The artwork reflects the island’s spirit; its rhythm, joy, natural beauty, and cultural pride; featuring iconic elements like the coquí’s song and the Maga flower.
