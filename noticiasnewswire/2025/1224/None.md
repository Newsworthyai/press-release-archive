# Dr. Anna Chacón on The cover of Welcome to America Magazine

MIAMI, FL — December 24, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The new edition of Welcome to America magazine has on the cover an interview and exclusive article with Dr. Anna Chacón, founder of Miami Derm. The story of Dr. Anna Chacón is that of an early vocation that, over the years, transformed into a medical career of high national impact.

 Born and raised in Miami, Florida, she grew up in an environment where medicine was not just a profession, but an ethical commitment to caring for others.

 Dr. Chacón is also a prolific author within the dermatological field. He has more than a dozen peer-reviewed articles and book chapters published in highly prestigious scientific journals, including Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), Archives of Dermatology, British Journal of Dermatology, Cosmetic Dermatology and Cutis.

 Dr. Anna Chacón is one of the few board-certified dermatologists licensed to practice in all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. This achievement not only reflects an exceptional commitment to her profession, but also a strategic vision aimed at democratizing access to dermatological care.

 Beyond her clinical role, Dr. Chacón has established herself as a prominent businesswoman and executive within the health sector. Her ability to integrate medical, technological and business knowledge positions her as a reference for female leadership in contemporary medicine.

 In addition to her professional achievements, her story offers a clear message to new generations of doctors and health professionals: it is possible to practice with excellence without giving up innovation, expand the scope of medicine without losing human focus, and build a career with purpose, social commitment, and a vision of the future.
