# Dr. Anna Chacón of Miami Derm on The Cover of Negocios Magazine

MIAMI, FL — July 28, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Negocios magazine launched its new edition featuring the cover of Dr. Anna Chacón. She is not only a nationally recognized and board-certified dermatologist, but also a visionary entrepreneur who has combined her passion for medicine with a keen business sense.

 One of Dr. Chacón’s most notable achievements is her active medical license in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. This national coverage allows her to offer her services to patients across the country through a highly efficient telemedicine model. More than 50% of her consultations are conducted online, many of them with same-day care, through a concierge-style service system that has revolutionized the way people access dermatological treatments.

 Beyond her medical credentials, Dr. Anna Chacón has become a symbol of female leadership. As the founder and director of her own clinic, she combines her deep medical knowledge with a clear and effective business vision. She has managed to position herself in an environment as competitive as Miami, creating a solid brand based on quality service, technological innovation, and a deep human approach.

 Dr. Anna Chacón is, at her core, a doctor who fuses vocation, technology, and closeness. Her goal is clear: to ensure that no one must wait months or travel long distances to receive expert and empathetic dermatological care. From Miami to the entire country, she continues to expand her reach with the same passion that led her to become a doctor from day one.

 “To maintain healthy skin daily, I recommend a skincare routine that includes gentle cleansing, proper hydration, and daily sun protection. It is also important to drink enough water, eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, and avoid excessive tobacco and alcohol,” Dr. Anna Chacón emphasized in an interview with Negocios Magazine.
