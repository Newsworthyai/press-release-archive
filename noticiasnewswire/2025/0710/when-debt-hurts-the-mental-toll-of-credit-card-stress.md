# When Debt Hurts: The Mental Toll of Credit Card Stress

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – July 10, 2025 – Although inflation has dropped significantly in recent years (from 6.5% in 2022 to 2.3% today), the emotional toll of financial stress has not followed the same downward trend. Debt.com’s latest annual survey on mental health and money reveals a troubling increase in negative emotions and behaviors related to debt between 2022 and 2025.

 The primary driver appears to be credit card debt. In 2020, just over 10% of respondents admitted to avoiding social outings with friends or family because of their debt. Today, that figure has climbed to over 23%.

 The emotional impact extends to dating as well. In 2022, only 5% said they avoided going on dates because of their credit card debt. Now, more than 13% do—highlighting how financial burdens are increasingly affecting Americans’ personal and emotional lives.

 “Inflation might have dropped, but the damage is done,” said [Howard Dvorkin](https://www.debt.com/author/hdvorkin/?pid=102918&aff_id=1242&s2=spanish&s3=content&s4=HMAReferral), chairman of Debt.com. “Credit cards are the most widespread form of debt, which means they leave the deepest scars. You can’t always see them, but they can linger for years and affect millions of Americans.”![Personal Finance Expert, Consumer Advocate – Howard Dvorkin](https://www.noticiasnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banners-v4-a-mo-150x150.jpg)
