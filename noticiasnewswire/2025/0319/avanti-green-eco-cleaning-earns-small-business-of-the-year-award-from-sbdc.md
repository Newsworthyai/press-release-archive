 LAS VEGAS, NV — March 18, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Avanti Green Eco Cleaning has earned the Small Business of the Year award from the Nevada Small Business Development Center (SBDC) for the company’s tremendous growth and success as an eco-cleaning leader in the Silver State. The award will be presented to Avanti Green on SBDC Day, March 19, at the AAPI Chamber office, 6675 South Tenaya Way, Suite 200, in Las Vegas, 5:30-7:30 p.m.

 “I’m humbled and honored to accept this award from the SBDC,” Avanti Green CEO and Founder Claudia Meneses said. “Fourteen years ago, I felt the home and commercial cleaning industry was falling short by not using environmentally-safe solutions for clients. I wanted to change that, and this purpose, along with the SBDC’s support, has helped me to build a company that now employs almost 50 people.”

 Since 2011, Avanti Green Eco Cleaning has become a major player in the state’s cleaning industry. By recently launching an expansion of services, which added carpet cleaning, floor cleaning, window cleaning, pressure washing and event porter services to its comprehensive portfolio of eco-friendly services, it is now a one-stop-shop for clients. The company is fully insured and proudly protects its employees under workers’ compensation laws.

 The eco-cleaning leader also benefitted from SBDC guidance over the years. Meneses and her team tapped SBDC experts for help with marketing and lead generation as well as finance and accounting mentorship.

 Avanti Green is also committed to bettering the Las Vegas community. Last year, it launched the Eco Kids Club, a partnership with the Clark County School District. With Eco Kids Club, Avanti Green team members provide free 30-minute workshops for K-2 classes covering water and energy conservation, recycling and reuse, and other sustainability topics.
