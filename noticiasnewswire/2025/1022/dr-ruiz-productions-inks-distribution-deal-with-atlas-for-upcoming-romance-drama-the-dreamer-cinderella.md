 LOS ANGELES, CA — October 23, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — Dr. Ruiz Productions proudly announces its partnership with Atlas Distribution Company to bring the highly anticipated romance drama The Dreamer Cinderella to theaters nationwide on January 23, 2026.

 The deal marks a major milestone for Dr. Ruiz Productions as it releases its first feature film, expanding its footprint in theatrical distribution with a heartfelt story that celebrates perseverance, identity, and the power of dreams.

 “The Dreamer Cinderella is a beautifully crafted and deeply uplifting film that captures the wonder, courage, and faith that inspire audiences of all ages. It’s rare to see a story that blends timeless fairytale magic with such emotional truth and authenticity. Atlas is proud to bring this extraordinary film to theaters and into the hearts of moviegoers everywhere,” said Harmon Kaslow, President, Atlas Distribution Company

 About the Film

 This Cinderella story blends the emotional resonance of Under the Same Moon with the transformational charm of My Fair Lady. At its center is Xochitl, a Mexican-American street fruit vendor whose life takes an unexpected turn when Andrew Goldblum, a powerful film director, makes her the subject of a daring bet with his career rival.

 Xochitl is thrust into a world far removed from her own—one she perceives as hostile. What begins as a challenge quickly becomes a clash of cultures, paving the way for new friendships, surprising rivalries, and life-altering consequences.

 A feel-good, Cinderella story for the whole family, the film explores the untold stories of hardworking street vendors who are too often overlooked, with the added topics of cultural bias, self esteem, immigration, DACA, and the pain of families separated.

 Director’s Statement

 “We are beyond thrilled to partner with Atlas Distribution Company to bring The Dreamer Cinderella to theaters,” said Dr. Jose-Luis Ruiz, Director, Writer, and Executive Producer of the film. “This story is a love letter to the immigrant experience, specifically to the dreamers, workers, and families whose resilience and courage often go unseen. Our goal has always been to create films that reflect real lives and inspire hope, and we can’t wait for audiences to see themselves in this story.”
