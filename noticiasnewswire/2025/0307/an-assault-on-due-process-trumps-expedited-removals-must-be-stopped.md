# An Assault on Due Process: Trump’s Expedited Removals Must Be Stopped

MIAMI, FL — March 6, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — As an immigration attorney in South Florida with over 18 years of experience helping immigrants obtain legal status, I have dedicated my career to championing the rights of those seeking a better future in the United States. The latest attempt by the Trump administration to expand the use of expedited removals is not only a direct attack on immigrant communities but also a dangerous erosion of our constitutional rights.

 The policy at hand would allow immigration authorities to bypass the legal system and deport individuals who have been in the country for less than two years, without granting them the right to a fair hearing. This is particularly alarming for migrants on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and those admitted under humanitarian parole—individuals who are legally present in the United States but now face unjust deportation without due process.

 The TPS program, which has provided a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of migrants, is already under threat. Extensions for Haitian and Venezuelan TPS holders have been revoked, leaving countless individuals vulnerable to removal. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has empowered immigration authorities to arrest and deport migrants who were admitted under humanitarian parole. Many of these individuals have been in the country for less than two years, making them prime targets for expedited removal. This policy creates a cruel reality: individuals who sought legal refuge in the U.S. under established humanitarian protections can now be swiftly deported with no chance to present their case.

 Beyond the immediate consequences for TPS holders and humanitarian parole recipients, Trump’s expedited removals also violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. By prioritizing the deportation of individuals based on their immigration status and length of stay, ICE will inevitably resort to racial profiling. Migrants—and even U.S. citizens—will be at increased risk of being stopped and questioned for proof of status simply because they appear to be foreign-born. This is not just an attack on immigrants; it is an attack on civil rights and the fundamental values of fairness and equality under the law.

 Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement weaponizes expedited removals as a tool to sidestep due process and disproportionately target vulnerable communities. This is a reckless and unconstitutional policy that must be stopped before it inflicts irreparable harm on countless families and individuals. We must stand firm in our commitment to justice and oppose any measure that seeks to dismantle the legal protections guaranteed by our Constitution.

 The time to act is now. We must push back against these unlawful removals and ensure that every individual, regardless of their immigration status, is afforded their fundamental right to due process. The integrity of our legal system—and the very principles of justice—depend on it.
