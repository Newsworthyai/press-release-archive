# Civil Rights Icon Dolores Huerta to Receive 2025 HPRA President’s Award

CHICAGO, IL — October 15, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) proudly announces that civil rights icon Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers and Founder and President of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, will receive the 2025 President’s Award at the HPRA ¡BRAVO! Awards Gala. The event will take place on Thursday, November 13, 2025, at The Drake Hotel in Chicago, in celebration of excellence in multicultural public relations and communications.

 This year’s ¡BRAVO! Awards theme, “Rooted in Purpose,” honors those who remain unshakable in times of turmoil. It speaks to the power of being grounded in community and principle, especially when faced with attacks and rhetoric that seek to silence or scapegoat. It calls on communicators to resist convenience and stand firm in truth.

 “We are living in a moment when Latino communities are being scapegoated, detained, and stripped of dignity,” said HPRA President Sonia V. Diaz. “In times like these, our role as communicators is not to bend or soften the message—it’s to name injustice, amplify truth, and stand steady in defense of our people.”

 Huerta embodies this clarity and conviction. At 95, she remains an active organizer and advocate. In 2025, she joined mass protests against federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, condemned the arrest of labor leader David Huerta, and co-signed a petition to the United Nations calling for a human rights investigation. She continues to advise immigrant communities, lead resistance against private detention centers, and support civic engagement through the Dolores Huerta Foundation. This year, the Foundation broke ground on a new Peace and Justice Cultural Center in Kern County, California.

 Her enduring legacy includes co-founding the United Farm Workers in 1962, helping win collective bargaining rights for farmworkers, banning dangerous pesticides, and advancing gender and racial equity. She coined the phrase “Sí, se puede”—“Yes, we can”—which continues to rally movements for justice across generations.

 “As communicators, we are on the frontlines of truth, justice, and dignity for our communities,” Diaz added. “Dolores Huerta has never stopped reminding us that direct engagement—face to face, voice to voice—can move people to action. Her legacy proves that when we truly listen and speak with clarity and courage, we protect lives and shift power.”

 The President’s Award is a singular honor, selected annually by the HPRA President and presented to a leader whose work has transformed lives and shaped the cultural narrative of Latinos in the United States.

 In addition to Huerta, the 2025 ¡BRAVO! Awards will recognize a slate of visionary leaders:

 * Pioneer of the Year: Karina Martinez, co-founder of DRAFTED
* Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion: Adrianne C. Smith, founder of Cannes Can: Diversity Collective
* Journalist of the Year: Julio (Julito) Ricardo Varela, independent journalist and commentator

 These honorees reflect the strength, creativity, and cultural clarity that define leadership in communications today.
