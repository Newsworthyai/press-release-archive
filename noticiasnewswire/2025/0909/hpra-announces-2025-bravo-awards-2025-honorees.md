# HPRA Announces 2025 ¡BRAVO! Awards 2025 Honorees

MIAMI, FL — September 9, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) – The Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) proudly announces 2025 ¡BRAVO! Awards honorees: Pioneer of the Year and DRAFTED cofounder Karina Martinez, and DEI Champion and Cannes Can: Diversity Collective founder Adrianne C. Smith. Now in its 11th year, the ¡BRAVO! Awards return on Thursday, November 13, 2025, at The Drake Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, bringing together industry leaders, change agents, and cultural storytellers nationwide.

 “Communicators are often the first to tell a story, yet the last to be recognized for shaping it,” said HPRA National President Sonia V. Diaz. “Karina and Adrianne lead with clarity and conviction, grounded in their communities and guided by a deep understanding of what’s at stake. At a time when inclusion is under attack and cultural narratives are being rewritten by those on the outside, their work stands firm.”

 Pioneer of the Year: Karina Martinez

 Karina Martinez brings a rare blend of cultural intelligence, political savvy, and brand strategy to every space she enters. As co-founder of DRAFTED, she created a platform that elevates the voices and visibility of Latinas in sports and storytelling, making them central to the narrative.

 Her career spans leadership roles in top agencies, major political initiatives, and public interest campaigns. Whether advising candidates or global brands, she brings a sharp understanding of how culture drives influence and how institutions must evolve to reflect the communities they serve.

 Karina’s impact is felt in the boardroom, in the media, and in the growing network of young professionals who see themselves reflected in her work. She is one of the few voices in our field consistently pushing for more than optics by insisting on depth, access, and accountability.

 DEI Champion: Adrianne C. Smith

 Adrianne C. Smith has spent her career building lasting frameworks for inclusion. As the founder of the Cannes Can: Diversity Collective (CC:DC) and Chief Inclusion and Impact Officer at FleishmanHillard, she has expanded access and opportunities for creatives from under-resourced communities on global stages and within major companies.

 Through initiatives like Inkwell Beach at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and Davos during the World Economic Forum. Adrianne has created space for honest conversations, real investment, and long-overdue visibility for creators who have been traditionally ignored or whose creative talents have been co-opted. Her leadership reflects both a commitment to representation and to developing infrastructure that supports long-term access, growth and innovation.

 She also launched the Center for Excellence in Advertising at Howard University and has guided agencies on their internal inclusion efforts. Adrianne’s work is defined by rigor, vision, and results that move the work forward without compromise.

 Celebrating culture in a time of challenge

 This year’s ¡BRAVO! honorees have helped reshape the multicultural narrative and their leadership reflects a deeper truth communicators understand well: the stories that survive are the ones rooted in courage and carried by community.

 The HPRA ¡BRAVO! Awards remain the PR industry’s leading platform for recognizing those who build cultural capital, lead with integrity, and deliver impact that resonates beyond the campaign cycle.
