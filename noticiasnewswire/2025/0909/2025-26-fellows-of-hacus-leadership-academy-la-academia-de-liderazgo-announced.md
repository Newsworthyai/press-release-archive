 SAN ANTONIO, TX — September 9, 2025 — (NOTICIAS NEWSWIRE) — The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities is pleased to announce the 26 fellows who were selected for the seventh cohort of its Leadership Academy/La Academia de Liderazgo. Since its inception, the program has advanced the careers of leaders within a wide range of higher education institutions, demonstrating the value of the program in expanding opportunities at the highest levels of college and university administrations.

 Fellows of the program participate in a range of development activities preparing them for leadership roles in the full spectrum of institutions of higher learning, with an emphasis on Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Emerging HSIs. The one-year fellowship program includes webinars and three seminars, with the first seminar held in November 2025 in conjunction with HACU’s 39th Annual Conference in Aurora, Colorado. The second seminar will be held in Washington, D.C., in April 2026, at HACU’s National Capitol Forum. The third seminar will take place at a still to be determined international location.

Mentorship with a university president or senior-level administrator is a key component of the program, as well as the development of a special project designed to have an impact at the Fellow’s current institution.
