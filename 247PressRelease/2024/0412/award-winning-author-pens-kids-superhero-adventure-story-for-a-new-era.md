# Award-Winning Author Pens Kids' Superhero Adventure Story for a New Era!

PORTLAND, OR, April 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Eleven-year-old Nick Townley and his Great Gramp share a love of superhero comics and all things Superman. But when his grandfather passes away and his family faces a move across the country, Nick would do anything to save his home. Award-winning author Sandy Grubb brings a story of friendship, belonging, and self-discovery with Just Like Click, a new adventure story for middle-grade readers.  Nick decides to step off the comic book pages he creates and go undercover as a powerful superhero, Click, to fight for truth, justice, and a better tomorrow…and his dad's job. Since Superman works undercover and alone, so does he…that is, until newcomer Patrick and twin vacationers Jacey and Celia find out about Nick's secret missions and want in. But can he ask his new friends to put their lives in danger to help him? What would Click do?  Sandy Grubb masterfully writes a story that will resonate with middle-grade readers finding their own place in their world and their own superpowers. Sandy is a native Oregonian and the winner of the esteemed Kraken Prize recognizing finely crafted middle grade fiction. She lives in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Grubb's debut book is scheduled for release on April 16, 2024.  Praise for Just Like Click:  "The story is compulsively readable, as the pace is dynamic—sometimes exciting and other times tender and contemplative…The prose is never patronizing and always deeply engaging, with descriptive passages that put the reader in Nick's shoes; one feels his attachment to his home and to his developing relationships. Each character has their own distinct voice, backstory, and sensibilities, all filtered through Nick's perspective." —Kirkus Reviews  Sandy will be speaking at the following events: April 16, 2024, 6:30 p.m., Paulina Springs Books, Sisters, Oregon May 11, 2024, 2 to 3 p.m., Roundabout Books, Bend, Oregon May 13, 2024, 7 p.m., Annie Bloom's Books, Portland, Oregon May 18, 2024, 1 to 3 p.m., Barnes & Noble at Bridgeport, Tigard, Oregon  Sandy and her book will be featured on a week-long Blog Tour April 14-21.
