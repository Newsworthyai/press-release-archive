# SaveRxCanada.to Offers Free Shipping for All Orders Through Its International Generics Program, Making Affordable Medications Even More Accessible

VANCOUVER, BC, August 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SaveRxCanada.to is pleased to announce that all orders placed through its International Generics Program (RxSelect) now come with free shipping. This initiative is part of the company's ongoing commitment to making affordable medications even more accessible to customers, especially those managing chronic health conditions on tight budgets. With generic medications already costing up to 85% less than their brand-name counterparts, the addition of free shipping amplifies the savings that customers can enjoy.  The Value of Generic Medications Generic drugs are chemically identical to brand-name drugs in terms of active ingredients, dosage, safety, strength, quality, and intended use. Despite this, they are sold at significantly lower prices because they do not carry the same development and marketing costs as brand-name drugs. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generic drugs can cost 80% to 85% less than brand-name versions.  Studies have shown that the widespread use of generics has saved the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars each year. A report by the Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM) found that generic drugs saved the U.S. healthcare system $338 billion in 2021 alone. SaveRxCanada.to's International Generics Program is designed to help American consumers tap into these savings while maintaining access to high-quality medications.
