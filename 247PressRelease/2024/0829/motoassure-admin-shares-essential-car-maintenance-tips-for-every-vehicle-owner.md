Tire Care:  Your tires are the only part of your vehicle that makes contact with the road, making their care essential. Regularly check tire pressure, alignment, and tread depth. Rotating your car's tires every 5,000 to 7,500 miles helps ensure even wear and extends their lifespan.  3. Brake Inspections:  Your vehicle's brakes are important for your safety, and regular brake inspections help you catch potential issues before they become serious. Look for signs of wear, including squeaking or reduced responsiveness, and replace brake pads as needed.  4. Battery Maintenance:  A healthy battery is essential for your vehicle's reliability. Check your battery connections regularly to ensure they are clean and secure. Additionally, testing your battery's voltage can help prevent unexpected failures.  5. Fluid Levels:  Maintaining proper fluid levels is critical for your vehicle's operation. Regularly check your coolant, brake, transmission, and power steering fluid to avoid potential issues. These fluids are essential for keeping your car running smoothly and safely.  How MotoAssure Admin Can Help While regular maintenance is crucial, unexpected issues can still arise.
