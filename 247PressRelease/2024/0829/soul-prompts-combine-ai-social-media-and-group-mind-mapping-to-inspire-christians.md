# Soul Prompts combine AI, Social Media, and Group Mind Mapping to Inspire Christians

AUSTIN, TX, August 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- How do AI, social media, and group mind mapping work with each other to galvanize Christians?  According to Amy Chang of New Dawn Ministries, these modern technologies have a massive potential to deepen the Faith of believers. The group has pioneered what it calls Soul Prompts, which are phrases that can be used as stand-alone inspiration, evocative and thought provoking social media posts, prompts for AIs which pull relevant content from millions of sources, and central topics for group mind mapping.  According to New Dawn's Director of Communities John Toomey, Soul Prompts are an ancient, yet somehow also ultra-modern way for Christians to deepen their Faith, invite insights from the Holy Spirit, build Fellowship with believers, and expand one's connections in the Kingdom. "A single phrase can have life-changing power if it can be re-purposed endlessly through all the ways humans have invented to extract meaning," he says.  A Soul Prompt begins as a favorite phrase from Scripture, or a burning question about the Christian Life, or a personal understanding incited by the Holy Spirit, or an interesting intuition from a friend, family member, favorite writer, or Pastor.   Bible quotes that work well as Soul Prompts include:  "My Grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" "Whoever wants to be first must be slave of all" "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also"  Soul Prompts take four forms:  1. The initial phrase, which usually is something one is inspired by, or a nagging question about one's spiritual life that has persisted for years.  2. The social media form of the phrase, which is usually a question that is interesting and provocative enough that when it is posted on a social network it will invite lots of comments  3. The AI prompt form of the original thought, which is optimized to produce the most wisdom-evoking answers from AI programs like ChatGPT. (All modern AI's access and sort through millions of documents about Christianity)  4. The phrase used as a central topic in a Mind Mapping program like generateideas.ai, Miro, or MindMeister, so that it leads to a shared vision of fellowship through online group Mind Mapping.  Says New Dawn's Education Director Soani Gunawan: "You might summarize the power of Soul Prompts thusly: They engage a believer initially through curiosity, awe, love, mystery, or bliss; then they efficiently draw in new interested people and visions through social media; then they unleash the massive power of modern Generative AI to invoke more insight; then they provide inspirational touchstones for Spirit-filled discussions via group Mind Mapping."  Soul Prompts are rigorously tested on Christian group sites that have a large number of subscribers; on Facebook these include "Christian Topics" (248,000 members), "God Created Heaven and the Earth" (265,000), and "Pray for Humanity" (4 million subscribers).  To reduce the incidence of AI 'hallucinating' those who utilize Soul Prompts use different AI's-- the ones that deliver exemplary results include ChatGPT, Gemini.google.com, Copilot (Microsoft), Claude.ai, Meta's LLaMA, and Perplexity.ai.  The group's website includes pages in Chinese, Hindi, Swahili, and Tagalog, based on interest in other countries.  https://soulprompts.org https://www.facebook.com/groups/push.highest For more information write amychang423@yahoo.com
