# First Look at Prince Harry's Polo Docu-Series, 'POLO,' Premiering This December on Netflix

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The series, produced by Archewell Productions and Boardwalk Pictures, promises an exclusive, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the fast-paced world of elite global polo players.  "POLO is a new documentary series that follows elite global players and offers an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the fast-paced world of the sport," Netflix stated in an announcement shared on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement was accompanied by four still photos, including an image of three polo players on horseback overlooking a pitch and another of two athletes battling for the ball with their mallets.  Prince Harry, who has been passionate about polo for decades, revealed earlier this year that he was working on the series. The show was filmed primarily at the US Open Polo Championship in Florida and will offer viewers unprecedented access to the professional polo scene. It aims to move beyond polo's glamorous reputation, diving into the grit, dedication, and competitive spirit of the sport at the highest level.  The news was first reported by Deadline, which also shared that Prince Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, is developing a cooking show with Netflix. Shortly after, Prince Harry was spotted at the National Polo Center in Wellington, Florida, with a film crew, further stoking anticipation for the series.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who stepped back from their royal duties in 2020 and relocated to California, are both set to serve as executive producers on POLO, with Miloš Balać (known for Welcome to Wrexham) as showrunner. This project is part of the couple's multiyear deal with Netflix through their production company, Archewell Productions, which has already released several successful projects, including the docuseries Harry & Meghan, Live to Lead, and Heart of Invictus.  Polo star Nacho Figueras, a close friend of Prince Harry, praised the Duke's dedication to the project, drawing parallels to his commitment to Sentebale, the charity Prince Harry co-founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006. "When I see Prince Harry delve into Sentebale, it makes me want to support him and his other projects even more. I know he will do the same for this series," Figueras told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview. He expressed excitement about the series, highlighting its potential to introduce polo to a broader audience.  Prince Harry, known for playing in charity polo matches, including those benefiting Sentebale, was recently seen competing at the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in Wellington, Florida, in April, and visiting the Lagos Polo Club in Nigeria with Meghan in May.  With POLO, Prince Harry aims to bring the world of professional polo to Netflix's vast global audience, offering an inside look at a sport that's often seen as exclusive and elite. The series will highlight the dedication and passion of its players, showcasing the real challenges of competing at the highest level.  Fans can look forward to POLO on Netflix this December, promising an exciting addition to the streaming platform's lineup of compelling documentaries.
