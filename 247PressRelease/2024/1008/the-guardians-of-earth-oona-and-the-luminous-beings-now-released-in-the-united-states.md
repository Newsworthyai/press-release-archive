# The Guardians of Earth – Oona and the Luminous Beings Now Released In The United States

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Guardians of Earth – Oona and the Luminous Beings (ISBN 978-2-89626-650-0, traditionally published by Ariane Editions) by Oriane Livingston has been officially released in the United States. The book is available in paperback edition and retails for $17.99. Both the book and the author have been earning critical acclaim for the creative and mesmerizing storyline and writing.   The Guardians of Earth- Oona and the Luminous Beings is the first volume of a fantasy saga celebrating the beauty of the natural world. It is a love letter to Earth filled with epic adventures beyond imagination, bringing children and teenagers closer to the magic of Nature. The novel is more than just a fantasy story; it is a poetic message of hope for young readers and a call to action for the younger generation. At a time when our planet is in peril as never before, the book is both timely and critical. The author wrote the book to educate children on the need to protect the environment early in their lives. Livingston sees the next generation as the key to save the planet. The book invites children to become a true 'Guardian of Earth'.  "Writing The Guardians of Earth has been a labor of love," said Oriane Livingston. "I sought to weave a tale that would both entertain and educate children – and their parents - about our beautiful Earth".   "I view writing as a form of activism," concluded Livingston. "It is my humble hope that after reading this book, children will walk away not merely with a keener awareness of the beauty of Nature but also use the book as a clarion call to protect our precious Earth".  It tells the story of Oona, an eleven-year-old girl who lives in a troubled household and feels very much alone. One night, her flower starts to speak to her, and she meets Eterna, a woman of extraordinary beauty who embodies the spirit of Earth. Eterna reveals to her that humans are slowly killing her, destroying trees, polluting oceans, and hunting animals to extinction. Oona learns that, along with Nawal and Aqiwo, her fellow Guardians, she must retrieve a sacred crystal to reconnect the filaments of light that once united humans' hearts with the Earth.  The Guardians of Earth- Oona and the Luminous Beings is one of the first (or one of the very few) times that Earth has ever been personified in a novel.  Oriane Livingston is a critically acclaimed French American published novelist, filmmaker and environmentalist.   A graduate from UCLA School of Law and a former attorney, her love for books and movies compelled her to embrace an artistic career. She studied screenwriting at the UCLA Film & Television School and the Fundamentals of Acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.   Throughout her journey, she's had the privilege of collaborating on numerous films with several Academy Award winning film producers and studios in Hollywood and in Europe.  Her storytelling aims at reconnecting us to the natural world. She draws her inspiration from wild animals, trees and stars.   A nature lover, Oriane can often be found on the hiking trails of the Santa Monica mountains in Los Angeles with Cosmos, her beloved husky. She is a vegan and practices yoga, dance, Shotokan Karate and Transcendental Meditation.  Additional information about her and The Guardians of Earth may be obtained at www.orianelivingston.com
