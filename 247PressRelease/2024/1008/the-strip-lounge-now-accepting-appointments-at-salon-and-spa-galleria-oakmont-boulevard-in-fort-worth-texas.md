# The Strip Lounge Now Accepting Appointments at Salon and Spa Galleria Oakmont Boulevard in Fort Worth, Texas

FORT WORTH, TX, October 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Licensed Cosmetologist Nakia Washington proudly announces the opening of her new waxing salon suite, The Strip Lounge, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Oakmont Blvd in Fort Worth, Texas.  With nearly five years of experience in the business, Washington attended the Continental School of Beauty in New York, where she learned the skills and developed the confidence to successfully operate her own salon.  "I like to say this industry picked me," Washington joked. "I started school during the time of COVID, and I had to learn a lot via Zoom. When we finally were able to get into the classroom, I learned all the hands-on techniques in person," she added. "Once I became confident and got the hang of the technique,  I knew I would be able to provide excellent service.  The benefits of waxing over shaving are numerous, according to Washington. For starters, waxing typically lasts longer than shaving, which means there is no chance of nicking the skin. Regular waxing can help loosen and remove dead skin, for a softer, smoother feel. And if you have sensitive skin, waxing eliminates the possibility of rashes or razor burn.  "Waxing removes hair at the root," Washington said. "This also helps decrease the chance of getting ingrown hairs."  To celebrate The Strip Lounge's grand opening at its new location, Washington is offering a 20-percent discount on the first service. She also offers a referral special: if a client refers three new customers, the referring client will earn one free service after the referrals receive their service.  The Strip Lounge is accepting clients from 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Wednesday by appointment only. To schedule an appointment, visit Washington's booking site.
