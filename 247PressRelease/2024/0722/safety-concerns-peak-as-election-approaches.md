# Safety Concerns Peak as Election Approaches

DURHAM, NC, July 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the pivotal election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, draws near, the safety concerns of many Democrats and Republican volunteers have skyrocketed. This surge in anxiety follows the attempted assassination of former President Trump, an event that has left both political sides in a state of panic and fear. With the incumbent president, Joe Biden, running for re-election, the stakes are higher than ever.  The Rise in Security Measures In response to these heightened fears, security measures have been significantly increased. The Republican National Convention saw an unprecedented surge in armed security, with the Secret Service detail being bolstered by over 100 private security companies. These companies provided contracted armed security guards to ensure the safety of attendees.  "I remember attending a political rally a few years ago, where the security was noticeably tight but nowhere near the levels we're seeing now. The presence of so many armed guards was both reassuring and a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in today's political climate."  Fear and Its Impact on the Public Fear is precisely what terrorists aim to instill in the American public. The recent incident involving a "lone" gunman with no apparent motive only adds to the alarm felt by many. It brings to light the critical role that private security contractors play as America's last line of defense, especially when law enforcement officers are at an all-time low in terms of active duty personnel.  The Role of Private Security Contractors Private security contractors are essential in filling the gaps left by an understaffed law enforcement community. These professionals are often the unsung heroes, working tirelessly to protect individuals and ensure the safety of large events. Their presence allows people to continue their daily lives with a sense of security.
