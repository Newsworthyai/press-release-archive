# Communication Between Generations Is The Focus Of Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein's Bestselling Ebook, Conflict And A Bit Of Magic, Available At No Charge November 19 And 20 In Ebook Form

WILMINGTON, NC, November 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The communication gap between different generations is an important factor in regard to building and maintaining strong relationships within not only families, but also communities. This can be fraught with serious challenges and misunderstandings. There are differences in experiences, values, and perspectives that can make it difficult for individuals of different age groups to relate to one another. Older generations have grown up in a time when technology was not as prevalent, leading to a lack of trust in modern-day communication tools. The younger generations may be more comfortable with technology, but may lack the life experience and wisdom that older generations can offer.  Members of the younger generation may see older people as out of touch or resistant to change. These negative attitudes can create barriers to effective communication. The fast pace of modern life and the increasing fragmentation of families and communities can make it harder for different generations to spend time together and build the kinds of relationships that lead to open and honest communication. If there is a solution, what might it be?  Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein, a visionary positive psychologist and award-winning film maker addresses this issue head-on in her bestselling book 'Conflict And A Bit Of Magic.' In this book, she uses fiction to address real world challenges in a way that is engaging for young people, while avoiding the "preachiness" of other books on the subject.  In this book, a high school freshman is facing a number of challenges, including a disappointing boyfriend and the fallout from a party. She jumps at the chance to visit her aunt in Minnesota and escape her irritating family, only to find herself drawn into a seance that reveals mysterious information about a deceased relative. Upon returning home, she must confront more mysteries, as well as communication issues with her mother. However, she also experiences some enlightening moments that help her understand her situation better.  The ebook will be available at no charge on Amazon November 19 and 20 at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbara-Becker-Holstein/author/B001JXEZ8U?
