SINGAPORE, August 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Key findings highlight Singapore's position as the most expensive country in Southeast Asia, with a cost of living index of 85.9, significantly higher than neighboring countries. The report also notes a substantial increase in property and rental costs, with average HDB flat prices reaching $532,768 and private houses averaging $2,080,533.  "While Singapore maintains its reputation for high quality of life, our analysis reveals that many residents face increasing financial pressures due to rising costs across multiple sectors," stated Mr. Nada, ROSHI Founder.
