# Dermatologist Kyle Owens named a 2024 Castle Connolly Rising Star

PROSPER, TX, August 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Kyle S. Owens, MD, has been recognized as a 2024 Castle Connolly Rising Star. The Rising Stars designation recognizes early-career physicians who are emerging leaders in their fields.  Dr. Owens is a dermatologist with Lockhart Matter Dermatology & Aesthetic Center. In September 2024, the practice will open a second, Plano location. The new location will be called Lockhart Matter Dermatology, Mohs and Cosmetic Surgery Center.  Prior to joining the practice in 2022, he served as a staff dermatologist with Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans.   Certified by the American Board of Dermatology, Dr. Owens diagnoses and treats people of all ages experiencing a wide array of skin issues. These include viral, bacterial, and fungal infections such as warts, herpes simplex, and impetigo; growth and pigmentation issues such as moles, skin tags, vitiligo, scars, and melasma; and skin cancer, including basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas, atypical moles, and melanoma.  Dr. Owens is also highly trained and skilled in all cosmetic injectables including dermal fillers and neurotoxins like Botox and Dysport. He believes in a holistic approach to the aging face and aims for subtle and naturally beautiful changes.  "Despite skin cancer being the most common cancer in the world, there are no real screening guidelines for it," he says. "As dermatologists, we generally recommend that people start coming in and getting checked at around 30 or 35 years old â€” and maybe even younger for people who have a family history of skin cancer or live in areas where the sun is stronger."  Year-round vigilance about sun exposure is critical to lowering skin cancer risk, Dr. Owens says.   "Some of the worst sunburns I've seen have been people coming back from ski trips, up in the mountains."  Dr. Owens says he went into medicine largely because of his mother's breast cancer diagnosis and (successful) treatment when he was a child.  "My sister and I would go with our mom to her chemotherapy treatments," he recalls. "I'd watch the nurses hang the IV lines and infusion bags and think that it was the coolest thing like an auto shop for people."  Dr. Owens believes in patient autonomy over everything. He notes, "As a physician, it is my job to relate the facts and dispel the myths for all my patients. I want to give them the right information and then have an appropriate discussion on how to best treat their problems given their unique situations".   Dr. Owens earned his medical degree at East Tennessee State University's Quillen College of Medicine. He completed a three-year dermatology residency at Tulane University Affiliated Hospitals, serving as chief resident during the final year.  He also holds a bachelor's degree (summa cum laude) in biomedical sciences from Auburn University.  Dr. Owens is affiliated with Baylor Scott & White and Medical Center Plano.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  After learning of his Rising Star nomination, Dr. Owens says he is honored. "This is a big deal to me given that the nomination comes from my peers in medicine. Being a physician is both a tough and honorable profession, and I am thankful to my colleagues for putting my name up for recognition."  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications. Nominations are open to all board-certified MDs, DOs, and DPMs. The Castle Connolly team chooses honorees based on nominee criteria that includes their medical education, training, hospital appointments, and disciplinary histories.  Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected as a Castle Connolly Top Doctor.
