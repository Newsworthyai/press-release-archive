# The Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook Group Offers Myriad Membership Benefits

FORT WORTH, TX, August 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With more than 4,900 members, The Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook Group is increasing in both size and popularity. If you take just a few moments to browse the posts on the page, it's easy to see why this group has become so well-loved. Any Robert Graham fan can easily find bargains on single shirts, and as a bonus, some sellers will offer discount pricing on lots.  Numerous posts appear daily, describing a variety of RG clothing items available. Many times, members are offering vintage RG pieces that are no longer available in retail stores. For example, a recent post announced an older Robert Graham Limited Edition "Letterman" jacket for sale, with the original price tag still attached. According to the seller, the shell is fabricated of blue leather, and the jacket is one of only 138 made. But members of the Robert Graham Clothing Collectors page generally are in search of a deal or a steal. And this seller knows his audience; he asked a relatively reasonable fee for a vintage item in brand-new condition.  If you're looking for the name of a Robert Graham article of clothing, well, you've come to the right place. Group members know Robert Graham fashions inside and out, and are more than happy to share that knowledge. All that's required is a photo and your query. In fact, one group member recently asked, "Anyone know the name of this one?" Four hours later, the answer was there: "Byrd."   This leads to a somewhat random question: How do the Robert Graham designers decide upon the name for a shirt? Some of the names seem pretty obvious, such as the Avengers Limited Edition shirt. In fact, Robert Graham has an entire collection devoted to the perennially popular Marvel comic characters, such as Spiderman, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor. The "Iron Man Extremis Armor" sport shirt features a silhouetted figure of Iron Man on the front, embellished with Robert Graham's traditionally exceptional embroidery. On the back of the shirt, a full-color print of Tony Stark contains more embroidery. "Avengers Unite" is a sport shirt that offers a collage of scenes from the Avengers comics, with appearances by Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Captain America Thor, and Black Widow.   The Marvel collection contains more than just button-down or sport shirts. One of several T-shirts in the Marvel Collection, "Team Up" displays a brightly colored Marvel logo, along with the Robert Graham logo underneath it. Another T-shirt, called "Marvel Spidey Battle," depicts Spiderman fighting enemies. A third T-shirt, named "Captain in Charge," contains the image of Captain America in his traditional red suit. The illustration on the front depicts Captain America fighting an important battle, while his trusty shield decorates the back of the shirt.  It's always exciting to explore Robert Graham's latest seasonal offerings, which include plenty of summer-themed, brightly colored prints. If you're looking for a shirt that simply oozes tropical delight, you'll want to check out the newly released "Toucan" short-sleeve, button-down shirt. Boasting a lush tropical leaf print, this shirt is crafted of nylon and cotton and offers a moisture-wicking capability. And if you really want to up your game, indulge in the matching shorts. You'll be the best-dressed passenger on the cruise ship, or at the very least, the hit of the summer party circuit.  Another Robert Graham recent release that's certain to be a summer smash hit is the boldly hued "Fiesta de Verano" short-sleeve, button-down shirt. It features a collage of colorful illustrations, including a bottle with the Robert Graham name emblazoned across the front; tropical drinks; a yellow electric guitar; and a cigar-smoking Robert Graham bulldog.  You'll be the master of the pickleball courts when you show up wearing Robert Graham's "Paddle Me" classic fit T-shirt. Fashioned of moisture-wicking polyester with a hint of spandex, this charming short-sleeved crewneck features a multi-colored array of miniature pickleball paddles. "Paddle Me" is absolutely delightful, and ever so appropriate to wear for your next pickleball challenge.  The Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook Group was created by Fort Worth entrepreneur and commercial real estate developer Ron Sturgeon, who started it in January 2020. Since then, membership has grown to more than 4,900, and is open to anyone who loves the brand. Group members enjoy connecting and sharing information and photos of their RG finds. One of the benefits of joining the group is that members are able to sell or trade their RG fashions to others on the page. You won't have to scroll far to find a bargain; outstanding deals appear in the posts on a daily basis.
