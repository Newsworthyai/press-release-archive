# Salon and Spa Galleria Receives Thanks from One Safe Place for its Generous Donations to Recent Beauty Brunch

FORT WORTH, TX, December 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Eighth Annual Beauty Brunch, a charitable event designed to benefit and empower local survivors of human trafficking and domestic violence, was a smashing success, according to the event's organizers.  "Thanks to the generous contributions by Salon and Spa Galleria, the day was filled with elegance, laughter and inspiration," said Yvonne M. Harrison, event chair from One Safe Place. "We could not have done it without this level of support."   During the Beauty Brunch, survivors enjoyed a day of relaxation and rejuvenation, along with a safe space to connect, heal, and thrive â€“ all with the support and encouragement of the local community.  Multiple independent professionals from Salon and Spa Galleria generously donated their time and talent to provide a variety of complimentary beauty and wellness services to survivors. Beauty Brunch participants enjoyed a day of pampering and relaxing treatments, including haircuts and styles; chair massages; facials; and makeup application; along with nail and brow styling.  The Beauty Brunch was organized by One Safe Place's VOICES Committee, a volunteer group comprising domestic violence survivors dedicated to providing advocacy and raising awareness about domestic violence and its effects on the community. Other groups contributing to the success of this year's Beauty Brunch included One Safe Place's Family Justice Center, along with assistance from Salon and Spa Galleria and its beauty professionals.  One Safe Place is a comprehensive crime prevention agency in Fort Worth that is dedicated to preventing crime and violence in Tarrant County's neighborhoods, schools and homes. In its 12th year, the not-for-profit organization offers vital resources for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Located at 1100 Hemphill St. in Fort Worth, the group operates a satellite office in Grapevine. The organization serves as an umbrella for more than 20 agencies under one roof, ensuring survivors get coordinated and comprehensive services. One Safe Place works in tandem with its VOICES Committee and the Family Justice Center to help provide assistance to domestic violence victims and their children.

During the camp, participants learn independence, along with the skills they need to help break the generational cycle of violence. Follow-up enrichment activities throughout the year allow campers to maintain friendships they started at camp.
