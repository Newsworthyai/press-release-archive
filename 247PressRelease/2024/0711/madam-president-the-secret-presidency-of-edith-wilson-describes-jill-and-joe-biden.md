# Madam President The Secret Presidency of Edith Wilson Describes Jill and Joe Biden

CHICAGO, IL, July 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Its all there. The shuffling gait. The scripted speeches. The blocked media interviews. The strange absense from press conferences. But she is there. Jill Biden or is it Edith Wilson. Since my book Madam President The Secret Presidency of Edith Wilson came out I have not really seen an Edith Wilson presidency...until now. To understand the parallell between Jill Biden and Edith Wilson you have to understand the motivation of both women. We have a spoils system in government. If the President loses his job then everyone else loses thiers...including the First Lady.   In Woodrow Wilsons case there was a clear objective. Hang on to power and get the League of Nations approved and end World War I by ratifying the Treaty of Versaille. Edith Wilson did not want power for herself but she wanted Woodrow Wilson to remain in power. So the coverup began. Lock the White House gates. Kick out the reporters. Keep Woodrow Wilson hidden away. Handle all the problems by diverting them from the President. The massive stroke that incapacitated Wilson was debilitating and Edith literally had to take over the goverment.   In Jill Bidens case she has had to step in and make sure Joe is not unscripted. That he cannot have news conferences. That she is there to fill in for him when he forgets names. She is there to guide him on stage. She is there to make sure that Joe does not reveal to the world what she and everyone who works for the President knows, that he can no longer be a proactive President wihout assistance. It is the covering up that Edith and Jill share. The knowlede that their husband can no longer fulfill the duties of the Presidency without help. And this is what an unoffical President does, they become proactive.   Edith Wilson in the beginning guided Woodrows hand in signing documents. Then she just signed them herself. Jill Biden is still guiding Joes hand...it is only a matter of time before she will be signing the documents herself.
