# FULLY PROMOTED LAUNCHES ENHANCEMENTS TO BRAND INCLUDING UPDATED WEBSITE AND NEW ANTHEM VIDEO

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, July 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fully Promoted®, a full-service promotional products franchise, is reinforcing its commitment to its franchise owners and clients with the launch of strategic brand enhancements that will improve operational efficiencies and the overall customer experience. Following numerous surveys and interviews with franchise owners, customers, and vendors, Fully Promoted uncovered an opportunity to develop more simplistic and consistent messaging. These findings have resulted in a refreshed website and brand anthem video, both of which help to articulate who the company is, what it does, and why clients have been doing business with them for over 20 years.  "We are so excited to launch these new enhancements to our brand that we believe will increase awareness and help us gain market share among prospective clients; equip our franchise owners with better tools to sell with; and generate higher systemwide sales," said Andrew Titus, President of Fully Promoted. "These initiatives align with our goal of becoming the number-one distributor in the industry and attracting best-in-class franchise owners who are foundational to our success and the backbone of our organization."  The revamped Fully Promoted website offers benefits for both existing and prospective clients with simple, easy-to-use features such as an updated location search and showcases some of the brand's previous work as well as viable solutions for companies of all types and sizes. The website also offers benefits for franchise owners with a new back-end software platform called Fully Promoted Connect that has integrated digital marketing tools, financial reporting capabilities, online commerce, internal communication tools, and more.  "One thing Fully Promoted will never be is stagnant; we are constantly evolving beside our ever-changing industry and working to identify ways we can better serve our clients and aid in our franchise owners' success," added Titus.   At its core, Fully Promoted is a business-to-business marketing strategy facilitator, helping businesses and organizations attract, retain, and engage with their customers and employees through branded apparel and promotional products. Since its inception 24 years ago, Fully Promoted has gained a reputation for providing unparalleled customer service. Through its franchise model, each Fully Promoted is individually owned and operated by a local franchisee – someone who not only is ingrained in their local community but also has a true understanding of local business needs. This hyperlocal connection has proven tremendously beneficial in driving impact and results for clients with nearly 80% of customers returning and ordering with Fully Promoted again.  Todd Diskin, owner of the Fully Promoted franchise in Olathe, Kansas added, "Being with Fully Promoted for over 20 years, I have witnessed first-hand the evolution of our brand and how it keeps getting better and better. With continued enhancements that will benefit the entire system, including prospective clients and franchise owners alike, we have the potential to take our business to the next level and I'm incredibly energized for what's to come."
