# Sage Advanced Aesthetics Now Accepting Appointments at Salon and Spa Galleria Oakmont Boulevard in Fort Worth, Texas

FORT WORTH, TX, July 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Licensed Esthetician Veronica Lizalde is no stranger to skin issuesâ€¦acne, to be specific. She learned how to care for her skin, fighting the battle against breakouts and emerging victorious. Lizalde recently opened Sage Advanced Aesthetics in the Salon and Spa Galleria Oakmont Blvd in Fort Worth, and is ready to share what she's learned on the road to healthy, radiant skin.  "I went into this business because I struggled with acne and wanted to help others with their skin," Lizalde said. "My goal is to offer my clients result-driven treatments, while simultaneously providing a relaxing environment and experience."  After attending esthetician school, Lizalde gained valuable hands-on experience working in a dermatology office and medical spa. For Lizalde, the next logical step was to take that knowledge and experience and open her own business.  "I created Sage Advanced Aesthetics to make corrective skin care relaxing and accessible to as many people as possible," Lizalde said. "I specialize in results and relaxation." Lizalde addresses a variety of conditions, including hyperpigmentation, acne, uneven texture, and clogged pores, and also provides treatments to help clients deal with aging skin.  Sage Advanced Aesthetics offers a wide selection of services, including facials; dermaplaning; chemical peels; hydrodermabrasion; exfoliation; extractions; dermaplaning; masks; hyaluronic acid infusion; and LED light therapy. A 90-minute radio frequency treatment uses energy waves to heat the inner layers of skin, which stimulates collagen production. Lizalde also offers microneedling services, and her deluxe brow package includes eyebrow lamination, tint and wax.  Several types of facials are available, and they're all personalized specifically for each client. Safe for all skin types, the oxygenating lift facial helps improve fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and acne. The hydrodermabrasion facial uses gentle suction to deep-clean, exfoliate, and extract congestion, while simultaneously infusing personalized serums into the skin. The diamond glow facial includes diamond-tip hydrodermabrasion for exfoliation, dermaplaning, oxygen infusion, and a biocellulose mask with LED light therapy.   As an incentive for new clients, Lizalde is currently providing a special 10% discount off the first facial service.  Sage Advanced Aesthetics is currently accepting new clients by appointment only. To accommodate her clients' needs, Lizalde is open Monday through Saturday. Learn more about Sage Advanced Aesthetics by visiting Lizalde's Instagram page.
