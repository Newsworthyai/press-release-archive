There are many more options including cyberchats, video press releases and more here https://socialstreamingtv.com/news/mediakit/  BACKGROUND ChannelPartner.TV Announces Acceleration of Ultra AI Video Network Platform Integrating GPT-4o (Omni) with "Kill Switch" - Coming Soon and also explore other models suited for customer needs. There is much more here:  https://socialstreamingtv.com/platform/  We reviewed earlier versions of GTP and found them to be lacking and even this new release is still focused too much on text, however they had added "omni" features such as video, audio, graphics and other content forms.   As OpenAI noted, "GPT-4o is trained on a single new model with end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network."   Because GPT-4o is a leading model combining all of these modalities, we believe it is time to accelerate our own AI efforts along with our existing AI development TECHtionary features in ChannelPartner.TV based on decades of research and development which can be found in MindMeld-Merging Mental and Metal called the "best business book on AI" and can be found on AIuserforum.com  Seeking a Higher Level of Governance and Compliance  There are many pitfalls as we see it relying upon another new and relatively untested platform which will also be the focus of cybersecurity attacks from all directions as GPT represents a new business operating system (BOS). As such we have built in a "kill switch" to disconnect GPT from the platform data should the need arise and plan to only use this to protect user/customer data. This concept is also recommended for other applications a customer may have in order to achieve a higher level of governance and compliance.
