# Skin Care Salon/Spa Opens in Georgetown

GEORGETOWN, TX, June 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Velvet Rose Esthetics has opened her business in Hill Country Salon Suites, offering a wealth of knowledge and experience in the skin care industry.  Velvet Rose Esthetics is owned by esthetician Amber Metzger, whose mission is to heal the mind and the body through her skin care techniques.  "Seventeen years in the medical field has helped tremendously because I understand how the body works and the nervous system," Metzger says. "I understand that skin is so much deeper than what you see; it's what's inside as well because when you are stressed, it puts a lot of stress on your body and on your skin."  Metzger attended the Aveda Arts & Science Institute in Austin to study Esthiology.  Her mission is to provide each client with a complete experience AND an experience unique to the individual. The steps to her customer service include:  •	Having each customer complete a pre-appointment consent form and questionnaire asking about client preferences, their favorite aromatherapies, and their skin care concerns •	Providing and maintaining a relaxing mood with a candle lit, clean and ready room as well as offering a heated spa bed and robe •	Providing a wide range of customized services including facials, waxing, eyebrow and lash care, and dermaplaning, all designed to reward her clients with a relaxing service, one which will provide peace of mind and calmness of spirit. •	A follow-up the day after service to find out reactions and results.  The union of Velvet Rose and Hill Country Salon Suites The management team of Richard Spradley and Melanie Scharton (husband and wife owners) believe that their clients, who lease salon suites as independent business owners, are more than just clients.  "People like Amber, really all of our clients, become part of our family here at Hill Country," Scharton said. "We are invested in them emotionally, and it is our mission to make sure they have the support they need to succeed."  And it is that spirit of cooperation and support which attracted Metzger to Hill Country. "It's pretty unusual, really, to find that kind of support in the business world, especially between property owners and tenants. I am just thrilled to call Hill Country Salon Suites home for my business."  Final word about Velvet Rose Esthetics For appointments, call 512-999-8651 or email ambermetzger@yahoo.com.
