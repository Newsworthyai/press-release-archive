# ADAP Advocacy Publishes Final Report for Patient Perspectives on Long-Acting Injectables

WASHINGTON, DC, June 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today, as part of its Long-Acting Injectables (LAIs) Project, published its final report and executive summary on patient perspectives from people living with HIV about approved LAIs medications for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, as well as their HIV-negative counterparts about HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) injectables. The findings yield valuable insights to the barriers being faced by both populations.  LAIs are prescription medications designed to either prevent the transmission of HIV or treat HIV over an extended period. These medications can be used to replace daily oral medications. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that access barriers remain.  Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy summarized: "Over the last few years we've witnessed some amazing policy work being done on long-acting injectables, but often times it lacked the patient perspective. ADAP Advocacy's Long-Acting Injectables Project starts to fill that gap and the final report being issued today reflects our commitment to addressing the attitudinal, operational, and other associated barriers patients perceive as preventing them from accessing these life-changing products for both the treatment of HIV, as well as the prevention of HIV. The findings from this project serve as a starting point for ADAP Advocacy to conduct additional patient-centric research to learn more about the barriers as well as facilitators faced by patients seeking long-acting injectables. This project's research questions concerned patient treatment preferences, information pathways, utilization, and barriers to access."  The final report and executive summary are available online, here https://adapadvocacy.org/LAIsFinalReport2024/.   ADAP Advocacy's Long-Acting Injectables Project is made possible with support from Gilead Sciences, Merck, and ViiV Healthcare.
