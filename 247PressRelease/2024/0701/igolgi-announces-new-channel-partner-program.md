# igolgi Announces New Channel Partner Program

PRINCETON, NJ, July 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- igolgi, inc., a leading innovator in audio/video processing, encoding, and transcoding solutions, unveiled its new channel partner program today. This program is designed to give broadcast and Pro A/V dealers and systems integrators (SI's), access to the igolgi's variety of encoding and transcoding products.  The first product in the channel offering is iLux Transport, a flexible multi-channel SRT gateway for public internet or private IP networks. With two form factors â€“ a Mini and a 1 RU - all audio/video formats carried over transport streams, including IP, ASI, and HLS, are supported. UDP/IP in and out is standard. Each channel is independent from the others and can be an SRT input and SRT output. The input or outputs can be Multi-Program (MPTS) or Single Program (SPTS) Transport Streams. If the input is MPTS, the iLux Transport can split out each channel and provide individual SRT outputs or can output the complete MPTS without SRT or with new SRT parameters.  The iLux Transport is available in several configurations with up to 32 independent SRT channels and is very competitively priced. https://www.igolgi.com/ilux-transport   Industry veteran Rich Hajdu, who has successfully managed channel partner programs for well-known companies like Utah Scientific, Pro-Bel, Chyron, and Imagine, will head this effort. Hajdu says, "igolgi is not well known to dealers and SIs, but they have quietly installed thousands of live and VoD channels across North America." He continues, "They have an almost flawless service record because of their commitment to quality, and a customer-first attitude, which should be well received in the channels community."
