MINNEAPOLIS, MN, July 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Twin Cities Southwest Metro authors Angela Grey and Paige Peterson have just released their latest mystery novel, replete with unexpected twists and turns. This action-packed romance with suspense undertones is poised to captivate readers from their teens to late adulthood with engaging characters and imaginative storytelling. The authors' passion for creating vibrant, relatable characters shines through in "Echoes at Midnight." It crafts authentic dialogue that immerses readers in interpersonal conflict while revealing their circumstances in the beautiful setting of the north woods lake country.  In Angela Grey and Paige Peterson's murder mystery Echoes at Midnight, a serial killer had made a comeback. To terrorize those living in the state park, small towns, and rural areas, the victims were killed with an axe, and their body parts were distributed around. The killer's style resembled that of the killings from the previous year; had the suitcase killer returned, or was there a copycat? After everything they had gone through in the last year, Leah and Jake, the children of the previous serial killer's victims, were still having difficulties. Detective Bentley's way of questioning Leah and Jake was to show them the graphic crime scene pictures since he suspected them of being involved in their parents' deaths. Detective Bentley was certain that Leah and Jake were once more implicated after the resurgence of killings.  Angela Grey and Paige Peterson's Echoes at Midnight offers thrilling suspense as a serial killer wreaks devastation once more. The chapters switched between Jake, Leah, and their friend in a convoluted but captivating plot. I could not stop reading after turning the first page since there were so many twists and turns; I never knew what would come next. Leah and Jake were complex characters who were still attempting to piece their lives back together after losing their parents. Before the shocking revelation, I was certain of the killer's identity. I am still in disbelief at what transpired; it was a major shock. The story was expertly written, making it ideal for readers looking for an exciting adventure full of suspense and peril.—Reviewed by Alma Boucher for Readers' Favorite  When Iris's ex-husband is dismembered and his body parts scattered around town, the Suitcase Serial Killer is back! Or is it a copycat with a different M.O.? After Iris bemoans that worse people are deserving of such a fate, a kill list is born—straight from her mouth to the ears of the serial killer. Now, the killer is on a spree, leaving a slew of dismembered bodies across the countryside, all evidence pointing to Iris and her friends. The police are on their trail, and as distrust mounts between the group, Iris, her daughter, Maeve, her best friend, Leah, and Leah's brother, Jake, must team up to find the killer before he strikes closer to home. Echoes at Midnight; Echoes in the North Country book two, co-authored by Angela Grey and Paige Anderson, is an enthralling cozy murder mystery.  Echoes at Midnight is an awesome murder mystery that I devoured in less than a day. Although this is the second book in the series, it features most of the same characters from the first one, but it contains no spoilers and can be read independently. The alternating perspectives heighten tension, suspicion, and suspense as everyone is a suspect with a seemingly adequate motive. Authors Angela Grey and Paige Anderson have crafted an intriguing mystery that readers will love to follow, piecing together clues while being thrown off by each character's thoughts and suspicions. Alongside great storytelling and fast-paced action, readers will appreciate the detailed architecture and scenery.
