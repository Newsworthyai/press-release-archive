# Donniece Gooden, Esq. is now offering DUI representation

WASHINGTON, DC, December 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For first-time DUI offenders the District of Columbia has diversion programs aimed at helping those charged with driving under the influence to avoid criminal records.  Under DC law, a DUI can be charged when a driver has a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of .07 percent or higher and has displayed signs of impairment based on field sobriety tests and driving behavior. Recognizing the significant impact a DUI conviction can have on an individual's life – including difficulties in employment, education, and personal relationships – these new diversion programs provide viable pathways for first-time offenders to address their behavior without a lasting criminal record.  As a second time offender your maximum possible jail sentence increases from 180 days of jail up to a one-year maximum jail sentence. The minimum penalty increases from zero days in jail for a first offense up to a mandatory minimum of 10 days of jail. Second DUI's within 15 years could result in fines of $1,000 to $2,500. As a third time offender a person is eligible for a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 days of jail time if convicted and a possible maximum sentence of one year of jail time if convicted. The fines range from $2,500 at a minimum up to $10,000 at a maximum.   It is very important to have a competent attorney that will work hard for you.
