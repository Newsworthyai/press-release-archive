# State Agencies and Private Sector Join Forces with BrightKey to Combat Fentanyl in Correctional Facilities

CHICAGO, IL, December 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This political collaboration has become a vital initiative in protecting both inmates and correctional staff, creating a safer environment in facilities where fentanyl exposure has increasingly posed a deadly threat.  BrightKey's cutting-edge mail screening program uses advanced detection techniques to intercept fentanyl and other illicit substances before they enter correctional facilities. This political initiative not only mitigates the immediate risks associated with dangerous drug exposure but also addresses a growing public concern around safety within the justice system.  This partnership aligns with recent legislative efforts, such as the Interdiction of Fentanyl at Federal Prisons Act introduced by Senators Bob Casey and John Cornyn, which seeks to curb the flow of fentanyl into prisons and protect officers from hazardous exposure. The bipartisan nature of this proposed legislation and the increasing number of related lawsuits reflect a broader political commitment to addressing the fentanyl crisis—a commitment that BrightKey's program actively supports.  As public awareness around the dangers of fentanyl grows, BrightKey's collaboration with state agencies showcases the power of state and private sector partnerships in combating this crisis. Introducing effective screening measures is a proactive response to public and political demands for safer correctional facilities. By intercepting dangerous substances before they enter, BrightKey and its partners not only set a new standard for safety and accountability within the justice system but also mitigate the risk of potential lawsuits stemming from fentanyl-related incidents.  Highlights of the Partnership: •	Advanced Screening and Detection: BrightKey's mail screening technology is specifically designed to detect trace amounts of fentanyl, providing a robust solution for intercepting time. •	Enhanced Safety for Staff and Inmates: By reducing the risk of drug exposure, the initiative supports a healthier and more secure environment within correctional facilities. •	Public Confidence and Legislative Alignment: This partnership echoes the intent behind current legislative proposals, enhancing public confidence in the safety measures taken by correctional institutions.  BrightKey's commitment to tackling this issue underscores its dedication to supporting public safety and aligns with the evolving political landscape surrounding fentanyl regulation. As the national conversation around fentanyl in correctional facilities intensifies, BrightKey stands ready to be an essential partner in this critical race to protect correctional staff and inmates alike.
