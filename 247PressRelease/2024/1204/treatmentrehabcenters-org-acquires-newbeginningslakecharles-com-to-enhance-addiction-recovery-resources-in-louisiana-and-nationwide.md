# TreatmentRehabCenters.org Acquires NewBeginningsLakeCharles.com to Enhance Addiction Recovery Resources in Louisiana and Nationwide

BOSTON, MA, December 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TreatmentRehabCenters.org, a leading advocacy organization for addiction and behavioral health treatment, has announced the acquisition of NewBeginningsLakeCharles.com, a key step in its mission to provide a comprehensive, fully vetted directory of top-rated addiction and dual diagnosis treatment programs in Louisiana and across the United States.  A Legacy of Compassionate Care  New Beginnings at Lake Charles has long been a cornerstone of addiction treatment in Louisiana, recognized for its evidence-based therapies and compassionate support for individuals facing substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health challenges. While the physical facility has closed, its legacy endures.  Through the acquisition of its domain, TreatmentRehabCenters.org aims to preserve this trusted resource and continue connecting Louisiana residents with high-quality recovery options. The platform will serve as a portal to local treatment centers and national resources, helping individuals and families navigate their recovery journey.  Commitment to Accessibility and Quality  "Acquiring New Beginnings Lake Charles former domain represents more than growth for our organization—it's a reaffirmation of our commitment to expanding access to trustworthy and effective care," said Jeffrey Slemmer, CEO and co-founder of TreatmentRehabCenters.org.  The organization is currently applying for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, further solidifying its dedication to being an unbiased, altruistic resource. Slemmer added, "Our goal is to honor the legacy of New Beginnings while ensuring individuals and families across Louisiana and the Southeast can access the help they need, whether through local resources or specialized care elsewhere."  A Fully Vetted Network  What sets TreatmentRehabCenters.org apart is its rigorous vetting process for treatment centers. Facilities listed in its directory must meet stringent standards, including accreditation, evidence-based practices, and proven patient outcomes. This ensures that each resource provides the highest quality care for those facing addiction and mental health challenges.  For Louisiana, where access to effective addiction treatment can be limited, this curated directory offers a lifeline. By partnering with centers that accept most insurance plans, including Medicaid and private insurance, the organization removes financial barriers that often prevent people from seeking help.  Addressing the Addiction Crisis in Louisiana  The acquisition of NewBeginningsLakeCharles.com is particularly significant in Louisiana, a state deeply affected by the opioid crisis and gaps in mental health services. By transforming the domain into a comprehensive resource hub, TreatmentRehabCenters.org aims to bridge these gaps and guide individuals toward recovery.  "Recovery isn't one-size-fits-all," Slemmer emphasized. "Our directory offers tailored options, whether someone prefers to stay local or seeks specialized care out of state. The most important thing is that they find the support they need."  A Vision for Making a National Impact  The acquisition is part of a broader initiative to expand TreatmentRehabCenters.org's reach. The organization is actively building partnerships with healthcare providers, community groups, and policymakers to enhance access to behavioral healthcare nationwide.  By combining its comprehensive directory with advocacy efforts, TreatmentRehabCenters.org is shaping a future where proven, quality addiction and mental health care are accessible to all.  Honoring a Legacy, Building a Brighter Future  "New Beginnings at Lake Charles profoundly impacted the lives of so many," Slemmer concluded. "We're proud to carry forward that legacy by ensuring individuals in Louisiana and beyond can find the care and resources they need to achieve lasting recovery."  With this acquisition, TreatmentRehabCenters.org is not just preserving the memory of a respected treatment center—it is creating new opportunities for hope and healing for those affected by addiction and mental health challenges across the United States.
