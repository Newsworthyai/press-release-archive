# Global Joint Statement Condemns Cancellation of Venue for International Religious Event in South Korea

NEW YORK, NY, December 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On November 27th, prominent figures, including religious leaders, delivered a joint statement to the South Korean government condemning the cancellation of a venue rental as an act of biased religious oppression. Signed by 402 organizations, 758 religious representatives, and 977 individuals, the statement emphasized the psychological and financial impact of the venue cancellation.  On October 30th, a religious leaders forum and graduation ceremony were set to take place in Paju, South Korea. The event was expected to draw over 30,000 participants from 78 countries, including 1,000 religious leaders. The Gyeonggi Tourism Organization canceled the venue rental on the morning of the event. It has been argued that the cancellation constitutes a violation of religious freedom and human rights.  The joint protest statement calls for an official apology and requests for the government to take disciplinary action against the officials involved. Over 88 global leaders sent documents and protest letters demanding appropriate measures be taken to address the venue cancellation.  Since November 15th, religious leaders and Shincheonji Church of Jesus members have held rallies condemning the venue cancellation and urging the government to take steps to prevent its reoccurrence.  Timeline of Events Leading to the Venue Cancellation • July 22: Notification of approval for the venue rental. • October 2: Full payment of the rental fee. • October 16: Working-level meeting held to discuss the event's size, arrangements, safety plans, and special effects. The GTO reviewed all details and completed a safety inspection. While Paju City was designated a danger zone due to potential North Korean provocations, officials assured organizers that this designation would not impact the event. • October 23 & 28: Officials confirmed twice that "there are no plans to cancel the rental." • October 28: A rally was hosted by 'SUGICHONG,' a Christian council, urging the cancellation of the venue rental. • October 29: Gyeonggi Province Governor unilaterally notified about the cancellation, citing security concerns related to the activities of a North Korean defector group.
