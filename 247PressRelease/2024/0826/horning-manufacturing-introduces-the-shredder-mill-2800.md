# Horning Manufacturing Introduces the Shredder Mill 2800

NEW HOLLAND, PA, August 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Horning Manufacturing, a manufacturer of quality agricultural equipment, has unveiled its most efficient corn processing solution yet—the Shredder Mill 2800.   The Shredder Mill 2800 combines milling and bagging processes into a single machine. This eliminates the need for separate pieces of equipment as well as the challenges of keeping them in constant alignment.  An upgrade to Horning's popular 340 model, the 2800 allows farmers to process and bag high-moisture corn faster than ever before—up to 2,300 bushels an hour. "With tractors getting bigger, farmers needed milling equipment that could keep up with demand," says Leon Horning.   The 2800 is PTO-driven but has its own hydraulic and braking system, simplifying connections and reducing load on the tractor. The machine's 300-horsepower, easy-access belt system drives the fuel-saving, on-demand hydraulic pump. Integral disc brakes make for consistent, tightly packed bags.   Thanks to the updated intake hopper, operators will experience less spillage when transferring from trucks or wagons. In addition, the auger can now be used on either the left or right side of the machine, making unloading a breeze.  Special features include a sample inspection drawer, one-man hoop changes, single-wrench roll adjustments, and an easy access cleanout compartment. An optional inoculation system is also available.  With agriculture constantly evolving, Horning's new shredder mill aims to simplify harvest while meeting higher volume needs. It is the first of their 2800 series—blower and auger-out models are coming soon.
