Grown on the company's family-owned farm in Illinois, the hemp used in all 1935 CBD products is naturally farmed, free from harmful chemicals or pesticides.

The roll-on format offers a cooling sensation that complements the Full-Spectrum CBD, making it a must-have for athletes and active individuals.  Complementing the roll-on is the 1935 Icy Relief CBD Cream, a non-greasy formula that combines Full-Spectrum CBD with cooling menthol for effective muscle and joint relief. Ideal for post-workout recovery or daily use, this cream absorbs quickly into the skin, providing long-lasting comfort.  The 1935 Icy Relief CBD Stick rounds out the new line as a portable, on-the-go option for quick and targeted relief. This CBD Muscle Stick is perfect for those seeking an easy-to-apply solution without the mess often associated with creams.
