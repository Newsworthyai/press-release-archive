# Loc it Up by Moni Now Accepting Appointments at the Salon and Spa Galleria Sublett in Arlington, Texas

ARLINGTON, TX, July 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Latrece Ward started braiding hair at the tender age of nine, and now she's not only made a career out of it, she has her own shop. Ward operates Loc it Up by Moni, which recently opened its doors in Arlington's Salon and Spa Galleria Sublett.  "Throughout my life, I've always had a passion for healthy hair," Ward said. "One thing led to another, and now I'm lucky enough to be doing what I love for a living."  Ward attended Expertise Beauty College in Nevada, and has been working in the industry since 2015. Now, with almost 10 years of experience under her belt, she takes great pride in providing a warm, welcoming atmosphere, and knowing that her clients recognize her as one of the best locticians.  "My customers love that my braids are clean and neat, and they like the fact that I'm able to offer detailed information about their hair while I'm working on it," Ward said. "That means the world to me, especially since I'm passionate about providing them with top-quality service," she added.  And that bit of extra effort pays off, according to Ward, who believes it's essential to find out exactly what her clients are looking for when they walk through the door of her salon.  "It's very important to me to take the time to listen to my customers," Ward said. "I want to understand their wants and values, and I want them to be able to trust that my responses will always be honest and respectful."  Loc it Up by Moni is currently accepting new customers.
