# Lone Star Injury Attorneys Launch Liberty Lyfts Free Rides Initiative for Safe Fourth of July Celebrations

SUGAR LAND, TX, July 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lone Star Injury Attorneys announced the launch of the Liberty Lyfts, offering free Lyft ride passes nationally for the Fourth of July. This program promotes road safety and prevents drinking and driving during the holiday.  Independence Day sadly marks one of the deadliest days of the year for drinking and driving incidents. According to recent statistics from 2018 to 2022, 545 lives were lost due to drunk driving accidents on this day alone. By offering free ride-share passes, the law firm hopes to provide a safe and convenient option for people to travel to and from their celebrations.  "This program is exactly what our founding fathers envisioned when signing the Declaration of Independence - independence from the dangers of driving a motor vehicle on the road while intoxicated," said Max Paderewski, Trial Attorney of Lone Star Injury Attorneys. "We hope this program lets people safely enjoy American activities, like watching fireworks or eating 60+ hot dogs within ten minutes. God bless this country."  The Liberty Lyft initiative provides $10 Lyft ride passes, available through a simple sign-up on the Lone Star Injury Attorneys event page. This offer is part of their ongoing efforts to support community safety, building on the success of their previous Shamrock Shuttles initiative for St. Patrick's Day. Each is worth $10 and is limited to one per person.  To participate, individuals must register by filling out the form on the event page by July 3rd before closing at noon. Winners will be notified via text message on the same day and can use the passes from July 4th until 2 AM on July 5th.   Lone Star Injury Attorneys encourages the community to act quickly to secure their ride passes and celebrate the Fourth of July responsibly.
