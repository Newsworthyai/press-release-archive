WILMINGTON, NC, July 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today the Internet has made it possible for any organization to extend their reach across the globe. Doing that however is not the same as attaining world-class status. Becoming a world-class organization requires much more, in the form of an unwavering commitment to a set of standards of excellence. Top motivational speaker and bestselling author Rocky Romanella, in a recently published newsletter article titled "How Do We Become A World-Class Organization?" presented a sharply detailed guide to understanding and implementing those principles. In that article he said in part:  Through our organizational culture is how we become a world-class organization. It is through disciplined people with disciplined thought creating our world-class organization through disciplined action. Let's talk about these areas in more detail.  1. Disciplined People  A) Level of Professionalism We use only acceptable language when we engage with our people, customers, and vendors. We do not tolerate off-color jokes and inappropriate comments. Disparaging comments have no place in our organization. We are consummate professionals.  B) We Are a Learning Organization We are constantly working on our business acumen, people skills, and communication skills. We understand the value of learning in all functional areas of our business. We understand finance as the language of business and use it to effectively monitor and improve business performance. We know how to utilize a Balanced Business Scorecard to augment financial planning. We work to become experts in all aspects of business planning, and we lead our management teams in highly effective planning protocols.  C) Investment in Self-Development We insist that relevant learning takes place at every level. We have a developmental leadership model defined and successfully implemented, and a developmental strategy and process for everyone. Our leadership team knows how to motivate and inspire high-potential individuals and act as a leadership role model, mentor, and coach.  D) Self-Accountability Owner Understands and "owns" goals. Plans to achieve measurable results and holds themselves accountable to Business Plan requirements. They demonstrate they know and understand their role in the organization's success.  2. Disciplined Thought  A) Collaborative Team Building Establishes a climate where team collaboration and effectiveness flourish. Establishes constructive and solid interpersonal relationships and treats others with courtesy, tact, and respect. Works effectively with others, regardless of organizational level, background, gender, race, or ethnicity, and works to resolve disagreements, attempting to persuade others and reach agreements. Finally, supports group decisions when group decisions are appropriate; leads and facilitates team interaction and maintains focus on group goals.  B) Integrity in All We Do Does what is right for customers, people, shareholders, and stakeholders; role models consistency between their words and actions; lives their word; establishes open, candid, trusting, respectful relationships at all levels; treats all people inside and outside fairly; makes decisions that are effective rather than politically correct.  C) Forward-Looking Is a visionary thinker with a vision for the business and business units. Maintains a long-term, big-picture view while dealing effectively with the short-term business challenges. Quickly identifies obstacles and opportunities; stimulates breakthrough ideas from the best talent; fosters innovative solutions, resulting in new effective business strategies.  D) Detailed Succession Planning Empowers employees by giving them the authority to get things accomplished in the most efficient and timely manner. Provides candid and helpful performance feedback to direct reports on a regular basis, both formally and informally. Ensures that performance feedback is an integral part of every supervisor's/manager's daily job responsibility. Insists that leaders accept developing subordinates as a major job requirement and has created a history of developing written succession plans and mobilizing company resources to support the plan.  E) Constructively Dissatisfied Is open to constructive criticism from a 360-degree perspective: boss, subordinates, and peers. Deals effectively with ambiguity and learns from success and failure.  F) Customer-Based Focus on Developing Solutions Works effectively with both internal and external customers. Knows how to gather and analyze customer data to discover business opportunities, continuously improve customer value, cement customer retention, and develop competitive advantage. Understands how to utilize customer relationships to identify high-potential business opportunities and create innovative products/services that create first-mover advantage.  3. Disciplined Action  A) Balanced Leadership Manages from a balanced leadership approach, ensuring that the three key constituents—customers, people, and shareholders—are represented in all decisions.  B) Consistent and Timely Communications Across the Enterprise Creates and communicates a client-driven vision, corporately aligned and engaging with all employees in pursuit of a common goal. Embraces the mission, values, and company ethics in all we do.  C) Compensation and Benefits Distributes rewards fairly: ensuring that pay, recognition, and other rewards are distributed in a fair manner, with clear guidelines and enforcement of those guidelines.  D) Promotion from Within Developing people from inside for potential opportunities is all part of a well-defined succession planning process. It starts with the selection and retention of an excellent workforce within an environment that values diversity and respects individuality. It promotes continuous learning and the development of self and others to achieve maximum potential. Through open and authentic feedback, the promotion-from-within process can flourish.  E) Engineer Solutions to Improve Overall Business Has developed excellent intuitive problem-solving insight supported by proven problem-solving methodology. Has an impressive, documented history of correctly diagnosing complex business problems and creating solutions that deliver acceptable outcomes. Leads others to adopt highly effective problem-solving processes.  F) Celebrate Success Creates recognition programs that positively affect the behavior of others and motivate them to achieve personal satisfaction and high performance through a sense of purpose and cooperation  With this understanding of how culture is the foundation of a world-class organization, we will also create organizational agility. We will know, respect, and leverage the company culture and assets. It will allow us to lead integrated change within a business and/or business unit to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.
