FAIRFAX, VA, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bixal, a leader in human-centered solutions, and Athena Infonomics, a leader in global development consultancy, are proud to announce the formation of Aṭala (pronounced "AH-tul"), a strategic joint venture that combines decades of expertise in monitoring, evaluation, and facilitating adaptive management with cutting-edge digital solutions including AI, knowledge management, data engineering, and programming. Aṭala is poised to transform how development organizations like USAID (the United States Agency for International Development) leverage data to facilitate adaptive management and help advance global change.   What is Aṭala?   Aṭala is a Sanskrit word embodying integrity, intellectual honesty, and objectivity—values that are foundational to this new joint venture. Bringing extensive monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) experience to a range of clients, Aṭala benefits from robust exchange between its experts. The JV is a uniquely positioned entity, bringing together Athena's deep-rooted experience in best-in-class research, data, and technology solutions in the Global South with Bixal's global leadership and expertise as a digital innovation and advanced data solutions provider. This combination allows Aṭala to provide customized, culturally specific approaches that ensure the success of USAID programs across diverse global contexts.   "Aṭala represents the best of both organizations, offering a compelling blend of data-driven insights and contextually aware solutions," said Carla Briceno, CEO of Bixal. "We're excited to help USAID and other global partners achieve meaningful, sustainable impact through this partnership."   A Comprehensive Suite of Services for Global Development   Aṭala's core services focus on monitoring, evaluation, collaboration, learning, and adapting (MECLA). These offerings ensure that USAID and other development partners have access to actionable insights that span the spectrum of real-time and rigorous solutions, all designed to guide program design and management. Aṭala's team of experts utilizes user-centered design to incorporate cutting-edge technologies—such as mobile data collection, and AI-guided modeling—along with time-tested techniques such as adult-centered learning approaches, utilization-focused evaluation, and monitoring systems tailored to programming contexts. As a strategic joint venture, Aṭala's experts approach their work with a deep commitment to fostering collaboration and learning across contexts in all that they do.   "At Athena, we believe that true impact comes from understanding and addressing the local context," said Michael Minkoff, director of business development at Athena Infonomics.
