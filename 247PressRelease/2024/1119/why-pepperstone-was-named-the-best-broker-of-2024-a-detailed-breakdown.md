VALLETTA, MALTA, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pepperstone is the Best Broker of 2024, according to InvestingGuide. The leading authority in financial service reviews reviewed more than 20 brokers to announce this result in its review.  This reviewing exercise focused on the user rather than the products offered or the best promotions. InvestingGuide experts were more interested in the user's perspective. They concentrate on what traders look for, including ease of use, innovative tools, remarkable customer service, and more.  InvestingGuide praised Pepperstone for its excellent services, thus naming it the best broker of 2024.   How InvestingGuide Evaluates Brokers InvestingGuide's evaluation process is one of the most thorough in the industry. Its experts conduct assiduous research, including practically trading on the platform. They also gather user feedback from third-party review sites like Google Play, the App Store, and Trustpilot. The exercise is entirely centered on the user's perspective to recognize top brokers without bias.  Simply put, Pepperstone was named the Best Broker of 2024 by InvestingGuide.co.uk expert reviewers. Thadeus Geodfrey and Claire Maumo personally tested the platform and provided in-depth feedback on usability, security, asset availability, and more.   Key Features of Pepperstone That Led to Its Success Pepperstone credits its success to several standout features for traders, including:  - Advanced Trading Platforms With Pepperstone, you get sophistication without sacrificing simplicity. The broker offers MT4, MT5, TradingView, and cTrader platforms. These platforms provide powerful analytical tools and automation while supporting ease of use. There is also Pepperstone's proprietary WebTrader platform with quality tools, including customizable and public watchlists.  - Competitive Pricing Brokers profit from spreads and commissions, but these eat on traders' profits. The lower these low spreads and commissions are, the better. Pepperstone understands this and is known to offer very low spreads and commissions. Such a transparent pricing model has been a critical factor in attracting traders seeking value for their money.  - Fast Execution Speed The speed at which traders execute makes or breaks a trading experience. You should seize every opportunity that comes your way without hesitation. At the same time, act swiftly to mitigate any potential losses. Pepperstone's low-latency servers are to thank for their excellent performance in this area.   Note: While Pepperstone features quality trading resources, using them does not guarantee successful trades. 75.1% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading spread bets and CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you understand how spread bets and CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.  Innovative Trading Tools Pepperstone provides innovative trading tools to help traders make informed decisions. They include:  - Smart Trader Tools Pepperstone's Smart Trader Tools suite includes over 20 plugins that offer deeper insights into market movements. These include sophisticated charting tools and automated trade execution strategies.  - VPS for Pro Traders Pepperstone offers free Virtual Private Server (VPS) solutions for professional traders. This feature makes it easier for users to enjoy sophisticated trading strategies and fast trade execution speed.

It also has CySEC license from Cyprus, DFSA in Dubai, BaFin from Germany, CMA from Kenya, and SCB from Bahamas.  The UK's FCA has some of the most stringent guidelines, offering traders a safe and secure environment for trading activities.  - Client Fund Protection One of Pepperstone's priorities is the safety of client funds.
