# David Blackwell Law Offers Grants for Coaches and Teachers to Get Equipment and Supplies

LANCASTER, SC, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As tomorrow's leaders, youth are a vital part of our future. Everyone benefits when they have the resources they need to succeed. That's why the personal injury law firm of David Blackwell Law started its Justice4Kids program.   The initiative works to get youth what they need on the field and in the classroom by awarding grants to coaches and teachers. They can use the money to obtain sports equipment, school supplies, uniforms, and anything else that will allow their athletes and students to reach their full potential.   The team at David Blackwell Law doesn't stop with helping their clients get the compensation they need to recover after an accident. They believe Justice4Kids is a critical program, as it's a way to support their community and inspire youth to do the same. Because teachers and coaches are one of the biggest influences on kids, they are in the perfect position to help nurture their growth.   Being active and participating in sports can improve children's self-esteem, build character, and teach them to work as a team. Coaches are a key part of that development, both on and off the field. On the other hand, teachers provide kids with the fundamental knowledge they need to take with them throughout their lives. These adults may also work with at-risk youth on a daily basis and know what they need to perform well and stay on a good path.  Unfortunately, not all schools have the money to give their students and athletes important resources. By providing the funds coaches and teachers need, the firm hopes to help youth grow their passion for sports, school, and other positive activities. They're trying to keep kids thriving in the classroom and off the sidelines so they have every opportunity to succeed.  David Blackwell Law learned these facts through personal experience. The firm founder and principal, David Blackwell, has been a coach for community sports for many years. His wife has been a part of the local education system, and Dana Stogner, their legal assistant, has a daughter who's a teacher.   The firm invites coaches and athletic directors from local sports leagues and youth organizations, as well as area school teachers, to reach out to them to be considered for the Justice4Kids program.
