# Fort Worth Design District Showcases Designs by Local Artist

FORT WORTH, TX, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christopher Sandoval's (@chag.draws) painted murals are not just beautiful; they're thought-provoking. And now, visitors to the Fort Worth Design District can enjoy them while strolling through the district.  According to Fort Worth Design District Marketing Manager Jennifer Brook, the murals are the latest in a series of artwork designed to enhance the experience of visitors to the district.  "I'm delighted about these pieces," Brook said. "With their striking colors and relatable themes, they're bound to catch your eye. They really are a splendid addition to the body of work we've assembled here."  Featuring a yellow hoodie and rose, the Beauty and the Beast mural was inspired by Sandoval's recent first-ever trip to DisneyWorld, which is now his favorite place, he said.  "This work represents a person's love for the story," he said. "But they never really know if they will ever get to be a part of that story," Sandoval added.   Sandoval's second work honors Dia de los Muertes, a multi-day holiday honoring friends and family members who have died. Widely observed in Mexico, the event gives celebrants a chance to remember ancestors and loved ones. It's not solely focused on the dead; it is also common to give gifts such as candy sugar skulls to friends, and to write lighthearted, mock epitaphs dedicated to living acquaintances.  "I created this mural to celebrate our loved ones who are no longer with us on Earth," Sandoval said. "It's a way of saying we will always remember you and tell your stories. We are our ancestors' wildest dreams," he added.  The Fort Worth Design District is a business enclave that was established for creative entrepreneurs in fashion, design, architecture, technology, and other fields that prize both design and aesthetics. Comprising about 40 acres, the Fort Worth Design District includes retail shop spaces; studios and workshops; showrooms; light industrial spaces for makers, distributors and manufacturers; and office suites.  "The thing that makes the Fort Worth Design District unique is that it offers alternatives to traditional space for lease," Brook said.   Also located in the district is the Golden Triangle Dog Park, which features a specific area for small dogs and a separate section for large dogs. The Snap and Share Art Walk is located in the district and is an interactive art walk that welcomes visitors to become part of the photo and encourages them to share it on social media.  "Our leasing options are well-suited for creative entrepreneurs in the Fort Worth area," Brook said. "Whether it's a shop, warehouse, office space or loft, we have it all at an affordable price. We've got the fun, funky workspace that will inspire your best work," she added.  Surrounded by newer homes and mixed-use commercial property, the Fort Worth Design District is a fast-growing area with attractive demographics. Alliance Airport is just north of the district, with many appealing restaurants nearby for a business lunch, dinner, or happy hour with the team. Part of the district was once a working horse farm. The barn has been renovated and is now open for businesses that want modern space with a rustic feel.  About Fort Worth Design District Located just north of the Fort Worth city limits, the Fort Worth Design District is situated south of Alliance at the I-135 Golden Triangle exit. The district includes three business parks: Box Office Warehouse Suites, Paddock Place Office Suites, and the Golden Triangle Business Park.
