# MARTIANS INVADING ON NOV 19TH! NEW BOOK RELEASE TELLS NIGHT OF TERROR FROM WAR OF THE WORLDS BROADCAST

CHICAGO, IL, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the last few years the revisionist history of the War of the Worlds broadcast paints a picture of few people believing that martians had landed and point to newspapers wanting revenge on the new medium of radio as the reason the story was exaggerated. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dead Air the Night Orson Welles Terrifed America by National Bestelling Author William Elliott Hazelgrove is being released today and debunks this revisionism. The Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weely and Booklist have all given rave reviews to the new interpretation of the famed Halloween broadcast when Orson Welles put on his radio show and terrified America.   Hazelgrove based his research on newspapers. Thousands of newspapers. "The latest take is that lesss than a million people heard the broadcast which is not true. Anywhere from six to twelve million people heard it but the real story is what happend across America that night. " From the articles a picture of terror emerges. Heart attacks. Suicides. People runniing out of restaurants, theatress, broken arms, accidents, pandemonium. "People literally ran for the hills and refused to come back even when they were told it was only a broadcast," Hazelgrove continued. "The news stories tell the tale with coast to coast headlines. CBS had 126 affiliates that spread this broadcast across the nation."   Jittery from breaking news bulletins from impending war in Europe and trusting the new medium of radio from the Fireside Chats of Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, people had no reason to doubt that Orson Welles broadcast using a breaking news bulletin format was anything but real. "Even if people didnt hear the broadcast, panic and terror feeds on itself at a point with the story becoming more fantastic."   Dead Air the Night Orson Welles Terrified America will be released in hardcover on November 19th by Rowman and Littlefield. The Martians will finally get the respect they deserve.  William Elliott Hazelgrove is the national bestselling author of ten novels and thirteen narrative nonfiction titles. His books have received starred reviews in Publisher's Weekly, Kirkus, and Booklist and have been optioned for movies. He was the Ernest Hemingway Writer in Residence where he wrote in the attic of Ernest Hemingway's birthplace. He has written articles and reviews for USA Today, The Smithsonian Magazine, and other publications and has been featured on NPR All Things. The New York Times, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, CSPAN, and USA Today have all covered his books with features. Learn more at www.williamhazelgrove.com.
