AUSTIN, TX, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Massage therapy is really an industry phrase to describe massage, but when done correctly, massage therapy really is about so much more. It is about body wellness. It is about body care awareness. And, lastly, and most importantly, it is about self love."  Hill Country Salon Suites is proud to welcome Spa Studio as their newest tenant. Hill Country co-owner, Melanie Scharton, talks about the perfect marriage of Hill Country and Spa Studio:  "Spa Studio is the only massage therapy business currently operating at Hill Country Salon Suites, and that is great news for both of us. Vivian finds herself in an advantageous position with the only massage therapy suite in our complex, and only a golf-cart ride away from Sun City, the absolute best target audience in all of Georgetown for her services. Sun City residents are always on the lookout for beauty and wellness services. This is a marriage made in heaven, and we are so excited to have Vivian a part of our Hill Country family."

What you can expect Vivian explains her approach to massage this way:  "I now have ten years of experience but, early on during my training/education, I realized that massage therapy is only a part of the whole. Finding body wellness is about fusing body care with internal happiness. Being physically fit serves no purpose if there is no peace of mind. For true wellness, the mind AND body need to be massaged.  "I work with both the body and mind, combining the deep tissue therapeutic approach with the traditional Thai approach to massage, and the combination of the two releases barriers many of my clients did not even know existed."
