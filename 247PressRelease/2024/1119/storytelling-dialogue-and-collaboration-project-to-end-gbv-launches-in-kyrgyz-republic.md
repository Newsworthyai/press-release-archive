# Storytelling, dialogue and collaboration project to end GBV, launches in Kyrgyz Republic

NEW YORK, NY, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Footage Foundation's PowerTools program will support efforts to address gender-based violence.   The U.S. Embassy Public Diplomacy Programs in Kyrgyzstan support initiatives like PowerTools to combat gender-based violence (GBV) through awareness campaigns, policy advocacy, and community mobilization. This aligns with U.S. foreign policy goals in Kyrgyzstan by promoting accountable governance, stability, and countering transnational threats such as human trafficking. By equipping stakeholders working to prevent GBV and address gender disparities in economic participation, this initiative highlights the strength of U.S.-Kyrgyzstan cooperation.  Footage will work with a local partner, Kyrgyz El Agartuu Public Association, a civil society organization, to raise awareness about GBV through educational campaigns and by advocating for policy changes that strengthen protections for survivors, promote cross-sector collaboration, and increase funding for local support organizations. The initiative also aims to mobilize communities to challenge harmful cultural beliefs and promote accountability.  "PowerTools: Storytelling, Dialogue, and Collaboration to End GBV across the Kyrgyz Republic" seeks to identify and address gaps in current GBV prevention efforts through an initial needs assessment. The project will deliver training through facilitated events, including a webinar to share Footage's innovative GBV storytelling methods, an advocacy workshop focused on shifting cultural norms, and a Stakeholder Summit bringing together government officials and civil society organizations for policy-making dialogues. Research and findings emerging from these activities will be published in a white paper to combat GBV and advocate for a safer, more equitable Kyrgyz Republic.  Executive Director and co-founder of Footage Foundation, Dr. Kristen Ali Eglinton, said: "Addressing GBV in Kyrgyzstan is vital for creating a safer and more equitable society for all. PowerTools focuses on enhancing policy dialogue and recommending actionable solutions. Needs assessment findings will be used to inform workshops to engage stakeholders from Kyrgyz civil society and government and equip them to foster long-term solutions based on compassion and creating a safer society for all."  Commenting on the initiative, Nurzhan Tulegabylova of Kyrgyz El Agartuu Public Association said: "The project aims to foster interaction and collaboration with the Government and civil society of the Kyrgyz Republic to strengthen support for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and ensure accountability for perpetrators. The program promotes a shift in local communities' attitudes toward the issue of GBV and challenges stereotypes about survivors. We are confident that the implementation of the program will enhance our skills and strengthen our commitment to driving policy changes and providing support to people in crisis situations."  Ajay Rao, Deputy Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic, said: "Every year from November 25-December 10 we call attention to the problem of GBV around the world through 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence. The international nature of this campaign highlights how we can make progress on global challenges when we collaborate internationally and share expertise. The U.S. Embassy is eager to support PowerTools as a way to contribute American perspectives and techniques to prevent GBV in the Kyrgyz Republic."
