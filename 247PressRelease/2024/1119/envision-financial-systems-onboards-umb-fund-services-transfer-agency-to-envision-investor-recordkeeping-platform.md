# Envision Financial Systems Onboards UMB Fund Services' Transfer Agency to Envision Investor Recordkeeping Platform

COSTA MESA, CA, November 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Envision Financial Systems, a leader in investor recordkeeping technology and services, announced today the onboarding of UMB Fund Services' Transfer Agency services onto Envision's comprehensive software platform for investor recordkeeping. Working alongside each other, Envision and UMB successfully completed the conversion earlier this month. In addition to the conversion of many fund companies, UMB was able to sunset several ancillary systems it had built over the years and implement a new streamlined and efficient operating model.   "UMB Fund Services' industry leadership in registered and alternative investment fund services—including mutual funds, interval and tender-offer funds—requires continuous automation and controls to handle the ever-increasing product requirements and complexities," said Tom Wiedecker, executive vice president at Envision. "All of us at Envision are honored to be part of bringing modernization and increased ease and automation to UMB."  Uma Wilson, UMB executive vice president and chief information and product officer, said, "We're excited to replace a system that had been in place for more than 20 years. This conversion will benefit both our customers and our associates."   Envision's focus is on helping its service provider clients manage and grow their business through its flexible and open recordkeeping platform and services. "We have converted to Envision to help us automate processing, modernize our service model and position ourselves for new business opportunities," said Mike Huisman, UMB senior vice president and director of Transfer Agency.  Recently, Envision's investor recordkeeping platform was recognized by industry trade association Nicsa for eliminating manual work relating to on-system tender-offer/capital-call processing and reporting. Envision was presented with Nicsa's Industry Innovation in Technology award at its Asset & Wealth Management Summit on October 29 in Boston.
