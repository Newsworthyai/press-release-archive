LOUISVILLE, KY, May 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Attorney Sheila Hiestand is filing a medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf of her client, Savonia Esters, who suffered serious health complications and crippling pain while under care at the Restorative Pain Institute in Louisville. Nurse practitioner Matthew Elkins, employed at the clinic, was found to have stolen patients' pain medication and replaced syringes with sodium chloride.  Sheila Hiestand finds the lack of interest in patient care at an institutional level alarming. Also, Matthew Elkins stealing and replacing pain medication for months without raising suspicions or getting caught highlights a major oversight and failure in the system.  Savonia Esters is just one of the numerous victims who were exposed to unnecessary pain due to the actions of Matthew Elkins and the Restorative Pain Institute's negligence. According to an investigation by John Boel for WAVE 3, Savonia Esters recalls that during an LMPD investigation, an officer told her that she was victim number 15.
