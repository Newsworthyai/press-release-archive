# The Full Works Inc. / Commercial Kitchen Works Leases Space from RDS Real Estate

FORT WORTH, TX, May 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- RDS Real Estate is proud to welcome its newest tenant at the Golden Triangle Business Park in Fort Worth, Texas. The Full Works Inc. / Commercial Kitchen Works recently opened a branch in the business park, located at 1927 Golden Heights Rd. in North Fort Worth.  Owned by Hugh Ashburn, The Full Works Inc. / Commercial Kitchen Works has been in operation for more than 24 years in Lewisville, Texas. The new location will give Ashburn some much-needed space to expand his business. The company offers a variety of services to restaurants, including gaskets; hardware; stainless steel and aluminum fabrication and flat work; and TIG/MIG welding.  While finding a larger space was his primary focus, Ashburn was thrilled about the convenient location of the property. Golden Triangle Business Park is situated near Alliance and I-35 West at the Golden Triangle Exit. The park is readily accessible from all of North Tarrant County, including Fort Worth, Keller, Roanoke, Haslet, Trophy Club, Highway 114, and Highway 170.  Additionally, Ashburn was ecstatic to discover that to rent commercial property he didn't have to get a certificate of occupancy, as the business park is outside the Fort Worth city limits. Not only did that eliminate the time and trouble associated with the process; it provided attractive cost-saving benefits.
