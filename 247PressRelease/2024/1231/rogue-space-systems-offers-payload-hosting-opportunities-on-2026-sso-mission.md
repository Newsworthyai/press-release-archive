# Rogue Space Systems Offers Payload Hosting Opportunities on 2026 SSO Mission

LACONIA, NH, December 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rogue Space Systems Corporation is offering payload hostings on our mid 2026 SSO mission Orbital Test Platform (OTP-3), featuring an ESPA-class satellite with 40kg of extra mass budget, an orbit average power of over 80w, and a peak power of 1.2kw for commercial and R&D payloads. "There is also a possibility that we will be launching an additional sister spacecraft to perform RPOD with which will open additional payload hosting opportunities as well as enabling any payload testing that could benefit from a dual satellite mission" noted Brent Abbott, Rogue CRO.   This mission is part of our ongoing demonstration and test program, with regular flights planned every 9 months through 2027. Each mission provides opportunities to advance technology development, conduct research, or deploy capabilities in space. We offer end-to-end services, including assembly, integration, and testing (AIT), as well as mission operations support for all hosted payloads. Hosting costs vary based on size, mass, power, CONOPS, and if it supports Rogue's roadmap.   Specifics:   Rogue's OTP-3 Mission features an ESPA Sized craft under 200kg, featuring precision AOCS, as well as Rendezvous-Proximity Operations and Docking (RPOD) capability. We have around 40kg of extra mass budget, with an Orbit Average Power of over 80w and peak power of 1.2kw. Our Scalable Compute Platform (SCP) is designed for parallel edge computing, capable of handling complex algorithms in AI, image processing, autonomy, and more. Customers can host their algorithms on the SCP. The SCP will have access to all sensor data that can be used as input data for these algorithms.   There is onboard storage, and downlinking will be conducted on X band occurring approximately three to five times a day. Additionally, we will have a multispectral remote sensing instrument, alongside RPOD situational-awareness cameras and sensors. GNSS information, PPS as well as pointing metadata can be provided to payloads. In addition to precision pointing, OTP-3 will have 6DOF RCS thrusters for enhanced agility along with a targeted Delta V of more than 1 km/s. We can accommodate various field of view and thermal management needs, with flexible internal and external volume available. The bus is fully redundant and expected to have a 7-year lifespan   Rogue's vision is to lead the development of logistics infrastructure and services for the emerging space economy. Our efforts focus on enabling in-space manufacturing, recycling, and related research and development through advanced platforms, payload containerization, and robotic service vehicles.   If you're interested in taking advantage of this opportunity, have any more questions, or know any other interested parties, please contact Brent Abbott directly (below).
