MEMPHIS, TN, December 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This Kwanzaa season, Anthony "Amp" Elmore Sr., a Memphis born 5-time World Kickboxing Champion, renowned cultural ambassador, Memphis 1st Independent 35mm Theatrical filmmaker, and community activist, has taken a monumental step in bridging the gap between African American and African communities. Through his latest video, "Orange Mound Black Memphis Celebrate Kwanzaa." Elmore has captured the vibrant celebration of Kwanzaa at the Orange Mound Community Center and is connecting it with the heart of Kisumu, Kenya.  From August 25th to September 1st, 2024, Elmore invited to Kisumu Kenya as a cultural diplomat by Kisumu Governor Peter Anyang' Nyong'o. Elmore attended the FESTAC Celebration in Kisumu. Festac is the world's largest Black and African Cultural Festival. While in Kenya Elmore forged a cultural link between ARYA Primary School in Kenya and Cherokee School in Orange Mound whereas Elmore created the "African Cultural Diplomat Exchange Network."  Also, during his Kenya visit, Elmore proposed to Governor Nyong'o that Kisumu host the "Tom Mboya 70th and the First Black Family Reunion in Africa in August of 2026, This unprecedented initiative promises to celebrate and strengthen the ties between Africans and African Americans.  Kwanzaa, an African American holiday, is a time to reflect on heritage, culture, and community values. However, many African/Americans as well as Africans are unfamiliar with this celebration. Many African/Americans have never attended celebrated Kwanzaa or witnessed full celebration on T.V. Elmore's 42-minute video not only documents an official Kwanzaa festivities in Memphis but also includes heartfelt interviews and personal stories, offering a unique educational resource for those in America and Africa to view a Kwanzaa celebration.  "This video is more than just a celebration; it's a bridge between continents," said Elmore. "Africans in Kisumu and Americans in Memphis can now see and hear each other's stories, creating a mutual understanding and appreciation of our shared heritage."  In a groundbreaking move, Elmore has asked Governor Nyong'o to establish a Sister City agreement between Orange Mound and Kisumu, marking the first such connection between an African American community and an African government. This digital cultural exchange allows Orange Mound's rich history and the principles of Kwanzaa to reach both American homes and Kenyan homes via platforms like WhatsApp, making the celebration truly global.  Governor Nyong'o, the father of Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o who visit Memphis in 2019 promised to return Memphis and bring his family including Lupita Nyong'o. The video, which can be shared through YouTube and other digital formats, is a testament to the power of 21st-century technology in fostering cultural diplomacy. As Black History Month approaches, Elmore envisions a joint celebration, strengthening the bonds and adding Afro-Indigenous heritage and honoring the legacy of Kenyan figures like Tom Mboya whereas without a Tom Mboya there never would have been African/American 1st Black President Barack Obama.  "We are practicing 'African Cultural Diplomacy' and bringing international recognition to Orange Mound," whereas Elmore noted "Orange Mound is the Birthplace of African Cultural Diplomacy." "This effort not only honors our ancestors but also paves the way for future generations to appreciate and celebrate their dual heritage."
