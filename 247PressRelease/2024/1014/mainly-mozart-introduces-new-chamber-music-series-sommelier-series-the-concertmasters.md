# Mainly Mozart Introduces New Chamber Music Series: "Sommelier Series: The Concertmasters"

SAN DIEGO, CA, October 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mainly Mozart – the San Diego nonprofit behind the highly acclaimed, annual Mainly Mozart All-Star Orchestra Festival – has announced an exciting new chamber music series, Sommelier Series: The Concertmasters, launching Fall 2024. Three intimate concerts, Nov. 17, Jan 11 and Feb 8, will take place at Fairbanks Ranch Country Club and feature concertmasters from the Philadelphia Orchestra, Dallas Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic, paired with top sommeliers who have chosen wines inspired by each concert's program. Tickets are on sale now for all three concerts in the series at www.mainlymozart.org/wine.  Chef Claudia Sandoval, "MasterChef" winner and judge, who is also the Culinary Director and Executive Producer for Mainly Mozart's "Culinary Concerto" Gala, is coordinating the sommeliers and wineries for the new series. Each concert will begin with an hour-long wine and appetizer reception at 6pm followed by a discussion with the sommelier, hosted by Chef Sandoval, preceding an intermission-free concert at 7pm. Wine will be poured between musical selections, and sommeliers and musicians will illustrate the connection of the wine to the pieces being performed.  "We used the inspiration of March's Culinary Concerto gala which paired world-class music with fine wine and fare, in creating the Sommelier Series," said Nancy Laturno, Mainly Mozart co-founder and CEO. "There's such a rich history and depth of feeling that exists with classical music. It is a uniquely emotive art form and we believe that this will be a sensory experience that you'll never forget."
