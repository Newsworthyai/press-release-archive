# Kit Harington Quips About His MCU Role in 'Eternals': "If Marvel Calls, You Gotta Do It"

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In 2021, Harington made his MCU debut as Dane Whitman in Eternals, a character initially teased as a significant new addition to the franchise. The post-credits scene hinted at a future as Black Knight, setting up a connection with the upcoming Blade movie. However, plans for a sequel to Eternals have since been shelved amid box-office disappointment and ongoing creative issues surrounding Blade—a development that has stirred its own share of controversy.  Despite the uncertain future of his MCU character, Harington remains candid about his brief foray into the Marvel universe. In a recent interview with GQ, he remarked, "I'm not gonna pretend I took that role because it was different and interesting. If Marvel calls, you gotta do it." The actor's remarks highlight a common sentiment among stars approached by Marvel—when the call comes, it's hard to say no, even if the project doesn't seem particularly unique.  The Blade reboot has been shrouded in development turmoil, keeping many details secret while the project underwent multiple creative overhauls. Initially announced in 2019 with Mahershala Ali cast as the lead, the film has faced significant delays, including the exits of director Yann Demange and several screenwriters. As of now, Eric Pearson (The Fantastic Four, Black Widow) is the latest writer attached to the project, but whether Harington's Black Knight will feature remains unclear.  Harington's reluctance to fully re-engage with blockbuster franchises extends to Game of Thrones, where he famously portrayed Jon Snow. He revealed that while HBO approached him about a Jon Snow spinoff, he ultimately left after years of development, citing concerns over the lack of a compelling story. "It was HBO that came to me and said, 'Would you consider this?' My first reaction was no," Harington shared. "We spent a couple of years back and forth developing it. And it just didn't… nothing got us excited enough." Even Casey Bloys, HBO's CEO, couldn't convince Harington to return to the role that made him a household name, partly due to the emotional baggage of revisiting Jon Snow.  "There's a lot of baggage that goes with playing Jon Snow," Harington added. "In some ways, you need to divorce completely from this previous thing… The role will always be such a significant factor in my life, but staying attached to it makes it hard to be seen as anything else."  For now, Harington is choosing to focus on other projects, leaving behind both the MCU and Game of Thrones. Whether the actor's secret departure from these franchises leads to renewed interest in future appearances remains to be seen. However, some fans have expressed frustration over fake speculation and tweets that have surfaced online, with some even bordering on harassing Harington about his decisions.  As he carves out a new path away from the blockbuster giants that launched his career, only time will tell if Harington chooses to revisit these worlds or continues seeking different roles.
