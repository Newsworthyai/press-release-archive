WASHINGTON, DC, October 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TCOM, LP, a global leader in airborne persistent surveillance and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) solutions, is thrilled to announce its participation in the 2024 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting & Exposition, running from October 14-17, 2024, in Washington, D.C. at Booth number 446.  At AUSA 2024, TCOM is unveiling its latest multi-layered ISR solutions under the theme "From Surface to the Stratosphere and Beyond." This innovative approach integrates TCOM's tethered aerostats, tethered unmanned aerial systems (Te-UAS), Aerostar's high-altitude balloons (HABs), and tethered drones, offering unprecedented operational coverage across various altitudes, from ground level to the stratosphere.  "Our participation at AUSA 2024 underscores TCOM's commitment to advancing ISR technologies that enhance situational awareness in any environment," said Nigel Sutton, TCOM's Vice President for Business Development. Sutton stated, "Our layered, integrated solutions ensure persistent, cost-effective surveillance that meets the evolving needs of military and homeland security operations globally."  Key highlights of TCOM's capabilities to be showcased at AUSA include:  1. Aerostats: Providing 30+ days of continuous ISR coverage, TCOM's aerostats offer elevated situational awareness and long-range sensing for military and homeland security missions. 2. Te-UAS: Combining the flexibility of drones with the endurance of aerostats, these tethered systems deliver persistent, real-time ISR across various environments. 3. Aerostar HABs: Operating at altitudes of up to 65,000 feet, these platforms deliver strategic ISR for up to 90 days, providing coverage in denied or hostile environments. 4. Tethered Drones: Equipped for rapid deployment, these drones deliver tactical ISR, complementing TCOM's aerostats and HABs by offering quick-response surveillance in dynamic, on-the-ground missions.  TCOM's ISR platforms are designed to be both scalable and cost-effective. They offer significant advantages over traditional manned aircraft, providing continuous coverage at a fraction of the cost and greater resilience in high-threat environments. The systems are currently deployed in critical regions, including U.S. border security, air and missile defense in Europe, and strategic locations in the Indo-Pacific.
