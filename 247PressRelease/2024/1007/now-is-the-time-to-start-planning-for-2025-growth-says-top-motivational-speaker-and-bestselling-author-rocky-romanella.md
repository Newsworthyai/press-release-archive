# Now Is The Time To Start Planning For 2025 Growth Says Top Motivational Speaker And Bestselling Author Rocky Romanella

WILMINGTON, NC, October 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As leaders, we understand we must at some point mentally turn the page and begin to prepare to take advantage of new growth opportunities. It is better that this happens sooner than later, especially in regard to planning for a new year. Top motivational speaker and bestselling author Rocky Romanella believes that planning for 2025 growth should begin now. He addressed this important topic in a recent newsletter article titled "Autumn Winds: Turn The Page". In that article he wrote in part:  As we turn the page in our calendar and start October, there are many autumn, fall, and harvest songs you can add to your playlist as a reminder of the time of the year. For me, "October Road" by James Taylor, "September" by Earth, Wind, & Fire, and "Harvest Time" by Luke Bryan are a few that are at the top of my list.  As leaders, each season represents a change. It's a reminder for us to stop and evaluate where we are, where we are in relation to our plan, and more importantly, where we are going. The difference with this time of the year is the balance we will need to strike as we assess our Business Health and Results. If we are off plan, we will need to consistently deliver positive short-term results to end the year on plan. If we are on plan or over plan, we must maintain that momentum going into the new year.  It's also time to evaluate from a growth perspective. Did we identify and successfully generate new product, market, and geographic growth opportunities? Especially if that was a strategic part of the plan for the current year. If it was not, do we need to add it to the upcoming plan?  This time of the year adds the complexity of balance. Balance in finishing the year strong tactically as we begin to build the 2025 plan strategically. You will need to exhibit seasoned judgment, and you will be tested to make good strategic choices. You will need to know when and how to emphasize and balance the company's short-term end-of-year results with the long-term strategic objectives you will be building.  It will be necessary to apply broad knowledge and experience when dealing with this complex issue. Your communications strategy and goals must be clear, and your decisions timely.  The Balanced Leadership approach, as outlined in the book 'Tighten The Lug Nuts', will serve as the foundational piece of building the plan and strategy and executing your short-term end-of-year results. You achieve balance when you thoughtfully consider all three constituents in your decision-making process: your customers, your people, and your shareowners and/or stakeholders.  Ideally, as you implement and execute the Balanced Leadership approach, you will see the following come to life and become a way of life within the organization. Your people will begin to:  Think like a customer by approaching each challenge as a true solutions provider. Feel like a valuable employee by knowing their work matters and they are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and they will never compromise on safety. Act like an owner by understanding the business and their role in what leads to success.  Some questions to answer as you begin the planning process with an eye to the future and an understanding of where you have been and where you are now:  - Are we creating and communicating a client-driven vision, corporately aligned, and engaging with all employees in pursuit of a common goal? Do we embrace the mission, values, and company ethics in all we do?  - Do our people believe, and have we demonstrated we are developing people from inside our organization for potential opportunities? Do we have a well-defined succession planning process that starts with the selection and retention of an excellent workforce within an environment that values diversity and respects individuality?  - Are we a continuous learning organization exhibiting the development of self and others to achieve maximum potential? Does it happen through open and authentic feedback, which allows the promotion from within policy to flourish?  - As leaders, do we positively affect the behavior of others and motivate them to achieve personal satisfaction and high performance through a sense of purpose and cooperation?  - Does our plan help us to utilize our teams intentionally and appropriately to focus leaders on building an enterprise that creates profit and generates business with the ultimate objective of delivering an attractive return on shareholder investment through the best, the brightest, most informed, and best people in the industry?  - By including this thought, skill, and vision, we aim to develop leaders who can "see around corners" to anticipate changes in market conditions and proactively position the company for future competitive advantage.
