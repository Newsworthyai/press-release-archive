# Jason McDonald Consulting Announces Expanded Expert Witness Services for Complex Digital Advertising Cases

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jason McDonald Consulting, a top-rated expert witness consultancy working in online advertising, SEO, and social media, is excited to announce new and updated content concerning expert witness services for lawyers in litigation involving digital advertising. As digital marketing expands in both dollar volume and complexity, online advertising platforms like Google Ads, META, and YouTube have created both opportunities and threats for businesses. Among the threats are complex litigation concerning trademarks, defamation, and employee/employer relations.  Jason McDonald, director of Jason McDonald Consulting, said, "As the complexity of online advertising grows, so does the need for fact-based, straightforward expert analysis supporting legal cases. Today, attorneys require an expert witness who not only understands these platforms from a technical perspective but can succinctly break down the facts in a way that judges, juries, and legal professionals alike can understand."  An example of the newly released content can be found at https://www.jasonmcdonald.org/blog/2024/09/the-critical-importance-of-a-digital-advertising-expert-in-legal-cases/. That content explains as follows. Digital advertisements consist of complex algorithms and data points, from click-through rates to conversion metrics that, while fact-based, can be difficult for the average judge or juror to understand. For example, platforms such as Google Ads use complex systems for ad placement, targeting and pricing. Having an expert witness on hand to make sense of the technical complexities can be what attorneys need in litigation.  The expert witness studies complex data, identifies trends, and disentangles complex online advertising strategies that might have played a role in the litigation. For instance, in cases of suspected trademark infringement or deceptive advertising, the expert witness analyzes ad content, targeting strategies and performance statistics to determine if the allegations are indeed valid. Dr. McDonald helps legal teams decipher platform-specific regulations and distill those facts into an easy-to-understand, yet evidence based analysis.  Interpreting the platform-specific rules is key for lawyers who handle digital advertising cases. As the new content explains, part of McDonald's job as an expert witness is deciphering technical rules, plus the jargon related to digital ad strategies like bid management and retargeting. This clarity is important for cases in which clear characterizations of advertising practices will make a difference.  Evidence summarization in support of cases is a key component of Dr. McDonald's services. He assembles data pertaining to ad impressions, clicks, and consumer engagement into a clear story that bolsters the arguments of a legal team. His ability to analyze and communicate technical data in layman terms makes sure every aspect of a digital ad case is represented in court, thereby providing the perfect assistance when the explanatory power of the facts is limited by their complexity.  Due to the complexity of digital advertising, attorneys must engage an informed expert witness. Beyond just peeling back the layers of complicated ad strategies, Dr. McDonald's services provide context among ever-changing facts that can be a game changer in legal environments. The way he combines technical knowledge with easily digestible summaries is priceless â€“ it allows attorneys to present solid, fact-based analyses as a basis for case strategy and direction.
