# Learn And Play® Montessori School Announces Fall Enrollment for Daycare and Preschool at Newly Opened Sunnyvale Campus

SUNNYVALE, CA, October 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Learn And Play® Montessori School, a top-rated early childhood education provider in the Bay Area, is proud to announce Fall enrollment opportunities in daycare and preschool at its newly opened Sunnyvale campus. As spaces for enrollment continue to fill, parents are encouraged to sign up for a tour and book a waitlist spot if needed. The new campus combines the best of Montessori and STEM education in a balance that enables young children to naturally develop skills for learning — habits and skills they will carry with them into the future.  Kiran Grewal, Co-Founder of Learn And Play® Montessori said, "Early education is incredibly important; we couldn't be more excited at the response to our Sunnyvale campus. As our expansion continues, we're focusing on daycare and preschool opportunities that still have slots available as we move into late Fall. We are reminding parents to act quickly as space can fill fast."  Here is background information. The daycare program provides a safe and stimulating space for children, as young as 18 months old, at the Sunnyvale campus (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/sunnyvale/). This Montessori curriculum offers children a hands-on learning universe to explore and create confidence in themselves as well as boost their social and emotional skills. The program offers and uses age-appropriate STEM activities, providing children with a stimulating introduction to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). This methodology helps kids learn to solve real world problems in exciting and interactive ways. Daycare (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/daycare/) taught in this way validates the fact that early childhood education is a critical educational advantage; it's never too early to learn in age-appropriate ways.  At the Sunnyvale campus, preschool (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/preschool/) is a step further into learning. Children are given the opportunity to explore their natural curiosities through a well-structured curriculum that involves language, math, sensorial activities, practical life skills and cultural studies. Other subjects taught within the program include a second language, visual arts and movement arts in addition to academic work which together cover all developmental needs. The program combines Montessori education with STEM learning to gear children up for kindergarten and give them the tools they need to become tomorrow's problem-solvers and innovators.  The "news" however is the rapidly filling school and the limited space available for Fall 2024. Space is limited so parents are urged to book a tour of the Sunnyvale campus and find out more about its Montessori and STEM programs.
