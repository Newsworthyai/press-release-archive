NEW YORK, NY, October 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As an architecture photographer, Nicole England found that the shoots she enjoyed the most were the ones where dogs were present - nothing lightens the mood like a nonchalant pup.

The photographs showcase incredible, amazing architecture and capture the personality of the idiosyncratic personality of each canine.
