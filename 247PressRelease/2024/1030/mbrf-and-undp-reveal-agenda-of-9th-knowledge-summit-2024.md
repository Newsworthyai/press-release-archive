In line with this, every year it convenes experts and specialists from different fields to exchange innovative solutions that will support efforts to attain sustainable development at all levels. At present, the summit reflects our relentless efforts to stay updated with Dubai's plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) in all sectors to support digital transformation and keep pace with global technological changes to ensure maximum readiness for the future. As a result, this year's summit will focus on the most significant challenges societies have been facing, including the development of human skills and the role of the AI economy in determining the direction of different industries."
