# Applewood Auto Care Acquired by Relay Hill Auto

LAKEWOOD, CO, November 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Applewood Automotive was recently acquired by Relay Hill Auto, a Denver-based locally operated automotive repair enterprise. The shop was founded in 1989 in the Applewood neighborhood of Lakewood, Colorado and moved a few years later to its present day location at the corner of 6th Avenue and Garrison. Steve Halliday founded the business and continued managing it successfully for 35 years. He passed the reigns to Relay Hill Auto, led by Shiju Thomas. The business now operates under the name Applewood Auto Care.  For decades, the business maintained an "old school" local repair shop feel that served the neighboring community. This attribute aligns with the Relay Hill Auto mission of building community in the neighborhoods it serves and within its' shops. Steve was adored by residents and customers due to his honesty and excellence in service. That tradition will be preserved for years to come under Relay Hill Auto. Mr. Halliday commented on the transaction, "I am so glad the shop gets to continue in good hands and serve this amazing community!"  The Relay Hill team found this opportunity especially attractive due to the characteristics of the real estate. The property purchase occurred in parallel to the business acquisition. The shop operates at an intersection with a daily traffic count into the thousands and the lot has room for additional development to expand service capacity. Mr. Thomas states, "Operating an extraordinary people-centered business requires excellent facilities, industry-leading professionals, and a commitment to integrity in all aspects of operations." He further shares, "The automotive industry is changing and we aim to be pioneers in merging an advanced technical trade with service and care more often expected in the hospitality industry."  The Relay Hill Auto enterprise consists of numerous reputable brands across Colorado. The group operates seven businesses and five automotive repair shops in Denver, Westminster, Lakewood, and Arvada. Likewise, the enterprise maintains commercial real estate in each of those geographies. Some of the brands include Advanced Transmission Center, Arvada Square Auto, and Hotchkiss Auto Repair. Relay Hill is a compassionate, purpose-driven organization prioritizing people over profits; customers and employees serve as the foundation of the organization's mission.
