# Janelle Parkton's Educational Coloring Books Launched on Amazon

ORLANDO, FL, November 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Florida-based author Janelle Parkton has officially launched her acclaimed series of educational coloring books on Amazon.com, achieving immediate success. Known for her innovative approach to children's literature, Parkton has created multiple series that seamlessly blend creativity with learning, captivating both young readers and adults.  Her extensive series collection, "Color and Learn with Janelle", features series such as Animals (more than 200 books), Sports (over 25 books), History (more than 60 books), Vehicles (more than 100 books), Architecture (over 30 books), and Professions (over 50 books). Each book contains 50 detailed images to color and 50 engaging and intriguing facts related to the book's theme. The Animals series stands out as the largest single collection of coloring books for children dedicated to animals, including titles on unique creatures like Komodo dragons and Tasmanian devils.   What sets Parkton's books apart is the inclusion of these captivating curiosities on the back of each coloring page. Unlike typical coloring books with blank backs to prevent ink bleed-through, she utilizes this space to provide scientific, historical, or cultural facts related to the book's theme. For instance, in "50 Kittens Coloring Pages", children can color adorable kittens while simultaneously accessing intriguing facts about various cat species, their habitats, behaviors, and roles in different cultures and ecosystems. The engaging trivia is written in an accessible manner, designed to inspire curiosity, further exploration, and discussions among children and adults.  The series covers a wide array of topics, from the animal kingdom to space exploration, ancient civilizations, and the professional world. The realistic images not only captivate children but also appeal to adults and seniors who have a passion for coloring. Parkton's innovative approach transforms a simple coloring activity into an enriching educational journey, making her books a valuable addition to homes and classrooms alike.
