# New Choices, High Value For Nova Homebuyers at University Park in Palm Desert

PALM DESERT, CA, November 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For home shoppers considering the California desert, Nova at University Park is a highly desirable choice for diverse and changing households. Among these are Rose and Dan Arguin, who moved to Palm Desert from San Diego to be closer to their adult children. We love living here," said Rose simply. "We love the house, the area and our neighbors, and we will never move."  High style at attainable price—Nova features distinctive architecture with enriched detailing, upscale interiors; and builder-included extras at prices that begin in the high $600,000s. Plan sizes range from 2,328 to 2,751 square feet and provide 4 to 5 bedrooms and 3.5 to 4.5 bathrooms. All homes also include a 2-car garage.  ADUs increase design versatility—Nova designs are ideal as a permanent residence or as a winter home with lock-and-leave ease, and new ADU layouts provide additional flexibility. Empty nesters, first-time buyers, seniors and multi-gen households are among Nova's most recent shoppers.   Self-contained layouts of the new ADU designs provide sleeping and living space, a bathroom and wardrobe, washer/dryer space and a compact kitchen. A separate entry further privatizes these homes, optimizing an ADU for income potential, or as independent space for parents, live-in help or long-term guests. Also available are plans with a casita, or a downstairs bedroom/full bath.  "Our ADU shoppers and buyers are looking for design that answers lifestyle questions now, and over time," said Todd Cunningham, WPG President. "Examples include homeowners whose parents—or adult children—want to come to Palm Desert for extended visits in the winter. We are also seeing young buyers who want extra income to help with the mortgage, and the potential for higher resale value is attractive to all.  "These new ADU layouts offer an amazing array of choices, so the best bet is to come to our model center, tour an ADU model home, and ask WPG Community Counselor Chad Ross your questions," added Cunningham. "Chad can also direct you to the opportunities WPG offers at Verve and Esprit at University Park."   Indoor/outdoor connectivity makes desert alluring in every Nova home, with great room layouts, through-plan views, and private side courts. Sleek kitchens are ideal for entertaining and for everyday pleasure. Secluded primary suites with spa baths and walk-in wardrobes strengthen Nova's luxurious design quality.   Premium Lifestyle—Nova residents can enjoy their new home in a well-situated Palm Desert locale. University Park is near the 10 Freeway, with the intersection of Gerald Ford Drive and Portola Road offering easy access to WPG's neighborhoods.   Key Destinations—Area work centers within easy reach include Eisenhower Medical Center, a draw for buyers employed here or those seeking ready access to renowned medical services. For family buyers, strong schools are another plus. The Desert Sands Unified School District and Palm Springs Unified serve University Park with quality schools for K-12.   Abundant retail and dining choices are also convenient, and so are hiking trails and other recreational options. Signature destinations include El Paseo Shopping District and the new Acrisure Arena, which hosts sports and entertainment events.   Close To Home—Leisure fun is close at hand at The Grove, the master plan's amenity center. The Grove features a resort pool, a lap pool and a kiddie pool, plus gathering rooms, kitchen and an indoor fitness center. A shaded playground, pickleball court, a stage area, lawn areas for events and games, a firepit and a BBQ area add more enticing venues.   Residents of University Park residents will also find choices at nearby parks. These include a dog park and a park with covered play area, basketball court and lawn.
