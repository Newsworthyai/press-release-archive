# Violation of Religious Freedom and Intolerance Ignites Global Backlash

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, November 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On October 29th, an administrative decision by a South Korean government agency ignited an international outcry, raising issues around religious freedom and leading to considerable financial repercussions.  The "Religious Leaders Forum and Graduation Ceremony," organized jointly by two major religious groups, was originally scheduled to take place in Paju, South Korea, with an anticipated turnout of over 30,000 attendees from 78 countries. The gathering included 1,000 religious leaders representing faiths such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism.  Despite prior confirmations, the Gyeonggi Tourism Organization, affiliated with Gyeonggi Province, suddenly canceled the venue rental agreement without advance notice. Organizers claim this decision has inflicted severe financial harm and argue it represents an unconstitutional act of discrimination against a specific religious group, thereby infringing on religious freedom, human rights, and due legal process.  The organizing bodies, the Association for Buddhist National Unification of Korea and the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, reported that they received official assurances on October 23rd and 28th that the event would proceed as planned. They assert that this abrupt, unilateral cancellation unfairly targets their group. They also emphasize that other events scheduled on the same day were allowed to continue, suggesting that external opposition influenced this administrative decision and that it violates the principle of church-state separation as enshrined in the Constitution.  The Gyeonggi Tourism Organization cited security concerns, referencing recent North Korean activities and a planned protest by a North Korean defector group. However, other activities, such as a civilian bike tour and visits by international tourists to the DMZ, were permitted within the same area.  This incident has renewed global discussions on religious freedom and tolerance in South Korea. The U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report has previously noted concerns over the treatment of Shincheonji Church of Jesus and the government's reluctance to approve the construction of a mosque.  Both the Association for Buddhist National Unification of Korea and the Shincheonji Church of Jesus are calling on the South Korean government to uphold religious freedom and human rights, demanding a reversal of the decision. They also appeal to international organizations to closely monitor the situation and advocate for the protection of religious freedoms.
