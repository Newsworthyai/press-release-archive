# Award-Winning Spy Thriller Expands Into Feature Film at 9 Lives Entertainment

LOS ANGELES, CA,, November 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 9 Lives Entertainment is proud to announce the development of a feature-length adaptation of its acclaimed short film Bonding. With scriptwriting underway, the feature builds on the original's emotional depth, intrigue, and suspense, promising to captivate audiences with an expanded narrative exploring themes of legacy, identity, and espionage.  Since its premiere at the Academy Award-qualifying St Kilda Film Festival in June 2023, Bonding has earned over 70 awards and 70 nominations, including screenings at BAFTA and Canadian Screen Award qualifying events. Olivia Balington of Indy Reviews remarked, "The ten minutes of narrative could easily be placed within a Hollywood blockbuster, leaving audiences longing to join Dr. John on the next phase of his journey."  The adaptation will follow Dr. John Flemington, a CIA clinical/forensic psychologist, as he unravels the mystery of his estranged father's identityâ€”none other than James Bond. His journey uncovers dangerous secrets involving espionage, interstellar communication, and the Gateway Process, a real-world CIA operation developed with the Monroe Institute to explore consciousness beyond the physical world.  "We're excited to continue Bonding's journey with a feature-length film," said Steven Lancaster, Executive Producer at 9 Lives Entertainment. "This is a unique opportunity to expand on the rich world we've created, and we are actively seeking partners to help bring this vision to life."  The short film has been recognized for excellence across all areas of production, winning Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Original Music, and more. It also earned the Outstanding Proof of Concept Award at the Pitch to Screen Film Festival in New York City.  Further updates will follow as the project develops.  Established in the summer of 2022, 9 Lives Entertainment stands committed to crafting top-tier cinematic shorts and proof-of-concept projects for feature films and TV series. Our debut production, "Bonding," marks the company's first fully financed and produced short film, rooted in the heart of Los Angeles, California. Spearheaded by Founder/CEO Luke Rex, Psy.D., and Executive Producer Steven Lancaster, our venture began its festival journey with a momentous World Premiere at the Academy Award Qualifying St Kilda Film Festival in June 2023, followed by a U.S. Premiere at the Academy Award/BAFTA/Canadian Screen Award Qualifying LA Shorts International Film Festival in July 2023. Our Welsh premiere took place at the BAFTA Award Qualifying Carmarthen Bay Film Festival in May, 2024. British Urban Film Festival (BUFF), a BAFTA Qualifying festival, and Toronto Nollywood International Festival (Canadian Screen Award Qualifying) both screened Bonding in 2024.
