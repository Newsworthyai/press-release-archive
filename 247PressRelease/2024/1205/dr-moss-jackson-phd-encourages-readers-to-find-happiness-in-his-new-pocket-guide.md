With a focus on simplicity, the book is designed as a "tickler guide," offering bite-sized reflections that stimulate the imagination and provoke new ways of thinking. It offers readers practical footholds to combat anxiety and explore the joy of living.  The author's unique style blends his extensive background in clinical psychology with an engaging, conversational tone, ensuring that readers feel both empowered and understood. Dr. Jackson, a clinical psychologist since 1973, continues his legacy of guiding individuals and organizations toward fulfilling their true potential.  Dr. Jackson has spent over four decades helping individuals and families overcome mental and emotional challenges. His passion for psychology extends beyond the therapy room—he also consults with businesses, offering insights on how psychological well-being can foster success in the workplace. Dr. Jackson believes in the power of belief to provoke change and champions the idea that we all have the potential to become "Life Provocateurs," constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible.  With You Deserve To Be Happy, Dr. Jackson adds yet another valuable resource to his body of work, continuing to help readers cultivate happiness, manage anxiety, and move through life with purpose and satisfaction.
