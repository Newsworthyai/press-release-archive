# Burhani Engineers and Swisscontact PropelA Partner to Empower Kenya's Youth with Skilled Training

NAIROBI, KENYA, December 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers Ltd., one of the leading engineering companies in Kenya, has entered into a groundbreaking partnership with Swisscontact through their PropelA apprenticeship program. This collaboration marks a significant step forward in addressing the critical need for skilled labour in the plumbing and electrical sectors, while also tackling the challenge of youth unemployment in Kenya.  Swisscontact, a renowned organisation with a global presence, aims to bridge the skills gap among young people through innovative training solutions. The PropelA program is designed as a dual apprenticeship model, offering students both classroom-based theoretical knowledge and practical, hands-on work experience. The initiative is particularly focused on developing a workforce that meets industry demands, thereby fostering sustainable economic growth in Kenya and beyond.  Addressing Skills and Unemployment Gaps  In Kenya, there is a substantial gap between the skills available in the labour market and those required by industries such as plumbing and electrical engineering. The PropelA apprenticeship program seeks to close this gap by equipping young Kenyans with the skills necessary to secure employment in these growing fields.  Swisscontact has partnered with Don Bosco Boys Town Technical Institute in Karen, Nairobi, to implement the PropelA program. This collaboration focuses on providing technical training to students, preparing them to enter the workforce with the essential skills needed to succeed in the plumbing and electrical sectors. One of the unique features of the program is its emphasis on practical learning, where students get to apply their acquired knowledge in real-world scenarios, thus ensuring they are work-ready upon graduation.  Burhani Engineers' Role in Talent Development  As part of its commitment to nurturing local talent, Burhani Engineers has joined hands with Swisscontact to support the PropelA program by offering students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a professional setting. Obed Bosire, a talented young student, is currently enrolled in the PropelA program and has been placed at Burhani Engineers to complete the practical component of his apprenticeship. Obed's journey is an excellent example of how the program is making a difference in the lives of young people.  At Burhani Engineers, Obed is applying the knowledge and skills he has gained through his training at Don Bosco Boys Town Technical Institute. Under the guidance of Burhani Engineers' experienced engineers and technicians, he is gaining valuable work experience that will help him build a strong portfolio in the field of engineering. This real-world exposure is crucial in helping young professionals like Obed develop the confidence and technical acumen necessary for a successful career in the industry.  In addition to gaining technical skills, apprentices in the program, like Obed, benefit financially from a stipend offered by Burhani Engineers during their time at the company. This stipend provides them with the means to support themselves while they continue their training and begin building their careers. For Obed, this financial support, combined with the skills he is acquiring, represents a stepping stone toward financial independence and long-term career success.  Building a Skilled Workforce for the Future  This partnership between Burhani Engineers and Swisscontact through the PropelA program is a model for how the private sector can collaborate with educational institutions to address the skills shortage in key sectors of the economy. By providing practical training and employment opportunities to young Kenyans, Burhani Engineers is playing an essential role in creating a pipeline of skilled professionals who are equipped to meet the demands of the engineering industry.  Regarded as one of the best engineering firms in Kenya, Burhani Engineers is dedicated to excellence and innovation in the engineering industry.
