# Weekly Intermittent Fasting Can Increase The Length of Your Telomeres, Test Results From Greg Lindberg's 6-Year Study Show

TAMPA, FL, December 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Greg Lindberg has released results of a 6 year study that shows conclusively that a long-term program of intermittent fasting – including regular weekly water-only fasts of over 90 hours combined with rigorous daily physical and mental exercises – can dramatically increase the length of your telomeres.  "This is my gift to the world – Only Eat On Weekends™ and you will get younger," Lindberg said. "This simple program is free and available to everyone," Lindberg said.  Lindberg said that his 6 years of test data "suggests that the Hayflick limit is wrong -- our cells do not have a built-in and predetermined lifespan." The Hayflick limit was proposed as the number of times your cells will divide before division stops and the cell dies. This limit was based on the fact that our telomeres – the end caps to the DNA – get shorter the more times the cell divides.  Each time a cell divides, the telomeres on the ends of each chromosome shorten slightly. Cell division will cease once telomeres shorten to a critical length. Hayflick interpreted his discovery to be aging at the cellular level. The aging of cell populations appears to correlate with the overall physical aging of an organism.   "Increasing your telomere length is the holy grail of anti-aging," said Lindberg. "And you can increase your telomere length simply by following an Only Eat On Weekends ™ program – 4 simple words to stop aging," Lindberg said. "Rigorous daily exercise, rigorous mental exertion, robust social interaction, and a carefully planned and balanced diet during your feast period are also critical elements to this anti-aging program," Lindberg said.  Numerous studies have shown that telomere length progressively shortens with age, which eventually leads to aging, age-related diseases and early death.   "Over a 6-year period, from April of 2018 to July of 2024, my telomeres increased in length from 7.01 kb to 10.46 kb. This increase took my telomere length from that of an average 60 year-old to that of an average an 18 year-old," Lindberg said. Lindberg's telomere results over this 6-year period were measured by SpectraCell Laboratories in Houston, Texas.  "My average telomere length increased by almost 50 percent. Before starting fasting, I was in the 39th percentile for telomere length. Today, my numbers have increased to the 99th percentile," Lindberg said.  "What's most extraordinary about this increase in telomere length is that this 6-year period was an extraordinarily stressful time for me: a divorce battle, indictments, numerous legal battles, and 633 days in a federal prison. Despite all of that, the Only Eat On Weekends ™ program that I followed resulted in longer telomeres – and a younger and more healthy body," Lindberg said.  Lindberg said numerous scientific studies show a link between telomere length and lifespan. A recent research study from Dr. Masood Shammas, a lead scientist from Harvard (Dana-Farber) Cancer Institute in Boston Massachusetts, shows that the rate of telomere shortening may indicate the pace of aging. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, bad nutrition and lack of physical activity can also affect the telomere length. The study adds that dietary restrictions, appropriate diet and regular exercise can help decrease the rate of telomere shortening, reducing the risk of disease and pace of aging.   In 2011, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reported that "Our results provide the strongest evidence available of the relationship between telomere length and lifespan and emphasize the importance of understanding factors that determine early life telomere length."  "My data shows that telomeres can get longer with regular fasting," said Lindberg. "The Hayflick limit is wrong. If you replenish your telomeres with a program of fasting and exercise, they can get longer. There is no built-in lifespan for your cells," Lindberg said.  Lindberg does a water-only fast four days per week, and only eats on weekends. During his fast, he exercises one to two hours per day. Lindberg said exercising while fasting can be particularly hard, but it's extremely important as it helps burn up the glucose in the system and convert the body to a triglyceride metabolism.   Lindberg also said that strenuous mental exertion – while exercising if possible – is also critical to the Only Eat On Weekends™ program. "Strenuous mental exertion drives the regeneration of the brain and helps your brain get younger," Lindberg said. Lindberg said he listens to science and engineering audiobooks at 2x speed while working out to help stimulate neurogenesis.  "Only Eat on Weekends™ -- This is my simple, four-word prescription that can help people live healthier and stay younger," said Lindberg. "This may not be conventional, but it works and it's free. A simple routine change can help prevent diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases that come with old age."  Lindberg's life-changing results from fasting has driven him to offer the fasting program to people through his wellness brand called Lifelong Labs. Lifelong Labs provides quick, simple and convenient ways to implement regimen like fasting and exercise into day-to-day routine to help people live younger longer and healthier.
