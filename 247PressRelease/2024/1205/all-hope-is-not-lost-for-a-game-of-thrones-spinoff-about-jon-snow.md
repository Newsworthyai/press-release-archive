# All Hope Is Not Lost for a Game of Thrones Spinoff About Jon Snow

LOS ANGELES, CA, December 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- However, Bloys left the door open for a potential return to the project in the future. "Maybe we'll try again," Bloys said during a press preview event for HBO and Max's upcoming 2025 slate. While he didn't provide a detailed update on what factors might revive the spinoff, his remarks echoed earlier statements from Kit Harington. In April, the actor told ScreenRant that the series was "off the table because we all couldn't find the right story to tell that we were all excited about enough. So, we decided to lay down tools with it for the time being."  Harington also acknowledged the possibility of revisiting the idea, adding, "There may be a time in the future where we return to it, but at the moment, no. It's firmly on the shelf."  Meanwhile, HBO has seen continued success with its Game of Thrones franchise. House of the Dragon delivered strong viewership for its second season, which was recently released to critical acclaim. Additionally, the upcoming series A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is currently in production. The new show, which follows Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, promises a lighter tone than its predecessors.  "So far those are the only ones that we felt could go the distance," Bloys said Thursday. "I mean, practically speaking, you don't want to overdo anything. There's no blinking green lights on any other ones. At the moment, we take our time with them, with the development, and only do them when we can serve it."  The potential Jon Snow sequel first surfaced in June 2022, with word of the project leaking online. Following the leak, author George R.R. Martin confirmed the series had a working title—Snow—and noted that Harington brought in writers and showrunners for the project.  While fans await further updates on Game of Thrones spinoffs, HBO continues to expand its Emmy-winning lineup, including recent hits like Hacks. With an approach that values quality over quantity, the network remains focused on delivering groundbreaking storytelling for its viewers.
