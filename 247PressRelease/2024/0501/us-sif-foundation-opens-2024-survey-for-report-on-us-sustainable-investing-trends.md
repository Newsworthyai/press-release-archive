WASHINGTON, DC, May 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The US SIF Foundation announced today that the 2024 Survey for the Report on US Sustainable Investing Trends is now open. The Trends report is the most comprehensive study of sustainable investing in the United States, and the data collected will inform the 15th edition of the biennial report. This year's survey will include additional questions to gather more granular information on the sustainable investing marketplace.  The Trends report examines the sustainable investing landscape for US asset managers, asset owners and institutional investors. It also offers insights on the sustainability issues they consider. In 2022, the report identified $8.4 trillion in total US sustainable investment assets under management, which represented 13 percent of the total US assets under professional management. It also identified that climate change was the number one issue for both asset managers and asset owners.   "For the 2024 Trends Report, we expanded the survey to collect additional data so that we could more accurately map the state and trends of sustainable investing in the United States," said Jun Han, Senior Research Manager at US SIF. "With more granular data, we can draw nuanced insights on what topics are top of mind for asset managers and asset owners. Our research team aims to present a detailed and insightful report for the investors, policymakers, media and other stakeholders interested in our findings."
