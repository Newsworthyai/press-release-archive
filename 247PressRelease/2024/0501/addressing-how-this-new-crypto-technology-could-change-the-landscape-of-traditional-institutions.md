# Addressing How This New Crypto Technology Could Change the Landscape of Traditional Institutions

NEW YORK, NY, May 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The pandemic-era bull market was a massive, albeit hysterical upswing. When celebrities started endorsing meme coins and buying NFTs, crypto became a cultural phenomenon. Early adopters of Bitcoin, such as Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Barry Silbert, and Satoshi Nakamoto, could not have predicted the impact of the influxes of new crypto enthusiasts who were merely looking for vibes and fun investments. As crypto found its home in popular culture, its influence and reach expanded beyond traditional financial circles.  Market upswings are much quieter post-pandemic. Few people have noticed the increase in crypto prices, yet savvy investors have seen a notable impact on their net worth as they settle back into the routines and lifestyles of pre-pandemic. As crypto continues influencing financial markets, its role in shaping individuals' net worth cannot be underestimated.  However, plenty of indicators show that crypto is on the rebound. MetaMask is nearing an all-time high of 30 million monthly users, and Coinbase recently had its most profitable quarter in two years. According to Google Trends, Bitcoin searches are back on the rise overall. Figures like Silbert are reiterating their confidence in the crypto market's resilience, further bolstering optimism among investors.  What is contributing to the rising interest? Aside from Bitcoin halving this year, meme coins and token airdrops continue to enhance crypto's reputation as a money maker. Also, more and more companies are endorsing crypto, making many unsure investors realize that crypto is technologically significant and here to stay. This growing interest is not just in terms of investment potential but also its inherent worth and utility in various sectors.  Moreover, there is a growing sense that crypto's worst may be over as court battles continue to wrap up in its favor, particularly the FTX bankruptcy process, with full restitution returned to all former users. This positive outcome signals a turning point for the industry, providing reassurance to investors and prompting some to consider if it's time to retire concerns about crypto's stability.  Governments want to work with the industry to develop policies that protect consumers. While there's no guarantee of the future of Bitcoin and crypto, the community can redefine the mindset of potential investors and remind them that crypto is substantial and long-lasting.
