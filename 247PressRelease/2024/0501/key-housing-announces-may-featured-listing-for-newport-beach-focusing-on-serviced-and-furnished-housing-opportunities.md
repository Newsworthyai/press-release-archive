NEWPORT BEACH, CA, May 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Key Housing, a top provider of short term housing solutions in California at https://www.keyhousing.com/, is proud to announce its featured listing for May for Southern California. The designee of the coveted award is the "Park Newport" complex, located at 1 Park Newport, Newport Beach, CA 92660, USA. Each month the experts at Key Housing review apartments to locate hard-to-find housing opportunities, in this case focusing on "furnished" or "serviced" apartments, which become very popular as summer comes into view.  "Newport Beach is SoCal living at its best," says Bob Lee, spokesperson for Key Housing. "As Europeans and Brits flock to the beaches of Southern California and want to mix business with pleasure, it is hard to find 'serviced' or 'furnished' apartments. That's where our team comes in and this month's announcement."  The featured short term rental can be viewed at https://www.keyhousing.com/corporate-rental-properties/park-newport/. Here is a summary of why the complex garnered the coveted award for SoCal for May, 2024. Park Newport offers an exceptional extended stay experience, blending business with pleasure for European or British citizens bringing their families to Newport Beach, California. Situated on 55 acres of lush landscape, these serviced apartments provide breathtaking views of Newport's Back Bay, Harbor, and the Pacific Ocean. With convenient access to John Wayne International Airport (https://www.ocair.com/) and nearby attractions like Balboa Island and Corona Del Mar, Park Newport ensures a memorable stay. With spacious living areas, balconies or patios, and pet-friendly accommodations, Park Newport surpasses traditional hotel stays, providing a comfortable and inviting home away from home.  ADVANTAGES OF A SERVICED OR FURNISHED APARTMENT OVER A HOTEL  Choosing a serviced or furnished apartment over a traditional hotel offers numerous advantages, especially in a vibrant destination like Newport Beach, California. These accommodations provide a "home away from home" atmosphere, allowing guests to relax and unwind in spacious living areas, cook meals in fully equipped kitchens, and enjoy quality time with family. The problem, however, is in finding a hard-to-find unit. Many apartments only offer six- or twelve-month leases, and of course hotels are easy to find, yet expensive and hardly a home away from home. The experts at Key Housing have decades of experience in the California housing market, especially relationships with key apartment complexes that offer services such as furnished apartments. Indeed, someone looking for furnished apartments throughout the region can visit https://www.keyhousing.com/label/furnished/ or contact Key Housing for a personalized consultation.
