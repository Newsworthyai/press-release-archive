# DownTown Mystic Revealed

NEW YORK, NY, May 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music announces the release of the new Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul: Acoustic Sessions  EP by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. The EP is a companion piece to the RnR 4 The Soul album, released in late February. The Acoustic Sessions will be digitally released on May 17 and distributed worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music. The EP's focus track, Think A Little Louder (Acoustic Mix) will premiere exclusively online via Americana Highways on May 14 with the full EP dropping at Radio the next day via Stephen's Indie Picks.  The Acoustic Sessions contains 6 acoustic tracks, including 2 bonus tracks. Think A Little Louder, Soul'd Out and Dead End Space (from the RnR 4 The Soul album), and Eyes of The World, which didn't make the album but became the lead single for it, all feature some of DownTown Mystic's best vocals. Long time DTM drummer and percussion maven Steve Holley cancelled a trip to London to come down to Shorefire Studios and record caj√≥n, bongos, maracas, and his famous tambourine, (the same one used by Ringo on We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper!) featured on Eyes of The World.  DownTown Mystic recently hooked up with Milestone Publicity in Nashville to promote the Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul release. DownTown Mystic writer/producer Robert Allen credits Milestone PR head Mike Gowen with the idea for the Acoustic Sessions. Robert comments, "I do these kinds of mixes for sync-licensing, but it never occurred to me to release them until Mike mentioned it. Luckily, I have a great product manager at Sha-La to put together the release for me. lol" The result is an EP with stripped-down versions of songs that showcase the songwriting. These are different from the full album versions so listeners can compare the two. One of the rarities on the EP is the original full version of Think A Little Louder that has never been heard before.  One of the bonus tracks, Without A Trace, has been sync-licensed for the upcoming film Everything's Going to Be Great starring Bryan Cranston and Allison Janney. Robert decided to do a different take on the song and says, "Since there's a studio version in the movie, I thought this was a good chance to try out my idea." The other bonus track, Night Time Girl, was considered for the RnR 4 The Soul album but couldn't find a place to fit. Robert decided he would record an acoustic track before the final version appears on the next DownTown Mystic album, currently being recorded. Check out Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul: Acoustic Sessions.  "Think A Little Louder is a fine example and a personal favourite, easy to play on repeat just about any time of the week" Stereo Stickman  "Ever the musical chameleon, Allen never rests on his laurels, and always does exactly what he wants." JamSphere Magazine   "DownTown Mystic is taking us back to where it all started."
