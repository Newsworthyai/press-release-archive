# Anger, Hatred And Bullying Are Topics Addressed By Award Winning Author Jody Sharpe In New Youtube Series, Angel Inspiration

WILMINGTON, NC, April 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Anger, hatred and bullying have been with us for nearly as long as the human race has existed. We will never be free of them, though we can mitigate the effect they have, which will allow us to improve our relationships, judgment, and sense of peace. These types of damaging emotions thrive on ignorance, fear, and prejudice, breeding intolerance and division, and perpetuate of harm and suffering. We can, given the correct approach, begin to dismantle the foundations upon which anger, hatred and bullying thrive, and begin to nurture new states of mind, in which compassion, love and kindness appear.  These topics are addressed in bestselling author Jody Sharpe's new Youtube video series, titled "Angel Inspiration". Jody witnessed the bullying of a special needs child before she became a special education teacher. She now includes a bully character in all of her award winning, best selling books. In a recent article posted on her site, she stated in part:  I was a special education teacher for twenty-five wonderful years. When I retired I wrote my memoir, 'Special Needs Children The Angels On My Shoulder'. I'd always had a heart for children, animals, the earth and those in need. Where did it come from? As a child I remember being around nine and witnessing bullying. A little girl with special needs, who would be diagnosed as a child with Down's Syndrome today, rode her bike past school each morning. She was not allowed in regular public school in those years. Other children were laughing and calling her names and it made me hurt for her. Wondering why she wasn't in school and why they were mean to her was embedded in my heart. I knew even then I would never be mean like those kids were.  Now that I am a grandmother, and a writer, I reflect on the makeup of people in our world. Some have the hearts for others and some are the bullies of the world. Why? The bullies teach us how not to be, I know that for sure. Yet, why can't they change or can they? In our warring world today, where bullying by politicians and others is accepted as near normal, we must keep loving, keep caring and keep on. The children of the world are watching how we handle life day by day. There is a theory that those bullying adults have been bullied themselves and their jealousy and rage come from childhood experiences and the lack of love.  When I write my novels there is always a bully character who has an awakening and changes his or her ways to good in the end. This is what I pray for. This is why I write.   The full text of the piece is available at http://jodysharpe.com/tuesdays-with-the-angels-angel-inspirations-being-champions-for-our-children/.  Sharpe's message resonates with readers, offering a beacon of hope. She passionately champions the transformative influence of uplifting literature, which can provide a ray of optimism in the face of depression and anxiety. Her anti-bullying message illuminates a path towards healing and resilience. Readers will discover in her books a profound shift in perspective that will carry over into their daily lives. They serve as an invitation to view the world through a different lens, one that empowers us to find the strength within to see the good in all people.  Her most recent work, 20 Moon Road, An Angel's Tale, features a character from her Mystic Bay series, Madam Norma. Madam Norma is based on a woman who influenced Sharpe's life in a number of unforgettable ways. The book trailer is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqJxbFTE1U  Diane Donovan at Midwest Book Review stated, "Do angels come to children with special needs? In Mystic Bay, they do. As the truth emerges about the town's makeup, history, and mission, readers become immersed in a spiritual story of angels and beliefs that drive positive changes and kindness in the world and spread beyond the small town of angels.  "Sharpe's Mystic Bay series embodies hope, belief, the power of conviction and angel influences, and the acts of kindness that lead humanity on a better, gentler path. 20 Moon Road's revelations of relationships with Madame Norma that changed lives and transformed beliefs through documented angel sightings by special needs children makes for a warm tale of revelation and discovery that explores guardian angels, lasting legacies, and blessings.  "Libraries and readers looking for blends of fantasy and spiritual examination will welcome the Mystic Bay series as a whole and this latest addition in particular, which expands the nature, purposes, and insights of Mystic Bay upon the larger world outside its borders."  Mark Walker of Midwest Book Review said, "The last paragraph reflects the unique vision and mysticism, which exudes throughout this book:  As we fly away from the beach on a mission to help someone in need, I know what God and all angels know and what Madam Norma always shared. Only love can mend our hearts and our Earth. Only love can set us free. Madam Norma's life was simply made of pure love, for as she told me once, 'Kindness is the first ingredient of love.'  "I look forward to someday seeing the Mystic Bay Series on the Hallmark TV channel!"  Books by Jody Sharpe include:  To Catch an Angel - Jody is also the author of 'To Catch an Angel', written in memory of her late husband Steve. In 'To Catch an Angel', miracles happen in Mystic Bay, California, the town with the psychic and angel vibe. Angels are calling.

And with the help of the indomitable oldest psychic in town, Madam Norma, the bully meets his match through the soft voices and intuitive minds of his neighbors.  Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  Her latest book, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California. While sleeping, an angel sent her a vision in a dream of a future event. Gayle realizes she must use her intuition to save an old man from drowning. But who is this old man?
