# Joseph Ganci, Bestselling Author Of the Christian Historical Ebook David: God's Chosen Crucible, Announces No Charge Download Of The Ebook Version From April 19 Through April 23, 2024, On Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, April 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Some Christians find the Old Testament unimportant, too violent, and difficult to comprehend. Perhaps it is the ancient style of disjointed prose or the complex laws and never-ending genealogies.  Joseph Ganci points to deeper understandings and richer meanings with previously unexplored connections. He has proven it by taking all the Empire of Israel series books to bestseller status amid rave reviews.  David, God's Chosen Crucible, Book 2 in the Empire of Israel series, will be available in Ebook form at no charge from April 19 through April 23, 2024, at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Joseph-Ganci/author/B06XHZ76N9?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1712930653&sr=8-1&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true.  David is every man's man, an outlaw prophet, a man of war, and a man of God. He is a ruthless warrior, an ardent lover, a skilled musician, and a poet-philosopher. God sees in him the heart of a lion, the tenacity of a bear, and an ever-faithful man of action. God calls an unlikely and lowly shepherd boy to become the king of the Jews and the fighting prince of Israel.  David overcomes all odds by escaping every snare and evading every trap. He learns from every encounter, growing in understanding and effectiveness in the love of his Creator. He protects, defends, and enlarges the stakes of Zion, the resting place of God's chosen people. David reaches the pinnacle of all worldly success. He marries the love of his life and is the master of everything he surveys, surpassing his imagination.  Ganci emphasizes the significance of David's story within the context of Christianity, delving into his famous battle against Goliath and his marriage to Bathsheba, who would become King Solomon's mother. Ganci's masterful work portrays David as an iconic figure whose life journey is marked by divine intervention, courage, and a deep connection with God, contributing to the rich tapestry of the Christian Bible's narrative.  Readers will relish this incredible, enchanting historical fiction. They will experience the heart-pounding narrow escapes from the vengeful King Saul, be a party to the kidnapping of David's two wives and his ferocious battle against the shapeshifting Amalekites, and be present as he wins them back and, in doing so, capture a vast treasure trove of flocks, herds, and gold that helps to secure his two kingdoms. Readers will join the battle at Mount Gilboa. Witness the destruction of Saul and his sons foretold by the witch of Endor, celebrate the fall of the city of waters and the last puzzle piece needed to establish the empire of Israel, look down from the high walls of Rabbah, and learn of the required destruction of Uriah the Hittite. Then stand invited to the marriage feast of David and his soulmate Bathsheba, the future mother of King Solomon, the future monarch of Israel.  Readers and reviewers alike have praised the new book.  "Although most people are aware of the story of David and Goliath, the giant, 'David: God's Chosen Crucible' by Joseph Ganci is a brilliant retelling of all the stories about the Shepard boy who would one day become a King of Israel. Reading with all the informational value of a history textbook is deftly combined with the entertainment of an action/adventure novel." Michael J. Carson Reviewer for Midwest Book Review.  "David God's Chosen Crucible is intelligently plotted, well-researched, and expertly executed. The writing by Joseph Ganci is wonderful, and the author has the gift of filling the narrative with exciting details, describing a setting that is colorful and transports readers to biblical times." Christian Sia for Readers' Favorite.  "Joseph delivers an extremely believable story that fills the gaps smoothly and neatly packs various events into an intense, multiple-viewpoint narrative. The book also contains several lessons and messages to help believers grow in faith and knowledge about God's ways." Foluso Falaye - San Francisco book review.  Ganci takes a ground-breaking and revelatory path to bring awe-inspiring stories to life and, ultimately, to film. He believes that connecting facts is far more enchanting than loosely fitting fantasies. He works within an engaging and dramatized fiction framework that remains faithful to uphold spiritual principles while exceedingly rich in detail.  Ganci bases his work on three primary pillars: The rock-solid cornerstone is historical biblical geography. The creative arch is revelatory in its timing and issues. The research is concrete and firmly rooted in customs, languages, and traditions.  Ganci fills in the blanks with rock-solid research and prophetic revelations. It is a style that has allowed him to create breakthrough approaches that are exciting and breathtaking while remaining within the limits of sound biblical teachings.  Ganci is also the Creator of 'Incredible Bible Mysteries,' a five-part video series now available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK0Op2dYhMXtz7nh2D__keQ.  Ganci believes that Old Testament revelations are the Word of God. Simultaneously, many needful details remained buried until the information age of discovery made them prominent and visible to the naked eye. These insights create a middle ground of understanding. As a dedicated and highly motivated researcher, he proposes many undiscovered nuggets of spiritual gold in the original manuscripts. He shines a new light on ancient texts and removes the black-or-white argument of the all-or-nothing question of modern-day revelations. He is adept at untangling philosophical and theological human-made knots. He allows us to look at what some consider foregone conclusions.  Readers of his bestseller, 'Gideon: The Sound and the Glory,' will learn about the Jewish Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant, the mysterious Golden Ephod, why David found himself at battle with Goliath, and much much more. This work illuminates the dark corners of scripture while engaging readers in a gripping narrative.
