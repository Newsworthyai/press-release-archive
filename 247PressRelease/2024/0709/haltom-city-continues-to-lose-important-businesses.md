# Haltom City Continues to Lose Important Businesses

HALTOM CITY, TX, July 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a recent post on Facebook, Haltom City employee Jayson Steele reported on new businesses coming to Haltom City. In that post, he stated that Sam's Dollar Store next to Goodwill had gone out of business as had Big Lots.   He went on to report that Five and Below was coming to replace Sam's Dollar Store and WD's Discount was going to replace Big Lots and a Wingstop was coming.   In the past, stores that were reportedly coming have not materialized, but in any case, what's important to note, says Joe Palmer Communications Director for Haltom United Business Alliance, is that Haltom City has lost two large businesses replaced them with two businesses and added a third.   Palmer adds, "Of course, throughout the city, other businesses have left, and some have come, but the vacancy rate remains close to 30% and appears to be rising in the primary corridors and most of the chains have left."   HUBA believes that these older corridors in South and Central Haltom City will continue their decline until the city takes steps to repopulate these businesses, and we believe those will only be small businesses.   "The big businesses have left because of a lack of traffic and the continued decline of these areas in the south and central parts of the city," says Palmer.   Although HUBA has been asking for a plan to revitalize these portions of the city and submitted a proposed list of improvements that could be made in the cities codes to encourage new businesses the council and leadership has yet to propose any plan for the needed improvements. Palmer states, "The new council members just elected were unanimous in their applause for improvements on the north side of the city, and uniformly silent on any plans to revitalize the declining south and central areas."   In fact, the city continues to maintain that because of improvements and new businesses on the north side of town, Haltom City is doing great at attracting businesses.  Unfortunately, the citizens, and those wanting to move to the city can see with their own eyes, the boarded-up businesses, and declining nature of the south and central parts of the city.   A recent report said that Haltom City's population has started declining, even though Dallas Fort Worth enjoys 1000 new people moving in each day. Other cities in Tarrant County are all growing. Haltom City is not.  HUBA reiterates its request for the city to have public hearings and propose plans on how to improve the declining portions. This situation is not new, and many smaller older cities throughout America are having the same issues, including increased crime and a loss of businesses in their central older districts.   A simple Google search will find plenty of success stories on how those cities moved forward to make the necessary improvements.  About Haltom City Haltom City is a diverse, majority working-class city located between Dallas and Fort Worth in Tarrant County, TX. Haltom City is minutes from both the DFW Airport and Downtown Fort Worth with direct access to major highways including I-820 and SH-121. Due to an outdated and restrictive use matrix that discourages new business and deters growth, several areas of Haltom City have seen a decline in small businesses which provided goods and services and were a significant source of jobs, including the once-thriving automotive industry. However, Haltom City can reverse this trend and should prioritize development of inner-city land and vacant buildings, particularly in the major corridors close to the city's center. The city is financially healthy with a capable manager and staff who would like to see diverse business development occur and need the support of the City Council to make it happen.  About Haltom United Business Alliance Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) wants to give members of Haltom City's business community an advocate and to keep those businesses informed about issues that affect them. They want to make sure Haltom City is business friendly and nurtures small business growth, including automotive businesses in the industrial districts, and bring more restaurants including breweries and eventually a major grocery store to the city. New businesses and growth in existing businesses will create a stronger tax base which will allow the city to pay its first responders wages that are competitive with surrounding cities while improving Haltom City's facilities and infrastructure. HUBA believes that the southern and central parts of the city need a revitalization plan, to prevent further degradation in those areas, and wants that to happen before the inner-city experiences increased crime and more blight. As retail and office uses are in decline, it's more critical than ever to attract new businesses. They believe that such a plan requires a strong relationship and support of the business community.
