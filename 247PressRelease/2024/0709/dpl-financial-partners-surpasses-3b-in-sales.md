# DPL Financial Partners surpasses $3B in sales

LOUISVILLE, KY, July 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DPL Financial Partners, the leading platform for commission-free annuities, today announced that it has surpassed $3 billion in sales. The latest $1 billion, achieved in less than half the time it took to go from $1 billion to $2 billion in transaction volume, underscores the acceleration in advisor adoption of commission-free annuity products and DPL's platform, as well as growing consumer awareness and interest in no-load, low-cost annuities.   "DPL is driving the industry's shift toward fee-based annuities," said DPL CEO David Lau. "For the first time, RIAs are able to serve their clients holistically. And we help commission-based advisors transition their annuity business to fees, just as they already shifted their asset management business from transactional to fee-based revenue. We expect our momentum to further accelerate as consumers increasingly become aware of the availability of commission-free products and seek them out."   DPL serves an advisor base of more than 6,500 RIA firms with access to the platform to discover, fulfill, manage, and report on a range of annuity and insurance products either directly or through integrations with Black Diamond, Orion, and other wealth management platforms. In addition to driving innovation in product pricing and design, DPL continues to drive technological innovations. In collaboration with carrier partners, the firm is developing straight through processing capabilities that will deliver a seamless buying experience for advisors and consumers, and is expected to further enhance product value, transparency, and adoption.
