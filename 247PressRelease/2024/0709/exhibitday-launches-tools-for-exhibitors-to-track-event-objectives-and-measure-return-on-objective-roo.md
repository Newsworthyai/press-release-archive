# ExhibitDay Launches Tools for Exhibitors to Track Event Objectives and Measure Return on Objective (ROO)

BETHESDA, MD, July 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ExhibitDay.com, an award-winning trade show planning and event project management platform, is thrilled to announce the release of its new tools for tracking Event Objectives and measuring Return on Objective (ROO) for trade shows.  The platform enables event managers to monitor Event Objectives, which are specific goals to be achieved by participating in events. These objectives are assigned a level of importance based on their significance to the event team. The importance of each objective carries a weight factor in calculating the overall Return on Objective for the event.  Once the event is over, the success of each objective is rated on a scale from 0 to 10. A rating of 10 indicates that the objective was fully achieved, while a rating of 0 indicates that the objective was not achieved at all.  The Event ROO Score ExhibitDay calculates a Return on Objective Score for each event -- a metric based on the weighted average of the event's objective achievement ratings. Each objective's achievement rating, combined with its weight factor, contributes to the overall event ROO Score.   Field marketing teams can compare ROO Scores across all events and identify the ones worth attending again.
