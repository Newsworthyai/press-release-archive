# FTC Proposes Rule to Ban Noncompete Clauses, Benefiting Workers and Competition

MEMPHIS, TN, April 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken a significant step toward promoting worker rights and fostering healthy competition by proposing a new rule that would ban non-compete clauses in employment contracts. These clauses, which have become increasingly prevalent, restrict workers from seeking employment with competitors or starting their own businesses within a specified time frame and geographical area.  Background on Non-Compete Clauses  Non-compete clauses have a long history, dating back to the Roman Empire, where artisans and craftsmen were bound by agreements preventing them from practicing their trade within specific geographic areas after leaving their employers. In today's world, these clauses are widespread, particularly in industries like technology, finance, and medicine. While they were initially intended to protect proprietary information and trade secrets, their impact on workers has raised concerns.  The FTC's Proposed Rule  The FTC's proposed rule aims to address the negative effects of non-compete clauses. Key points include:  Banning Non-Competes: The proposed rule would prohibit employers from imposing non-compete clauses on their workers. By doing so, it seeks to increase wages by nearly $300 billion per year and expand career opportunities for approximately 30 million Americans.  Economic Liberty and Innovation: FTC Chair Lina M. Khan emphasizes that the freedom to change jobs is essential for economic liberty and a thriving economy. Non-competes hinder workers from freely switching jobs, depriving them of higher wages and better working conditions. Additionally, they limit businesses' access to a talent pool necessary for growth and innovation.  Harm to Competition: Non-compete clauses harm competition by blocking workers from pursuing better opportunities and preventing employers from hiring the best available talent. They also hinder innovation and business dynamism.  Tennessee's Perspective  In Tennessee, courts evaluate the enforceability of non-compete clauses based on several factors, including whether the clause protects legitimate business interests (such as trade secrets or customer relationships) and whether it imposes undue hardship on the employee. The reasonableness of the duration and scope of the clause is also considered.  Public Comment and Next Steps  The FTC received nearly 27,000 comments on the draft rule, reflecting the significance of this issue. The final vote on the rule is expected in April 2024. While labor and advocacy groups support the proposed ban, industry groups, led by the US Chamber of Commerce, oppose it, arguing that the FTC lacks statutory authority.
