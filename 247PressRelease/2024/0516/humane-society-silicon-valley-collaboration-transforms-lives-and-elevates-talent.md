# Humane Society Silicon Valley Collaboration Transforms Lives and Elevates Talent

MILPITAS, CA, May 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) facilitated a critical ear surgery for a 10-year-old German Shepherd and the unique teaching opportunity in this unusually severe case. A collaboration with San Diego Humane Society (SDHS) for surgery not only improved the senior canine's quality of life, but also offered valuable hands-on training to further develop the skill set of HSSV's veterinary team.  After arriving as a stray to the City of San Jose Animal Care & Services, Smokey was diagnosed with severe ear infections and moved out of the municipal shelter and into a foster home. Recognizing the urgency of his condition and the shelter's budgetary constraints, the shelter reached out to HSSV who, in turn, tapped Dr. Leilani Im from SDHS for consultation.  The surgery, known as Total Ear Canal Ablation and Bulla Osteotomy (TECA-BO), involves the complete removal of the ear canal and part of the surrounding bony structures to eliminate chronic and severe ear infections. As with Smokey, it is recommended in cases of end-stage otitis in which treatment is no longer helping due to a bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotics or other underlying conditions predisposing the ears to chronic inflammation and infection.  At an estimated cost of $8,000 to $10,000 per ear, SDHS agreed to perform the surgery at no charge and teach the technique to HSSV staff veterinarians, furthering a commitment to advance shelter medicine and enhance the quality of care for animals in need. Dr. Im, alongside HSSV's veterinary team, performed the intricate procedure which lasted six hours.  "When we learned about Smokey's situation, we wanted help, but we also needed help to do so," said Dr. Cristie Kamiya, Chief of Shelter Medicine at HSSV. "Collaborating with San Diego Humane Society was essential in providing Smokey with the care he needed, and it aligns with our strategic priorities."  HSSV's strategic priorities include changing the game by advancing shelter medicine and cultivating the next generation of veterinary professionals, increasing access to veterinary care and pet services, and helping shelters save more lives. By investing in staff with new skill sets and learning opportunities, HSSV is better equipped to save more lives and ensure shelter animals receive the quality care they need and deserve.  "Smokey's surgery embodies our priorities," said Dr. Kamiya. "His quality of life is dramatically improved, and our staff received invaluable training that will enhance our life-saving efforts."  The partnership between HSSV, City of San Jose Animal Care & Services and San Diego Humane Society symbolizes the collective spirit around the human-animal bond within the shelter and animal rescue community.
