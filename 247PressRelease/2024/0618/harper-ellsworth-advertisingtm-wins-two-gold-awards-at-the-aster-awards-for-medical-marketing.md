# Harper Ellsworth Advertising™ Wins Two Gold Awards at the Aster Awards for Medical Marketing

DALLAS, TX, June 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Harper Ellsworth's client, Texas Radiotherapy (Fort Worth, Texas), provides superior radiation oncology treatment plans. They put each patient first and treat them like family. The agency profiled this unique approach through patient testimonials and outtakes with radiation oncologist, Dr. Matthew Cavey, M.D.   Both the video series and the campaign highlighted the expert level of care provided to patients as well as the patients' positive experiences with staff members at Texas Radiotherapy.   Dr. Cavey stated, "I was very interested in letting my patients tell their incredible stories. My patients inspire me every day. This campaign encompasses what it means to be a part of Texas Radiotherapy."   Kathlene Simmons––the founder of Harper Ellsworth–– works diligently to ensure that the campaigns produced bring her clients' stories and truths to life while connecting to their ideal audience. Simmons noted "it was a true honor to work with such an amazing client and to create something that not only spreads brand awareness but increases prostate cancer awareness and treatment options. Understanding what makes each client different is what Harper Ellsworth is all about."  Melvin Strobbe, creative director for the "Texas Radiotherapy: Putting U First" campaign series, had a unique approach to the campaign's development. Strobbe stated, "Our creative approach at Harper Ellsworth™ comes from our collaborative style between the client and the agency; it is not one-sided. We are as equally vested in the successful outcome for our clients, as our clients are. Dr. Cavey wanted to ensure his patients' voices were heard, and we believe that we have turned that wish into something truly impactful."
