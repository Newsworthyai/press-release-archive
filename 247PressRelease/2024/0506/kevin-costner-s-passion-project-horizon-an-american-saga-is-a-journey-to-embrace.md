# Kevin Costner's Passion Project "Horizon: An American Saga" is a Journey to Embrace

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In recent days, the buzz surrounding "Horizon," Kevin Costner's ambitious cinematic endeavor, has been met with skepticism. Questions have arisen about the film's three-hour runtime, with news writers even suggesting that it may spell failure for Costner's passion project. Critics have gone as far as to propose that Costner should have remained dedicated to his acclaimed "Yellowstone" TV series.  Yet, amid the noise of doubts, it's essential to remember that these opinions are often formed without firsthand experience. Many critics base their assessments solely on the brief trailer that was released, neglecting the full scope and potential of Costner's vision. As someone who believes in reserving judgment until the credits roll, I refuse to dismiss a film of such grand ambition solely on its length.  Speaking of "Yellowstone," my personal disengagement from the series wasn't due to its sporadic release schedule, but rather its disjointed narrative and excessive promotional tie-ins. However, Costner's decision to pivot from television to pursue his cinematic passion project speaks volumes about his dedication to "Horizon." It's a testament to his unwavering commitment to storytelling on a grand scale.  What genuinely excites me about "Horizon" extends beyond its narrative premise; it's the promise of immersive cinematic spectacle. The majestic landscapes that serve as the backdrop for the film are set to transport audiences on a visual journey unlike any other. For me, the allure of witnessing such grandeur on the silver screen is reason enough to make a trip to the theater an event in itself.  Comparisons to past cinematic epics, such as Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List," offer valuable perspective. Despite its formidable runtime of three hours and fifteen minutes, and intense subject matter, "Schindler's List" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to captivate and move audiences profoundly. While some may find longer films challenging, their impact and significance endure long after the credits roll.  Furthermore, the landscape of entertainment has evolved significantly since the release of "Schindler's List," in 1994. The prevalence of streaming services has reshaped viewing habits, making the communal theater experience all the more precious. As streaming prices rise, the appeal of the theater as a communal space for cinematic immersion becomes increasingly attractive and can often be cheaper than streaming.   In light of these considerations, I am unwilling to cast doubt upon "Horizon" prematurely. Firstly, Costner's dedicated fan base eagerly anticipates his distinct cinematic style. Secondly, the promise of breathtaking scenery and a compelling narrative ensures an unforgettable cinematic experience. Lastly, the opportunity to return to the theater and indulge in the magic of cinema is a compelling reason in itself. "Horizon" is my reason to return.   "Horizon: An American Saga" represents not only a cinematic endeavor but a celebration of storytelling on an epic scale. By embracing the theater experience, audiences have the chance to immerse themselves fully in Costner's vision and rediscover the magic of cinema. So, let's cast aside doubt and embrace the journey that "Horizon" promises to take us onâ€”a journey into the heart of the American saga.  Learn more about the movie - Click Here.
