# Automotive Defense Specialists Announces Strong Internet Response to Recent Posts on Smog and Auto Repair Shop Needs in California

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Automotive Defense Specialists, a team of best-in-class defense attorneys focused on auto repair technicians and owners at https://www.automotivedefense.com/, is proud to announce strong reaction across the Internet to its informative posts helping SMOG shops and auto repair technicians to stay informed.  "There are all types of lawyers who support consumers, but we are directly focused on defending California's small SMOG shop businesses," said lead attorney William Ferreira from Automotive Defense Specialists. "Local businesses are the backbone of any community, and our goal is to preserve mom-and-pop shops in the SMOG testing and auto repair sector. Metrics on these new posts have been outstanding!"  Among the facts are strong pickup by third-party resources. For example, part of the news is that two press releases were carried by several California-based news channels that focus on business.  * https://www.ksn.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/624677873/automotive-defense-specialists-announce-new-content-on-finding-a-smog-check-lawyer-in-california/  * https://kdvr.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/624677873/automotive-defense-specialists-announce-new-content-on-finding-a-smog-check-lawyer-in-california/  The primary focus has been on new posts explaining the in's and out's of the Smog check industry as for example, this newly announced post: https://automotivedefense.com/2023/03/05/smog-check-stations-work-hard-to-reduce-pollution-heres-a-little-history/.   Here is background on the announcement. The Bureau of Automotive Repair may be known to conduct random inspections of smog shops via undercover cars and unexpected visits. The California agency also responds to consumer complaints, and focuses largely on "defending" consumers and not on protecting the rights of hard-working auto repair shops and technicians. If a SMOG technician is accused of negligence or wrongdoing during a car inspection, however, he or she may face the power of the State of California alone. As the new and detailed posts show, securing legal representation may be money well spent. Business owners and SMOG testing professionals can review the firm's page for fighting SMOG citations at https://automotivedefense.com/2009/07/20/fight-bar-smog-citations/.   Indeed, every other year, the Department of Motor Vehicles reminds Californians when a car is due for a smog check. If the notice has been received, the driver must quickly find a smog testing station. A nearby mom-and-pop SMOG testing station may be the preferred choice. If the trusted local testing station has shut down due to an accusation from the Bureau of Automotive Repair, however, that could be a problem for the entire community and be a type of "unintended consequence" to overzealous regulation.
