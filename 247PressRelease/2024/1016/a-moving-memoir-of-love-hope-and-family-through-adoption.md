# A Moving Memoir of Love, Hope, and Family Through Adoption

NEW YORK, NY, October 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An Unforgettable Story of Adoption and Family  Authors Andry and Pippa Seichrist unveil their deeply personal and heartwarming memoir, My Life Before: A Memoir of a Family Created Through Adoption. Released in 2024, this book chronicles the unique adoption journey of Andry, a Ukrainian orphan, and how his life and that of the Seichrist family intertwined to form a remarkable bond of love, hope, and resilience.  A Life-Changing Adoption Journey  Adopting an older child is often seen as a challenge many avoid, but for Andry and Pippa Seichrist, his adoptive mother, it became the most extraordinary chapter of their lives. My Life Before takes readers through Andry's life in Ukraine, offering a candid glimpse into the hardships of growing up in a country scarred by poverty and tragedy. Through Pippa's and Andry's alternating narratives, the memoir reveals the trials and triumphs of finding one another and creating a family despite the overwhelming odds.   The Power of Love and Family The story begins with Pippa and her husband Ron's decision to adopt an older child rather than a baby—a choice driven by the desire to give hope to a child who might otherwise face a bleak future. The book captures both the joyful moments and the heart-wrenching challenges as Andry adjusts to his new life in America, offering a perspective seldom heard from adopted children. Readers are taken on a transformative journey through Andry's memories—ranging from childhood struggles in a Ukraine village living with his biological family to the orphanage to the eventual adoption that brought new meaning to his life.   A Message of Resilience and Hope With honest and heartfelt storytelling, My Life Before addresses not only the complex emotional landscape of adoption but also the broader themes of family, belonging, and the transformative power of love. The Seichrists' memoir sheds light on the importance of understanding and embracing the difficult past of adopted children, and how patience and empathy can create strong, lasting bonds.   "My life wasn't easy, but the love and family I gained changed everything," said co-author Andry Seichrist. "I hope that our story encourages others to consider opening their hearts and homes to older children."
