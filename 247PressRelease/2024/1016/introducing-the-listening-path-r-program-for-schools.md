# Introducing The Listening Path® Program for Schools

PHILADELPHIA, PA, October 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Listening Path® announces the launching of The Listening Path® Program designed for children in grades 3 to 5 and is available to schools throughout the U.S. and Canada.   The Listening Path® Program is different—it's fun and easy. Children learn a new way to listen through a series of engaging, animated videos that take them on an educational adventure, while teaching them to Listen to Understand. To navigate their journey, the program includes everything they'll need: The Listening Path® map, posters, stickers, a compass, passports and more. The Listening Path Program® was developed with one thing in mind—to go deeper to truly understand what someone means, and not just what they're saying.   Educators say their greatest challenge is getting students to listen and comprehend. A reason for this, is because there is no program that teaches listening as a skill. This led Christine Miles, the founder of The Listening Path® to develop The Listening Path® Program for the classroom.   "Listening matters," said Christine Miles, founder of The Listening Path®. "Yet, while we have methods to teach children to read, write and speak, we have none to teach them how to listen. Listening is a skill and needs be taught as such."  "This program is designed to teach children how to listen in their formative years," continued Miles. "It is to provide teachers with a tool to help them develop children's listening and comprehension skills in a fun way, while not increasing the teacher's workload."  The Listening Path® Program teaches children how to listen to understand fully what the speaker is saying. It is designed to help improve the overall aptitude of students by unlocking their listening skills. It is the only educational program in the United States designed just to teach listening—leading to a higher level of understanding, greater learning and increased emotional intelligence.
