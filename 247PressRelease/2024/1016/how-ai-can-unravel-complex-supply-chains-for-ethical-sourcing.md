# How AI Can Unravel Complex Supply Chains for Ethical Sourcing

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, October 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Climate change is disrupting global supply chains and making it more difficult for businesses to ethically source products, the Associated Press reports. But global fintech RobobAI (pronounced "robo buy") is using artificial intelligence to help large organizations "shift their spend towards more ethical and sustainable suppliers to create real and positive impact on environments and communities around the world," says Julian Harris, RobobAI CEO.  "We believe that global organizations have enormous opportunities to positively impact human rights, protect the environment, and be more inclusive of indigenous, diverse, and small businesses," Harris says. RobobAI does this by helping organizations:  • Proactively monitor supply chain risk, sustainability, and diversity through third-party risk management. • Constantly monitor and flag suppliers sanctioned, mentioned in media or listed for modern slavery. • Utilize research and development of new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives in areas including carbon, cybersecurity, and DEI. • Ensure data security and compliance with global regulatory standards. • Gain 360° visibility of their supply chain spend to drive efficiencies and reduce waste.  "Collectively, global organizations have the opportunity to positively impact human rights and the environment while also being more inclusive of indigenous, diverse, and small businesses," Harris says. "By understanding their current reality, organizations can do their part to build a better future world through evolving the ethical and commercial management of their supply chain."
