# Atticus Injury Law Welcomes Trial Lawyer James G. Perry to Powerhouse Team

IRVINE, CA, October 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Atticus Injury Law, PC is proud to announce the addition of James G. Perry as a Senior Trial Lawyer. With nearly a decade of experience as a prosecutor, primarily with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, and a proven track record in civil and criminal law, Perry brings a wealth of expertise to the firm's personal injury practice.  "Interestingly, my entire legal trajectory began with trial advocacy," said Perry. "I participated in mock trials during undergrad and law school and loved it. I initially tried to figure out how to apply that passion to a legal career, which led me to criminal law." Throughout his career, Perry amassed substantial trial experience to help those who have been harmed, a passion that carried him from criminal to civil practice.  Perry has a deep connection to civil and criminal cases, finding them uniquely compelling. "I often gravitate toward cases with a criminal element alongside civil prosecution, particularly in wrongful death cases, which have been a major focus both during my time at the DA's office and in recent years as a civil practitioner."  One notable case he worked on recently involved a wrongful death suit against the City of Los Angeles, where a driver going twice the speed limit struck and killed a young woman at a dangerous intersection in a residential neighborhood. The case against the city exposed this unsafe condition, which resulted in an 800% increase in accidents over ten years.  "It was a heartbreaking case, but we secured a positive outcome for her family. The case was technically complex, but it exemplifies the importance of seeking justice for victims," said Perry.   In addition to his considerable trial experience, Perry has written extensively on a wide range of topics, including the intersection of the Fifth Amendment and civil discovery, spoliation of evidence, and state and federal public records requests, and is actively involved in the legal community. He serves on the Top Gun Event Committee for the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association, Education Committee with the Orange County Bar Association, and holds board positions with the Consumer Attorneys of California's Inland Empire Chapter. Perry is also a member of several other bar associations, including the San Bernardino and Riverside County Bar Associations.  "We are thrilled to welcome James to the team," said Atticus N. Wegman, Managing Partner at Atticus Injury Law. "His passion for advocacy, impressive trial experience, and commitment to helping individuals who have suffered life-altering injuries make him a valuable addition to our firm."
