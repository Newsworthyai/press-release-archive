Global experts shared the latest trends in fields such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and quantum information technology while discussing future visions.  The exhibition integrated three major events: 'AI Korea,' 'IT EXPO BUSAN,' and 'CLOUD EXPO KOREA.'  This year, 'K-ICT WEEK in BUSAN' was held in conjunction with the 'Korea Safety Expo (K-SAFETY EXPO),' bringing together companies from various industries such as ICT-based safety, manufacturing, education, marine, logistics, medical, and security to Busan.

The event provided an 'indoor navigation service' to guide visitors through the exhibition and created a virtual exhibition hall using a metaverse platform, allowing participants to experience the normalization of AI in daily life.  The Cloud Conference, held on September 10, drew attention with a keynote speech by Microsoft Korea, alongside discussions by AI experts from companies like Kakao Enterprise and DOUZONE BIZON on the latest trends and prospects.  As the K-ICT WEEK in BUSAN celebrated its 10th anniversary, Busan Metropolitan City showcased innovative technologies leading to AI Transformation (AX), expanding the scope to quantum information technology and information security. The conference became a platform to support participating companies in finding new business opportunities.  Busan Mayor Heong-joon Park stated, "This event, a global collaboration stage where the advanced technologies of future unicorn companies can be seen at a glance, will be a success, proving that Busan is already prepared for the AI Transformation (AX) of all industries. Through the organic cooperation between these two cross-industry events, we will present Busan as a city soaring towards becoming a global hub."
