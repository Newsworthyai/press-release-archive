# Precoa acquires Everplans

PORTLAND, OR, October 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Precoa is pleased to announce the acquisition of Everplans, the life-planning brand that offers a leading digital organizational platform. Together, Precoa and Everplans will provide families across the country with easy, secure, and accessible ways to prepare for the unexpected, as part of Precoa's mission to create the highest quality preneed experiences for families, advance funeral planners, and funeral homes.   "Everplans has an outstanding technology platform with bank-level security and privacy, and it is our shared vision to help everyone create an intentional plan for the loss of a loved one that ultimately brought us together," said Michael Hornibrook, President and CEO of Precoa. "We're excited about Everplans joining Precoa so we can leverage our unique strengths and continue creating the highest quality experiences for the families and partners we serve."   Precoa is the nation's leading preneed insurance sales and marketing company, and their premier funeral home partnerships across America have resulted in nearly one million prearranged families. The acquisition of Everplans arises from a strategic alignment between both companies and a shared dedication to enhancing consumer experiences through next-generation technology.   "This is such an important step in our evolution," said Abby Schneiderman, co-founder of Everplans. "We have always been committed to helping as many people as possible plan for the unexpected. Joining forces with Precoa enables us to bring our platform to an even larger audience. While we will continue working closely with financial advisors and employers, we will now expand with Precoa to serve the funeral industry as well."   Founded in 2012, Everplans helps people manage, organize, securely store, and share critical information with those in their lives who may need it during an emergency, or in the event of death. The company currently maintains a consumer subscription service, which is also offered by financial advisors, attorneys, insurance agents, and employers. More than 30 million people have utilized Everplans' robust content library and tools, consisting of thousands of articles and checklists which cover a broad range of topics related to end-of-life and legacy planning. Everplans' founders are also the authors of the best-selling book In Case You Get Hit by a Bus â€“ How to Organize Your Life Now For When You're Not Around Later (Workman/Hachette Publishing).   "The Everplans platform is unique in that it is not just a vault; it's a highly personalized digital experience that helps people organize their critical information," said Adam Seifer, Everplans co-founder. "We have been working closely with Precoa since 2021 and are excited to build on our capabilities together."  Upon completion of the acquisition, Everplans will become a subsidiary of Precoa and continue to service all its existing customers. Michael Hornibrook looks forward to the innovations and enhanced experiences to come. "Anyone who has ever lost a loved one knows the emotional toll of planning a funeral while trying to navigate finances and affairs," said Hornibrook. "We believe that by planning for the inevitable, you make a challenging time a little easier so that you can focus on connection and healing. Together with Everplans' technology and their roadmap, we can help families across the country be better prepared for life's most difficult moments."
