# EXCEL WITH TRUSTED WIRELESS: INTRODUCING THE PTAU-2 WIRELESS MICROPHONE SYSTEM

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Phenyx Pro proudly announces the launch of its latest innovation, the PTAU-2 Wireless Microphone System. Designed for professionals who demand top-tier performance, the PTAU-2 offers unparalleled audio clarity and robust interference resistance, making it the ultimate choice for mid-to-large venues like live shows, corporate presentations, and theatrical productions.  What Makes the PTAU-2 Stand Out?  Streamlined System Mastery No more fumbling with complex controls—manage everything with one knob. The intuitive shuttle jog dial keeps the front panel clean while integrating multiple functions into one sleek wireless microphone system. With a simple twist, you can quickly access Volume, RF. SET, ID Lock, Tune, Squelch, Auto Scan, Spectrum Analysis, Tx. SET, and Auto Lock. Designed for fast-paced environments, this streamlined control simplifies your experience, allowing you to focus on your audio.  Reliable Audio Transmission   When delivering a speech or performing in a complex environment, rely on the advanced ID Lock function. This feature locks the selected frequency, allowing only the matched handheld microphone to transmit audio. It prevents simultaneous output from other microphones on the same frequency, effectively eliminating the risk of interference and cross-talk. With ID Lock, you can enjoy stable, secure audio transmission and focus on your performance without technical disruptions.  Effortless Frequency Management  Setting up for an event in a crowded environment filled with wireless devices can be challenging, but the Auto Scan feature simplifies frequency management by automatically detecting and avoiding busy channels and external interference. Supporting up to 2x1000 selectable frequencies, it ensures a clear and stable connection free from cross-channel interference. Meanwhile, the spectrum analyzer analyzes and displays signal conditions, helping you identify clean frequency bands and manage your own frequencies alongside those of other wireless systems nearby. Together, these features provide comprehensive frequency management, ensuring your performance is always backed by the best possible audio setup.  Versatile Scenario Adaptability  The PTAU-2 offers adjustable transmitter power and receiver sensitivity for flexibility in diverse scenarios. With selectable transmitter power settings of 5mW, 10mW, and 30mW, you can adapt your audio setup to any environment—boosting power to extend transmission range and overcome interference in large venues, or lowering it to reduce disruptions and save battery life in smaller settings. Additionally, the receiver sensitivity can be tailored with three settings (High, Mid, Low) to match environmental needs and microphone placement, ensuring optimal performance in any situation.  Uninterrupted Signal Reliability  Experience enhanced signal reliability and pristine sound quality with our True Diversity Circuit. This technology uses two independent receiver modules and antennas for each channel, continuously monitoring and selecting the strongest signal to minimize loss and interference. Compared to standard UHF systems, it significantly reduces dead zones and prevents mute or dead-point noise. Whether in a large venue or complex environment, move freely on stage, assured your audio remains clear and consistent for your audience.  Pristine Vocal Reproduction  Capture every nuance of your voice with our cardioid pickup capsule and finely tuned EQ, delivering rich, clear, and vibrant detail. This setup ensures high-quality vocal reproduction for both live performances and studio recordings. Your voice will shine with depth and brilliance, providing clarity and warmth that envelops your audience in an unforgettable audio experience.
