# Redefining Christian Fiction - Bestselling Author Joseph Ganci Announces No Charge Download Of Bestselling Ebook, Gideon, The Sound And The Glory (The Empire of Israel Book 1)

WILMINGTON, NC, March 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Joseph Ganci, author of three bestselling books in the Empire Of Israel series, has announced that the first book in the series, 'Gideon, The Sound And The Glory' (The Empire of Israel Book 1), will be available in eBook form from March 19 through March 23, 2024 at no charge at Amazon.  Set aside all that you thought you knew about the Bible. In this gripping series, comprised of three panoramic novels, Ganci reveals in vivid detail the spiritual journey of Israel. In the words of Midwest Book Review, the book, " . . . powerfully captures the essential elements of the spiritual journey of Israel, a story that vividly brings to life one of the many biblical heroes that are often forgotten. The story is written in an excellent manner and readers will love the balance that comes out neatly between character, plot, and setting. Joseph Ganci's prose is arresting, peppered with wonderful imagery and succinct descriptions of plot, characters, and setting. The themes are masterfully created and they are woven into the story in a way that allows the reader to enjoy both the inspiration the story offers and the accompanying action. The book explores powerful spiritual and political themes, capturing the conflicts and the dynamics of life within the community of God's chosen people."  Why has the true story of Gideon been hidden for three millennia? How does Gideon connect with Jacob wrestling an angel? How did a blood feud between Gideon and the Midianite kings evolve? How does the prophetess Debra establish the tradition of lighting two Shabbat candles? How does Gideon's three hundred represent the Trinity? Why was Gideon not at the major Midianite battle? How did three hundred starving men conquer fifteen thousand in a night battle on foreign soil? Why is Gideon a similitude of the coming of Jesus Christ as a spiritual warrior? Why were there mice in the Philistine cart that transported the Ark of the Covenant back to Israel? What was young David even present at the battle with Goliath? Why did David have five stones in his script?  Besides being informative and entertaining, the biblical novel is a spiritual delight to the pilgrim searching for the mind of God.  Unsung biblical heroes and murderous villains leap to life, blazing onto the pages of revelation. Gideon, a lowly woodcutter, is blessed by an angel to be the savior of all Israel. He does not know why or how and shrinks from this dangerous mission. The commandment to conquer the Midian Empire as one man seems all but impossible. But Gideon's confidence grows as God guides his every step until he stands fearless, dauntlessly fulfilling his destiny as "a mighty man of valor." The fierce warriors, burning towers, and devastated cities contained in Gideon's journey are but silver threads that weave into a sweeping tapestry that fills ten generations that follow with intrigue. Running through and stitching together the entire saga is the Ark of the Covenant and the Baal-Berith, also known as Gideon's mysterious Ephod of Gold (shown on the back cover in the print version).  Read this book, and unearth hidden treasures of the peoples, places, and artifacts while resurrecting the stuff of legends that have slept for 3000 years.  Ron Capshaw for Indie Reader said, "Ganci is clearly a believer and knows the Old Testament well, a section of the Bible many religious scholars view as the most complex and opaque. Nevertheless, he has pulled off the feat of making this era understandable to modern readers by using the universal theme of the leader initially feeling unworthy when destiny calls."  Romauld Dzemo for Reader's Favorite stated, "Gideon: The Sound and the Glory will appeal to fans of political thrillers, adventure, and conflict-driven stories that are laced with intense action. I was hugely entertained by the writing and the plot. A real page-turner!"  The eBook will be available at no charge March 19 through March 23, 2024 at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Joseph-Ganci/author/B06XHZ76N9?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true  All of the books are available on Amazon in e-Book and paperback versions. Audio versions of Gideon and David God's Chosen Crucible are currently available.  Ganci takes a ground-breaking and revelatory path in his quest to bring awe-inspiring stories to life and, ultimately, to film. He believes that connecting facts is far more enchanting than loosely fitting fantasies. He works within an engaging and dramatized fiction framework that remains faithful to uphold spiritual principles while exceedingly rich in detail.  Ganci bases his work on three primary pillars:  The rock-solid cornerstone is historical biblical geography.  The creative arch is revelatory in its timing and issues.  The research is concrete and firmly rooted in customs, languages, and traditions.  Ganci fills in the blanks with rock-solid research and prophetic revelations. It is a style that has allowed him to create breakthrough approaches that are exciting and breathtaking while remaining within the limits of sound biblical teachings.  Ganci is also the creator of 'Incredible Bible Mysteries,' a five-part video series now available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK0Op2dYhMXtz7nh2D__keQ.  Ganci believes that Old Testament revelations are the Word of God. Simultaneously, many needful details remained buried until the information age of discovery made them prominent and visible to the naked eye. These insights create a middle ground of understanding. As a dedicated and highly motivated researcher, he proposes many undiscovered nuggets of spiritual gold in the original manuscripts. He shines a new light on ancient texts and removes the black-or-white argument of the all-or-nothing question of modern-day revelations. He is adept at untangling philosophical and theological human-made knots. He allows us to look at what some consider foregone conclusions in a new light.  Readers of his bestseller, 'Gideon: The Sound and the Glory,' will learn about the Jewish Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant, the mysterious Golden Ephod, why David found himself at battle with Goliath, and much much more. This work illuminates the dark corners of scripture while engaging readers in a gripping narrative.
