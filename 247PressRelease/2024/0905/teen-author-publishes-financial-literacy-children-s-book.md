PALO ALTO, CA, September 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Abby Medin is a 17 year-old incoming senior at Menlo-Atherton High School, CA. When she was a kid, she enjoyed making comic books about her dog, doodling at recess, and reading graphic novels. In high school, she became passionate about expanding financial education in the midst of economic instability, and the rising, historically high, American debt. Medin became a leading advocate for financial education, writing about current events, the economy, and financial education for teens- "Teeconomics".
