EVERGREEN, CO, September 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Blue Spruce Habitat for Humanity, the local foothills affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, is excited to announce its annual Hard Hats & High Heels fundraiser on Wednesday, September 18, 2024, at the beautiful Evergreen Lake House. Doors open at 6:00 PM, and guests will enjoy an evening of drinks, food, live music, a silent auction, and a live auction—all in support of affordable housing for low-income families in our mountain communities. Together, we are making our communities stronger.   This lively event brings together community leaders, local businesses, and individuals to raise critical funds for Blue Spruce Habitat's ongoing home-building projects in Idaho Springs, Evergreen, Conifer, and surrounding areas. Our work ensures that local residents—including teachers, government employees, and healthcare workers—have the opportunity to build and own safe, affordable homes.  Since its founding in 1990 by twelve dedicated volunteers in Evergreen, Blue Spruce Habitat has grown to include hundreds of volunteers who contribute thousands of hours each year. With the support of our community, we are able to construct homes for families in need, helping them achieve long-term stability, build wealth through home equity, and contribute to the prosperity of the community.

Future homeowner quote: Cody and Michael, both blue-collar workers in Evergreen, found it increasingly difficult to afford living in the area. "We have not been able to afford to buy a home in Evergreen," Cody shared. "We cannot even afford rent here!" They were accepted into the Blue Spruce Habitat for Humanity program. "That day, we drove to the site and took a family photo of our future new home to document the journey we were about to embark on," Cody said with a smile. Earning "sweat equity" hours has been a significant part of their journey. Cody and Michael have been working at the ReStore, making meals for volunteers, and contributing to the construction of their own home and other Habitat projects. Cody and Michael's story is one of perseverance, community, and hope. It's a testament to the transformative power of organizations like Blue Spruce Habitat for Humanity, and the importance of never giving up on your dreams, no matter how distant they may seem. Their new home will be more than just a house; it will be the foundation of a brighter future for their family.
