WILMINGTON, DE, July 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bethany Hall-Long: A Legacy of Service, Compassion, and Leadership  BethanyHall-Long's journey is a testament to resilience, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to public service. Growing up on her family farm in Sussex County, Bethany learned the values of hard work, integrity, and community from an early age. Her father, a pastor, instilled in her a sense of duty and compassion that has driven her throughout her life.  A Trailblazer in Education and Healthcare  As the first person in her family to attend college, Bethany pursued her passion for helping others by becoming a registered nurse (RN), earning her Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), and later, her PhD. These accomplishments highlight her dedication to education and her determination to make a difference in the healthcare sector.  Bethany's background as a military wife and daughter of an army veteran has further deepened her understanding of the sacrifices made by service members and their families. This personal experience fuels her advocacy for veterans and their needs.  A Career Dedicated to Public Service  Bethany Hall-Long's career is marked by her roles as a nurse, educator, and public servant. Her extensive experience in these fields uniquely positions her to understand and address the challenges facing Delaware's residents. She has served her community as a State Representative and Senator, and her track record of effective leadership and legislative accomplishments speaks for itself.  When elected Governor, Bethany will make history as Delaware's second woman Governor and the first nurse Governor in the nation. Her profound knowledge of education, healthcare, and agriculture sets her apart from other candidates, ensuring she brings a well-rounded perspective to the role.  Proven Experience and Accomplishments  Bethany Hall-Long is committed to making Delaware the best place to live, work, and raise a family. Her extensive experience as an educator, nurse, and public servant has equipped her with the skills and insights necessary to tackle the state's most pressing issues.  During her tenure, Bethany chaired the state retiree healthcare benefits committee, protecting healthcare benefits for thousands of retirees. She also led the state's Pandemic Resurgence Committee, personally administering over 4,000 vaccines and organizing vaccine drives across Delaware. Her efforts helped businesses survive and thrive during challenging times.  Under the Carney-Hall-Long administration, Delaware has seen remarkable economic growth, with over 32,000 jobs created, making it the strongest job-creating administration since the 1990s. Additionally, the administration has made significant investments in public education, including raising educator pay statewide.  As Lt. Governor, Bethany chaired the board of pardons, reducing the backlog for pardons and commutations from 2-3 years to just 2-3 months. Her dedication to efficient and fair governance is evident in these accomplishments.  A Bold and Innovative Plan for Delaware  Bethany Hall-Long's vision for Delaware includes a strong economy that supports both big and small businesses, ensuring great public education regardless of zip code, and fighting for affordable access to healthcare. She is a staunch advocate for protecting reproductive healthcare freedom and will work tirelessly to safeguard these rights.  Bethany is also committed to protecting the environment and investing in a green energy future.

She aims to cut red tape and expedite the construction of affordable housing, addressing a critical need in the state.  Endorsements and Support  Bethany Hall-Long's leadership and vision have earned her the endorsement of numerous leaders and organizations.

Bethany Hall-Long's record stands in stark contrast to her opponent, Matt Meyer. As county executive, Meyer faced multiple lawsuits from women who claimed they experienced years of sexual harassment during his tenure. His administration has been marred by allegations of unethical behavior, including threats to withhold funding and pay-for-play political games.  Bethany, on the other hand, has a proven track record of supporting reproductive rights, growing the healthcare workforce, and advocating for the needs of Delawareans. She is the only candidate in the race with a consistent voting record on democratic issues and has co-sponsored over 1,000 bills during her time in the state legislature.  A Champion for Delaware's Future  Bethany Hall-Long is committed to continuing her advocacy for the Delaware Corporate Franchise, which provides a significant portion of the state's budget revenues. Unlike her opponent, who aligns with interests that threaten to dismantle the Chancery Court, Bethany will ensure that Delaware's economic stability and growth are maintained.  In conclusion, Bethany Hall-Long's extensive experience, dedication to public service, and bold vision for Delaware make her the ideal candidate for Governor. Her commitment to education, healthcare, and economic growth will ensure a prosperous future for all Delawareans. As Governor, Bethany Hall-Long will lead with integrity, compassion, and a deep understanding of the needs of her community.
