# Corporate Whistleblower Center Urges a Nursing Home RN in Any State to Call About Rewards If in 2020-2021-The Home's Ownership Got a PPP Loan-And Never Added Staff-We will Know if They Received One

WASHINGTON, DC, July 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to the Corporate Whistleblower Center, "We are urging nursing home-long term care facility RN, manager or staff anywhere in the nation to call us at 866-714-6466, if in 2020 or 2021 they worked at an extremely short-staffed facility, and nothing changed with respect to staffing during this time frame. The reason we want to talk to a person like this is because even if they don't know-we will know if their nursing home-long term care employer received a Paycheck Protection Program-PPP loan. We simply want to identify staff who saw the short staffing firsthand. If the workplace received one of these PPP loans and there was no significant change in staffing the whistleblower rewards might exceed $100,000+.  "We consider the Paycheck Protection Program loans that went to nursing homes across the USA to be some of the biggest instances of fraud in US history. We have discovered numerous instances where entire nursing home chains received more than ten million dollars, and they never spent a dime of their Paycheck Protection Program loans on beefing up staff. These types of facilities were frequently owned by wealthy investors, private equity firms or venture capital firms.   "If you worked as a RN, manager or staff member at a nursing home-long term care facility in 2020-2021 please give us a call at 866-714-6466-if your workplace was extremely short staffed. The whistleblower rewards for this type of information might be significant-if the facility received a PPP loan." https://CorporateWhistleblowerCenter.Com  Some Basic Rules for Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program Loans in 2020-2021:  * 60% of the loan proceeds were supposed to be spent on payroll-staff.  * A company could not have more than 500 employees.  * The loan was supposed to be necessary.  As a background in the Paycheck Protection Program loan fraud according to the Center for Medicare Advocacy, "Nursing home staffing levels increased in only minimal ways after nursing facilities received hundreds of thousands of dollars in PPP funds. Where did the rest of the PPP money go? How did facilities spend the bulk of the $10.5 billion that they received in PPP funds?"  The Corporate Whistleblower Center considers Paycheck Protection Program-PPP loan fraud involving nursing homes, long term care facilities and some healthcare companies to be some of the worst instances of misuse of taxpayer money in US history.  A nursing-long term care facility manager or RN with information-specifics about severe short staffing at their facility in 2020 or 2021 are encouraged to call the Corporate Whistleblower Center anytime at 866-714-6466. The group wants RNs or nursing home managers to know that Paycheck Protection Program loan fraud is very, very easy to prove if their workplace received one. All calls are confidential. https://CorporateWhistleblowerCenter.Com
