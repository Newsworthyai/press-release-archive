# Sippi Kutz Barbershop Opens at Salon & Spa Galleria

FORT WORTH, TX, July 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After being let down time and again by the barbers he'd tried, Marlon Johnson was "tired of people butchering my head." When he decided to attend Mid Cities Barber College, he not only discovered a talent for barbering, but he also discovered a true passion for the work.  Today, with more than 20 years of experience under his belt, Marlon Johnson is proud to announce the opening of his brand new shop, Sippi Kutz Barbershop, located in Suite #500 of the Salon and Spa Galleria at 1501 Airport Freeway in Fort Worth, Texas.  Sippi Kutz Barbershop will serve men, women, and children with all types of hairstyles. In addition to traditional services, the shop will offer custom fades, cornrows, all types of braids, straight razor shaves, ladies pixie kits, and much more. Marlon, who has become known for his expert braiding skills, is also an instructor for professionals interested in learning the techniques.  Normal hours for the shop are Monday thru Saturday from 10am to 7pm "but flexible," said Marlon. Although walk-ins are always welcome, appointments are suggested and can easily be made by calling/texting (817) 501-4567. To honor veterans and senior citizens, Sippi Kutz Barbershop will offer $20 haircuts on Monday and Tuesday of each week.  Marlon Johnson is also happy to consult with clients regarding the best way to maintain their hair and the various options available when considering a new look. Whatever the service, he takes pride in doing everything possible to meet and exceed his clients' needs. By choosing to lease an upscale space at Salon and Spa Galleria, Johnson joins a group of small business owners who are each able to offer professional and specialized services to their clients in their own private suite.
