# EXIT FACTOR FUELS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITH FIVE NEW FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, August 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exit Factor™, the leading franchise in business value enhancement and exit planning, today announced the signing of five franchise agreements and expansion of its corporate team. This growth will strengthen the company's footprint in Texas, with a new location coming to the Dallas market. Exit Factor is also making entry into the Northeast and Midwest regions, with development in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, and expanding its presence in the Southeast with its first location in Florida. The company has signed 15 agreements to date this year.  The strategic growth comes in response to increasing demand for Exit Factor's specialized services, which help business owners maximize their company's value and plan for successful exits, and underscores the brand's accelerated development efforts since launching its franchise program just last year. With these new agreements, Exit Factor is poised to bring its proven methodologies and expert guidance to even more entrepreneurs across the United States.  "We're thrilled to welcome our new franchisees and expand Exit Factor's reach into these dynamic markets," said Jessica Fialkovich, founder and President of Exit Factor. "Our mission has always been to empower business owners with the knowledge and strategies they need to build valuable, exit-ready companies. This expansion allows us to support even more entrepreneurs in achieving their long-term goals and securing their financial futures."  To support its rapid growth, Exit Factor has also expanded its corporate team. The company has hired Chloe Martin to serve as Communications Manager and promoted additional leaders from within, elevating Melissa Nunez to Director of Operations and Thomas McKeen to Development Director.  "As we continue to grow, it's crucial that we have the right team in place to support our franchisees and maintain the high standards of service our clients expect," Fialkovich added. "Chloe, Melissa, and Thomas bring valuable skills and experience that will be instrumental in our next phase of growth."  The rapid growth of Exit Factor's franchise network demonstrates the attractiveness of its business model. Franchisees benefit from a proven system, comprehensive training, and ongoing support in a high-demand industry.  Diane Warsoff, owner of Exit Factor of SLC & Utah County, purchased Exit Factor's first franchise territory in late 2023. Recognizing the potential for success in her market, she purchased three additional territories in Salt Lake County and has quickly established Exit Factor as a leading resource in Salt Lake City's thriving business community. Her efforts have helped propel Exit Factor's franchise success and were recently recognized at United Franchise Group's World Expo, where Warsoff was honored with the Pioneer Award for her impressive achievements.  "Joining Exit Factor as its first franchisee has been an incredible journey," said Warsoff. "The support and systems provided by the Exit Factor team have been instrumental in my success. There's a real need for these services in every market, and I'm proud to be part of a network that's making a significant impact on local business communities."  Exit Factor's new locations in Texas, New York, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Florida are slated to launch operations in the coming months. The brand is also expecting continued momentum and projecting 10 more franchise agreements to be signed by the end of 2024.  "Our projected growth for the remainder of this year and into 2025 reflects the strong demand for our services and the appeal of our franchise opportunity," added Fialkovich. "We're excited to continue our expansion and bring Exit Factor's valuable expertise to business owners across the country."
