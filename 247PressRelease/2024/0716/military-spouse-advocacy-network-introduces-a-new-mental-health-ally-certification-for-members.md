# MILITARY SPOUSE ADVOCACY NETWORK INTRODUCES A NEW MENTAL HEALTH ALLY CERTIFICATION FOR MEMBERS

SAN ANTONIO, TX, July 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In celebration of National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month, Military Spouse Advocacy Network proudly announces the debut of a new Mental Health Ally Certification, presented by USAA, created exclusively for eligible MSAN members through our trusted partner, Psych Hub.  This exciting new initiative follows certification previously granted only to MSAN volunteers. Now, in alignment with the organization's mission, we are empowering more military spouses even further by offering this certification to active participants of MSAN's mentorship program.   There are six requirements to obtain the Mental Health Ally Certification, including joining and participating in the Mentorship HUB and actively communicating with an assigned MSMP mentor. For more details about eligibility, lessons learned and to be paired with a mentor, review the list at https://www.militaryspouseadvocacynetwork.org/mentorship-hub.  MSAN pioneered and continuously provides a structured and personal approach through a one-of-a-kind peer-to-peer mentorship experience within our proprietary Membership HUB, available 24/7. A recent member survey revealed that military-connected spouses need more mental health support:   82% of surveyed members said the challenges that they've encountered as a military spouse have affected their mental health or overall wellness.  93% of respondents said military spouses and families need additional mental health support. 96% of respondents said they would benefit from mental health training and resources.  The new mental health ally training better serves MSAN members and helps to address mental health resource shortages. Participants will benefit from Psych Hub's evidence-based professional training, which supports a more compassionate and mentally fit volunteer force. Psych Hub owns a library of over 1,000 digital assets, including short videos, shareable content, and podcasts.   From Verenice Castillo, MSAN Founder & CEO "The intent of these certifications is to support military spouses, their families, and their communities as a whole. Throughout the years, we have gathered testimonies and data that reflect the need for meaningful mental health support. Our commitment to support, empower and educate military spouses, brought us to this point. We are building an army of first emotional responders that will bring immediate and long term impact. The mental health allies will fill the gap between the moment a military spouse needs support and the time they receive professional services. We are thankful to have USAA's trust and support to bring change to a community in need."
