# Corporate Whistleblower Center Urges a Nursing Home Manager-RN To Call to See if Their Employer Received a PPP Loan in 2020-2021-If they Did & They Never Staffed Up-The Rewards May Exceed $100,000+++

WASHINGTON, DC, July 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to the Corporate Whistleblower Center, "We have by far the most aggressive initiative in the nation focused on nursing homes-long term care facilities nationwide that received a Paycheck Protection Program-PPP loan during 2020-2021 because of COVID and then never spent at least 60% of the loan proceeds on staffing or staff retention. We are reaching out to nursing home-long term care facility managers or registered nurses who worked at an extremely short-staffed facility during 2020-2021 who know their facility received a PPP loan. If the facility did receive one of these loans and did not beef up staffing by spending at least 60% of the loan proceeds on employee retention call us at 866-714-6466. The whistleblower rewards for this type of information might exceed $100,000-or a lot more.  "If you were a nursing home-long term care facility manager or RN anywhere in the USA and your facility was extremely short staffed in 2020-2021 and you do not know if your workplace's ownership received a Paycheck Protection Program-PPP loan, just call us at 866-714-6466. We will know almost instantly if they did receive a PPP loan. If the ownership of your facility owned more than one nursing home-long term care facility and they all received a PPP loan because of COVID the whistleblower rewards might be hundreds of thousands of dollars-or more. All calls are strictly confidential. We want to emphasize PPP loan fraud is super easy to prove." https://CorporateWhistleblowerCenter.Com  Some Basic Rules for Paycheck Protection Program Loans in 2020-2021:  * 60% of the loan proceeds were supposed to be spent on payroll-staff.  * A company could not have more than 500 employees.  * The loan was supposed to be necessary.  As a background in the Paycheck Protection Program loan fraud according to the Center for Medicare Advocacy, "In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), to make loans to employers to keep workers employed during the pandemic (and to pay "other eligible expenses"). Most of the loan money could be forgiven, meaning that repayment was not required, if at least 60 % of the proceeds were spent on payroll.   "Nursing home staffing levels increased in only minimal ways after nursing facilities received hundreds of thousands of dollars in PPP funds. Where did the rest of the PPP money go? How did facilities spend the bulk of the $10.5 billion that they received in PPP funds?"  The Corporate Whistleblower Center considers Paycheck Protection Program-PPP loan fraud involving nursing homes, long term care facilities and some healthcare companies to be some of the worst instances of misuse of taxpayer money in US history. This initiative is nationwide-from New Jersey to Washington State, Texas, Minnesota, California, Illinois, Ohio, Florida, New York, Georgia-in any US State. A nursing-long term care facility manager or RN with information-specifics are encouraged to call the Corporate Whistleblower Center anytime at 866-714-6466. All calls are confidential. https://CorporateWhistleblowerCenter.Com
