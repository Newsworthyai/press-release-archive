# DB Wealth Institute's AI Innovation Journey with Cillian Miller

CLIFTON, NJ, July 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On a chilly morning in late 2018, Cillian Miller, dean of DB Wealth Institute, sat at his antique desk, eyes fixed on stock market charts. Outside, snow covered the streets, but the market's sharp downturn felt colder. A close friend and seasoned Wall Street investor had fallen into despair due to the market's swings. Miller, reflecting on their past vibrant discussions, realized many investors lacked a deep market understanding, driven by short-term emotions.  With degrees from Yale and ETH Zurich, plus a CFA certification, Miller had intimate market knowledge. He decided to create a disruptive investment system, combining quantitative trading with AI to help investors navigate turbulent markets. Thus, "AI Financial Navigator 4.0" was born.  Miller aimed to transform the financial system by issuing tokens through the cryptocurrency market, appealing to the tech-savvy younger generation. He chose ABTCOIN, a burgeoning exchange with NASDAQ ambitions, for the Initial DEX Offering (IDO) of DB Wealth Institute's token, DBW. This strategic move highlighted Miller's vision for financial technology's future.  The successful fundraising attracted top talent, accelerating the development of "AI Financial Navigator 4.0." As AI technology evolved, Miller's team pushed the system to new heights. By issuing the DBW token, Miller addressed immediate financing needs and set a solid foundation for continued fintech innovation. DB Wealth Institute established a leadership position in global fintech, opening a new chapter in financial technology's future.
