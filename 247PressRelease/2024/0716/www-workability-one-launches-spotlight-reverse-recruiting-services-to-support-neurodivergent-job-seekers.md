# www.workability.one Launches Spotlight Reverse Recruiting Services to Support Neurodivergent Job Seekers

BEND, OR, July 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- workability LLC, a disability inclusion employment firm, has launched a unique new reverse recruiting service, where it advocates for and submits applications on behalf of a job seeker.  "We're starting this service because the most common question we receive in our job board inbox is, 'Can you please help my son or daughter find and keep a job?'" said Sheila Salido Jordan, founder and managing director of workability.  Maintaining gainful employment can often be a source of friction between a neurodivergent adult and their parents, especially if they are living under the same roof. "Email requests continue to increase as the job market tightens, so we developed this program to assist neurodivergent adults who struggle to transition to the workforce."  The Spotlight monthly subscription service is available in the United States and Canada, and includes:  - Surveying and interviewing the job seeker to determine career interests and skill levels - Recommending job pathways and or vocations - Suggesting specific training or coursework that may make the job seeker a more attractive candidate for their dream job - Writing a customized resume tailored for up to five different types of jobs - Writing a customized cover letter tailored for up to five different employers - Searching job postings, reviewing job qualifications and requirements to identify opportunities best-suited for the job seeker. - Applying for a minimum of 10 different jobs well-suited to the job seeker's skill-level and career interests. We will maintain a spreadsheet that will be sent to you at the end of each month summarizing the progress that's been made in the prior four weeks. - Scheduling the job seeker's interview and sending reminders to ensure they show up on time. - Sending customized emails or handwritten thank-you notes on the job seeker's behalf after an interview takes place. - Provide coaching and guidance for up to three months after they've started their new job.  "The most time-consuming and overwhelming part of a job search isn't the job interview – it's searching postings and submitting applications," explained Jordan. "We hope we can alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for neurodivergent job seekers by taking the busy work and paperwork off of their plates. And their parents will know that they are in good hands while we help spearhead their job search."  The monthly subscription service is US$750 per month with a three-month minimum, which would net 30 submitted applications for the job seeker. "We recognize this pricing may be a barrier but it reflects the true cost of our time investment in a candidate," said Jordan.   Some job seekers may be able to seek reimbursement from their county I/DD department for a portion of these costs.  To sign up, visit the link here https://www.workability.one/pricing and scroll to the bottom right corner and select "Reverse Recruiting Services." Fill out the form on the next page (disregard the "Employer Sign Up" heading – we weren't able to modify it for this purpose), submit your payment information, and we'll help the job seeker kick off a new career search adventure.  "We can provide highly individualized resumes, cover letters and applications, and conduct mock interviews to enhance a candidate's hireability but we cannot guarantee they'll be hired or stay hired," added Jordan. "At the end of the day, it's the candidate's day-to-day performance that will determine their success on the job."  Disclaimer: The purpose of this service is to maximize the job seekers' opportunities for employment by creating and executing an effective career plan on their behalf. Workability cannot guarantee employment or length of employment, as it is ultimately the job seeker's responsibility to perform well during job interviews and on the job in order to maintain successful employment.  Unleash the Power of Disability Representation in DEI. workabillity LLC operates www.workability.one, a niche job board that connects neurodiverse, autistic and disabled talent with inclusive employers worldwide. Founded in 2021 by the mom of two neurodiverse teens, workability is an authentic grassroots movement to increase employment opportunities through our job board, vocational rehabilitation and youth transition services, and national Ticket-to-Work job placement program. We walk the talk: 75% of workability's staff is neurodivergent, or cares for a family member experiencing disability. Who better to help you reach this untapped talent pool?
