# Phenyx Pro Unveils PTL Series Mixers: A New Level of Flexibility and Performance

SAN DIEGO, CA, October 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Phenyx Pro is excited toÂ introduce its new PTL Series mixing consoles, featuring the PTL-600 (6-channel) and PTL-800 (8-channel) models. Compared to previous mixer models, the PTL Series offers enhanced input/output capabilities and more advanced, flexible routing options, making it suitable for a wider range of professional applications.   Extensive Connectivity  The PTL Series mixers come equipped with 4 or 6 dedicated XLR and TRS inputs, allowing seamless connection to a variety of audio sources. The AUX outputs, with pre-fader/post-fader sends, enable customized monitor mixes independent of the main output. For live streaming or recording, the BUS outputs offer a separate mix without affecting the main audio. Dual stereo headphone outputs make real-time monitoring convenient for two users, ideal for collaboration. Additionally, the three XLR main outputs (L, R, and Sub) provide balanced stereo sound to the main PA, with the Sub output delivering enhanced low frequencies when connected to a subwoofer.  Advanced Routing  Building on the versatile input/output options of the PTL Series, its advanced routing capabilities take flexibility to the next level.   Users can choose between pre-fader and post-fader AUX sends, offering tailored control over monitor mixes and supplemental sound reinforcement. Pre-fader AUX sends ensure that performers receive monitor signals unaffected by the main fader levels, while post-fader AUX sends provide consistent volume relative to the main output, ideal for balanced sound distribution across different zones.  The BUS control simplifies complex mixes by enabling you to group channels with the press of a button. This makes it easy to manage multiple channels, such as grouping all drum mics under one BUS, allowing collective volume control with a single fader. The BUS auxiliary tracks add even more routing flexibility, perfect for live sound setups, where personalized mixes can be sent to various zones or used for recording.  Furthermore, the SUB output features a sweepable low-pass filter (adjustable from 50Hz to 450Hz), ensuring only low-frequency signal reach your subwoofer. This delivers powerful, controlled bass for venues with insufficient low-frequency response, enriching the audio experience with enhanced depth and clarity.  Diverse Effects  Continuing with its impressive routing capabilities, the PTL Series also delivers diverse effects to enhance your audio with precision and versatility.   The 3-band EQ on each channel allows for fine-tuning of high, mid, and low frequencies, ensuring a balanced and distinct mix.  You can easily integrate external effects using the FX SEND & RTN function, expanding your sound palette and adding unique textures to your mix.  For quick audio enhancements, the mixer offers 16 built-in DSP effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, and more, allowing you to effortlessly incorporate professional-grade effects into your setup.   Each channel is also equipped with individual +48V phantom power, ensuring optimal performance for condenser microphones with clear, low-noise audio capture.  Wireless Streaming  To round off its comprehensive feature set, the PTL Series offers Bluetooth Streaming and USB Connectivity for seamless audio integration.   Stream music wirelessly with ease using the built-in Bluetooth functionality and experience high-fidelity recording and playback with the USB-B/2.0 connection, boasting a 48kHz/24bit sampling rate. With excellent compatibility, the PTL can be used with a MacBook for seamless recording.
