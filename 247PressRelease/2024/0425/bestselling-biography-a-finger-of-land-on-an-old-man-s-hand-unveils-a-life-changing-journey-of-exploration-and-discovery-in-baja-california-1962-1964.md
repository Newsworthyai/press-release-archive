# Bestselling Biography, A Finger of Land on An Old Man's Hand, Unveils A Life-Changing Journey of Exploration and Discovery in Baja California, 1962-1964

WILMINGTON, NC, April 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Earl Vincent de Berge's bestselling memoir, 'A Finger of Land on An Old Man's Hand,' offers a riveting account of his 1962-64 odyssey through Baja California, inspired by Joseph Wood Krutch's 'The Forgotten Peninsula.' This vivid narrative transports readers into the wild terrains of 1960s Baja, where rugged mountains, verdant oases, and stark deserts meet the expansive ocean and a group of youthful explorers. It is a remarkable tale that describes the trip we all wish we had taken in our youth.  Captured through eloquent prose and stunning, previously unseen photographs, the book recounts the four explorers' encounters with diverse wildlife, the warmth of frontier families, and the fury of Pacific storms. This backdrop sets the stage for a compelling saga of survival and personal transformation, featuring characters like gold prospectors and reclusive hermits, whose stories of resilience and discovery are interwoven with thrilling challenges, adventure and spiritual transformation.  "I was born in a cactus patch called Arizona," notes Earl. "At every turn, this desert, in its unforgiving and unhurried way, instructs me on the importance of patience and balance in all things we do that affect the natural world, and especially the delicate, balanced ecology in deserts. So for me," de Berge added, "the principal message I draw from 80 years of exploring desert ecologies is the imperative for mankind to learn to see nature as a partner to be protected and nourished, not merely as an asset to be exploited."  One reviewer called the book, ". . . a beautifully written, fabulous tale of an incredibly brave and daring journey." ReaderViews, in their 5-star review said, "A Finger of Land on an Old Man's Hand by Earl Vincent de Berge is the stark, witty, and profound memoir of four college students testing their limits on the Baja Peninsula in the summer of 1962. One could think of this as the classic literary assignment, 'How I Spent My Summer Vacation.' Only to do so would be to grossly underestimate this narrative."  Earl's adventures in Baja deepened his youthful fascination with the Sonoran Desert and its plants and animals, and inspired him to write a collection of charming stories for young readers. The main characters are Big Ears Jack – a huge magician jackrabbit – and other animals, birds and plants of the Sonoran Desert and its coastal regions. "Big Ears Jack and Friends," will be published this summer.  Earl also published three collections of his poems, "Allegro to Life," "Swans to Carry Me," and "Wind in the Elephant Tree," which touch on nature, human nature, love, desert silence, and life in Guatemala.  All of de Berge's books are available at Amazon and other online book retailers.
