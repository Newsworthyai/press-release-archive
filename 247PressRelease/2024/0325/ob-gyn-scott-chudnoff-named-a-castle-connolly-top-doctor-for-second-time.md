He excels in office-based procedures and the full gamut of minimally invasive gynecological surgeries, such as laparoscopic hysterectomy and myectomy.  "As a surgeon, I made a big part of my career creating and offering the least invasive approach possible — and when possible, avoiding surgery," Dr. Chudnoff says.  "I treat patients as patients, not as conditions. I take a holistic approach, treating the whole person, not just the issue she is visiting me for that day."  Certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, he is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  In addition to his clinical, administrative, and research activities, Dr. Chudnoff is a professor at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University.

His research has been published in many journals and he has presented at conferences around the world.   Dr. Chudnoff earned his medical degree at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He completed both a four-year obstetrics and gynecology residency and a fellowship in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery at Montefiore Einstein Campus.  He also holds a master's degree in clinical science (clinical research and biostatistics) from the Sue Golding School of Biomedical Sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  "I appreciate being named a Castle Connolly Top Doctor," Dr. Chudnoff says.
