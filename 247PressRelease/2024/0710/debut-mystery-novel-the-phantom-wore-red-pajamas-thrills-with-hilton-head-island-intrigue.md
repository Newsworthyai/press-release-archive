# Debut Mystery Novel "The Phantom Wore Red Pajamas" Thrills with Hilton Head Island Intrigue

CHARLESTON, SC, July 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Set in the fictional Live Oaks Active Senior Community on Hilton Head Island, the novel follows amateur sleuths Lottie Carter and her husband Arthur as they investigate the suspicious death of a renowned orchestra conductor known as "The Maestro." With the help of their lively friend Minuet ("Minnie") and a retired police officer, the couple navigates a labyrinth of secrets and eccentric suspects to uncover the truth behind the supposed suicide.   "I'm thrilled to share this twisty tale with readers," said Doucette. "The Lowcountry setting and the lively characters at Live Oaks are sure to resonate with mystery fans, especially those dreaming of retirement in South Carolina's coastal communities."   Doucette, a retired teacher, drew inspiration for the novel from her own experiences living in the Sun City Hilton Head Retirement Community and her love of classic whodunits with a humorous twist. "The Phantom Wore Red Pajamas" is the first in a planned series featuring the adventures of Lottie, Arthur, Minnie, and their cohorts at Live Oaks.   "The Phantom Wore Red Pajamas" is now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book formats at Amazon and independent bookstores throughout South Carolina.
