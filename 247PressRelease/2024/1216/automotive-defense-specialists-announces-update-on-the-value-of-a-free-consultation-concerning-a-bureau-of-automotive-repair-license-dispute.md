# Automotive Defense Specialists Announces Update on the Value of a Free Consultation Concerning a Bureau of Automotive Repair License Dispute

LOS ANGELES, CA, December 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Automotive Defense Specialists, a California-based law firm servicing auto repair and SMOG technicians and shops, is proud to announce new details on consultation options available with the firm. A quick, easy, confidential and free consultation, as announced by the law firm, could be the best next step.  "We empathize with California's SMOG test and auto repair shops. They have to budget to cover their bills and pay their staff. Some months can be a struggle. The last thing they need to worry about is how to cover that first legal consultation when they receive a Bureau of Auto Repair action," stated William Ferreira, lead attorney at Automotive Defense Specialists. "Our free consultation option helps them get initial information quickly and easily, so that they can decide whether or not to continue with a fully paid service."  Auto repair and SMOG testing professionals can find newly updated details at the link https://automotivedefense.com/consultation/. Automotive Defense Specialists is a law firm serving the automotive repair industry, including smog testing shops, SMOG technicians, and locally owned "mom-and-pop" car repair shops. William Ferreira, the lead attorney, founded the firm. The Automotive Defense Team helps smog businesses fight against an accusation, citation, suspension (https://automotivedefense.com/about/services/bureau-of-automotive-repair-star-invalidation-cases/), or even criminal action from the Bureau of Automotive Repair (https://bar.ca.gov/). Often the repair shop or technician does not know the legal status of an action; that is not necessary, as the newly announced free consultation option means that an attorney can perform an initial review and explanation.  The law firm specializes in STAR suspensions and has been known to be at the forefront of California's auto repair and SMOG industry. A Bureau of Automotive Repair license dispute can result in heavy fines and possibly revoke a valuable license. A complimentary consultation from an attorney focused on SMOG testing cases can help STAR program participants and technicians receive valuable legal support.  The firm has managed over fifty interim suspension order hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings via the Department of General Services (DGS). Hearings have occurred in San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Oakland. The costs to operate a SMOG or auto repair shop may be substantial, and an expensive dispute over a Bureau of Automotive Repair license may be a significant burden. Seeking legal assistance does not have to be costly, however. A professional team of attorneys can offer a 'budget-friendly' initial consultation to determine the best course of action, if any.
