# Introducing AImail™ - A Fully Managed Marketing Solution Designed for Financial Institutions

HUNTSVILLE, AL, December 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As financial institutions face increasing pressure to deliver personalized communications at scale, DeepTarget introduces AImail™, a groundbreaking full-service solution that enables community banks and credit unions to achieve enterprise-level marketing services. This surprisingly affordable service leverages AI-powered email automation to help financial institutions meet their growing communication challenges.  The launch of AImail™ builds upon DeepTarget's mission to democratize enterprise-level marketing capabilities for community financial institutions. This solution, available immediately, comes with transparent, results-based pricing that aligns with community institution budgets.  "You've got me sold!", said Tina Paradissis, Marketing Coordinator at Holy Rosary Credit Union in Kansas City, MO. "This will be an amazing new capability for us at Holy Rosary Credit Union. AImail will make my job so much easier!"  Email marketing remains one of the most cost-effective digital channels for financial institutions, consistently delivering strong returns on investment while maintaining the personal connection that community banks and credit unions value. Further, email reaches accountholders who rarely visit branches and others who don't access digital banking. However, community financial institutions have traditionally been challenged by limited resources, complex compliance requirements, and insufficient data analytics capabilities.  AImail™ eliminates these barriers by combining DeepTarget's patented AI technology with deep financial services expertise in the form of fractional digital marketing experts who deliver the following benefits monthly on behalf of the financial institution: •	Compliance-first personalization and regulator-friendly content tailored to individual account holders. •	Targeting Optimization using AI and data insights help identify the best audience for each campaign's maximum impact. This includes predictive analytics that identify the optimal products to offer each account holder based on their financial journey. •	Distinctive, captivating banner ads that utilize sophisticated Gen AI images and messages created with DeepTarget's ADbuzz™ technology and embedded in each email campaign for amplified engagement.  •	Streamlined Campaigns: From content creation to execution - all managed seamlessly and designed to expand email engagement rates by up to 300%. •	Beyond vanity metrics, built-in ROI tracking and reporting designed specifically for financial institution metrics include tracking influenced product sales, revenue and new balances generated due to the campaigns.  "While new channels emerge constantly, email remains the most universal and trusted way to reach account holders," said Preetha Pulusani, CEO of DeepTarget. "Nearly every adult with a bank account has an email address, and not all of them visit branches or use digital banking. They expect to receive important financial communications through this channel. What makes AImail revolutionary is its ability to transform these routine touchpoints into meaningful, personalized conversations that drive engagement and growth. What used to take marketing teams weeks to accomplish now happens with our experts using AImail on behalf of financial institutions, with robust results and strong compliance controls."
