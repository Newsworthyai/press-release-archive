# Young Family Loves The Lifestyle Ease At Valencia

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, December 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tony and Candy Straight lived in Fillmore before they found Valencia by FivePoint, and their new home at Marigold. "New home availability was a big reason to come and check it out," said Tony. "We found that, plus a great lifestyle."   Marigold by Lennar provided two-story detached homes to consider and proved to be the winning neighborhood for the Straights. Both Tony and Candy appreciated being able to live in a large new home with ample living spaces and bedrooms, and the design versatility that accommodated a home office.   This space is especially handy for two busy people who work from home. Tony is a career coach and Candy has launched Flamingo Box Co., a new e-commerce enterprise that specializes in gifting solutions for all types of circumstances, Candy said. "We have gifts for every occasion, including life's struggles and losses, as well as for all of the happy times!"   Family Times—The Straights have two sons, ages 2 and 6, and Valencia's family focus was a delightful discovery. "We love our neighbors, and the boys love it, and we all love all of the incredible events here, like the Easter Egg hunt," said Candy. "Every month there is something new and fun and offered with a high level of professionalism that helps you enjoy the entire event."  From Here To There—travel to and from their new community is a breeze for the Straights. "Many important destinations are in this area, and the drive to and from Fillmore just got to be too much for us," said Candy. "We are 4 minutes instead of 35 minutes from church now, and that's just one example of the ease this community offers. We love it!"  Community Feeling— Valencia's many choices for activities and neighborly interaction have also proven themselves to Candy and Tony, with many internal points finding favor with the family. Valencia's open space features Confluence Park, an award-winning core amenity.   Places to play here include open lawn areas for free form enjoyment, an adventure playground, trails, an array of pools, and the clubhouse, with indoor/outdoor seating and dining spaces. The community plan also features 10,000 acres of permanently protected open space.   "This place is a real collection, not just a collection of homes," said Tony. "The kids have great playgrounds, we all have Confluence Park and its pools and grounds, and there are lots of great places to spend time throughout the community. We practically live in the pool!"  "This place offers a vision for our children," added Candy. "They are really enjoying their lives here, and of course that makes our lives better, too."  Valencia offers a wide selection of new home choices in collections by some of the nation's most prominent builders.
