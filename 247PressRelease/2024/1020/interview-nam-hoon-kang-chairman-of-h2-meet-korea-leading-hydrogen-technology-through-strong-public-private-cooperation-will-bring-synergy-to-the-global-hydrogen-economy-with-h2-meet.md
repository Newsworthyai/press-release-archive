# [Interview] Nam-Hoon Kang, Chairman of H2 MEET: "Korea, Leading Hydrogen Technology Through Strong Public-Private Cooperation, Will Bring Synergy to the Global Hydrogen Economy with H2 MEET"

GOYANG, KOREA, October 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- South Korea's largest hydrogen industry exhibition, H2 MEET 2024, successfully concluded on September 27 after a three-day run at KINTEX in Goyang City.  This year's event, held from September 25 to 27, saw 317 companies and organizations from 24 countries participating across three main sectors: hydrogen production, storage and transportation, and utilization. The exhibition drew over 41,000 visitors, cementing its leading global hydrogen expo status.  Major hydrogen industry players such as Hyundai Motor Group, Korea Zinc, Kolon Industries, HD Hyundai Infracore, NK Tech, Hylium Industries, Samjung ENC, and Donghwa Entec participated in the exhibition. Global companies, including Robert Bosch Korea and Emerson, also set up booths to showcase their latest technologies and achievements.  Visitors could experience the future of hydrogen-powered mobility firsthand, with hydrogen buses, trucks, tractors, drones, and trams on display. A special hydrogen refueling station zone allowed attendees to observe the actual refueling process through exhibited equipment such as tube trailers and liquid tankers.  Regional and national pavilions showcased hydrogen industry models from various locations, including Gangwon, Gwangju, Gyeonggi, Ulsan, and Pohang. International pavilions from countries like Canada, Australia, and Switzerland presented technological advances and explored collaboration opportunities.  The event featured numerous side events, including the Leaders Summit, where over 150 hydrogen industry leaders and experts spoke; the Country Day sessions, which highlighted the hydrogen strategies of 12 countries; and the H2 Innovation Awards. There was also a global partnership consultation event, co-hosted with KOTRA, aimed at promoting the overseas expansion of South Korean hydrogen companies.  With strong attendance from media outlets such as Interesting Engineering (USA), Sohu (China), H2 Mobile (France), Solarquarter (India), and H2 Energy News (Bosnia and Herzegovina), H2 MEET continues to strengthen its reputation as a key platform in the hydrogen industry.  Q: Varun Gulati, Editor of Solarquarter: Compared to electric vehicles, hydrogen mobility seems to be stagnating. How is the South Korean industry and government responding to this?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang, Chairman of H2 MEET: Indeed, hydrogen vehicle production and sales are far behind electric vehicles. Scaling the market is the key to addressing the high costs and limited accessibility of hydrogen mobility, but the initial steps have been challenging.  The South Korean government is offering subsidies to hydrogen vehicle buyers, supporting the construction and operation of hydrogen refueling stations, and reducing production costs for hydrogen vehicles. These efforts aim to expand the market and lower product prices.  In line with the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target, South Korea plans to supply 300,000 hydrogen vehicles and 660 hydrogen refueling stations by 2030. Currently, we are at 30,000 vehicles—just a tenth of the goal—but we still have six years to meet the target, and the outlook remains positive.  Moreover, the focus has shifted from passenger cars like the NEXO to commercial vehicles such as buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and ships requiring more hydrogen. This focus presents new opportunities for hydrogen production companies and helps improve the efficiency of refueling infrastructure.  Q: Kapil Kajal, U.S. Editor at Interesting Engineering: Are there any technical challenges hindering the growth of the hydrogen sector, and what policies are being implemented to address them?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: The biggest challenge lies with green hydrogen, considered the ideal clean hydrogen. Every aspect—from the renewable energy required for production to the electrolysis solutions and storage—carries significant costs.  The South Korean government is encouraging the development and operation of renewable energy-based power plants by purchasing electricity produced from green hydrogen. The government also proposes mandatory green hydrogen usage targets to stimulate demand and supply.  Companies like Iljin Hysolus and Korea Zinc are working on large-scale green hydrogen plants in Australia, supported by government efforts to build the initial market.  Q: Arnes Biogradlija, Editor of H2 Energy News: The U.S. recently announced plans to produce hydrogen at $1 per kW. How feasible is this target from your perspective?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: Producing 1 kW of green hydrogen in South Korea costs around $10, so the U.S. target seems unrealistic.  However, it's not impossible with continued support for the green hydrogen market. The South Korean system, where hydrogen producers sell electricity to power companies, and the government subsidizes it, helps offset the costs.  Though green hydrogen is expensive, ongoing innovations and market growth could lower costs, making the $1 target more achievable.  Q: Michaël Torregrossa, Editor of H2 Mobile: There's growing global interest in hydrogen internal combustion engines (ICE) over fuel cells for mobility. What is South Korea's stance on this?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: South Korea is investing in hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen internal combustion engines (ICE), closer to commercialization. We are pursuing both technologies to offer consumers a choice.  At this exhibition, companies such as HD Hyundai Infracore showcased hydrogen ICE for heavy machinery. While small hydrogen ICE for passenger cars is still developing, expanding product lines for heavy equipment is a promising direction.  Q: Jintong Zhou, Reporter at Sohu: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously criticized hydrogen energy. What is your response, and when do you see hydrogen becoming a major energy source?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: Musk's comments reflect his position as a leader in the electric vehicle industry. While electric vehicles currently have a price advantage, many of the challenges in the hydrogen mobility sector will likely be addressed through innovation.  In the long term, hydrogen is an ideal energy source for achieving carbon neutrality, and overcoming short-term price issues will make it competitive in mobility. South Korea already sees significant investments in hydrogen production to ensure energy independence.  For example, Hyundai has developed technology to produce hydrogen from plastic waste, and the government is funding research into nuclear hydrogen production using existing nuclear power plants.  Q: Arnes Biogradlija, Editor of H2 Energy News: Is South Korea exploring natural sources of 'white hydrogen'?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: While we would love to explore white hydrogen across the Korean peninsula, the likelihood of finding it here is low. However, there have been discoveries abroad, such as in the U.S., so we remain hopeful for future developments.  Q: Varun Gulati, Editor of Solarquarter: How do you see South Korea impacting the global hydrogen industry, and what role does H2 MEET play?  A: Nam-Hoon Kang: South Korea is committed to hydrogen energy and mobility, with clear policy goals for vehicle and refueling infrastructure deployment. The government supports the hydrogen industry through subsidies and resource management strategies, fostering early market formation.  South Korea is also leading efforts to expand green hydrogen infrastructure, with major companies like Hyundai, SK, and POSCO collaborating with global partners. H2 MEET is a key platform that helps strengthen public-private partnerships and international networks, ultimately advancing the global hydrogen economy.  H2 MEET is a specialized hydrogen industry exhibition for Korean and international companies and institutions involved in hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and utilization. From this year, H2 MEET aims to become a professional event that will enhance participation from global hydrogen industry companies, generate tangible results, and contribute to understanding South Korea's hydrogen economy ecosystem. Starting this year, it will be held in conjunction with H2WORLD and concurrently with the K-BATTERY SHOW 2024 and HARFKO (Heating Air Conditioning Refrigeration and Fluid Exhibition—Korea) 2024 at KINTEX 1.
