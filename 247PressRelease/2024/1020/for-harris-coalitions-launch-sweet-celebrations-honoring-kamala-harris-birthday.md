NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a joyful show of support for Vice President Kamala Harris' 60th birthday, several "For Harris" coalitions are coming together to inspire a sweet celebration across the country. This fun and delicious initiative calls on the community to engage in social banking, phone banking, and canvassing while celebrating with cake in honor of Kamala Harris.  From professional bakers to home chefs, there are three fun ways to join the "Cakes for Kamala" initiative:  1. Create a Cake for Kamala Participants are encouraged to bake a cake, post a photo online, and celebrate VP Kamala Harris' birthday with the hashtags #CakesForKamala and #HappyBirthdayKamala. Whether cutting the cake with friends or dropping it off at a local campaign office for volunteers, this sweet gesture helps build community support while spreading joy.  2. Recipe Submission Home bakers can submit original recipes in honor of Harris' birthday. With permission, Founders for Kamala will share these recipes online and across social media, with potential publication in print. Select recipes may even be used to raise funds for the Harris Victory Fund.  3. Commemorate with Professional Bakers Professional bakeries are invited to join in by offering cakes for sale or accommodating complimentary tastings to canvassers.
