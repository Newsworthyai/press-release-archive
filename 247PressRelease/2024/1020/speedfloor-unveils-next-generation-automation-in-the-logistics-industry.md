SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As digital transformation reshapes the logistics landscape, traditional manual methods are becoming obsolete. To address these challenges, South Korea's leading logistics technology firm, SpeedFloor Co., Ltd., introduces SpeedFloorâ€”an advanced loading space optimization solution designed to enhance cargo handling and transport efficiency.  SpeedFloor leverages real-time digital mapping to monitor truck interiors, enabling operators to track available space precisely. By identifying additional cargo that can be loaded en route, it maximizes space utilization and optimizes transportation routes, significantly improving operational efficiency while reducing unnecessary fuel consumption.

This innovation is especially valuable for U.S.-based logistics companies looking to reduce costs and meet the demand for energy-efficient transport in sectors like food and pharmaceuticals.  Mr. Hong, CEO of SpeedFloor stated, "The U.S. logistics market is a critical player in the global supply chain. As the industry shifts toward automation, the need for smarter, more efficient solutions has never been greater. SpeedFloor addresses these needs by streamlining operations and driving profitability for companies navigating complex logistics challenges."
