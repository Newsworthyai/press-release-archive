# Bestselling Author Donna Fletcher Crow, Renowned For Her Immaculate Approach To Research, Announces New Monastery Murder Mystery Novel - This Time She Is Taking Readers On The Journey With Her

WILMINGTON, NC, April 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Award-winning author Donna Fletcher Crow has announced a new novel in the Monastery Mystery series, 'A Wind in the Hebrides'. This time she will reveal, in serial form, the stories behind the writing of the book, and the research that serves as the basis. In a recent blog post she announced the project, and stated in part:  "One could say this book has been almost 30 years in the making. I don't remember exactly when a friend told me about the Hebrides Revival, but I know it was in the 1990s because our daughter, who is now a mother of six, was in high school at the time. I knew instantly, however, that this was a story I wanted to tell.  "I did the initial research in 2001 when my friend Evelyn Bennett and I set out on one of the first planes to leave Boise after 9/11 on the nearly 4,500-mile journey from Boise, Idaho, to Barvas, the Isle of Lewis, via London, Glasgow, Iona, and other stops. It was a wonderful trip that we still recall fondly. No book followed, however, as other projects intervened. At last, the time has come to tell the story.  "From the beginning of my 40-some year career my focus has been telling the history of British Christianity through the medium of mystery and romance novels. For the Monastery Murders my contemporary characters reveal the story through their travels. Father Antony Sherwood, a church history lecturer at a theological college run by monks in Yorkshire, loves to tell the colorful events of England's saints and heroes of the faith. His impetuous American wife Felicity is the one most likely to learn how events of the past can impact today—especially when the couple are thrown into solving murders.  "A Wind in the Hebrides, book 7 in the series, finds Felicity curbing her rash instincts now that she has their five-year-old son in tow. The challenges to her new circumspection increase when Antony remains behind on the jewel-like Isle of Iona peacefully walking in the footsteps of Saint Columba with a group of students while Felicity and young Teddy go on to the Island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Felicity is on assignment to learn about the Hebrides Awakening, but she is determined to make this a holiday for Teddy and a pleasant break for herself. After all, post-World War II events shouldn't be that difficult to uncover. And what danger could there possibly be?"  "Well, that remains to be seen—and my plan is to let my followers see it all as Antony and Felicity's story progresses. As the plot unfolds, I will publish a blog every few weeks to give readers peeks at the adventure—literally, as I will include as many photographs from my research trips as I can.  "It is always my goal to tell my stories in a way that takes my readers along with me—and I never write about a place I haven't been to myself. I am hoping that inviting you along as this story develops will add to the fun."
