SAN ANTONIO, TX, September 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ZeroMils, a social impact consulting company, and the Military Spouse Advocacy Network (MSAN), a leading military family nonprofit, are thrilled to announce a transformative strategic partnership, the Military Spouse Leadership Development Program Alumni Network (MSLDPAN). This collaboration will harness the combined strengths of both organizations to support and empower military spouses who have graduated from MSAN's Military Spouse Leadership Development Program (MSLDP).  What began as an informal mentorship between the founders of ZeroMils and MSAN has blossomed into a robust partnership rooted in shared missions, visions, and values. The new alliance will significantly enhance the opportunities for the 200 military spouses who have completed the MSLDP to realize their full potential and make impactful contributions within their communities.  The partnership will focus its efforts on the development of the Military Spouse Leadership Development Program Alumni Network â€” a dynamic and engaged community designed to foster collaboration and growth among its members. The MSLDPAN will meet monthly, providing a platform for alumni to connect, collaborate, and leverage their collective expertise and experiences to create stronger, thriving military families.  Key initiatives of the partnership include:  - Expert Insights and Mentorship: Bringing together thought leaders, advocates, and mentors from various sectors to share valuable insights and guidance, helping alumni enhance their leadership skills and achieve their goals.  - Prestigious Mentorship Opportunities: Creating a distinguished network of mentors sourced from corporate, nonprofit, and government sectors to offer tailored support and advice to MSLDP alumni.  - Enhanced Connectivity and Fellowship: Organizing both in-person and virtual events to strengthen relationships among alumni, highlight their leadership contributions, and provide ongoing opportunities for engagement and professional development.  Recent feedback from a survey of MSLDP alumni highlighted their desire for increased networking opportunities and continued professional growth. The survey revealed that: - 97% of alumni seek opportunities for in-person or online networking and relationship-building. - 98% are interested in attending virtual workshops and webinars to further develop their leadership skills. - Nearly 60% desire mentorship support to guide them through their ongoing leadership journeys.  MSAN and ZeroMils are committed to addressing these needs through their partnership, ensuring that alumni have the resources and connections necessary to thrive as leaders and advocates within their families, local communities, and the military-connected community overall.  According to Verenice Castillo, CEO of MSAN, "The knowledge, experience, and mentorship MSLDP Alumni bring will make a significant impact on their journeys, and those of their military spouse peers. Joining forces with ZeroMils will allow us to create a stronger military spouse community as we connect and thrive together!"
