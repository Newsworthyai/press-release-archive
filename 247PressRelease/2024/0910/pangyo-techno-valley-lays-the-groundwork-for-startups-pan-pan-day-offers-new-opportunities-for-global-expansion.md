PANGYO, KOREA, September 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pangyo Techno Valley facilitates global market entry for its local startups through the monthly 'Pan-Pan Day' event.

Pan-Pan Day offers various programs that provide practical help to startups. Key programs include IR pitching, one-on-one consultations, networking, and seminars. Monthly themes invite experts in relevant fields to conduct meetings. Through these seminars, startups can acquire up-to-date information necessary for international expansion.  In particular, last June's Pan-Pan Day was held with G-Invest Day, resulting in the venture firm 'Platinum Technology signing a 200 million won investment contract with NexPot Solution. In August, the 'Open Innovation' theme facilitated collaboration opportunities between startups, major corporations, and mid-sized enterprises. Prominent companies such as Toss, Yanolja, Daewoong Pharmaceutical, Mastercard, Hoban Construction, and KT participated, leading to 18 follow-up meetings with 16 companies.  In the future, Pan-Pan Day will continue to be held monthly from September to December with various themes. The themes are set as content in September, ICT in October, SaaS in November, and manufacturing in December, with experts from each field participating in seminars to provide necessary information to startups. Specifically, September's Pan-Pan Day will collaborate with the Gyeonggi Startup Summit, offering various programs, including meetings with foreign VCs and seminars, which are expected to assist companies in international expansion greatly.  A networking session between Estonian startups and Gyeonggi Province startups is planned. This will provide a unique opportunity for startups dreaming of entering the European market to gather information on entry policies and networking opportunities.  A representative from a participating startup shared, "We joined wondering how to establish our service in the market. Conversations with VCs and major corporate representatives at Pan-Pan Day were incredibly helpful. These discussions helped us find solutions to our problems and gain insights into approaching collaborations with major corporations."  They added, "Through Pan-Pan Day, we received advice tailored to our startup's perspective, gaining practical solutions for expanding our platform services and strategies for market entry. Even though we didn't match with a VC, it was greatly beneficial in determining the direction for the platform services we are developing. It was a truly valuable experience."  Pan-Pan Day will continue to support the global expansion of Pangyo startups and strengthen the connection between startups and investors. As startup growth leads to national development, events like Pan-Pan Day are expected to continue actively.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi Province's representative innovation cluster, it was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).  Furthermore, the Techno Valley Innovation Division of the Gyeonggi-do Business & Science Accelerator (GBSA) holds monthly events such as the Pangyo Evening Meet-Up, Pan-Pan Day, and the Pangyo Startup Investment Exchange "In-Best Pangyo" to maximize the value of Pangyo Techno Valley.
