# David W. Brown, Plant-Based Author, Unveils Groundbreaking New Book 'Taste Versus Cancer' and Launches Online Plant-Based Certification Course through P53 University

CAMAS, WA, September 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A transformative new chapter in plant-based nutrition is unfolding, promising to reshape the way people approach health and wellness. Leading this charge is David W. Brown, a renowned author and nutrition expert, best known for his creation of the P53 Diet & Lifestyle. With the release of his latest book, "Taste Versus Cancer," and the launch of P53 University's online plant-based certification course, Brown is offering a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to fighting cancer and chronic diseases through diet and lifestyle changes.  With over 17 years of research focused on the relationship between nutrition, cancer prevention, and the reversal of chronic illnesses, Brown has gained widespread recognition for his P53 Diet & Lifestyle. His four influential books—"P53 Diet & Lifestyle," "How You Are Being Poisoned," "Understanding Hormones, Enzymes & Cell Receptors," and now, "Taste Versus Cancer" —lay the foundation for his groundbreaking insights into the undeniable connection between diet and disease.  One of Brown's followers, Dr. Jerry Summers, a prostate cancer patient, has been reversing his cancer without chemotherapy or radiation—relying solely on the P53 Diet & Lifestyle. "The P53 Diet & Lifestyle is the real deal," says Summers. "Anyone facing cancer should read Taste Versus Cancer, it worked for me."  Brown's works have become go-to resources for individuals seeking scientifically supported solutions for preventing and reversing cancer and other serious conditions. His latest book, "Taste Versus Cancer," explores the psychological and social reasons people continue to eat unhealthy, cancer-promoting foods despite knowing their harmful effects. Along with his previous works, the book provides readers with a roadmap for reclaiming their health by breaking free from destructive dietary habits.  For those eager to elevate their understanding of plant-based living, Brown's P53 University offers one of the most rigorous online plant-based nutrition certification programs available. Graduates are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to become certified Plant-Based Nutrition Specialists, empowering them to guide others toward healthier, plant-based lifestyles. The course covers essential topics such as the science of a plant-based diet, nutrient optimization, toxins, bio-chemistry processes, anatomy and the prevention of chronic diseases and a lot more.  One notable student, Truett Standefer, a certified life coach from Washougal, Washington, and owner of Lumen8Life.com, chose to incorporate plant-based nutrition into his practice after experiencing firsthand the transformative effects of the P53 Diet & Lifestyle. To deepen his expertise, Standefer enrolled in P53 University to earn his certification. "I wanted to provide the best nutritional advice to my clients, and after researching, I found P53 University to be the most comprehensive program out there," says Standefer. "I've learned about over 80 hormones and enzymes—just a fraction of the in-depth material covered. This isn't a quick weekend course; it's thorough and demanding."  Adding to the P53 Diet's growing influence is the innovative P53 Food Carts initiative, which brings healthy, plant-based meals directly to communities. These mobile kitchens offer nutrient-dense meals based on the P53 Diet principles, providing an accessible way for people to experience the benefits of plant-based nutrition. After being introduced in the Portland, Oregon area, Lisa Peterson is now planning to launch her P53 Food Cart in Bend, Oregon.  The P53 Diet & Lifestyle movement is also supported by an online hub, TheP53.com, which serves as a central resource for those looking to adopt or maintain a plant-based lifestyle. The website features meal plans, recipes, and educational tools designed to help individuals transition to a healthier diet seamlessly. With tailored resources for different dietary needs, TheP53.com is an invaluable companion for anyone embarking on their plant-based journey.  As the P53 Diet & Lifestyle gains momentum, it's evident that this is more than just a diet—it's a science-driven, results-backed lifestyle with a global mission to transform lives. Through an array of books, certification courses, food carts, and an expansive online presence, the P53 Diet & Lifestyle is set to become the go-to resource for anyone serious about health, wellness, and sustainable living.
