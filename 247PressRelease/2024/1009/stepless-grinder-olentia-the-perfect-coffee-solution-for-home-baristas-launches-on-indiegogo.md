NEW YORK, NY, October 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NADO US INC, a leading developer of coffee grinders, is launching the Olentia 63mm conical burr grinder on the global crowdfunding platform Indiegogo.  Olentia is designed to provide an optimal grinding solution for expert-level home baristas. Equipped with a 63mm conical burr, it was chosen for its ability to deliver the best balance and flavor in coffee. The conical burr, precision-machined from stainless steel 420, offers excellent corrosion resistance, easy maintenance, and precise grinding performance.  To cater to the growing trend among home coffee enthusiasts for light roast bean grinding, Olentia features a powerful BLDC motor that optimizes the grinder's internal structure, motor torque, and usage. The custom-developed high-efficiency BLDC motor is quiet enough for use early in the morning or late at night. The motor supports 900-1700 RPM with 100 RPM increments, allowing precise adjustment based on bean type and desired coffee flavor.  With a focus on "ease of use," Olentia is designed for simple disassembly, cleaning, zero-point adjustment, and intuitive operation. The grinder incorporates anti-static technology to prevent coffee grounds from scattering, keeping your coffee table clean. Additionally, Olentia comes with over ten essential accessories, providing a complete grinding experience without the need for additional purchases.  Detailed information and purchasing options for the Olentia grinder will be available on the Indiegogo website starting October, 8th 2024.  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/grind-with-olentia-your-brewing-partner/reft/37963322/starget-press
