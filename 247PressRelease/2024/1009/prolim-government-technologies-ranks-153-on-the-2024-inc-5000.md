# PROLIM Government Technologies Ranks #153 on the 2024 Inc. 5000

PLANO, TX, October 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Inc 5000 revealed that PROLIM ranks #153 on the 2024 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy's most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.   "We are incredibly honoured to receive the Inc. 5000 award," said Ashwini Patil, President of PROLIM Government Technologies. "This achievement reflects the hard work, dedication, and innovative spirit of our entire team. Understanding the critical importance of security in federal operations, our facility security clearance allows us to handle sensitive information and deliver solutions that meet stringent security requirements"   The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year's top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year's Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.   "One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list," says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. "To see all the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year's honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce."
