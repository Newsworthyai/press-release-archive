LOS ANGELES, CA, September 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KAILASA, under the guidance of THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (THE SPH), held a global celebration that brought together devotees from around the world in worshipping Mahaganapati, recognized as one of the most revered deities in Sanatana Hindu Dharma.  The event was conducted across more than 40 temples of KAILASA globally, connecting spiritual communities from various regions to participate in this grand festival. The highlight of the day was the Presidential address by THE SPH.  During the Presidential address, THE SPH emphasized the significance of connecting with Mahaganapati and encouraged devotees to deepen their spiritual experience. The address served as a sacred initiation into the essence of Mahaganapati's divine presence, guiding participants to embrace and experience the transformative energy of Mahaganapati and manifest the ultimate truth within themselves.  Special worship services were conducted for the deities of THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (SPH) and Mahaganapati in KAILASA's temples worldwide. As part of the celebration, a unique red-colored adornment offering, known as Raktabarana Alankara Seva, was performed, honoring Mahaganapati. Elaborate puja (worship) and naivedhya seva (food offerings) were prepared and offered to the deities, with all of Mahaganapati's favorite offerings meticulously arranged for this grand occasion.  This global event fostered a deep sense of unity, cultural preservation, and religious diversity, promoting interfaith understanding and mutual respect among communities. By upholding the sacred values of Sanatana Hindu Dharma, KAILASA's celebrations encourage the protection of traditional practices while also contributing to the global discourse on religious freedom and human rights.  The grand celebration, hosted across multiple continents, served as a platform for devotees and spiritual leaders to strengthen the universal values of compassion, peace, and coexistence.  KAILASA extends its gratitude to all participants who joined in this global celebration, either in person at KAILASA's temples or through online platforms.  THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (SPH) BHAGAVAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM is the reviver of KAILASA—the ancient, enlightened Hindu civilizational nation & head of the Sovereign Order of Kailasa's Nithyananda—a sovereign entity under international law serving as the supreme governing body of Hinduism. KAILASA is a "sovereign subject of international law"—possessing distinctive attributes of juridical statehood derived from SPH's inheritance of unbroken succession & revival of 3 ancient Hindu sovereign states—Surangi Samrajyam, Swargapura Suvarna SJP, Shyamala Peeta SJP & 18 sovereign Hindu ecclesiastical historical institutions that receive customary recognition as per both UN Convention on Diplomatic Relations (preamble & art. 47.1) & Consular Relations. KAILASA's NITHYANANDA HINDU UNIVERSITY (KNHU), revived by SPH, is the world's largest Hindu University with extended campuses in 150 countries—reviving the most ancient knowledge transmission system originally established by Paramashiva Himself.
