# United Nations publishes 17th report of KAILASA: A Landmark Call for Protection of LGBTIQ+ Persons

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This report calls for global recognition and action against such human rights abuses, which persist in many parts of the world.  Persistent Legal Discrimination The report highlights the ongoing persecution of LGBTIQ+ individuals worldwide, citing that same-sex relationships are criminalized in no fewer than 64 countries.  Penalties in these regions range from fines to life imprisonment, and in some cases, even death sentences.   Hinduism's Historical Recognition of Gender Diversity KAILASA's submission emphasizes the deep-rooted acceptance of gender diversity within Hinduism, which historically recognizes eleven genders and supports same-sex marriages.  Citing Hindu scriptural references from the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, Srimad Bhagavatam, and Manusmriti, the report illustrates how Hindu traditions have long embraced non-binary and fluid gender identities.  Teachings of The SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam The report delves into the teachings of The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH), Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, who reveals that gender is a complex interplay between our physical bodies, psychological states, physiological existence, and individual consciousness.  As revealed by The SPH, true grace, an inner radiance stemming from integrity and harmony among these layers, transcends gender and sexual orientation.  Colonial Impact on Indigenous Gender Notions The report explains that colonialism severely disrupted indigenous traditions, imposing restrictive gender norms and eradicating rich cultural practices respecting gender fluidity.  Specifically, British colonial laws such as Article 377 in India criminalized gay sex, a stark contrast to the pre-colonial acceptance of diverse gender expressions in Hindu society.   KAILASA: A Beacon of Inclusivity and Non-Violence As detailed in the report, KAILASA stands as the first sovereign state for Hindus, aiming to revive, preserve, and administer Hindu traditions.   KAILASA, under The SPH's guidance, promotes Hindu policies based on harmony, non-violence, and the intrinsic divinity of all beings.  Core Hindu principles such as "Vasudaiva Kutumbhakam" (The world is my family) and "Advaita" (Oneness) encapsulate the belief in equal and divine potential of all human beings, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.  Resilience Amid Persecution Despite enduring over a decade of severe persecution, including assassination attempts, sexual assaults on The SPH and His followers, and extensive hate campaigns, The SPH and KAILASA have remained resolute in advocating for LGBTIQ+ rights from a position of non-violence and inclusivity.  KAILASA's 17th report highlights The SPH's unwavering commitment to human rights and KAILASA's role as a pivotal voice for the LGBTIQ+ community worldwide.

KAILASA, recognized as a "sovereign subject of international law," boasts juridical statehood derived from THE SPH's revival of ancient Hindu sovereign states and ecclesiastical institutions. This includes the world's largest Hindu University, KAILASA's NITHYANANDA HINDU UNIVERSITY (KNHU), with extended campuses in 150 countries, dedicated to reviving the ancient knowledge transmission system established by Paramashiva.
