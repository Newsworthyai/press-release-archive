"We are so grateful to the Georgia Society of CPAs and the accounting industry for their support of this friendly competition," said Danah Craft, Executive Director of Feeding Georgia.  "It provides critically needed resources to Feeding Georgia food banks."  Anna Abernathy LLC won the honor of Grand Prize Food Fight Hero, raising $3,390.75 and earning the most points per employee statewide.

The Georgia Accounting Food Fight is timed each year to restock the food banks after the summer surge they experience due to the conclusion of the school year (and school lunch assistance programs). During the friendly two-week competition, accounting professionals compete to raise funds for nine food banks across the state. All funds raised by each team stay local and benefit the food bank that serves its community.  As the Georgia Accounting Food Fight ends its 11th year, Boyd Search, CEO of The Georgia Society of CPAs, praised the campaign's growing success and community impact: "Each year, we see the power of our profession and community coming together to tackle one of Georgia's most pressing issues—hunger. Raising a total of over $2.5 million during this decade-long initiative, CPAs across the state are showing just how dedicated they are to serving those in need. It's a testament to what we can accomplish when we unite for a common cause."  Right now, 1 in 9 Georgians is experiencing food insecurity, meaning they may not know when their next meal will be. Fundraisers like the Georgia Accounting Food Fight are more crucial than ever. The fundraising efforts will directly support Feeding Georgia's mission to provide nutritious meals to those in need and create a hunger-free Georgia.  Since its inception in 2014, the Georgia Accounting Food Fight has collectively raised $2,507,681.61, the equivalent of 10,030,726 meals for the state's food banks.  The Georgia Society of CPAs extends its heartfelt gratitude to all participating teams, sponsors, and supporters for their instrumental role in this year's campaign's success. They have demonstrated that when individuals and organizations unite for a common cause, they can achieve remarkable feats.
