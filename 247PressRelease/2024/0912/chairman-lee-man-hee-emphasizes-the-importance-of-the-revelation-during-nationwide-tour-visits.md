# Chairman Lee Man-hee Emphasizes the Importance of the Revelation During Nationwide Tour Visits

CHEONGJU, KOREA, September 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, was bustling in the early morning on the 8th. A gathering of 80,000 people, one-tenth of Cheongju's population of 850,000, came together for Sunday service.   The Sunday service at the Cheongju Church of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, was attended by members from the Matthias Tribe, which covers the Chungcheong region, as well as members from the John Tribe, which covers the southern Seoul and Gyeonggi areas, and key members from churches across the nation. The event was especially meaningful as the Cheongju Church celebrated its 30th anniversary this year.   Moreover, over 100 Protestant pastors from around the country attended in person to listen to Chairman Lee's sermon.   From early that day, numerous Shincheonji Church congregation lined up along a 4-kilometer stretch from the Cheongju Interchange to the Cheongju Church to welcome Chairman Lee. The reason for this enthusiastic reception is because Chairman Lee has been able to clearly explain not only the Book of Revelation, which even pastors and theology scholars find difficult, but also the secrets of the 6,000-year history of the Bible.  One believer, who had arrived early after starting their journey the previous day, said, "I've been a believer all my life, but I can't express how grateful I am for the clear explanation of the prophecy and fulfillment of Revelation, something I've never heard anywhere else," and added, "I came here because I wanted to personally express my gratitude to the Chairman for teaching the revelation and welcome him."   As the believers had hoped, Chairman Lee emphasized once again, "We are so thankful that God has revealed to us the words of Revelation, which no one has known for 6,000 years," adding, "This word is life. You must have a faith that is 100% aligned with this word, which is becoming one with God."   He continued, "The biggest difference is that we can present the reality of the prophecy of Revelation. However, we were all in the same position as those who did not know in the past. Now, we must humble ourselves before everyone and help explain and guide them to the truth."   Since the founding of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Chairman Lee has consistently emphasized the importance of the revelation and the need for a Bible-based faith. This year alone, he has visited over 40 churches domestically and internationally, including this visit to the Cheongju Church, focusing on delivering the revelation message.  As a result, there is a noticeable trend of believers both domestically (in Korea) and internationally who had been unable to quench their thirst for the word of God Shincheonji given by Church of Jesus.   Mr. Lee, who had been a Presbyterian for over 30 years, confessed, "I wandered from church to church, attending sermons, early morning services... but I never found the clear answers I was looking for," and added, "During a Bible seminar, I was almost shocked by Chairman Lee's two-hour lecture that explained the entire book of Revelation so clearly." He continued, "When I set aside my preconceptions and focused solely on the word, I felt the answers to my long-standing questions unfolding one by one. I believe there are many people across the country and around the world who have had similar experiences, which is why over 100,000 people are completing their studies each year."   This confession is not limited to one person; it is supported by data. According to a public opinion poll conducted last September by the Pastoral Data Research Institute on 1,000 Protestant aged 19 and older, 65% of Protestant church attendees in Korea reported feeling "spiritually thirsty." Moreover, more than 55% of all respondents expressed a desire to receive systematic Bible education from their pastors. This result is seen as revealing the current state of Bible education within the Protestant community in Korea.   Additionally, the trend of young people in their 20s and 30s leaving religion continues to deepen, which is one of the biggest concerns for the Protestant community both domestically and internationally. On the other hand, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus is not only seeing an increase in young members in their 20s and 30s, but over 100,000 people are completing the church's eight-month course each year. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus attributes this to its Bible-based faith and the excellence of its revelation teachings.   A representative of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus explained, "The core of the message delivered by Chairman Lee is that the prophecy in the Book of Revelation, which many thought was just an old story, has actually been fulfilled and has tangible evidence," adding, "Because of this, Shincheonji Church of Jesus has a systematic curriculum with undeniable evidence, and it is gaining recognition from people of all ages and backgrounds, regardless of whether they have a religious background."   The representative added, "Since this message comes from a pastor who has seen and heard the fulfillment of the prophecy, we hope that all believers will approach this truth with maturity and personally confirm it with their own eyes."
