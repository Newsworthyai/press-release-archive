# Hulu's How To Die Alone: A Potent Dramedy About Conquering Fear

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In this Hulu drama/comedy, Mel is a woman grappling with fear, self-doubt, and anxiety, often holding herself back from pursuing her dreams. Her fear of the unknown and past disappointments have led her to set boundaries on her aspirations, leaving her feeling stuck in her job as a cart driver at JFK Airport, despite her fear of flying. Mel's journey reflects the struggles of those burdened by the belief that they're "never good enough," reminiscent of characters like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's Rebecca Bunch and BoJack Horseman's Diane Nguyen.  Throughout Season 1, Mel's core challenge is learning to overcome her fears and realizing she deserves the good things in life. Creators Rothwell and Vera Santamaria craft a surprisingly uplifting narrative about a relatable, flawed, and humorous adult, even though the show takes a few episodes to find its footing. Initially, How To Die Alone begins as a shaky workplace comedy, with early episodes rushing to establish Mel's dilemmas and the airport setting where much of the story unfolds. While the series misses opportunities to fully utilize its vibrant airport backdrop in a fun, Superstore-like manner, it quickly evolves into a more confident dramedy that better serves its coming-of-age storyline.  By the fourth episode, How To Die Alone finds its stride, focusing on Mel's personal growth. She steps out of her comfort zone, which had been limited to hanging out with her work best friend, Rory (Conrad Ricamora), and pushes herself to join a training program for a promotion. As Mel takes crucial steps to change her life—including making new friends and taking bold, sometimes risky actions—the show deepens, reflecting her transformation. The seeds of Mel's journey are planted in the premiere when she "celebrates" her 35th birthday with a solitary plan to take edibles and watch The Office (minus the Robert California episodes). A near-death experience leaves her alone in the hospital, where she meets an older patient who inspires her to start living again, or risk dying alone.  Rothwell shines in the role, bringing a blend of comedy and depth to Mel's character, particularly during intense scenes with Ricamora that showcase the actors' chemistry and emotional range. A standout midseason episode explores Mel's complicated relationships with her brother and mother, played by Bashir Salahuddin and Ellen Cleghorne, offering a darkly comedic look at her family dynamics and generational issues.  How To Die Alone also stands out for its portrayal of Mel as a "broke, fat, Black" woman, a type of leading lady rarely seen on screen. The show makes a sincere effort to provide multi-dimensional representation, with performances that bring these qualities to life. However, the series occasionally stretches itself thin as it juggles various tropes, including elements of magical realism where Mel imagines herself in other people's lives, and hints of a rom-com as sparks fly between Mel and her ex-boyfriend Alex (Jocko Sims) and her co-worker Terrance (KeiLyn Durrel Jones).  Ultimately, the heart of How To Die Alone lies in Mel's quest to break free from her fears and truly live. The love triangle, family issues, and workplace antics are secondary to Mel's personal journey. Rothwell's performance infuses the series with enough emotional depth to make any rough patches worthwhile, delivering a show that resonates deeply with those familiar with the challenges of self-doubt and the desire for a more fulfilling life.  How To Die Alone premieres September 13 on Hulu.
