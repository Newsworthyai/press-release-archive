# Mango Animate Upgraded Its AI Video Maker With Advanced Features

HONG KONG, September 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The demand for animated videos has soared exponentially in the last few years. Every creator is in the race to make their content more high quality and is looking for tools to streamline the video creation. Mango AI noticed this market demand and launched an AI video maker, Mango AI, to make the content creation more seamless for creators. Mango Animate has been actively reviewing the creators's demands and upgrading Mango AI accordingly.  The main feature of Mango Animate's AI video maker is to transform the creator's ideas into a high-quality interactive video featuring a human-like AI avatar. With intuitive interfaces, the AI video generator supports creators to enter their scripts and illustrations with one click. The scene-based format included an intro, outro, and the main script. Initially, all three of them used to be in text format. However, to make videos more interactive, Mango Animate recently added an insert image option in the script section to enable creators to add more relevant images.  Mango Animate's AI video maker includes an advanced cartoon-lip syncing feature that enables text to be accurately mouthed by an AI avatar, providing a seamless and lifelike animation experience. Creators can select a built-in AI avatar or create a customized avatar using their personal photo depending on the script and type of video. Mango Animate allows users to select a narration voice that matches the script and avatar from built-in and integrated AI voices that are different in gender, language, and age.  The "talking photo" feature is a dynamic and innovative aspect of AI animation technology that breathes life into clear portrait photos by animating them to mimic human expressions and speech. It allows users to customize the animation to synchronize with a pre-recorded voice or text-to-speech, ensuring that the character's mouth movements and facial expressions are in harmony with the narration. The underlying AI algorithms analyze the facial features in the photo to generate smooth and realistic animations, making it a powerful tool for anyone looking to add a touch of interactivity and personalization to their visual content.  "Mango Animate is on a committed lifelong journey of innovation and utmost customer satisfaction. Our goal is to upgrade our tools to keep up with the growing market demands," says Ken Glenn, CMO of Mango Animate.  To learn more about the AI video maker, please visit Mango AI.
