# Babaians Law Firm Announces the Creating Your Future Scholarship

GLENDALE, CA, July 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Babaians Law Firm wants to invite undergraduate and graduate students in all fields of study to apply for its newly-debuted "Creating Your Future" Scholarship. This scholarship promises $2,500 to a student who can create a compelling video describing their goals for the future.  The firm requests that applicants create a one to two-minute video going into detail about their academic and career goals. We encourage students to think critically about questions like the following:  - What degree are you pursuing and why? - What do you plan to use your degree to benefit your community? - Describe what your ideal academic journey looks like - What obstacles do you anticipate making your collegiate career harder? - What is your unique approach to conquering your dreams?  Babaians Law Firm wants to celebrate a student who's already taken steps toward securing the future of their dreams. We want students to use their video essays to creatively elaborate on how they intend to bring a unique perspective to a collegiate and professional environment.  Students may use a suite of editing tools, like Adobe Creative Cloud, to complete their video essays. However, applicants do not need to elaborately edit their videos to secure the "Creating Your Future" Scholarship. The scholarship selection committee will value students' scholarship essays based on their contents.  With that in mind, we strongly encourage students to create their own scripts before recording their essays. While students may use AI to create B-roll for their essays, they may not use AI to replace their voices, create fake actors, or develop their scripts. Inappropriate use of AI will see a student's application disqualified.  Students have until November 1, 2024, to submit their completed video essays to the scholarship selection committee.
