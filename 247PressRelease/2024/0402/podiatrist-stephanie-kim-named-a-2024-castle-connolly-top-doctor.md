# Podiatrist Stephanie Kim named a 2024 Castle Connolly Top Doctor

KIRKLAND, WA, April 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Stephanie E. Kim, DPM, has been recognized as a 2024 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, the first year she has received the prestigious Top Doctor honor. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are selected annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors in their regions for their specialties.  Dr. Kim is a doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM) — commonly called a podiatrist — a physician and surgeon who evaluates and treats conditions of the feet, ankles, and lower legs.   Certified by the American Board of Podiatric Medicine, Dr. Kim is with The Foot and Ankle Center, which has locations in Kirkland and Issaquah.  Dr. Kim has special expertise in reconstructive surgery, aesthetic (cosmetic) podiatry, pediatric podiatry, and the care of sports injuries of the foot and ankle. She is known for her clinical skill and state-of-the-art techniques and treatments, as well as her genuine care for and dedication to her patients.  "At our practice, we understand the significance of every patient's concerns, regardless of their perceived severity," Dr. Kim says. "We prioritize creating a supportive and welcoming environment where patients feel heard and valued. Whether it's a minor issue or a complex medical condition, we approach each case with the same level of dedication and attention to detail."  As a certified pedorthist, Dr. Kim specializes in modifying footwear and providing supportive devices to address the unique needs of both pediatric and adult patients. Typical patients who benefit from custom mold orthotics include individuals with various foot and ankle issues, such as flat feet, high arches, plantar fasciitis, bunions, and arthritis.  The Foot and Ankle Center treats adults and children for a variety of issues, including sports injuries such as sprains, ruptures, and fractures. They have special expertise in minimally invasive surgery and frequently perform bunion surgery. They also offer a range of non-surgical treatments tailored to address foot and ankle problems effectively.  "We focus on providing optimal outcomes with minimal disruption to the patient's life," Dr. Kim says. "Our approach begins with a thorough and personalized consultation to understand each patient's unique needs and circumstances fully."  Among the non-surgical treatments they provide, shockwave therapy stands out as an innovative and effective option for various conditions. This non-invasive procedure utilizes targeted shockwaves to stimulate the body's natural healing response, promoting tissue regeneration and pain relief.  Additionally, the Foot and Ankle Center offers platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, a treatment that harnesses the healing properties of a patient's own blood to accelerate tissue repair and reduce inflammation. This approach has shown promising results in treating a wide range of foot and ankle issues.  They also offer filler injections as a minimally invasive option for certain foot conditions, such as soft tissue defects or volume loss, providing both structural support and aesthetic improvement.  For children, their focus extends beyond reactive treatment to proactive preventive care.   "We emphasize interventions that promote better alignment and gait, aiming to address issues early on before they develop into more significant problems," Dr. Kim says. "Additionally, given the active lifestyles of many children, we often encounter sports-related injuries and provide comprehensive care to aid in their recovery and prevent future occurrences."  Dr. Kim earned her doctoral degree at Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine. She completed a two-year podiatry residency at the Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics at Baltimore's Sinai Hospital, as well as a dermatopathology fellowship with Bradley Bakotic, DPM.  She is affiliated with Overlake Hospital and Swedish Medical Center and serves as a consulting physician at Seattle's VA Medical Center.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  "I am deeply honored and grateful to have been nominated as a Connolly Top Doctor by my peers this year," Dr. Kim says. "I believe that my nomination reflects our practice's unwavering commitment to prioritizing effective communication among healthcare providers and delivering exceptional patient care."

Nominations are open to all board-certified MDs, DOs, and DPMs. The Castle Connolly team chooses honorees based on nominee criteria that includes their medical education, training, hospital appointments, and disciplinary histories.
