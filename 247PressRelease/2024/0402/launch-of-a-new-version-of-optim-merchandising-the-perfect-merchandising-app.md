# Launch of a new version of Optim Merchandising, the perfect merchandising app

SINGAPORE, April 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Powata, a Singapore-based SaaS developer, announces the official launch of a new version of Optim Merchandising, a merchandising app already used by hundreds of merchandisers in Asia Pacific and Europe.   Powata launched the first version of Optim Merchandising in 2017, to replace the solutions used by merchandisers (tracking on paper, using in-house tools or messaging apps). Powata's clients are both brands and distributors.   The Optim Merchandising app allows merchandisers to capture information while performing their work, ensuring "ground truth": capture of timestamps and GPS coordinates, pictures taken only in the app and not from the gallery.  Supervisors can organize the schedule of their merchandisers and their tasks, whether general merchandising, stock take, reordering, tracking share of shelf or planogram checks. The app can work offline or online.   Powata also provides an app for sales promoters who are stationed in stores and sell to consumers.   All data collected is stored in a structured way and allows for automated reporting to supervisors, managers and brands.   Powata is part of the iLathys venture builder and a sister company of fewStones, a corporate video production company and StoryboardHero, a platform to generate AI storyboards.  Powata, a Singapore-based developer of SaaS solution, focused on digital solutions for the retail industry since 2017.
