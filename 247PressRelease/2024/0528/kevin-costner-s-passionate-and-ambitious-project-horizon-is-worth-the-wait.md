# Kevin Costner's Passionate and Ambitious Project "Horizon" Is Worth the Wait

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fans have eagerly awaited Kevin Costner's return to the screen, and the wait is nearly over. "Horizon: An American Saga" is set to release on June 28th, following its recent world premiere at Cannes. As expected, critics have been quick to share their thoughts, with some predictable negativity surfacing on social media.   Critics have raised concerns about the film's length, storyline, and labeled it a vanity project. It's a reminder that movie reviews can sometimes prioritize clickbait over constructive feedback. However, fans of Costner see things differently.  "Personally, I'm eagerly anticipating this film. Costner's work has always drawn me to the theaters, and this one is no exception. I was even compelled to go during the height of the pandemic for his last film," C. K. Gold.  Costner's dedication to "Horizon" is evident, and his fans appreciate the effort he has poured into this film. They are excited to embark on this cinematic journey with him, recognizing his immense talent and passion for the project. The seven-minute standing ovation at Cannes speaks volumes about the film's impact and artistry.  The film's use of multiple storylines, a technique that has proven successful in countless films, adds depth and richness to the narrative. Knowing that "Horizon" is the first part of a four-part series only heightens the anticipation. Fans are thrilled to have more of Costner's storytelling and expertise in the western genre on the horizon.  The length of the film is a non-issue for fans who have been anticipating its release for over two years. Many successful films have longer runtimes, and the chance to see Costner on screen for a few hours is a welcome change from his shorter appearances in Yellowstone. The immersive experience of a full-length film is something fans are eager for.  As for the cost of the film, while critics might harp on the budget, filmgoers are less concerned with production costs. High-budget films like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Marvel movies have been beloved by audiences despite their hefty price tags which were three times higher than "Horizon." The focus for fans is on the quality of the cinematic experience, not the production expenses.  Costner's meticulous attention to detail in capturing the essence of the West adds an immersive layer to the film. The scenery and locations in "Horizon: An American Saga" are nothing short of breathtaking and truly deserve to be experienced on the big screen.
