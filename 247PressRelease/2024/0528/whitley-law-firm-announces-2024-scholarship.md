# Whitley Law Firm Announces 2024 Scholarship

RALEIGH, NC, May 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The legal professionals with Whitley Law Firm have always known the power of community. The people around us build us up and transform our futures. In light of the transformative power of community, the firm intends to debut its "Community Commitment" scholarship ahead of the 2024/2025 academic year.  Whitley Law Firm's newly-announced "Community Commitment" scholarship promises $2,500 to an undergraduate or graduate student who can demonstrate a commitment to both their institution of choice and the communities that raised them. Applicants must create 1 to 2-minute video essays describing the communities they come from and how those communities have shaped their lives.  Students must include their name, applicable credits, sources, and information about their editing program of choice in the credits of their video essays. The videos must be recorded in well-lit areas while holding their recording device of choice as still as possible. Students are requested to use only copyright-free content and come up with a creative, catchy title that reflects their ideas. Whitley Law Firm then requests that students upload their essays to YouTube as unlisted videos before linking those videos as part of their broader scholarship applications.  The firm will not consider applications that do not respect the requirements mentioned above.   Students have until August 15, 2024, to complete their scholarship video essays and submit them through Whitley Law Firm's website. The firm will not consider applications submitted after the scholarship application deadline passes.  The team encourages students to dig deep in their efforts to explore the different ways that their families, churches, volunteer groups, academic institutions, and other parties have formed the communities that have shaped their lives. We wish all applicants the best of luck and look forward to celebrating our first "Community Commitment" scholarship winner in the fall.
