As part of its prestigious heritage, Morpheus8 is already a multi-award-winning technology offering the latest advancements in skincare tightening and rejuvenation. Morepheus8 works by effectively remodelling subdermal fat to address common signs of aging and blemishes, such as:  •Loss of volume •Acne scarring •Uneven tone/texture •Sagging skin •Jowls •Stretch marks •Wrinkles and fine lines  In medical aesthetics Morpheus8 is a top choice for skin tightening and body remodelling, and there are many reasons why.  Boosts Collagen Production  After the age of 20, collagen levels begin to decline. Skin looks less firm. As aging progresses, areas like jowls or cheeks can develop a loose, sagging appearance. Morepheus8 combines the benefits of microneedling with RF energy, penetrating deep into the subdermal level to tighten while stimulating collagen production. Put simply, after treatment the skin starts to work immediately while also boosting collagen, a protein vital to beautiful skin, for long-term benefits and improved skin health.  Addresses Fine Lines and Wrinkles Morepheus8 delivers incredible rejuvenating benefits, especially around the eyes, mouth, forehead, and neck. By harnessing the power of radiofrequency (RF) energy, Morpheus8 effectively smooths out fine lines and wrinkles, making it a go-to for individuals looking for a full-face solution to combat the signs of aging—without surgery. Post procedure, patients observe noticeably tighter, more vibrant skin for a more rejuvenated, youthful appearance.  Delivers Lasting Results  Dr Kamani can tailor the procedure to meet individual needs and treatment goals, making Morpheus8 a versatile choice with results lasting up to three years after a course of 3-6 sessions, depending on individual goals.
