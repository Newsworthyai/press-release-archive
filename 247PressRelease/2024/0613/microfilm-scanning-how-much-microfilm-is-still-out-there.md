# Microfilm Scanning: How Much Microfilm is Still Out There?

VANCOUVER, BC, June 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What type of original records have been preserved for several lifetimes on microfilm? Since the medium was first used to capture vital documents in the mid-1800s, uncountable billions of pages of irreplaceable information have been archived to microfilm. To learn more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/microfilm-scanning-how-much-microfilm-is-out-there-excellent-question/  In the 1920s a New York City banker named Georger McCarthy was issued a patent for his process for permanent storage of cancelled cheques and other financial instruments. This led to a much wider acceptance of the technology for capturing and preserving original records of all types.  Microfilm Scanning Services in Vancouver  Over the ensuing years, many City, Municipal, and Provincial government clients used microfilm as their primary method of archiving a myriad of records, including, but not limited to, birth, marriage, and death records, land titles records, newspapers, adoption records, business documents, taxation and immigration documents, as well as banking and insurance information. In short, microfilm was the only game in town for safe and reasonably priced records storage.  In the 1990s, the tide started shifting from strictly using microfilm as an archival medium to digitizing paper records. Many existing microfilm/microfiche clients were very interested in embracing scanning as a new way of preserving and distributing information. Micro Com was aware of this new trend and in a position to act upon it, but what about the many decades of microfilm in clients' vaults?  Convert Microfilm to Digital Information with Micro Com Systems  Initially, very little happened with people's microfilm, but gradually, as new equipment and technologies emerged, it became possible to reliably and efficiently convert microfilm to digital information. Micro Com Systems first purchased microfilm digitization equipment in 1998 and put it to work right away. That hardware was subsequently replaced over the years and the team now has access a fleet of 8 Sunrise microfilm digitizers, allowing them to reliably convert microfilm, microfiche and aperture cards in any volume, efficientlyâ€”and at a reasonable cost.  Microfilm Scanning  Today, after a quarter century of scanning all types of microfilm, the team at Micro Com still sees a significant amount of microfilm going through the shop. Even 26 years of converting/digitizing microfilm has barely scratched the surface in terms of all the microfilm out there.
