# AWARD WINNING GEORGIA ENTREPRENEUR LAUNCHES SAGEDOX

JOHNS CREEK, GA, June 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As a lawyer and entrepreneur who has grown her own small business, Danielle Hudson Laughlin knows how tough it is to stay compliant and protect your investment when scaling a startup. That's why she has launched SAGEdox, a one-stop portal for basic legal documents every small business needs. These documents can be purchased and customized for one time use or, with a subscription, access self-paced online courses to educate yourself on must-know topics such as Georgia LLC law, Compliance and more.   Laughlin and her firm, Sage Business Counsel, which offers business and legal consulting, has been recognized multiple times by the Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce for her entrepreneurial endeavors. She is well-aware that many small businesses fail within the first year.  "I believe that no small business, regardless of size, should be stranded in the labyrinth of legal requirements, especially if the business is not yet large enough to engage a full-time legal counsel. That's where SAGEdox can be extremely useful," explains Laughlin. "And that's why I launched this service as a Benefit Corporation, to help reduce the number of small business failures."   If your start up needs an LLC Operating Agreement, Letter of Intent, Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, Basic Service Agreement or other vital legal documents, SAGEdox can affordably help you protect it.   "Sometimes, we don't know what we don't know. That's why as a subscriber, you can access informative, self-paced webinars that help you understand issues, hurdles and speed bumps your company is likely to face," said Laughlin.  About SAGEdox SAGEdox is an online documents and education platform designed with modern businesses in mind, balancing the need for accurate solutions and peace of mind with affordable legal assistance to keep you compliant and help you avoid legal pitfalls as you grow. www.sagedox.com is a registered Benefit Corporation.
