# Important Women's History Month Message from Mindquest Global

VICTORIA, BC, March 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The International Coaching Federation states that 86% of companies saw an ROI of 86% after coaching engagements, and 96% if those who went through executive coaching said they would do it again. According to MetrixGlobal, in one study, executive coaching had a 788% ROI thanks to increases in areas like productivity and employee satisfaction and according to iPEC, a reliable ROI for executive coaching has been reported as 500%-700. While many corporate employees at the executive level enjoy the company benefits of coaching, most female employees never get access to this corporate perk. During eleven years of coaching male and female executives at global organizations and growth stage startups, International Executive Coach, Kasia Gurgul, noticed that males were offered executive coaching through their companies, while females were paying their own way, even when they were already in executive roles. Kasia Gurgul is concerned that women are being overlooked for leadership development coaching opportunities. Executive coaching sharpens skills and improves career advancement and self-care habits, so Kasia Gurgul encourages women to negotiate or invest in executive coaching to create more equitable opportunities for their growth and advancement. Often the multitude of home and work demands leads women to experience health challenges or to leave leadership. This Women's History month, Kasia Gurgul wants to encourage women to not only celebrate their achievements, but to engage in coaching to further maximize their growth and career opportunities. There are 3 ways women can do this 1) If they are offered coaching by their workplace, seize the opportunity - don't be 'too busy and make time for coaching 2) If you are offered a professional development budget, say you'd like to use it for professional coaching 3) Invest in your own growth. The bottom line is "don't wait for someone else to see your value. Invest in yourself as the ROI on professional coaching is worth it" said Kasia Gurgul.   In the USA professional development can be a tax deductible expense, and Kasia Gurgul recommends talking to your tax advisor so you can understand what you can claim in your personal situation. Professional coaching will help you rise to new levels and stay in leadership by sharpening your delegation skills and implementing new strategies.
