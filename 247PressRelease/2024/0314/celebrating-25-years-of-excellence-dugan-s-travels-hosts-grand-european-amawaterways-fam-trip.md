The narrative then transitioned seamlessly to Amsterdam, reached via the high-speed comfort of the Eurostar. In Amsterdam, the group swelled as more Dugan's Travels agents joined the expedition.

This deep dive into Amsterdam's heart and history was both enlightening and moving, offering perspectives that transcended the traditional tourist experience.  Boarding the Amawaterways Lucia marked the beginning of a luxurious seven-night cruise down the Rhine, a river that threads through the heart of Europe, carving landscapes and histories in its wake. This part of the journey was a testament to the beauty and diversity of the European continent, with stops in Germany, France, and Switzerland. Each destination offered its unique allure, from medieval castles and vineyard-clad hills to cosmopolitan cities and quaint villages, providing a comprehensive and immersive travel experience.  The voyage concluded in Zurich, Switzerland, where the agents enjoyed a two-night stay, encapsulating the trip with a visit to Lucerne.
