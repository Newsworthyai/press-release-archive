# Lawsuit Filed By Mayor Law On Behalf of an Oregon Man Hit By an Ambulance Then Charged For The Transport To The Hospital

PORTLAND, OR, November 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Travis Mayor of Mayor Law, LLC filed a lawsuit against Columbia River Fire & Rescue on behalf of his client, William Hoesch after being struck by one of their ambulances while biking. Hoesch was billed $1,862 for transportation to the hospital following the incident. The collision occurred on October 27, 2022, as Hoesch was cycling west on West C Street in Rainier, Oregon, and entered an intersection. The ambulance reportedly made a sudden right turn, resulting in a crash that damaged Hoesch's bike and caused him multiple injuries.  The complaint, filed in Oregon Circuit Court, alleges negligence by the ambulance service. Hoesch sustained injuries to his face, left hand, hip, and diaphragm, and experiences persistent pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility. Medical expenses to date amount to around $47,000, with potential future costs estimated at an additional $50,000. Hoesch is seeking roughly $900,000 in damages.  The Rainier Police Department's report shows differing accounts of the crash. Hoesch claims he attempted to pass the ambulance on the right, expecting it to continue straight, but it turned unexpectedly. The ambulance driver, however, stated that he was moving slowly with his turn signal on and did not see Hoesch until the impact.  Columbia River Fire & Rescue has acknowledged the allegations and directed the case to their legal counsel, declining further comment.
