# The Common Thread That Unites Us All

CHICAGO, IL, November 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Groundbreaking Art Book Explores the Impact of Tribal and Ancient Art on Human Behavior Over 30,000 Years  The Commonality of Humans Through Art assembles ten leading scholars in a masterpiece collection of chapters on art history and cultural anthropology and how the language of art has shaped human behavior from birth to death.   With contributions from distinguished experts, the book combines insights from fields in neuroscience, anthropology, and art. According to John Buxton, founder of ArtTrak.com and long-time appraiser on the television series, Antiques Roadshow, The Commonality of Humans Through Art is the most important book about art since H.W. Janson's History of Art.   Featuring 400 vibrant color photos of tribal and ancient art objects from globally renowned museums and private collections in one book, it offers readers a centralized exhibition that examines the interconnectivity of humanity and art across diverse cultures. This 576-page book explores themes of family, motherhood, conflict, warfare, sickness, healing, religion, and the brain and how art has influenced human life over the past 30,000 years.   "Instead of following the standard geographical or historical arrangement, this book The Commonality of Humans Through Art moves on to group works thematically in terms of human life events…each essay by an expert who teases out the ways in which the language of art captures and forms social experience across cultures and history in each domain," said the prestigious publication, World of Interiors.

Zaidel: Brain Research Institute Member and Adjunct Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience, UCLA — "The Brain and Art" Wilfried van Damme: Art Historian, Anthropologist, and Scholarly Article Author — "Aesthetics and Human Cultures" Barbara C.
