SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, November 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Accipital, an international alternative assets investment management firm, and DECA, a Puerto Rico corporate advisory firm for financial incentives and compliance, have announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to promote Puerto Rico's Tax Incentive Code (Act No. 60-2019) to companies based in South Korea.  This strategic partnership aims to raise awareness of Puerto Rico's unique incentive programs under Act 60, which offers significant benefits to companies seeking to expand operations in the U.S. market while leveraging Puerto Rico's attractive economic environment. The partnership will focus on providing South Korean businesses with critical insights and access to these incentives, helping them explore new growth opportunities on the island.  Through this collaboration, Accipital and DECA will jointly engage in outreach efforts, including tailored consultations, webinars, and events that highlight the competitive advantages of establishing a presence in Puerto Rico. By combining Accipital's cross-border financial expertise and DECA's local incentives knowledge, the two firms will offer a comprehensive suite of services designed to support South Korean firms as they explore the Puerto Rican incentive landscape.   Corey Hawk, Director of Investments for Accipital, noted: "Dozens of large multinationals currently operate in Puerto Rico, but Korean companies are noticeably absent. We believe our network in the Korean market combined with DECA's local expertise will yield a valuable go-to-market offering for Korean companies operating in the U.S. market."   Aurelio Fuentes, Co-Founder & Partner at DECA, noted: "This partnership with Accipital represents an exciting opportunity to not only bridge economic interests between Puerto Rico and South Korea but also create high-paying jobs for Puerto Ricans. By attracting foreign investment to the island, we are helping to fuel economic development, provide rewarding career opportunities for our local workforce, and demonstrate Puerto Rico's potential as a global hub for innovation and business growth."  Puerto Rico's incentives have already attracted significant international interest, and this partnership between Accipital and DECA Analytics seeks to further strengthen economic ties between Puerto Rico and East Asia, fostering mutual growth and investment.
