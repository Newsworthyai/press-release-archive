# Connecting Businesses With Community Trash Cleanups That Boost Your Online Visibility

COOKEVILLE, TN, November 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Many businesses are looking for creative ways to build local links and visibility, but traditional sponsorships often fall flat. However, SEO Arcade has found a unique solution - hosting community cleanup events that generate real, relevant links while also making a positive impact on the local area.  "Sadly, while there are already non-profit organizations in nearly every county in the US to facilitate business sponsored community cleanup events, they don't do SEO and don't understand how digital marketing works," said Jeremy Rivera, Founder of SEO Arcade. "At best you might get a single image/logo link if you sponsor a cleanup. But we've developed a process to amplify these real-world events to create a valuable link building opportunity."  SEO Arcade works with local non-profits to coordinate community cleanup efforts, handling all the logistics from finding volunteers to providing the necessary supplies. But the real value comes in how they leverage these events for digital marketing.  By creating an RSVP form on the company's website and using strategic anchor text, SEO Arcade is able to build links from local event calendars, articles about eco-friendly businesses, podcast shownotes, and more. They also distribute a press release to over 100 news sites, resulting in additional coverage and links.  "Do good while you build links," added Jeremy Rivera. "It's a win-win for businesses looking to strengthen their local SEO and brand visibility."
