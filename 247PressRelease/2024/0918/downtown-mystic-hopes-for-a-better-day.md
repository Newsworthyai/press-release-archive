# DownTown Mystic Hopes For A Better Day

NEW YORK, NY, September 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music announces the release of the new Better Day Digital 45 by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. This will be the 3rd and final release of 2024 for DownTown Mystic. Better Day will be digitally released on October 18 and distributed to all the streaming services worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music. The Digital 45 will be dropping at Radio on October 15 with Brandon Day/Tinderbox Music handling promotion.  The Better Day Digital 45 contains 3 tracks, including Love Light and Tomorrow's Clown, featuring the ace rhythm section from Ian Hunter's Rant Bandâ€”drummer Steve Holley and bassist Paul Page. It's the 1st release from the new album The Wish, due out in 2025, which shows DownTown Mystic's style of RnR continuing to evolve. Still "vintage yet modern" in sound and approach, Better Day offers a unique sound with a positive vibe. DownTown Mystic Writer/Producer Robert Allen comments, "I wanted to put out a positive vibe and Better Day was the perfect song to do that. I'm also a big Tom Petty fan, and as a nod to him (w/Mike Campbell), the track features a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar that was a trademark of his sound. I created the solo as an homage to TP and his memory."  For DownTown Mystic, 2024 has been dominated by the release of the Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul album and currently, the companion Acoustic Sessions EP. Both releases have had successful runs at Radio in Europe and College/Non-commercial/AAA Radio in the US. From the label side, after cultivating years of success at Radio in Europe, Sha-La Music's strategy to concentrate on doing the same in the US is proving successful. The release of DownTown Mystic's AmeriKarma album last year caught the attention of Non-com Music Programmers and put the artist on the map with over 3 million streams. Releasing Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul this year has helped to solidify that attention.  Influenced by bands like Buffalo Springfield and Rockpile, the music of DownTown Mystic balances a timeless feel with a contemporary edge. Besides gaining a wide-reaching global fan base, thanks to significant international radio airplay in over 40 countries, DownTown Mystic has become one of the top sync-licensed indie artists creating music today with music in over 240 TV shows and films. Check out the Better Day Digital 45 to hear what DownTown Mystic is all about.  "The exuberance never subsides and given his exemplary backing band, the music bristles with an energy and electricity that rarely subsides." American Songwriter  "It's a perfect blend of muscle and melody, a brilliant balance of power and poise, an exercise in groove and grace, energy and elegance." Dancing About Architecture  "This is a record brimming with catchy melodies, contemplated chord changes, and unique instrumental accents" JamSphere Magazine   Listen to the Better Day Digital 45: https://tinyurl.com/vtdywejv  DownTown Mystic: https://downtownmystic.net Facebook: DownTown Mystic Spotify: https://tinyurl.com/y7ntbt88 DownTown Mystic YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/DowntownMystic1 X/Twitter: @DTMysticband  Sha-La Music: https://sha-lamusic.com/ FaceBook: Sha-La Music Twitter: @shalaman  For Press inquiries, contact:  Grant Flesland: grant@tinderboxmusic.com   For Radio inquiries, contact:  Brandon Day: brandon@tinderboxmusic.com   Formed in 1987, Sha-La Music is an independent Publishing & Production company that includes a Record Label with worldwide digital distribution from The Orchard/Sony Music.
