# SJ Manders Exposes the Harsh Reality in Gaza with Her Compelling Works

PALM BEACH, FL, September 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SJ Manders, a passionate advocate for social justice, shines a spotlight on the deeply rooted crisis in Gaza in her thought-provoking three-volume books, Catastrophe in Gaza & the Complicity of the West, Catastrophe in Gaza II, All Eyes on Rafah, and Catastrophe in Gaza III, War Crimes. SJ Manders is a graduate student and advocate for the basic human rights of innocent Palestinians suffering in Gaza and the West Bank, both before and after October 7, 2023, through the promotion of accurate information and documentation of the current conflict as separate from dogma, propaganda, and rhetoric. She seeks to advance public awareness of the devastating impact of the war and promote common ground as a way forward according to the rule of law and recognition that some rights are endemic to all people, including Palestinians, namely, safety, freedom, and self-determination, each ingrained in international law, the Geneva Convention, and United Nations Resolution #242. In her first book of a three-volume set, Catastrophe in Gaza, Complicity of the West, SJ focuses on the treatment of the Israeli-Palestinian issue through the lens of biased Western media and explores the role of politics and media to perpetuate Israeli sympathies at the expense of an unrecognized and dehumanized civilian population in Gaza. She draws parallels between a shared history of apartheid in Palestine with South Africa, both founded under the auspices of the United Nations in 1948. She urges an examination of the common history of both and the divergent path of liberation versus continued occupation.   Her second book of a three-volume set, Catastrophe in Gaza, All Eyes on Rafah, builds on the theme of impunity against escalation including the relentless bombing attacks on humanitarian zones and protected space in Gaza with advancement into Rafah-deemed a red line by the United States, despite the deaths of more than 15,000 children and lack of life-sustaining resources, including food, water, fuel, hospitals, and shelter, with diplomatic protections maintained and the uninterrupted flow of billions in military weapons. The book serves as a call to action, encouraging readers to resist distractions and remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice for the people of Gaza. Her third book of the three-volume series, Catastrophe in Gaza III, War Crimes, invites readers to examine the findings, preliminary findings, and outcomes of the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, resulting from illegal occupation and war of disproportion in Gaza with escalation into the West Bank and implications for a future Israel and Palestine. After all that has happened in an almost 100-year struggle a few fundamental questions remain, "Will leaders be held to account for the war crimes of ethnic cleansing, causing extermination, the use of starvation as a method of war, and targeting civilians in conflict - all crimes against humanity & violations of international law?" "Will the international community in the United Nations, and the United Nations Security Council & International Courts fulfill the fundamental obligation of upholding the standards of international law and protection of innocent civilians?" and finally, "Will the world wake up from the normalized state of blindness to the unparalleled impact of an oppressed people under military occupation and brutal system of apartheid in favor of a normalized Israeli state that favors itself in every conceivable manner, regardless of harm and history, above all else?"   As an unaffiliated, non-religious, doctorate-level researcher, taxpayer, and "like it or not" funder of militarism on Gaza, SJ Manders, an African American, has taken personal responsibility and obligation to document the truth and facts on the ground to convey with crystal clarity, events as they unfolded since October 7, 2023, in Gaza. In furtherance of reports from the over 170+ humanitarian, medical, and journalists targeted and killed on the ground to render them silenced, SJ hopes to forward their report for the benefit of free thought from the public taxpayer perspective. To that end, she emphasizes the value of the legal system and in this case, International Courts to hold violators accountable, regardless of who they are, while providing what could be the last chance of protection for an isolated and oppressed people caught in a system that mirrors Apartheid South Africa and a racial segment of history in America, that God willing, they shall overcome. Shalom, Amen, and Inshallah!   SJ refers to herself as a lifelong student and enjoys reading, writing, and living the beach life with family and friends.
