MOOSE JAW, SK, August 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DirectAuctions.ca is proud to present an extraordinary auction event that offers a rare opportunity to own a piece of Moose Jaw's rich history. On August 22, CanaDay's Apparel Ltd., a beloved icon in the local community for over six decades, will see its buildings, equipment, and memorabilia go under the hammer.  Established in 1954, CanaDay's Apparel Ltd. quickly became a cornerstone of Moose Jaw's economy, providing employment to more than 300 residents at its peak. The company was renowned for producing high-quality men's clothing, which was distributed across Canada to major retailers such as Hudson Bay, Woodward's, and Mark's Work Warehouse. The upcoming auction will feature an impressive collection of 916 items, including sewing machines, pressure rollers, industrial washers, chairs, and vintage exit signs from the company's plant at 115 Coronation Drive and its iconic "Pic-a-Pant" outlet at 429 River Street West.  Murray King, a former merchandising agent and a dedicated employee of nearly 60 years, expressed his mixed emotions about the event: "I'll be so happy just because it's been an economic burden the last seven years. I'll also be happy to get something for the machinery and the lots and the building. We had a good operation going, for sure."  Adding to the excitement, Jeff Schwarz, a renowned reality TV personality known as "The Liquidator," highlighted the significance of CanaDay's legacy: "To see somebody in Moose Jaw with over 300 employees, it's quite substantial. This was a very significant part of Moose Jaw for many years."

We're honored to help preserve and distribute these pieces of Moose Jaw's heritage."
