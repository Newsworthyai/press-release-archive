Mr. Chang has spearheaded several successful projects and initiatives that have improved the quality of life and well-being of Berkeley residents.  James Chang said "What I do best is I know how to deliver for constituents who are in need, as long as they're patient with me and give me time. Most of the time, I am able to give them what they want within reason, whether that's cleaning up a street, making sure that our unhoused people are compassionately served, or getting a traffic circle at the edge of our district, or making sure that their events get fully funded. Also, getting $9 million for the African American Holistic Research Center, and making MLK Way much safer. It's still messy, but safe. That took seven years, and I am so proud of it."  Mr. Chang directed a team to build a 3-year housing funding strategy that reduced homelessness. Then he established a cross-functional leadership team among business and activist groups to prioritize public safety goals. And he secured $27M of infrastructure funding through collaborative legislation.

Then he established a cross-functional leadership team among business and activist groups to prioritize public safety goals. And he secured $27M of infrastructure funding through collaborative legislation.   "For seven years", Chang said, "I've been Chief of Staff to former District 7 Councilmember Kriss Worthington and now to Councilmember Ben Bartlett. In these roles, I've problem-solved for hundreds of students and participated in writing and passing progressive legislation to expand affordable housing, end homelessness, meet the climate crisis, and improve public safety. I'm a proven progressive leader who will always be true to these values, but I know that serving on the Council isn't about political ideology; it's about governance and service."
