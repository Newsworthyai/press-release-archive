# DownTown Mystic 4 The Holidays

NEW YORK, NY, December 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music Inc. announces the holiday release of The DownTown Demos: AmeriKarma Demos & Final Versions by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. The album will be distributed to all the streaming services worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music on December 20. DownTown Mystic's 1st AI video, Shadow Walk, created by Joshua Elyashiv of the band SHIV, will be released via YouTube to promote the project. Jon Delange/Tinderbox Music will handle video promotion.  In 2023 DownTown Mystic released the career-defining album AmeriKarma. That album raised the artist's profile with over 3 million streams, thanks in part to its global Radio success. The DownTown Demos: AmeriKarma Demos & Final Versions contains 11 tracks: final versions of 4 core AmeriKarma tracks: Live, Shadow Walk, Fly & When The Angels Sing, with 4 demos and 3 bonus tracks. This will allow listeners to compare the demos against the final versions. DownTown Mystic writer/producer Robert Allen comments, "I was recording a sync project and experimenting with some beats. There were 4 tracks out of about 15 that I kept coming back to. I eventually heard the possibilities and began to create melodies and then write lyrics." The result would be the songs that would become the core of AmeriKarma.  One of the main reasons for the holiday release is to celebrate the personal journey it took to create AmeriKarma. The lead track Live was written by Robert 10 months before he would be diagnosed with MDS, aka pre-Leukemia. 7 months later in 2019, he would receive a life-saving stem cell transplant as a cure. Robert says, "I guess I was trying to tell myself something. It's been a long, strange trip for sure and the one constant that kept me going was the music." Robert would write most of the songs for AmeriKarma during his recovery and the Covid-19 quarantine. In 2022 he entered Shorefire Studios with drummer Steve Holley and bassist Paul Page to record the tracks that would be released as AmeriKarma. The 1st single Fly was released during the mixing sessions, a year before the album even had a title.  The DownTown Demos: AmeriKarma Demos & Final Versions album caps off another stellar year for DownTown Mystic. 2024 started with the release of the Rock'n'Roll 4 The Soul album, then its companion Acoustic Sessions EP, followed by the current Better Day Digital 45. All have charted on the NACC College Radio Charts. Add to that the secret release of the DownTown Nashville EP to County Radio in between the last 2 releases and 2024 has been one rockin' year! Robert adds, "Having survived my ordeal made me appreciate getting a second chance and making the most of it."  How will DownTown Mystic top a year like 2024? The next single One More Chance will be released on January 24, 2025, along with a new AI video. The Wish album will follow in the Spring, as well as having sync-licensed songs in the upcoming films, Sovereign with Dennis Quaid, Nick Offerman & Jacob Tremblay and Everything's Going to Be Great starring Bryan Cranston & Allison Janney. Stay tuned!  "a fascinating peek inside the creative process of a deeply talented team of musicians. It's also a lot of fun." The Static Dive  "Allen gives his music that modern touch some somewhat younger colleagues can just dream of." Rock At Night Magazine   "They set the table for the future as they reshuffle the deck of roots rock music for a whole new generation."
