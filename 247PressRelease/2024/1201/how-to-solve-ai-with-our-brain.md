SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, December 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- John Ball, an emerging voice in the field of artificial intelligence, is excited to announce the upcoming release of his groundbreaking book, How to Solve AI with Our Brain. Published by Pat Labs Pty Ltd, this insightful work exposes the flawed promises of computational AI and uncovers the cognitive science breakthroughs that could meaningfully advance the field.  In How to Solve AI with Our Brain, Ball empowers readers to understand the scientific foundations that will shape the future of artificial intelligence. While many consumers encounter AI primarily through computational systems, this book also addresses the higher standards for certainty and reliability that enterprise software users and producers demand.  Dr. Neal Sample, Chief Information Officer at Walgreens, emphasizes the book's significance, stating, "While many consumers' first exposure will be to computational AI, users, and producers of enterprise software have higher standards for certainty and reliability. This book sheds light on how the next generation of AI can meet these higher standards."
