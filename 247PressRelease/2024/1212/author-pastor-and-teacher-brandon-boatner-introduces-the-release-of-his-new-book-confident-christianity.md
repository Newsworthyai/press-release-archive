# Author, Pastor, and Teacher Brandon Boatner Introduces the Release of His New Book "Confident Christianity"

MAGNOLIA, TX, December 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Do you sometimes feel confused or uncertain about your faith? Maybe a Bible idea or principle just doesn't make sense right now. Or you don't know how to contend for the faith in today's culture. Author Brandon Boatner wishes that "Confident Christianity" had existed when he began this journey with Jesus decades ago.  Becoming an author, pastor, or teacher was never a consideration for Brandon, but the beginnings of those paths were clear. He cared deeply for others, often being the counselor or reconciler within his friend group. He also wrote poetry and music, recording his first album at age 16. This later led to ministry. Brandon is quoted saying, "I'm a musician, who God called to preach."   After college and Seminary, Brandon followed God's direction to Saint Louis, where he has been active for more than a decade. Some of Brandon's areas of impact are church revitalization, multi-ethnic ministry, and creating a culture of cooperation within the Kingdom of God.   Written with personal stories, humor, and saturated with Scripture, "Confident Christianity" will guide readers through essentials of the Christian faith, teach about discipleship, help people set achievable discipleship goals, and ultimately strengthen their faith. It is Brandon's hope that readers will use this tool to help move toward becoming a confident Christ follower.  As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Brandon's book will educate, support and inspire. "Confident Christianity" will help people study and gain the faith foundation needed to become a more confident Christian witness and share the gospel with others.
