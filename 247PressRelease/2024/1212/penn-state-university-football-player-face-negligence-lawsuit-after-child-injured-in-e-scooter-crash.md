# Penn State University, Football Player Face Negligence Lawsuit After Child Injured in E-Scooter Crash

CENTRE COUNTY, PA, December 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The family of a 6-year-old boy who was seriously injured in a February e-scooter crash on the Penn State campus has filed a negligence lawsuit against the university and freshman defensive tackle De'Andre Cook. Ostroff Godshall Injury and Accident Lawyers is the firm representing the family in the case.  The lawsuit, filed Nov. 12 by Shane Richard, the child's father, of Union County, alleges that Cook failed to yield at a pedestrian crosswalk on North Burrowes Road, striking the child with his scooter. The crash resulted in two pelvic fractures, a broken foot, and head injuries requiring four staples. The family claims Penn State violated its own policies by providing athletes access to banned scooters, contributing to the incident.  Attorney Rich Godshall of Ostroff Godshall Injury and Accident Lawyers, representing the child, described the injuries as significant, "This young boy endured severe physical trauma and faces a lengthy recovery due to decisions that prioritized convenience over safety," Godshall said.  The crash occurred around 6:10 p.m. on Feb. 18, 2024, as Shane Richard and his son were crossing North Burrowes Road in a designated pedestrian crosswalk on Penn State's campus. De'Andre Cook, listed at 6 feet 4 inches tall and 282 pounds, was riding an electric scooter at a high speed when he struck the boy, who weighs just 55 pounds. The collision left the child with severe injuries.  The lawsuit seeks damages from both Cook and Penn State, citing negligence in the scooter's operation and the university's failure to enforce its campus-wide ban on motorized scooters. Penn State policy prohibits the use of scooters that do not meet Pennsylvania Vehicle Code requirements, yet the suit alleges student-athletes were granted exceptions.  Penn State University declined to comment, citing its policy on pending litigation. Cook, who paid a fine for traffic violations related to the crash, has not publicly addressed the lawsuit.
