# World's First Wireless Adapter Transforming Car Navigation into a Laptop, AutoPro X, Launches on Kickstarter

NEW YORK, NY, March 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mayton Motion is launching AutoPro X, the world's first wireless adapter that allows users to use the car navigation screen like a laptop on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  AutoPro X is a smart wireless adapter that connects an Android smartphone to car navigation, enabling all functions usable in a computer. Simply plug AutoPro X into the car's USB port without any additional installation, and it's ready to use, utilizing the pre-installed Dex software in Samsung Galaxy devices.  With AutoPro X, users can operate all apps available on their smartphones and Google Play Store on the navigation screen. While previous Android Auto systems were limited to a few compatible applications, AutoPro X allows all functions like GPS, YouTube or OTT streaming, internet browsing, email, social media, Chat GPT, document processing, gaming, voice recognition like Bixby, and more. Additionally, users can also calibrate it with game controllers, keyboards, and other devices through via Bluetooth. AutoPro X focuses on diverse usability to run multiple apps simultaneously on one screen.  What makes such technologies possible lies in leveraging Samsung DeX software technology. While Samsung DeX software was originally designed for TV and PC monitor uses, Mayton Motion has succeeded in making it the world's first to be compatible with navigation screens, by developing AutoPro X.  'Screen Select Mode', which allows users to choose whether to entirely fill the screen or view in the original ratio, prioritizes user convenience catering individual preferences.  AutoPro X is compatible with vehicles that are connectable with Samsung Galaxy phones and Android Auto. Detailed information (i.e., Honda, Chrysler, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche, etc.) and the chance to pledge for AutoPro X will be available on the Kickstarter website platform March 21st, 2024.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/autopro-x/autopro-x-transform-your-navigation-screen-into-a-laptop?ref=9b7kx9
