# How Presidents FDR and Nixon Enacted Socialist Policies that Remain in the U.S.

PHOENIX, AZ, March 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In his newly released groundbreaking work- The Great Arrogation: Why America is Not a Party to the Battle of Armageddon, legal scholar, researcher and analyst R.C. Caudill describes how Former Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon enacted policies during their terms that were designed to boost the economy but also had very strong socialist undertones. Further, he explains that these policies by default changed the United States to a socialist nation at least in part and that similar policies remain in place even today.  R.C. provides a host of credible evidence from reliable sources to support his contentions. The book also focuses on current legal and governmental issues in the United States and how they affect the economy and the liberty of American citizens. The work is written from a Christian perspective and thus Caudill links these and other points to eschatology.  The Great Arrogation: Why America is Not a Party to the Battle of Armageddon is available in major bookstores including-  Amazon.com Barnes and Noble Abe Books  For more information- https://thegreatarrogation.com/  Published by Seabury Press https://seaburypress.online/
