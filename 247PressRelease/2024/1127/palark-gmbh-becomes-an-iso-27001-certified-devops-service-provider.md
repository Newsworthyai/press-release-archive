ULM, GERMANY, November 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Palark GmbH announces becoming an ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified company, reassuring its commitment to secure and reliable operations. Meeting the certification requirements, as validated by third-party experts, confirms that Palark renders its DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) services in a thoroughly organised, robust, and safe manner.  The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification assumes establishing and continuously maintaining an information security management system that protects crucial data and ensures sustainable business operations.  "For Palark as a B2B service provider working with vital customer data, it's essential to have an elaborated, secure, well-documented approach to dealing with various access rights and confidential data.

"We rigorously examined and improved our processes, tools, and documentation to enforce actual reliability in our daily operations."  Previously, Palark also successfully assisted its customers, including a Norwegian SaaS startup, in becoming ISO 27001 certified. Together with Palark's own recent certification, this experience outlines the accumulated company's expertise in building solid information security management systems, as international standards require.
