# Marleen Geyen's Am I a Coach: Short Stories of Intentional Actions Set to Inspire Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs

MINNEAPOLIS, MN, November 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acclaimed business leader and author Marleen Geyen is poised to make waves in the literary world with the release of her highly anticipated book, Am I a Coach: Short Stories of Intentional Actions. This thought-provoking collection of stories is set to inspire and empower professionals with its unique blend of business insights and personal reflections.  Drawing from her extensive experience as a business owner and leader, Geyen offers readers a series of short stories that transcend conventional business advice. Each story explores the intersection of professional life and personal growth, weaving lessons on leadership, resilience, and intentional living into a narrative that is both engaging and relatable. The book is now available for pre-order on Amazon.  "Am I a Coach isn't just a book about business," says Geyen. "It's about the human side of leadership—the stories, challenges, and triumphs that shape who we are as leaders and how we guide others."   This collection stands out by highlighting real-world applications of strategic thinking, team management, and the small but powerful actions that make a lasting impact. Geyen's stories resonate with entrepreneurs, business leaders, and anyone navigating the complexities of professional and personal development. Her emphasis on intentional actions—the mindful, purpose-driven decisions that lead to meaningful outcomes—is a timely reminder of how impactful leadership truly begins.  Why Am I a Coach Stands Out: •	Real-Life Reflections: Each story draws from genuine business experiences, making the lessons both practical and inspiring. •	A Fresh Perspective: Unlike many business books that focus solely on strategy, Geyen's work integrates personal insights, revealing the authentic journey behind professional growth. •	Timely and Relevant: In an age where intentionality and mindfulness are valued more than ever, Am I a Coach offers stories that encourage readers to reflect on their own actions and leadership style.  The book will be officially released on November 20, 2024, but is currently available for pre-order on major platforms, including Amazon. Early reviews have praised Geyen's candid storytelling and ability to connect with readers through her unique blend of business acumen and personal experience.
