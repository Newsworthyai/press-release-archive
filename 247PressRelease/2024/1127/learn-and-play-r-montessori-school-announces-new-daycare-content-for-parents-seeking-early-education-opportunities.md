FREMONT, CA, November 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Learn And Play® Montessori School, a top-rated provider of early childhood education in the San Francisco Bay Area, is proud to announce a renewed focus on its daycare programs, designed to serve children as young as 18 months. With locations across the Bay Area, including Fremont, Dublin, Milpitas, and the newly opened Sunnyvale and Hercules (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/hercules/) campuses, the school provides age-appropriate, nurturing environments that foster a passion for learning even in the earliest stages of development.  Kiran Grewal, Co-Founder of Learn And Play® Montessori, emphasized the importance of early childhood education: "It is never too early to instill a love for learning. Our daycare programs create a foundation of confidence, curiosity, and independence, setting children on a path for lifelong success. Parents can rest assured that their young learners are in an environment that not only cares for them but also enriches their minds."  The daycare programs at Learn And Play Montessori integrate the best of Montessori principles with STEM-based learning; more information can be found at the newly updated page at https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/daycare/. Children are encouraged to explore their surroundings, develop motor skills, and engage in hands-on activities that build essential cognitive, social, and emotional skills. The curriculum is carefully crafted to introduce concepts such as basic math, science, and language through playful and interactive methods, fostering natural curiosity and discovery.  Unlike traditional daycare programs, the program focuses on brain development through structured play and practical life activities. From learning to share and cooperate with peers to mastering basic self-care routines, children develop essential skills that prepare them for preschool and beyond. The program also includes elements such as art, music, and cultural studies, ensuring a well-rounded early education experience. An additional informative post can be found at https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/blog/daycare-to-nurture/ and all parents are encouraged to book a school tour to explore how the program can help their children and family.
