"Poe's legacy as one of the most influential American authors has been embraced globally, and his works are translated into languages spoken around the world," said Poe Theatre Founder and Artistic Director Alex Zavistovich. "It's gratifying to see an idea that started three years ago in my basement in Baltimore City begin to grow into a truly international event."   Edgar Allan Poe worked in Baltimore for three years, during which time he authored some of his more notable stories, including "MS Found in a Bottle," "Berenice" and "Shadow â€“ A Parable." His connection to Baltimore is much stronger than that, however, His wife, Virginia Clemm Poe, was born in Baltimore, and his grandfather, the renowned military leader David Poe, was a co-founder of Baltimore's historic First and Franklin Church. Edgar Allan Poe's body is buried on the grounds of Baltimore's Westminster Hall.
