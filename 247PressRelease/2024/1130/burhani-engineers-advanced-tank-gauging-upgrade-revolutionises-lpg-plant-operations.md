# Burhani Engineers' Advanced Tank Gauging Upgrade Revolutionises LPG Plant Operations

NAIROBI, KENYA, November 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers is proud to announce the successful completion of a major upgrade project at a client's LPG Plant in Nairobi, Kenya. This milestone demonstrates the company's unwavering commitment to providing innovative engineering solutions tailored to the complex needs of the oil and gas sector. Their team undertook a comprehensive overhaul of the plant's existing tank gauging system, upgrading older REX gauges to the state-of-the-art Rosemount 5900 series. This transformation represents a significant enhancement in measurement accuracy, operational efficiency and long-term reliability for the plant's systems.  The client faced a series of operational challenges with the older REX gauges that had been in use. These gauges, limited by basic analog communication protocols and rudimentary HART integration, hindered seamless interaction with modern control systems. Furthermore, the reliance on mechanical components within these older models led to frequent maintenance needs, resulting in increased downtime and higher operational costs. The plant's need for more robust and reliable instrumentation was evident, and Burhani Engineers rose to the occasion with an expertly executed solution.  The project included a complete lifecycle management approach. Their skilled team handled every aspect of the upgrade, from initial planning and procurement to installation and commissioning. The switch to the advanced Rosemount 5900 series was strategically planned and implemented to ensure minimal disruption to ongoing operations. The Rosemount 5900 series stands out for its advanced technology, including digital communication protocols such as Foundation Fieldbus, Modbus, WirelessHART and HART, facilitating seamless integration with the client's modern control systems. This shift has resulted in a significant leap forward in how the plant monitors and manages its LPG inventory.  Unlike the mechanically dependent REX gauges, the Rosemount 5900 series operates without moving parts. This innovation substantially reduces the need for maintenance, cutting down on operational interruptions and associated costs. With no mechanical wear and tear to contend with, the client can now benefit from a more consistent and reliable measurement system, bolstering the plant's overall efficiency and safety profile. The new system's high-precision measurements also ensure better process optimisation, even under challenging environmental conditions, enhancing the plant's safety protocols and operational oversight.  This upgrade was a testament to the expertise and dedication of Burhani Engineers Ltd's engineering and technical teams, who brought their vast knowledge of instrumentation and control systems to bear on the project. Every phase was executed with meticulous attention to detail, meeting strict technical and safety standards. By delivering on time and within budget, their team reinforced Burhani Engineers' reputation for excellence in engineering services.  The successful execution of this project not only addresses the specific challenges faced by this specific client but also highlights Burhani Engineers' capabilities in delivering tailored solutions to the wider oil and gas sector, among other industries. Their approach balances advanced technology with practical implementation, ensuring long-term client satisfaction. The enhanced reliability and accuracy of the new gauging system will support the client in maintaining safer, more efficient operations for years to come.  This project is a clear demonstration of their commitment to engineering excellence, where every solution provided is marked by quality, reliability and a deep understanding of the client's needs. As Burhani Engineers continue to serve sectors such as Oil & Gas, Food and Beverage and beyond, they remain steadfast in their pursuit of innovative solutions that drive progress and operational success.
