# HBO Chief Executive Officer Dismisses George R.R. Martin's Concerns Over House of the Dragon Season 2, Says It Did "Really, Really Well"

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a recent interview with Deadline, Bloys was asked whether the fanbase was "divided" over the latest season of the popular prequel series. He responded, "I'm not sure the fans were divided by season 2."  This came after the interviewer referenced Martin's now-deleted blog post criticizing certain aspects of season 2. Bloys seemed to take a lighthearted jab, replying, "Yes, maybe one fan was. But no, the show did really, really well. I expect that will be in competition."  Martin's post had taken issue with changes made to the Blood and Cheese scene, which diverged from the source material and omitted Helaena's youngest son. He also speculated whether these changes could have a butterfly effect on future seasons, including a major event in House of the Dragon season 3. Despite these concerns, Martin's relationship with HBO remains strong, with a new Game of Thrones spin-off, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, having just wrapped filming.  As for HBO's awards prospects, Bloys expressed optimism: "I have high hopes for Penguin with Colin and Cristin. We've got The White Lotus coming back, The Last of Us returning, and Hacks is coming back too. So I'm looking forward to next year."  The lighthearted exchange from Bloys sparked chatter on social media, with some fans wondering if HBO was subtly trolling Martin in response to his public critique. Meanwhile, discussions around fake accounts fanning the flames of the debate have also surfaced, with some speculating that certain accounts were amplifying the controversy beyond the general fan reaction.  Regardless of the online discussions, Bloys, as HBO's top executive, remains confident in the show's performance and its chances for next year's Emmys. "The show did really well, and I fully expect it to be a contender," Bloys added.
