# The Global Peace Summit and Peace Prize with Dr. K. A. Paul at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, In Beverly Hills

BEVERLY HILLS, CA, November 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On a recent evening at the prestigious Beverly Hills Hilton Hotel, Dr. KA Paul, a globally recognized humanitarian, spiritual leader, and advocate for peace, delivered an unforgettable talk that left a profound impact on the influential guests in attendance. The event, which gathered a diverse group of entertainment industry giants, CEOs of major organizations, non-profit leaders, and philanthropists, was a powerful reminder of the importance of compassion, peace, and service to those in need.   Dr. Paul, a man who has dedicated his life to humanitarian causes and spreading messages of hope, shared insights drawn from his own personal faith and experiences. As a devout follower of Jesus Christ, Dr. Paul's message was clear: true success is not measured by wealth, fame, or power, but by the impact one has on others, especially the most vulnerable in society—orphans, widows, and the marginalized.   Drawing from biblical principles, Dr. Paul underscored the essential role of peacemakers in today's divided and often chaotic world. He encouraged the audience, many of whom hold influential positions across various industries, to leverage their platforms for positive change, becoming voices for peace and leaders driven by empathy and integrity. Dr. Paul reminded those present that, in the face of global unrest, the call to be peacemakers is more crucial than ever. He emphasized that true compassion involves not just personal success, but also caring for those who are most vulnerable—such as orphans and widows. By showing kindness to the marginalized, he explained, individuals reflect the heart of Christ and fulfill their higher purpose of service to others.   The event was not just a speech, but a call to action. Dr. Paul's work spans the globe, and his efforts have earned him recognition as one of the most influential figures in the world of humanitarian work. Through his organization, The Global Peace Initiative, Dr. Paul has helped provide resources, education, and healthcare to millions of people across the world. His message at the Beverly Hills Hilton was not just inspirational, but also a challenge to those present to step up and make a difference.  Dame Sandra Costa was the executive organizer, supported by B David Levine, Queennak, Kim Fitzgerald Starzyk, Nfagie Koroma, Ashinee Reynolds, Princess Monalisa Okojie, George Lewis and Allen Shay. Dr. K. A. Paul honored this group as Global Peace Ambassadors and presented to them The Global Peace Award.  As the evening drew to a close, Dr. KA Paul's words lingered in the hearts and minds of those in attendance. His powerful call to action—to become true peacemakers and advocates for compassion—resonated deeply with the influential leaders gathered at the Beverly Hills Hilton. In a world torn by division and conflict, Dr. Paul's message was a timely reminder that the path to healing and unity begins with each individual's commitment to peace. As the guests left the event, many felt inspired to use their influence, resources, and platforms to actively promote peace, understanding, and service to those in need. The challenge was clear: in every corner of society, whether in business, entertainment, or philanthropy, there is a vital role for each person to play in fostering a culture of peace.
