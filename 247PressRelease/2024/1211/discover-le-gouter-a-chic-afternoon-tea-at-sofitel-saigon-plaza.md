# Discover Le Goûter: A Chic Afternoon Tea At Sofitel Saigon Plaza

HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM, December 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sofitel Saigon Plaza is delighted to once again present the exquisite French-inspired afternoon tea experience Le Goûter this festive season. Following the resounding success of our pastry collection at Boudoir Lounge, we are proud to unveil a new menu, meticulously crafted by the renowned French Chef Robin Mouquet. Starting December 5, 2024, Le Goûter will be served from Tuesday to Sunday every week between 2:00 PM and 5:30 PM at Le17 Bistro restaurant.  As an invitation to embrace Sofitel's authentic and lively food and beverage concept with a touch of French Zest, Le Goûter promises a captivating selection of refined pastries, presented with style on a sophisticated white trolley. Each exquisite creation is freshly prepared daily, allowing guests to personally select from an array of delicacies beautifully displayed on the trolley. With an illustrious background in Michelin-starred kitchens, working alongside culinary legends such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire, and Pierre Hermé, Robin Mouquet is celebrated for his innovative fusion of pastry techniques with the rich flavors of Vietnam, delivering an unforgettable gastronomic experience. Every Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday, he will be present at Le17 Bistro to personally serve guests and share the inspiration behind the Le Goûter menu.  Immerse yourself in the art of French pastry with two highlights from the Le Goûter collection: Mont Blanc and Paris Brest! Named after the highest peak in the Alps, Mont Blanc represents the snow-capped mountain in winter. With a crispy meringue base, Mont Blanc is enhanced with a hint of blueberry tartness to complement the rich Chestnut purée and cream. Meanwhile, Paris Brest pays tribute to France's oldest long-distance cycling race, Paris-Brest-Paris, with a stylized wheel shape. Golden pate à choux, creamy Hazelnut Mousseline, all promise to create a wonderful experience. Robin Mouquet shares: "From Paris Brest, Mont Blanc, to classic pâtisserie, Le Goûter will not only satisfy your taste buds but also elevate your tea time to an entirely new level."  For a truly indulgent affair, Le Goûter can be paired with the exceptional The Teamakers Private Reserve collection from Dilmah. Revered for their rare, refined flavors, these teas are hand-selected from the finest tea estates around the world, embodying the pinnacle of tea craftsmanship. Guests may also savor the nuanced richness of sustainable Vietnamese coffee, grown with care at Folliett Coffee, providing an ideal complement to the finesse pastries. Why not enhance your experience with a glass of Pommery Brut Reserve Champagne? With its graceful effervescence and rich, refined flavor, it's the ideal way to toast to luxury, directly from the prestigious Champagne region of France.  "We are thrilled to reintroduce Le Goûter, with the aspiration to make Sofitel Saigon Plaza not only a destination for guests to revel in the timeless charm of afternoon tea but also a cultural crossroads where the finest elements of French and Vietnamese traditions beautifully intertwine," said Mr. Alistair Minty, Acting General Manager.
