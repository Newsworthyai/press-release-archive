Remember, for comprehensive security guard services available nationwide 24/7, call Fast Guard Service.  Top 10 Holiday Security Tips:  1. Secure Your Property When Away  If traveling or closing your business, hire a drive-by security service for daily checks. Install cameras as deterrents; our guards can monitor systems and respond to alerts 24/7, acting as your personal defense system.  2. Be Vigilant While Shopping  Stay aware of your surroundings, especially when purchasing high-value items. Avoid shopping alone and be cautious of individuals observing you.  3. Postpone Sharing Travel Plans on Social Media  Refrain from posting vacation details until after returning home to prevent alerting potential criminals to your absence.  4. Manage Deliveries During Absence  Arrange for packages and mail to be held or delivered to a secure location to avoid accumulation that signals an empty home.  5. Illuminate Your Property  Ensure all entrances are well-lit to deter intruders. Use motion-sensor lights and keep trees and shrubs trimmed to eliminate hiding spots.  6. Use Timers for Lights and Electronics  Set timers to turn lights and electronics on and off, giving the appearance of occupancy.  7. Secure Doors and Windows  Install deadbolts and secondary locks on all doors and windows. Avoid hiding spare keys outside; instead, give one to a trusted neighbor or friend.  8. Be Cautious with Strangers at Your Door  Verify the identity of unexpected visitors, especially those claiming to represent charities. Donate directly to recognized organizations.  9. Practice Fire Safety  Inspect holiday lights for damage before use and avoid overloading electrical outlets. Keep decorations away from heat sources and never leave candles unattended.  10. Plan Safe Travels  Ensure your vehicle is in good condition before traveling. Share travel itineraries with trusted individuals and avoid discussing travel plans publicly.
