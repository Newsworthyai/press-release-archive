# Parent Coaching Institute Graduate Launches Online Community for Both Parents and Parent Coaches

BELLINGHAM, WA, December 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Parent Coaching Institute (PCI) proudly announces the successful launch of a new online membership community by PCI graduate, Natalie McCabe. Bringing parents together with professional parent coaches, the space, the Powerful Parenting Collective, is uniquely designed to foster meaningful connections, offer guidance, and provide resources to help parents thrive on their individual journeys.  Ms. McCabe, who resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia, explains how it all began: "After making a post on Facebook asking parenting experts and parents, "Who wants to have a chat on YouTube?" I received over 400 responses. I immediately wondered, why are we all out here alone, in different corners of the internet trying to spread our message? I knew then and there that we would all be more powerful and make a bigger impact if we collaborated together and the Powerful Parenting Collective was born!"  Gloria DeGaetano, founder and CEO of the Parent Coaching Institute adds, "For PCI Certified Parent Coaches® this community is a place to exchange best practices, discuss the latest coaching techniques, and explore new strategies to support parents in raising resilient, confident children. Natalie has given PCI Coaches and other parenting experts a wonderful opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and support each other in building their parent coaching practices."  The Powerful Parenting Collective is a membership organization for both parents and professional parent coaches. Ms. McCabe will be rolling out an affiliate program for coaches in early 2025 as well. For more information, interested individuals can contact Ms. McCabe: Natalie@nataliemccabe.com.
