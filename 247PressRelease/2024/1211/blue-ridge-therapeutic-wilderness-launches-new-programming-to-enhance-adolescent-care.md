# Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness Launches New Programming to Enhance Adolescent Care

CLAYTON, GA, December 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness is excited to announce the launch of a new initiative designed to complement its renowned outdoor programming for adolescent girls and boys ages 12-14 and 14-17. Blue Ridge has introduced biweekly overnight stays at its bunkhouse, combining immersive outdoor experiences with creative and therapeutic indoor programming to provide a comprehensive and balanced approach to adolescent care.  Extensive research highlights the restorative power of time spent in nature, particularly when paired with intentional breaks from electronic devices. Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness has long witnessed the benefits of outdoor immersion as students learn to regulate their emotions, build resilience, and develop meaningful connections with peers and mentors. Now, with the addition of indoor programming, students will have access to enriching experiences that deepen their growth and provide essential comforts.  Creative Intensives Foster Expression  During their time indoors, students at Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness will engage in creative intensives carefully designed to spark imagination and foster personal expression. Activities such as jewelry making, pottery, nature-inspired art projects, and gourmet cooking offer students a chance to explore new skills while participating in therapeutic conversations. These projects provide opportunities for self-expression and reflection in a supportive, low-pressure environment.  Comfort Meets Purposeful Care  The bunkhouse experience is tailored to provide both physical and emotional comfort. Students can enjoy hot showers, traditional beds, and family-style breakfasts while catching up on practical tasks such as laundry and backpack organization. This intentional break from outdoor activities allows students to recharge and prepare for their next adventure.  The indoor setting also enables more complex projects requiring electricity, hot water, or specialized tools. Free from the demands of camp chores, students can relax and engage with deeper aspects of their subconscious, supported by a caring and professional team.  Supporting Families Through Holistic Programming  Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness remains dedicated to supporting families who have made the difficult decision to seek a higher level of care for their loved ones. The organization provides a well-rounded experience designed to comfort and energize students and families by seamlessly integrating outdoor immersion with indoor creative and therapeutic opportunities.  Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness is a licensed and accredited outdoor child-caring program that provides mental health treatment from licensed therapists and skilled outdoors professionals. Removed from the distractions of daily home life, students (ages 12-18, and 18-29 in the Emerald Arrow young adult program) experience the abundance of the nature-based setting of the North Georgia Chattahoochee National Forest. Blue Ridge Wilderness and Emerald Arrow provide clinically-focused assessment and evidence-based therapeutic approaches that teach students communication skills, emotional regulation, healthy habits, and other skills needed to be aware of and act on their values.
