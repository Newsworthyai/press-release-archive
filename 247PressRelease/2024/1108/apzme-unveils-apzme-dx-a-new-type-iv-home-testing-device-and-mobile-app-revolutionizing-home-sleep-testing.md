# apZme Unveils "apZme Dx" - A New Type IV Home Testing Device and Mobile App Revolutionizing Home Sleep Testing

HOLLYWOOD, FL, November 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- apZme, a leader in dental sleep medicine, proudly announces the launch of apZme Dx, a new type IV home testing device and AI-powered mobile app developed in collaboration with Millennium Sleep Lab, an apZme company. Designed to simplify and accelerate the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing disorders like sleep apnea, apZme Dx offers patients a modern, convenient way to conduct home sleep tests.  apZme Dx is a wrist-worn type IV testing device that uses signals from familiar pulse oximeters and employs advanced AI-driven analysis to accurately detect respiratory events—including AHI, RDI, and hypoxic burden—and to identify sleep stages such as wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM. This comprehensive data provides clinicians with a fuller evaluation of sleep health. The app immediately transfers the data for physician review, allowing clinicians to access and interpret information with ease, and to export a final sleep report for sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment.  "At apZme, our mission is to lead the way in innovating dental sleep medicine and bring accessible, effective sleep health solutions to patients everywhere," said Rani Ben-David, Founder and CEO of apZme. "With apZme Dx, we're making a powerful step forward by making sleep diagnostics easier, faster, and more convenient than ever."  With Rani Ben-David—a pioneering force in sleep health and the founder of a pioneering initiative in sleep health technology—apZme has been advancing sleep medicine solutions for years. The launch of apZme Dx marks a full-circle moment for Ben-David's longstanding commitment to innovation in sleep diagnostics and care.  The app's features are designed to ensure inclusivity and accuracy, with no performance bias in relation to skin color, making it effective in reaching diverse patient populations. The platform also centralizes data management across multiple devices, creating a streamlined process for clinicians and enabling multi-night testing to provide a fuller picture of patient sleep patterns.  "The launch of apZme Dx represents apZme's commitment to advancing sleep health. By centralizing device data, facilitating easier clinician access, and accelerating treatment, we are delivering high-quality, patient-centered care," said Dr. Kent Smith, DDS, D-ABDSM, CEO of Star Sleep & Wellness, and Co-Founder & President of apZme.
