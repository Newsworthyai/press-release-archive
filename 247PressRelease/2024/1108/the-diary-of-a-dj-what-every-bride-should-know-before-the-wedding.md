# The Diary of a DJ: What Every Bride Should Know Before The Wedding

HOUSTON, TX, November 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Diary of a DJ by David Campo is a book that brides never knew they needed. This book is a comprehensive guide to adding that element of perfection to one's wedding, the most special day of an individual's life. From choosing between a band and a DJ to handling the timeline of the main day, this book is a must-read for all brides-to-be and couples. Coming straight from the heart of a DJ (read wedding expert), this read subtly yet beautifully touches every question that a bride-to-be is dealing with in the wedding planning process.   Campo has been in the wedding industry for more than two decades, which makes his book an invaluable tool for all soon-to-be brides and engaged couples. Usually, DJs are not given much importance which marks the beginning of a wedding horror story, turning a couple's special day into a nightmare.   As Campo writes in his book, "Anyone can push a play button, but they can't really know how to read a room like a DJ can; they can't see what's happening around the room and think that it's a good idea to do the bouquet toss now or the money dance in 5 minutes. I can't stress enough the importance of a DJ."   The best thing about The Diary of a DJ is how substantially it covers all the possible issues that can occur on a wedding day by sharing his personal experiences throughout his reign in the wedding world. The author has taken it upon himself to educate and address all possible areas that brides-to-be would want to focus on to make their day perfect.   By the end of this book, readers can expect to have an upper hand with enough knowledge to make all the right music-based decisions on their wedding day, handle technical mishaps, and turn their big day into a memorable one.  David Campo, a seasoned wedding DJ, has been in the business since 2003. His experience of more than twenty years has bestowed upon him the expertise and the skills to help soon-to-be-married couples make the best music-based decisions for their big day to turn it into a perfect memory. He is an independent wedding DJ who runs solo shows, personally taking care of every aspect of the wedding music, ensuring that the brides can be fully present to take in every moment of their wedding day.
