# Nature Can Control Zebra Mussels When Provided with Sufficient Life Force Energy

SOUTH PASADENA, CA, September 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the latest of a series of ecological articles, W. John Martin, MD, PhD, is reporting the disintegration of invasive zebra mussels from Big Spirit Lake, Iowa. While the major emphasis of the environmental movement has been on improving the composition of agricultural land, increasing attention is being given to reestablishing vibrant and healthy inland waterways. Currently, the majority of the Nation's rivers and lakes are unsafe for bathing with advisory limits on the intake of locally caught fish. These rivers and lakes are lacking in their intrinsic capacity to overcome the ongoing water pollution caused by human activity. According to Martin, this reflects an overall deficiency of a life force energy that he defines as KELEA, a synonym for Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction. Restoring the lost functions of damaged water ecosystems proceeds by the reverting to earlier evolved biological processes. The less evolved biological processes are more resiliant to damage, although they typically require far more energy. The capacity of Nature to use progressive, step-wise means of restoring its normal functions is termed Nature's Allostasis. It can begin in polluted waterways with the carbon and energy-enhanced expansion of beneficial microbes, followed by balanced collections of smaller to larger invertebrates, which provide the foundation to better support vertebrate life forms. Zebra mussels originated from the Capsian Sea and Black Sea in Southern Ukraine and Russia. They have become a major menace to the Great Lakes and other lakes in the Midwest, primarily because of their capacity to occlude metal pipes and to ingest enormous amounts of phytoplankton. It was thought that the mere introduction of zebra mussels into US waters was sufficient for their survival and out-competing of existing mussels. Attempts at reducing contamination have accordingly included the use of toxic copper-containing compounds and the imposition of strict quarantine in the moving of untreated boats between lakes. Regions of Big Spirit Lake were treated with a combination of KELEA-attracting volcanic rock pellets, marketed as Kiko Technology, biochar, and a mineral water conditioner. This simple protocol was applied by Mr. Steve Gruhn, a prominant local resident. It not only reduced the levels of contaminating algae in the lake but he also saw the return of wildlife that had been scarce in recent years. Moreover, a major die-off of zebra mussels occurred beginning last December and has now been further witnessed by the marked reduction in intact shells attached to recently docked boats. The improved water in Big Spirit Lake is, seemingly, no longer a suitable environment for zebra mussels. Like the historical debate between Antoine BÃ©champ and Louis Pasteur, the terrain can have a major impact on the survival of certain pathogens. Additional efforts to use KELEA to prevent the potential further spread of Zebra mussels within the United States and Western Europe, and to treat existing contaminated rivers and lakes are warranted.
