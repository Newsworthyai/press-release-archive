# SeniorMatch:Dating After 50. People More Focus on Feelings, Not the Socioeconomic Status

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In today's fast-paced society, senior singles face numerous challenges in making new connections. While they often meet new friends through work and social events, finding the right partner remains difficult. As online dating becomes popular, more seniors are turning to dating websites and apps to find love.  SeniorMatch, a dating site designed specifically for middle-aged singles over 50, recently conducted a survey of 138 users. It found that:  - Men tend to date younger women, especially on dating apps, where they can more directly access users' age information. - Men over 50 show a stronger desire to start new relationships, often entering into a new romance within six months. - Older women typically make it clear that they do not accept "hookups" and are more inclined to seek serious relationships. - Both men and women tend not to consider each other's professions, religions, or ethnic backgrounds, but place greater emphasis on education and interests. This shift helps determine whether both parties share common interests, topics, and lifestyles.  In addition, SeniorMatch offers features like voice messaging and video chatting, enabling users to establish deeper connections before meeting in person. This allows them to get to know each other in a comfortable environment, enhancing mutual trust.  In addition, over 64% of singles over 50 indicated that they are not in a hurry to confirm a new relationship, often preferring to have facetime or exchange messages before meeting in person. Some users even discuss sexual preferences prior to their first meeting to ensure that both parties have aligned goals, which helps them decide whether to proceed with an in-person date. This kind of discussion allows both individuals to better understand each other's expectations and needs, avoiding potential misunderstandings and disappointments in the future, and fostering a more open and confident approach as they enter a new relationship.
