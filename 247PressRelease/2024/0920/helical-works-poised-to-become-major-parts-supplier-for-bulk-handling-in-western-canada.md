# HELICAL WORKS POISED TO BECOME MAJOR PARTS SUPPLIER FOR BULK HANDLING IN WESTERN CANADA

ABBOTSFORD, BC, September 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Abbotsford's Helical Works Company Ltd. is repositioning their product offering to better serve customers in bulk and material handling industries across Western Canada.  Since it was launched several years ago by its parent company, Mainland Machinery, Helical Works has maintained a reputation for high quality products and customizable solutions. However, as Helical Works is now coming into its own, they will be adding a complete line of pre-manufactured helical and conveyor products that will provide their customers with the same quality but easier access and quicker service.  "This will be industrial purchasing at its best," said General Manager, Paul Hiebert. "Our helical customers in Western Canada have been looking for a local supplier for the products they need in a quality they trust. We're striving to be that company—with superior products that are ready to go, off the shelf."  Mainland Machinery has excelled in delivering effective industrial solutions for more than fifty years, and now Helical Works is building on that stellar foundation toward another fifty years of success in the Western Canadian industrial marketplace, serving bulk and material handling in ports and terminals, mining and minerals, oil and gas, as well as industrial agriculture.  Helical Works benefits from at least two generations of expertise in industrial services. According to Hiebert, he and his father are both still actively involved in the family business. "My dad still works here—at 83 years old," Hiebert said, "and he still has the same passion for delivering the best solutions to our customers at the best value."  Helical Works brings together an older generation of unparalleled on-the-job excellence and a new generation of business acumen, strategic direction, and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes. And a third generation is already engaged—Hiebert's son is currently working on the shop floor.  "I'm really proud of how flexible our company has been," Hiebert commented. "We've been able to adapt to the needs of the marketplace and creatively align our products and services to the needs of our customers."  Today, Helical Works is filling a critical gap in the bulk and material handling industry in Western Canada by supplying three main components to the marketplace: helical flights, replacement augers, and screw conveyors. In the future, they will complement their product lines with additional components.  Hiebert also emphasized their regional focus, "We are local to Western Canada, we will manufacture here, we will stock our parts here, and we will deliver here. If customers in Western Canada are looking for bulk handling parts and equipment, Helical Works Co will be their local supplier."
