NORWALK, CT, September 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On August 24, 2024, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc. (MMRF), the largest nonprofit in the world solely focused on accelerating a cure for each and every multiple myeloma patient, set out on the eighth installment of its annual endurance cycling program, Road to Victories.  Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer of the plasma cells that develops in the bone marrow and can spread throughout the body. It is the second most common blood cancer. The endurance event raised crucial funds to accelerate a cure for every myeloma patient through research, awareness, patient education, and community support. The 2024 Road to Victories team has raised $110,000 and counting for the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.  Sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, the MMRF Road to Victories program has not only fostered physical endurance but also served as a powerful platform for raising funds.  "As an organization solely focused on patient outcomes and accelerating cures, the MMRF is honored to partner, and ride, with those battling multiple myeloma – patients, families, physicians, researchers, and our partners," said Michael Andreini, President, and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. "This team represents our community and demonstrates that together, we are fueling progress and driving cures."  Road to Victories covered over 250 miles through California's Wine Country – Sonoma, Napa, Yountville, Bodega Bay and sweeping Pacific Coast views, along the Russian River, and Armstrong Redwoods State Preserve. The 18-person team included six multiple myeloma patients, as well as family members, healthcare providers, and supporters.  "Road to Victories is more than just a bike ride, it is an unforgettable and life changing experience. The week is a journey among friends providing support, inspiration, and hope to all participants," said Rob Bultje, Regional Business Director, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. "Everyone who participated in this year's ride became stronger physically, mentally and emotionally after the immersive experience and I'm confident we'll all cherish these memories forever."
