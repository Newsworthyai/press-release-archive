WILMINGTON, NC, May 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Joseph Ganci, the author of three bestselling books in the Empire Of Israel series, is offering his latest eBook, 'Second David, Trials and Tribulations,' for free on Amazon from May 20 through May 24, 2024. Don't miss this opportunity to delve into the world of 'The Empire of Israel' series at no cost.  Prepare to be captivated by a fresh perspective on biblical history. In 'Second David, Trials and Tribulations,' Ganci masterfully weaves an epic historical tapestry, rich with penetrating insight and colored by insurrection, coups, and civil wars. This is not your typical historical fiction-it's a gripping journey through the ancient world, an enhanced history that mirrors present-day headlines about Israel, Jerusalem, and power politics. And it's all backed up by solid research and accepted historical connections.  Reviewer Cecelia Hopkins called 'Second David' "a must-read for lovers of Christian literature and historical fiction." Reviewer Essian Asian said, "Joseph Ganci masterfully blends historical narrative with captivating facts to create an engrossing read. This gives us a much more credible picture of David than we would have from any other source. Ganci's storytelling style highlights the attention to detail that fills in the gaps in the story concerning questions readers might have about David's failings. 'Second David: Trials And Tribulations' is one book historical fiction buffs will enjoy. "  The novel unveils the near miss of David's son Absalom's assassination attempt and the betrayal by Ahithophel Bathsheba's grandfather, the only man alive David feared. He was once David's trusted friend and prime minister. Ahithophel's contempt for David leads to a failed coup and an orchestrated insurrection, plunging the kingdom into civil war.  The book meshes historical facts with the excitement of an action-packed adventure novel. Our version of this history is like a puzzle, missing many of its pieces. 'Second David' provides those missing pieces and reveals the consequences of David's self-imposed judgment and punishment, which balance the scales of justice.  This is not just another biblical saga; it's a revelation, painting a new portrait of ancient Israel, Jerusalem, and the profound impact of one man's choices. It is an unforgettable exploration of an era that continues to shape the capital of Israel, even today.  Readers and reviewers alike have praised both of Ganci's first two books in the series:  "Although most people are aware of the story of David and Goliath, the giant, 'David: God's Chosen Crucible' by Joseph Ganci is a brilliant retelling of all the stories about the Shepard boy who would one day become a King of Israel. Reading with all the informational value of a history textbook is deftly combined with the entertainment of an action/adventure novel." Michael J. Carson Reviewer for Midwest Book Review.  "David God's Chosen Crucible is intelligently plotted, well-researched, and expertly executed. The writing by Joseph Ganci is wonderful, and the author has the gift of filling the narrative with exciting details, describing a setting that is colorful and transports readers to biblical times." - Christian Sia for Readers' Favorite.  "Joseph delivers an extremely believable story that fills the gaps smoothly and neatly packs various events into an intense, multiple-viewpoint narrative. The book also contains several lessons and messages to help believers grow in faith and knowledge about God's ways." Foluso Falaye - San Francisco book review.  All of the books are available on Amazon in e-book and paperback versions. Audio versions of Gideon and David God's Chosen Crucible are currently available.  Ganci takes a ground-breaking and revelatory path in his quest to bring awe-inspiring stories to life and, ultimately, to film. He believes that connecting facts is far more enchanting than loosely fitting fantasies. He works within an engaging and dramatized fiction framework that remains faithful to uphold spiritual principles while exceedingly rich in detail.  Ganci bases his work on three primary pillars:  The rock-solid cornerstone is historical biblical geography.  The creative arch is revelatory in its timing and issues.  The research is concrete and firmly rooted in customs, languages, and traditions.  Ganci fills in the blanks with rock-solid research and prophetic revelations. It is a style that has allowed him to create breakthrough approaches that are exciting and breathtaking while remaining within the limits of sound biblical teachings.  Ganci is also the creator of 'Incredible Bible Mysteries,' a five-part video series now available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK0Op2dYhMXtz7nh2D__keQ.  Ganci believes that Old Testament revelations are the Word of God. Simultaneously, many needful details remained buried until the information age of discovery made them prominent and visible to the naked eye. These insights create a middle ground of understanding. As a dedicated and highly motivated researcher, he proposes many undiscovered nuggets of spiritual gold in the original manuscripts. He shines a new light on ancient texts and removes the black-or-white argument of the all-or-nothing question of modern-day revelations. He is adept at untangling philosophical and theological human-made knots. He allows us to look at what some consider foregone conclusions.  Readers of his bestseller, 'Gideon: The Sound and the Glory,' will learn about the Jewish Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant, the mysterious Golden Ephod, why David found himself at battle with Goliath, and much much more. This work illuminates the dark corners of scripture while engaging readers in a gripping narrative.  Joseph Ganci was honored as one of the '50 Great Writers You Should Be Reading in the 2017 Book Awards. 'Gideon: The Sound and the Glory' has received rave reviews from readers and reviewers alike.
