# BT Partners Achieves Global Recognition as SYSPRO's Top Partner

CHICAGO, IL, May 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BT Partners is proud to announce they have been recognized by SYSPRO as the Top Global Sales Partner in the 2023 Global SYSPRO PartnerUP Awards. This latest achievement demonstrates BT Partners' unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation.   While this is a sales award, the BT Partners team is quick to highlight that they adopt a different strategy by prioritizing a consultative approach in their sales process. Todd Perlman, President of BT Partners, explains, "We bring our delivery team in from the very beginning, so we don't have that traditional sales-to-service handoff that often leads to miscommunications and complications during and after the implementation."   Michael Bennett, Global Channel Executive, SYSPRO Central warmly shared "BT Partners' exceptional performance, dedication, and outstanding achievements have truly set a benchmark for excellence within our partner community. We applaud their remarkable success. Doubling of revenue year over year and a remarkable 29% YoY Account Management Revenue growth solidifies their position as the #1 top-selling partner for 2023 globally. They're hard work, commitment, and innovative spirit continue to inspire us all."  The Account Management Revenue noted is for add-on solutions and upgrades for existing clients and its significant portion of overall sales is illustrative of the consultative approach that BT Partners exemplifies. Unlike some VAR partners, the BT Partners team avoids selling as much as possible upfront and instead focuses first on understanding the client's current needs. Then while continuing to be a strategic ERP partner and advisor, they help clients add on additional technology and functionality gradually when it's needed, so that it aligns with the clients' changes and growth at their own pace.   Perlman continues, "We're thrilled to receive this recognition, which highlights how dedicated our team is to helping our SYSPRO manufacturing and distribution clients. We're focused on finding ways to continuously optimize business processes and technology to make our clients' businesses run smoother and more efficiently. It's all about helping them thrive."
