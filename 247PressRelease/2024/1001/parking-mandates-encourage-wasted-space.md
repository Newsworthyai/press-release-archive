# Parking Mandates Encourage Wasted Space

HALTOM CITY, TX, October 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When a significant number of businesses close in a defined area of a city, it behooves leadership to adopt strategies which actively encourage redevelopment in that area. Without action, an ongoing spiral of decline will likely occur.  Such is the case in the south and central areas of Haltom City. The number of vacant and boarded up commercial properties has continued to rise, while city leadership has done nothing to encourage investment. "In fact, current codes and policies discourage investment along the older corridors of the city," said Joe Palmer, Communications Director for the Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA), "and one of the more obvious deterrents is the issue of parking minimums."  The elimination of parking minimums is currently a hot topic, and the American non-profit Strong Towns has a lot to say on the issue. Strong Towns helps citizens advocate for cities that are safe, livable, and inviting through their written materials, classes, podcasts, videos, and much more. Their e-book, Stuck in Park: How Mandatory Parking Minimums Hurt American Cities, is just one resource of many that explore the downsides of imposed parking minimums and the benefits of eliminating them.  In a section entitled "Mapping the Effects of Parking Minimums," the author focuses on the cost of too much parking. "What makes surface parking so destructive it that it consumes a finite resource (land) with virtually no direct financial benefit." Since cities rely on tax revenues, and parking areas generate far less income than buildings, homes and businesses, "Tax revenue is but one of many resources squandered by each acre of land devoted to deactivated cars."  Obviously, parking is important to any business that relies on customer traffic. But there are many businesses that need far less parking than required by the obsolete codes. If Haltom City eliminates parking mandates along the south and central corridors of the city, potential business owners would be allowed to determine the amount of parking needed for their business's successâ€¦ and as such, would be much more likely to invest.  "If we want to get those buildings occupied, we need policies that encourage new businesses," said Palmer. "Encouraging small businesses start-ups will not only help revitalize those neighborhoods, but will create a stronger tax base and enhance quality of life for citizens who live and work in those areas." He adds, "Haltom City needs a better value proposition than surrounding cities to attract businesses. They are starting from behind, with corridors that don't inspire investment."  About Haltom United Business Alliance Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) wants to give members of Haltom City's business community an advocate and to keep those businesses informed about issues that affect them. They want to make sure Haltom City is business friendly and nurtures small business growth, including automotive businesses in the industrial districts, and bring more restaurants including breweries and eventually a major grocery store to the city. New businesses and growth in existing businesses will create a stronger tax base which will allow the city to pay its first responders wages that are competitive with surrounding cities while improving Haltom City's facilities and infrastructure. HUBA believes that the southern and central parts of the city need a revitalization plan, to prevent further degradation in those areas, and wants that to happen before the inner-city experiences increased crime and more blight. As retail and office uses are in decline, it's more critical than ever to attract new businesses. They believe that such a plan requires a strong relationship and support of the business community. Anyone who owns a business in Haltom City is eligible to join HUBA. Dues are $20 annually or $50 for a lifetime membership, and membership is 100% confidential.
