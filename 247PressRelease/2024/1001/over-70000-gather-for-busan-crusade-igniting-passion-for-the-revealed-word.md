# Over 70,000 gather for Busan Crusade, igniting passion for the Revealed Word

PERTH, AUSTRALIA, October 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a remarkable display of faith and community, over 70,000 people gathered for the Busan Crusade of the Word, igniting a powerful atmosphere that stirred hearts and transformed minds! A participating pastor shared, "What I experienced was profound—I want to convey this emotion to my fellow pastors without delay." Chairman Lee passionately declared, "Let all churches unite through the word of revelation." Another pastor echoed this sentiment, stating, "Hearing the revelation in person has ignited my desire to learn even more."  The atmosphere was electric, with a vibrant parade featuring a pungmul (traditional Korean performing art) band, a military band, and a lively band truck captivating the citizens of Busan. The 2024 Shincheonji Word Crusade – Real Evidence of Revelation's Fulfilment took place in Masan on the 25th and then swept into Busan on the 29th, proving once again the enthusiasm for the revealed Word. This extraordinary event, held at the Andre Training Center, was organised by the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (Chairman Man-hee Lee) in response to the heartfelt requests of pastors and believers in the Yeongnam region.  Since its founding in 1984, this national traveling crusade has consistently brought together believers from across the country. Chairman Lee Man-hee, serving as the lecturer, emphasized the significance of the Book of Revelation, stating, "Faith must align with the Bible. We must grasp the true meaning of the Word and embody it in our lives."  Chairman Lee further stated, "The solid foundation for verifying these words is 'reality.' We must examine each prophecy for its fulfilment. When the time comes, the truths of the Book of Revelation will surely manifest." He urged pastors, "If you wish to understand the words of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, I will share them with you monthly. We are united in God and the Bible, and we must strengthen this unity."  Pastor Hwang from an independent denomination remarked, "Currently, 70% of churches in Korea lack Sunday schools. For the Korean church to flourish, the truth of God's Word must come alive." He noted, "The Shincheonji Church of Jesus exhibits remarkable growth amid a declining Protestant world, offering hope through the revealed words."  Pastor Choi from the Presbyterian Church shared, "Chairman Lee's insights made me realise how challenging the prophetic book can be—it shifted my understanding from question marks to exclamation points! I'm eager to learn more, and I hope other pastors can experience this revival of passion as well."  Testimonies poured in from attendees, with many expressing their desire to share the emotional impact of the event with fellow pastors, each feeling profoundly moved by the sermons. An official from Shincheonji Church of Jesus stated, "This Crusade of the Word has fostered an invaluable space for connection among pastors. When we communicate and unite based on biblical teachings, it positively impacts both civil society and religious harmony."  As of last month, 727 domestic churches have signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Shincheonji Church of Jesus, and internationally, 13,053 churches across 84 countries have joined in this mission. A total of 1,671 churches in 43 countries have changed their signs to align with Shincheonji.  Promotional activities across Busan and beyond significantly contributed to the excitement surrounding this event, which drew over 70,000 attendees. The day featured a spectacular parade, drawing in locals and igniting their interest in the Crusade. Additionally, like the Masan Crusade, Shincheonji Church of Jesus offered live broadcasts on YouTube, allowing those unable to attend to witness the revelations, which garnered over 73,300 views!  A local citizen remarked, "It's incredible to see so many people come together in unity. The atmosphere is bright and orderly, and I was impressed by how well they managed everything, even the garbage disposal!"
