# Akasha's Crown Therapy Hair Salon Opens at Salon & Spa Galleria

FORT WORTH, TX, October 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Whether she is doing cuts, colors, braids, weaves, updos, natural hair or any other salon services traditionally offered, Montina McMorris brings a great deal of passion to her work. With the opening of her new salon, Akasha's Crown Therapy, Montina is pleased to be able to provide those services to each client served in her own private and luxurious salon suite.  Montina began to learn braiding and twisting techniques when she was only twelve years old. After high school, she attended the Salon 496 Barber College and became a Master Barber in South Carolina, then later moved to Texas and reciprocated her license here as well. Today, with extensive education and 15+ years of experience under her belt, Montina has a wealth of experience and a great deal of knowledge about all things hair.   Knowing the importance of hair health and the role it plays in a person's wellbeing ("your hair is your crowning glory"), Montina is holistically focused on achieving the healthiest hair possible for each of the clients she serves. She uses top quality products and has her own line of all natural hair oils and creams available in her salon as well. She has been known to refer clients to their physicians for bloodwork when certain hair or scalp issues have been observed, and she offers spiritual/energetic hair ceremonies for both men and women. "Consider it something like hair baptism. You can see a clip of this on my Instagram page. The overall goal is to release any low vibrational energies that are causing blockages in your crown chakra that are preventing your hair from looking its very best."  Akasha' Crown Therapy is located in Suite #111 of the Bridgewood Salon & Spa Galleria at 1200 Bridgewood Drive in Fort Worth, Texas. Appointments can made on-line via her booking website or Instagram page, or by calling/texting (706) 351-5094.

Clients with a 3.0 or better GPA will receive $50 off any braiding or high-end service (over $100) and those who have a 4.0 GPA or better will receive $75 off any braiding or high-end service (over $100).
