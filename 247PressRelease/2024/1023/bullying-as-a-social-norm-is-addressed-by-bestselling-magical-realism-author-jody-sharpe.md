# Bullying As A Social Norm Is Addressed By Bestselling Magical Realism Author Jody Sharpe

WILMINGTON, NC, October 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Unfortunately there are forms of bullying that often go unnoticed, flying beneath the radar, yet have profound and lasting impacts. One such covert form of bullying is the targeting of legal immigrants. This behavior is becoming normalized in our society, and it's possible that, without realizing it, some of us are inadvertently passing these harmful attitudes on to our children, as they watch what we do and then copy it.  Bestselling author Jody Sharpe believes we should take a moment to recognize and challenge this form of bullying, ensuring a more inclusive and respectful environment for all. She recently addressed this issue in a piece on her site titled, "Bullying Legal Immigrants Is The Opposite Of Kindness". In that post she said in part:  In the news, the political bullies are spreading falsehoods about legal immigrants. All of us, unless we are of Native American descent, come from people who made many sacrifices to get to our democracy in the United States of America.  Bullying everywhere across the world should stop. I remember when my late daughter, Kate, as a six- year- old, brought home a friend from school. I spoke to the mother on the phone and Kate never mentioned the girl had a different skin color or was from a different country. Children are born with goodness in their hearts. However, many adults in our beautiful world are teaching bullying by their words and actions. How unfortunate to lie to our children about people from other ethnicities or countries.  The full text of the piece is available at http://jodysharpe.com/tuesdays-with-the-angels-bullying-legal-immigrants-is-the-opposite-of-kindness/.  Sharpe recently received an honorable mention in the 2024 National Federation of Press Women's Professional Communication contest at the national level for one of her novels, 'Summer of Angels'. This is the fourth NFPW win for her. In 2023, '20 Moon Road, An Angel's Tale' took First Place nationally in the novella category. 'Town Of Angels Christmas' placed At Large, as did 'Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder'.  She was also featured in the September issue of 'Great Writers You Should Be Reading Magazine.'  Books by Jody Sharpe include:  To Catch an Angel - Jody is also the author of 'To Catch an Angel', written in memory of her late husband Steve. In 'To Catch an Angel', miracles happen in Mystic Bay, California, the town with the psychic and angel vibe. Angels are calling. Psychic Maggie Malone returns home to find she's swept up in the miracle of it all. She can't imagine why her mother left or who her father might be. But these questions pale in comparison to the wonder of the angels. Maggie meets writer, Noah Greenstreet. They realize they've met before, but where? Maggie and Noah embark on a journey to find our world is all awash with angels.  The Angel's Daughter - A secret lies in Mystic Bay, California, and only two people know it. First, there's Hannah, a tender curly-headed half-angel. Then there's her father, Gabe, an effervescent, teddy bear of a full-blooded angel. And it's up to Hannah to keep the secret safe, but she's made a colossal mistake telling her ex-boyfriend and writing professor, Sam Blakely. Now he's written a book exposing the secret to the world.  Town Of Angels - Angel vs. Bully in the town of Mystic Bay, California, where a well-kept secret lies. Angels live as humans there. After angels appeared to three children, all was blissful in the town full of psychics, and ordinary folk. But as brute, Klaus Waxman, comes to town, angel Ken Leighton, a storeowner, must carefully guide his flock of humans not to give in to the bully's efforts.As Klaus opens a store mocking the resident angel sightings, angel Ken guides psychic Justine Greer, and her family to thwart his efforts. And with the help of the indomitable oldest psychic in town, Madam Norma, the bully meets his match through the soft voices and intuitive minds of his neighbors.  Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  One of her latest books, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California. While sleeping, an angel sent her a vision in a dream of a future event. Gayle realizes she must use her intuition to save an old man from drowning. But who is this old man?  With the help of intuitive attorney, Alex Knight, she finds they are caught in the middle of a future crime. But can Gayle and Alex solve the case and save the old man before it's too late? With surprising twists and turns of intrigue and love, Gayle and Alex find there are angels at the helm as they help prove the bully never wins.  'The Dog Who Came For Christmas' again features meteorologist and psychic Gayle Force Knight, who proves to be a force to be reckoned with once more. While Gayle was sleeping, an angel sent her a vision of a future event. With her intuition, Gayle wonders, will she really meet the dog in her dream and save another one?  With the help of her intuitive husband, Alex Knight, and friends, Gayle sets on a course to rescue many more. But with surprising twists and turns of intrigue, both Gayle and Alex find there are always angels at the helm as they ride on their coattails.  In addition, on the "Tuesdays With The Angels" section of her site, Sharpe presents stories of real-life encounters with angels. The stories are available at Sharpe's website at http://www.jodysharpe.com.
