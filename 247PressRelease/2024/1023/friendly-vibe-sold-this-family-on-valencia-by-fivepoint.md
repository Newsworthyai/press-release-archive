# Friendly Vibe Sold This Family On Valencia By FivePoint

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, October 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When the house hunting began, her pre-school daughter was priority #1 for Ilisa, and Valencia by FivePoint was clearly the best location when the family purchased a new home here. Ilisa and her husband RJ are both employed in the entertainment business and had lived in North Hollywood before coming to Valencia.   When they became new parents, they started looking for a family-focused location. "I wanted to live in a community that is good for kids," said Ilisa simply.   The search included various points throughout Los Angeles, but nothing felt right, Ilisa said. "I took a drive out a little further because I had heard so many wonderful things about the Santa Clarita Valley."  Valencia's scenic location, ambience and convenience ticked off all the major points and after one visit, Ilisa persuaded her husband to come take a look. "Once he saw Valencia, he fell in love," she said. "We both felt immediate gratitude at finding a place where we felt we could breathe."   A brand-new home—The family moved in mid-2022 and are very satisfied with their choice. "I think our builders were top notch, and aesthetically made these homes with a lot of love and thought," Ilisa said. "Their floorplans were my favorites, and the attention to detail really stood out."  Quality schools were also a big plus for these parents, whose daughter is still a toddler. "She won't be in school for a few years, but knowing that good schools are nearby was important to both of us," said Ilisa.  A community to love—Getting to know their new surroundings was a pleasure, with Confluence Park a core amenity. Here were places to play—open lawn areas, an adventure playground and an array of pools. The park's clubhouse features indoor/outdoor seating and dining spaces. The community garden further enriches the park's environment.  Confluence Park is thus an important anchor for "out and about" times, and the family spends a lot of leisure time here. The family loves the park's open spaces, playgrounds, pools and pathways, clubhouse and the many pleasing views. "We can also see sunrises and sunsets from our new home, and that is truly wonderful," said Ilisa.   Special events add to the pleasures of living here, with the new Farmers Market a recent example. "The market opening was amazing!" said Ilisa. "I was so happy to see so many awesome vendors and having the ability to connect with neighbors and local businesses was truly special—we plan to come every Sunday. This is the perfect add-on to our community!"  Such happy gatherings further enrich everyday living, and Ilisa commented on the all-around good feeling here. "This entire community is clean and well kept, and that definitely is key to enjoying your immediate surroundings and the whole neighborhood network," Ilisa noted.   "The feeling of safety was a big factor for us," she added. "If I wanted to walk outside at 2 a.m., I would feel comfortable, and we are enjoying this feeling immensely."
