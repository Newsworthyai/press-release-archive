# Sickle Cell Community Consortium and Cleverly Changing Announce Virtual Fourth Annual Sickle Cell Caregiver Summit

ATLANTA, GA, November 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Sickle Cell Community Consortium, in collaboration with Cleverly Changing, LLC, proudly announces the Fourth Annual Sickle Cell Caregiver Summit, an entirely virtual conference designed to uplift, educate, and connect caregivers within the global sickle cell community. The summit will take place from November 15 to November 17, 2024, with an early check-in and welcome on Friday, November 15, 2024. Sessions will start daily at 7 AM PST / 10 AM EST.  This year's summit theme, "Empowering Caregivers: Building Community through Advocacy, Collaboration, and Self-Care," reflects the Consortium's commitment to creating an inclusive, supportive space for sickle cell caregivers—parents, grandparents, siblings, guardians, friends, and care professionals—who share the unique experience of supporting loved ones living with sickle cell disease. Attendees will have access to impactful educational sessions, interactive family and trivia games, and invaluable networking opportunities, all crafted by caregivers for caregivers.  "The journey of a sickle cell caregiver is demanding. Events like these provide a lifeline, proving that families don't have to face the challenges alone," says Elle Cole, mother of a 16-year-old Sickle Cell Warrior. "Caregivers must become experts in their loved one's care, despite not holding a medical degree, and this event underscores that journey with mutual support."  Sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Title Sponsor) and Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (Platinum), with support from Bluebird Bio and many others, the Summit will deliver a series of dynamic sessions led by experts in the sickle cell field and community advocates. Each day is packed with education, engagement, and fun.
