# Adventures in Avalon: An Offbeat & Quirky Adult Bedtime Story Comedy Ebook Featuring Cartoon Characters, Will Be Available At No Charge November 13 Through November 15, 2024 At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, November 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bijou Entertainment has announced that their delightful, laugh out loud absurdist fiction novel, 'Adventures in Avalon: An Offbeat & Quirky Adult Bedtime Story' will be available at no charge in ebook form November 13 through November 15, 2024 at Amazon.  Intrepid ace reporter Ginger Marin discovers a lost civilization of cartoon people living in Middle America, in a town called Avalon in the County of Ligature-Upon-Avon â€¦ one of those quaint little communities that is somewhat lost in American space, neither here nor there but definitely somewhere. Her dispatches from the front lines will thrill and excite you as she describes all the crazy things cartoon people do when they think no one's watching.  You'll read the fascinating, slightly raunchy, true tales of the Avalon Defense Department (a.k.a. police department) where rock star police detective General Schnitzkof, a former British officer, and his trusted assistant, rookie cop WingWing, a rotund little dumpling of a "lad", solve some of the town's most absurd crimes such as these: "The Case of the Missing Member or How John Sir Gwaine Bobolini Lost One of His Family Jewels and How He Recovered It ... Well Sort Of", "The Case of the Missing Haunted Mobile Home" and last, but certainly not least, "The Cream Puff Caper", where you'll meet some of Avalon's worst offenders like that creep Mr. Parabolikos and murderous old lady Wiggins.  If you like the charms and craziness of South Park, you're sure to enjoy the cartoon community of Avalon.  Readers and reviewers praise 'Adventures in Avalon: An Offbeat & Quirky Adult Bedtime Story'. A Readers Favorite reviewer said, "Very rarely do I find a book in the humor genre that actually makes me laugh; however, I am glad that I took a chance with this book because it made me laugh out loud and had not a dull moment. I would recommend Adventures in Avalon to readers who enjoy a good laugh and are ready to explore the weird imagination of the author."  An Amazon reviewer called it "a book to love and to appreciate over and over." Another said, "You may need to buy an adult diaper before reading this . . ."
