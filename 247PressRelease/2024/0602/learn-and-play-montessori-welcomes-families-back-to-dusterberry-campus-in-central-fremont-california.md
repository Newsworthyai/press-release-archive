It is a community dedicated to providing an exceptional early learning experience. The flexible schedule options cater to the needs of busy families, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive in our nurturing environment.

With spacious classrooms, inviting play areas, and modern facilities, the campus provides the perfect backdrop for exploration and discovery.  A CURRICULUM LIKE NO OTHER  The uniqueness of the teaching methodology is the combination of Montessori (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/montessori-method/) and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) allowing children to engage in hands-on learning experiences that develop critical thinking skills and a love for learning. As a nod to Fremont's history, Dusterberry Campus embraces the legacy of Frederick Dusterberry, a trustee of the Washington Union High School District (and now the Washington High School at https://fremontunified.org/washington/), by providing high-quality education and fostering a sense of community.  Enrollments are now open year-round, with convenient monthly billing to make managing payments a breeze for parents.
