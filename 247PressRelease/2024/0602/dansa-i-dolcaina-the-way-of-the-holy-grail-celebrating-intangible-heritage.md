VALENCIA, SPAIN, June 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Saturday, June 1st, at 10:00 AM, an extraordinary cultural event, 'Dansa i Dolçaina the Way of the Holy Grail', was held at the Plaza del Ayuntamiento de Emperador in Valencia, Spain. Dozens of local residents have been able to attend an event full of colour, tradition, and dance and Valencian music.

Dr. Ana Mafé García explained that she "would love to be able to take this event to all the regions that make up 'The Way of the Holy Grail' as a European Cultural Itinerary."  'Dansa i Dolçaina The Way of the Holy Grail' is a celebration that combines dance, voice, light, and music in a cultural journey via the legacy of 'The Way of the Holy Grail'. This unique event seeks to highlight the importance of the Mediterranean's intangible heritage and its influence on European traditions.  It is presented as a reenactment where a pilgrim arrives in a town along The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, and path of Peace. In its square, they discover people doing tasks from the past, and dances and music are organized around them, in terms of the context of their aforementioned tasks.  Valencian dance and its music are just part of the attractions that Valencia has in each one of its festivals. Whoever takes 'The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, path of Peace' through Valencian lands will surely be able to experience this unique folklore, which in turn is common throughout the Mediterranean arch where the Crown of Aragon was present.  Participants The event was attended by the prestigious 'Grup de Danses Santa Barbara', directed by Miriam Ortiz, who, through their performances, took the attendees on a journey through the traditional dances and melodies of the region.
