Aaron finds himself torn between his allegiance to his country and his personal belief system. Remarkably, just hours before deployment, a shocking revelation rocks his world: he discovers his Jewish heritage, shattering his sense of identity to its core.  Despite his sense of dread, Aaron forges ahead, driven by a profound sense of duty and patriotism. But now he finds he must battle on two fronts - the enemy forces without, sworn to wipe the Jewish race from the face of the earth, and the ethical dilemma within himself.
