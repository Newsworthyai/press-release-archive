MORTON GROVE, IL, December 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dental emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere and require immediate action. At ProCare Family Dental, we understand that tooth pain and other dental issues can be distressing and pose a threat to your overall health.   What is a Dental Emergency? A dental emergency is any situation that poses an immediate threat to the health of your teeth and supporting tissues. These emergencies can result from trauma, infection, or other dental issues. To ensure the best outcome, it's crucial to have any dental emergency evaluated by a professional as soon as possible.  What to Do if a Tooth is Knocked Out For permanent teeth: Rinse the tooth gently and try to place it back in its socket. If that isn't possible, keep it moist by placing it in a container of milk, water, or saliva. Avoid touching the roots; handle the tooth by the crown, and do not brush it. Contact us immediately (847) 965-6223 for guidance and treatment—time is crucial in saving your tooth. For baby teeth that are knocked out, leave them out and contact us for further instructions.  Types of Dental Emergencies We Treat:  1. Substantial toothache 2. Significant sensitivity 3. Swollen or sore gums 4. Jaw pain 5. Tooth infections (Emergency Root Canals) 6. Broken, cracked, or chipped teeth 7. Broken fillings 8. Lost or loose crowns 9. Sports-related dental injuries 10.
