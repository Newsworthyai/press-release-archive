Ocurate's ML for real-time LTV enables applying per-customer revenue predictions for ad bidding, transforming digital advertising by increasing ROAS by 15% and more.  This sophisticated framework utilizes a combination of the most granular, real-time event stream data capturing all minute customer interactions with the brands' websites, and advanced neural networks to dynamically predict customer value. The result is unprecedented precision and Machine Learning accuracy.  "Our team of skilled data scientists has been continuously advancing machine learning for individual-level LTV predictions, delivering value to our clients. By employing neural networks structured in innovative ways and processing the most predictive, granular type of high-dimensional event stream data, we've significantly enhanced model performance and set new industry standards.," said Giovanna Fernandes, Head of Ocurate ML.
