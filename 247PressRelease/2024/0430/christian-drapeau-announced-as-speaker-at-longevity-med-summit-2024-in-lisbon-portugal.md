# CHRISTIAN DRAPEAU Announced as Speaker at Longevity Med Summit 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal

AUSTIN, TX, April 30, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christian Drapeau will be sharing the latest in stem cell science and his research on the body's innate repair system at Longevity Med Summit (LMS), an annual meeting where Longevity Clinics and Physicians, Pharmacists and Investors come together to meet the latest innovations for applications in clinical practice. LMS 2024 brings together the world's most prominent clinics to spearhead the cutting-edge trends and scientific knowledge in the field of healthspan extension.   Author of "Cracking the Stem Cell Code", Christian Drapeau, will be lecturing on one of the most powerful indicators of health and longevity: the body's innate repair system. Having spent the last 20 years researching regenerative health optimization, Drapeau has identified natural plants and bioactives that act as stem cell mobilizers, providing natural stem cell support as an alternative to more expensive treatments.   Drapeau shares that he's "looking forward to sharing the latest knowledge about Endogenous Stem Cell Mobilization at this year's Summit. True longevity lies in the balance between cellular loss and renewal… we can leverage the body's innate repair system to literally rejuvenate organs and tissues and increase health and quality of life as we age."   Christian Drapeau, MSc is a stem cell scientist that has developed a patent-pending blend of proprietary plant-based extracts documented to increase the number of circulating stem cells by stimulating Endogenous Stem Cell Mobilization (ESCM). These ingredients have been investigated in numerous studies for their effect on stem cell function, of which five were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical trials. This product has wide application in antiaging and overall health optimization.
