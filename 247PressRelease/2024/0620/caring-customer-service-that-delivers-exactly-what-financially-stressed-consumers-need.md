# Caring Customer Service That Delivers Exactly What Financially Stressed Consumers Need

DES PLAINES, IL, June 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Some customers are in a totally emotional state when they call or come into one of our stores," says AmeriCash Loans Lending Services Representative Bethany Tucker. "They're in the middle of a crisis, and they don't know where else to go to get money to pay an overdue utility bill or to buy gifts for their child's birthday.  "That's when empathy and understanding are most important," she continues. "When someone's so agitated and upset, I listen carefully to them and try to get them to see that I'm here to help them."  AmeriCash Loans offers installment loans up to $2,500—backed by caring, sympathetic customer service—to consumers in Missouri, South Carolina and Wisconsin.  Finding the right solution for each customer's challenges  "I start by asking questions, to find out what exactly the customer's needs are," says Bethany. "As I take a customer through the opening conversation, I can hear them slowly calming down as they talk it out.   "I assure them that they've come to the right place, and that together we can find the solution to their problem," she continues. "I help the customer figure out a game plan: how much money they need, and how much they can afford to pay each month.   "By the conclusion of the call," Bethany adds, "we've found an affordable solution to their immediate financial emergency. They're usually very happy and grateful, and I can hear the relief in their voice.  "One time, a single mom and her child came into the location where I was working," Bethany recounts. "She needed money before the end of that day, or their water was going to be cut off.   "We were able to get her loan processed and approved, and she was out the door that same day with the check in hand, so she was able to pay that bill," Bethany continues. "She was in tears by the time she left the store. We help customers in these kinds of situations time and again."
