Joan did her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley and her graduate work at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, CA. In 1985, while working for the LA Times and living in Rome, she met her husband-to-be Oleg Vidov, who had just dramatically defected to the west, a few months later, the new couple moved to Los Angeles. Joan began a new chapter of her career working as a film industry executive. In 1992, Films by Jove, the film production and distribution company she and Oleg founded, acquired the international rights to an award-winning Russian animation library. They partnered with Mikhail Baryshnikov, who invited 36 leading actors to re-voice the stunningly beautiful animation, and subsequently released the films around the world. This instantly popularized Russian animation which had previously been seen primarily at a few film festivals. But, in 2007, the Russian State intervened and under the direction of the Kremlin, a Russian Oligarch bought back the rights to the Russian animation film library and all the rights and all the masters Oleg and Joan had worked so hard to restore, were gifted to a state-owned television station.
