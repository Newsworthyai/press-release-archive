# Shincheonji Church of Jesus Hosts Successful Bible Seminar on Revelation's Fulfillment

NEW YORK, NY, November 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On November 23rd, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony hosted a successful Bible seminar at its Peace Training Center in Cheongpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The seminar titled, "Testimony on the Fulfilled Realities of Revelation" drew about 200 pastors from various church denominations.  Shincheonji Chairman Lee Man-hee delivered the sermon. In his lecture, he shocked and surprised the attendees by explaining, one by one, the tangible evidence of how each verse of the Book of Revelation had fulfilled.  "For 2,000 years, no one has testified to the reality of the Book of Revelation. This is because only those who have seen and heard can testify," Chairman Lee said. "The Book of Revelation has been fulfilled today, and Jesus has chosen an advocate to deliver the words. I am testifying to these words according to Jesus' instructions."  Pastors who attended the event unanimously agreed with the message of 93-year-old Chairman Lee and felt that his words resonated greatly with them.  A Presbyterian pastor who attended the Bible seminar said, "The more I come to hear Chairman Lee's words, the more moved and inspired I become. And as a pastor, I have many conscientious thoughts like, 'Shouldn't I come here and listen to the Chairman's words even more in order to have some qualities as a pastor?'"   Another Presbyterian pastor said, "I think all of these words of Chairman Lee, which make us face the reality of the religious world, will first eliminate conflicts among pastors, clergy, and other religious people. In some ways, this is something that is really needed in the Republic of Korea."  Shincheonji Church, with its Bible seminars offering a vivid explanation of the fulfillment of Revelation, will undoubtedly challenge the Korean religious community to reflect on the way in which they understand the Bible and carry out their faith lives.  A pastor who had a hard time interpreting the Book of Revelation said, "I used to interpret the Book of Revelation abstractly, but today I saw the reality of the prophecy and its fulfillment for the first time." The pastor emphasized, "This teaching is something that the Korean church community must pay attention to."
