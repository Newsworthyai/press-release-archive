# DR. ANA MAFÉ RECEIVES RECOGNITION FOR SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRATING THE AUTHENTICITY OF VALENCIA'S HOLY CHALICE AS THE AUTHENTIC HOLY GRAIL

VALENCIA, SPAIN, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This recognition, promoted by 'Laboratorios Viñas', highlights the rigour with which Dr. Mafé has demonstrated that the Chalice meets the art historical standards to be considered the legendary 'Holy Grail', one of the most fascinating objects in world history.  The event was presided over by Mr. Mariano Viñas, CEO and Vice President of 'Laboratorios Viñas', who took the opportunity to pay tribute to his family's strong ties with the city of Valencia. In his speech, Mr. Viñas remembered the relationships forged by his ancestors, especially recalling his grandfather, the renowned tenor Francesc Viñas (affectionately known as "Paco" Viñas). For over twenty-five years, he frequently performed at Valencia's Teatro Principal and maintained close friendships with significant Valencian cultural figures like Teodoro Llorente, Vicent Blasco Ibáñez, and Mariano Benlliure. A distinguished sculptor, Benlliure created the Viñas family's beautiful mausoleum which can be admired at the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.  Descendants and relatives of these celebrated figures also attended the event, all receiving homages for their role in preserving Valencia's cultural heritage. Among the guests were Lucrecia Enseñat, great-granddaughter of Benlliure; Rosa Muñoz, great-great-granddaughter of Blasco Ibáñez; Pilar and Elena Corbín, great-great-granddaughters of Llorente; and Miquel Lerin, great-grandson of the tenor Viñas. Additionally, Mariano Buxadé, representative of Laboratorios Viñas and grandson of its founder, expressed his gratitude to speaker and 'positive psychology' expert Víctor Küppers and to researchers who have dedicated their work to studying the era and its notable figures.  Laboratorios Viñas and its Legacy in Valencia Founded in 1911 in Barcelona by Pere Viñas Dordal, brother of the esteemed tenor Francesc Viñas, Laboratorios Viñas has maintained strong ties with Valencia thanks to Paco Viñas's affection and admiration for the city. Celebrated for his interpretation of Lohengrin, the lead role in Wagner's renowned opera, Viñas became the favored tenor among Valencians, and his legacy endures in Valencia to this day. Through this convention and the presence of the families and heirs of great Valencian cultural figures, 'Laboratorios Viñas' underscores the importance of keeping this intergenerational connection alive and enriching shared cultural heritage too.  Dr. Ana Mafé's Role in Reaffirming the Holy Chalice Dr. Ana Mafé, an esteemed expert on the history of the Holy Chalice, has dedicated years of scientific research to verify, using scientific methods, that Valencia's Chalice possesses the characteristics that establish it as the authentic Holy Grail. Dr. Mafé joins a long tradition of scholars and artists, such as Francesc Viñas himself, who in his 1934 book 'Legends of the Holy Grail and Parsifal', asserted that the Valencian chalice was the "true and only" cup that inspired the works of renowned German composer Richard Wagner.  Throughout this ceremony, Laboratorios Viñas reinforced its commitment to culture, science, and artistic heritage, expressing deep appreciation to all who contributed to preserving Valencian history and identity, and especially recognizing Dr. Ana Mafé for her research on the Holy Chalice.
