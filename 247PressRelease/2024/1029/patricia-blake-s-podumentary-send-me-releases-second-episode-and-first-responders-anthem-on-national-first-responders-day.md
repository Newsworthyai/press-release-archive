# Patricia Blake's Podumentary "SEND ME!" Releases Second Episode and First Responders Anthem on National First Responders Day

YERINGTON, NV, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Patricia Blake's groundbreaking podumentary series, SEND ME!, returns with its highly anticipated second episode, launching on National First Responders Day. This new installment delivers a compelling and powerful narrative celebrating the dedication, heroism, and often-overlooked sacrifices of first responders. Expanding on the celebrated opening episode, which captivated audiences worldwide, Episode Two sets an ambitious new standard, intertwining the historical significance of first responders with a stark look at the nation's current struggles.  "We're honored to bring forward a story that champions our first responders in such a profound way. This episode reflects their timeless courage as well as the challenges they face today," said Patricia Blake, host and co-creator of SEND ME!.  As a special tribute, this episode also marks the debut of the "SEND ME! Theme Song," which Patty co-wrote with producer and media business icon, S.W. Miliano. This powerful track, which Blake describes as "the anthem I hope will resonate in every firehouse, precinct, and emergency room," blends Patty's stirring lyrics and a smoldering, anthemic country ballad soundscapeâ€”played by an all-star lineup of Nashville's finest session musicians. These artists bring a timeless resonance to the track, capturing the intense emotion and resolve that defines our nation's first responders.  The theme song is the first release from the SEND ME! Songbook, a larger album that will be rolled out one song at a time. Many of the upcoming tracks will be tied directly to future episodes of the SEND ME! series, further unifying the podumentary's narrative with the spirit of each song.  Producer S.W. Miliano adds, "This project is deeply personal to us; we wanted to capture the grit, heart, and unwavering spirit of first responders. We hope this song becomes an anthem, honoring not only their courage but the strength of the communities standing behind them."  Episode Two of SEND ME!, and its passionate theme song, are both streaming online now. Be sure to check out Patricia Blake's official and specialty websites for more information.
