# The Psychophysiologic Disorders Association Becomes Association for Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms

PORTLAND, OR, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Psychophysiologic Disorders Association (PPDA) is proud to announce its rebranding as the Association for Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms (ATNS) under the new brand and social banner of Symptomatic. This transformation comes with a renewed focus on staying at the forefront of scientific advancements in treating chronic pain and illness, offering an evidence-based approach to millions worldwide affected by neuroplastic symptoms. The organization's new website can be found at Symptomatic.Me.  Neuroplasticity — the brain's ability to adapt, change, and heal — lies at the heart of the group's mission. The mission remains educating practitioners and patients about neuroplastic symptoms, which are generated by the brain in response to past or present stress. These symptoms include chronic primary pain, migraines, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, post-viral syndromes, and many other conditions. The name change reflects the association's growth and commitment to empowering people to understand and overcome these symptoms with the newest science.   David D. Clarke, MD, President of ATNS, said, "Our mission has always been to ensure people receive the right kind of care. Too often, patients are treated for symptoms without considering the underlying neuroplastic causes — leading to ineffective outcomes. We are here to change that narrative. Everyone deserves the best care, focusing on healing rather than just living with symptoms. This rebranding makes our mission more widely approachable and understandable for both the public and practitioners, helping us bridge the gap between research results and effective clinical care."  An estimated 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain or illness that is not caused by disease or injury. Four out of ten people seen by physicians suffer from these neuroplastic conditions. What if their symptoms could be permanently relieved with the proper care? ATNS is the leader in sharing the new science for treating these conditions, because a life without pain and illness is possible.   Through its mission of sharing the new science of chronic pain and illness, ATNS goals include:  •	Educate the Public •	Advance Scientific Research •	Empower Practitioners •	Support Patients •	Collaborate Across Disciplines •	Advocate for Policy Change  Howard Schubiner, MD, ATNS board member and Clinical Professor at Michigan State University, stated, "The understanding of neuroplastic symptoms represents a significant leap in the medical community's approach to chronic pain. By recognizing that the brain can generate pain in response to stress rather than structural issues, we can provide more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments. This shift is not just about managing symptoms — it's about offering real, sustainable healing options to patients who have long struggled with unexplained pain or illness."  The launch marks an exciting opportunity to grow the robust community committed to sharing the latest science and education in treating chronic pain correctly.   Rebecca Kennedy, MD, board member and Family Medicine Physician, also expressed her excitement: "Our focus on neuroplastic symptoms brings hope for more effective, compassionate care for those who need it most. This new chapter is about growth, empowerment, and transformation — not just for our organization, but for the countless individuals we serve."  "We invite medical professionals, patients, researchers, the public, and advocates to join us in this journey as we continue transforming the understanding and treatment of neuroplastic symptoms," remarked Clarke.
