# Book 'Dead Air' Describes Sheer Terror on 86th Halloween Anniversary of War of the Worlds

CHICAGO, IL, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It is hard for the twentyfirst century mind to wrap itself around the notion that people believed martians had invaded and were incinerating and gassing humans across the country in 1938. But due to a war scare, a prolonged depression, the incredible growth of the new medium radio, Orson Wells managed to create a coast to coast panic that sent people screaming into churches, theatres and churches that the world had come to an end. The advent of the car radio and CBS affiliates took Welles broadcaset outs of the East Coast and sent it flying across the republic to create a the first viral moment of fake news. And this really was fake news.   William Hazelgroves "Dead Air The Night Orson Welles Terrified America' (Rowman and Littlefield) revisionist take on the broadcast is already garnering rave reviews from the Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, and a starred review from Booklist. It would seem during an election year where media is under a constant spotlight as to what is real and what is fake, Orson Welles grand hoax has a new relevancy. On a warm Halloween Eve, October 30, 1938, during a broadcast of H G. Wells' War of the Worlds, a twenty-three-year-old Orson Welles held his hands up for radio silence in the CBS studio in New York City while millions of people ran out into the night screaming, grabbed shotguns, drove off in cars, and hid in basements, attics, or anywhere they could find to get away from Martians intent on exterminating the human race. As Welles held up his hands to his fellow actors, musicians, and sound technicians, he turned six seconds of radio silence—dead air—into absolute horror, changing the way the world would view media forever, and making himself one of the most famous men in America.  William Hazelgrove's 'Dead Air' sheds new light on the eighty sixth anniversary of the broadcast with anecdotal tales of people running for their lives coast to coast. The maritains may not have landed but Welles proved that perceptiion was reality in 1938 and we are learning the same thing today.
