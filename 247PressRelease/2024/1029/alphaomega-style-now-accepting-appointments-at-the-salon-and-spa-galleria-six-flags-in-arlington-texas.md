Smith specializes in pixie cut weaves, crochet braid styles, protective styles, micro-link bead extensions, natural hair treatments, and natural hair styles for young girls.  With a focus on professionalism and a personal touch, Smith said she strives to make each and every client feel confident and beautiful.  "I've refined my craft and passion for creating personalized, polished looks," Smith said. Since relocating to Texas, Smith has continued to deliver exceptional styling services, including working with clients to train them how to maintain their hair at home.  Since she was a young teen, Smith was passionate about doing hair. Friends and family recognized her natural talent, encouraging her to enter the beauty industry. She listened, and in 2003, she took them seriously, enrolling at the Marinello School of Beauty. Smith said Celebrity Stylist Edward Morrison played an important role in her training, as she served as his celebrity stylist assistant while working on the hit series "Bernie Mac Show"  "I've been truly blessed by the opportunities and growth this industry has brought me," Smith said.  In 2022, good fortune landed in Smith's lap, as she had the incredible opportunity to participate in an international program. As part of the project, Smith traveled to West Africa to donate hair services to young girls in Liberia.  "Despite the challenges of COVID, it was deeply rewarding to see the joy and confidence it brought to these girls, especially during such uncertain times," Smith said.  Back home in Tarrant County, Smith has continued her community-minded work by offering free hair services to local seniors. Referring to her experiences as "heartwarming," Smith said she treasures her work both here and abroad.  "It's allowed me to give back to those who deserve extra care and attention," she said.
