# Astronomical Alignment Means Two Hearts Meet

WILMINGTON, NC, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Can two people as unalike as an artist and an astronomer create a harmonious romance? With one person living in his head and the other in her heart, where can they find agreement? It all comes down to alignment: a key concept in science, in art, and in life, according to best-selling author Mara Purl.  Whose Hearts Align is an engrossing tale with the most satisfying and romantic storyline of her saga so far. To celebrate autumn and the upcoming holidays, the novel makes its debut in print, and the Amazon Kindle E-book will be free for three days, October 31, November 1 and 2nd.  Award-winning author Mara Purl weaves compelling facts into her story. "This book is the penultimate of the saga," Purl explained. "Miranda Jones finally marries astronomer Cornelius Smith. But as they marry, emotions roil in Milford-Haven and in her own family. First, her sister has plunged into a serious relationship with Zack Calvin, whom her sister used to date. Shock, betrayal and judgment land on the celebrants from one side of the aisle, while support and encouragement flows from the other side.  As if this weren't enough of a complication, yet another wedding of an important character is happening on the other side of the country. "Sally O'Mally owns a popular restaurant on Main Street. The man she loved way back in highschool has reappeared, but Sally is pregnant by someone else, a man who left her. Meanwhile, back in the small town where she and Tony went to school, her mama has taken a fall. Sally and Tony go to Arkansas to care for her, but it turns out to be their only chance to marry before Sally's child is born.  Purl's latest opus is full of the entertaining twists and turns that've made her a best-selling author. "But what I love are the deeper moments of vulnerability," Mara confessed. "What makes a beautiful, accomplished woman doubt herself? Why does a successful man question his chances at real acceptance for who he is beyond the accolades? Are a person's chances at risk because of racism or disability? From my perspective every limitation can be overcome if we align with our core values. But that doesn't make it easy."  As always, Purl did exhaustive research as she prepared to write this fourth novel. "My studies revealed multiple uses and layers to the concept of alignment: scientific, emotional, psychological, societal, professional. These all brought a new level of awareness, but what brought the story alive was pairing these with lived experiences, my own as well as others'."  Whose Hearts Align is part of Purl's best-selling saga, Milford-Haven, which began as a hit BBC radio drama with 4.5 million listeners in the U.K., and became a multi-award winning book series with 17 million followers in the U.S. The saga is set in California's scenic Central Coast, where Purl regularly researches her stories and is a frequent speaker.  Trade Reviews: "Whose Hearts Align is another novel in the Milford-Haven series from esteemed writer Mara Purl. [This book] is a people story for those who love people stories – highly recommended." – Midwest Book Review  "First-time readers need not fear trying this, the fourth volume of author Purl's BBC Radio drama converted into a series of engaging novels. With plenty of cliffhangers and red herrings to woo them, readers will be captivated by this small-town tale that will leave them ready for more. And although there's a lot of backstory, as in all soap operas, readers will be drawn in and hooked by the ongoing saga.." – ForeWord Reviews  "Mara's Milford-Haven series goes deep into the life of artist Miranda Jones—her family, her agent, her friends and neighbors in San Francisco and the fictional town of Milford-Haven situated on the Central Coast of California. Intrigue, murder, and betrayal; musicians, murals, and shells; hummingbirds, whales, sea otters; … and an astronomer who shows Miranda how to reach for the stars in life and love." – Derra Moyers  "What a lovely escape I had reading Mara Purl's new book! As usual, I'm impressed by how she manages to so skillfully interweave all of the threads of her environmental concerns with spiritual insights while spinning this intricate tale. What I noticed most of all is the sophistication and depth of her thoughts about family, pregnancy, childhood and parenthood. But incorporating all of this so adroitly into the Milford-Haven saga is puzzle-creation of the highest order!
