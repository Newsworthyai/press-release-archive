# Burhani Engineers Instals Cutting-Edge ATG System to Modernise Fire Water Tank Management at Kurasini Terminal

DAR ES SALAAM, TARZANIA, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers Ltd has started on a transformative project at the Kurasini Terminal in Tanzania, aimed at revolutionising the management and monitoring of fire water tanks. The installation of a state-of-the-art Automatic Tank Gauging (ATG) system marks a major upgrade, replacing outdated manual processes with cutting-edge automation. This initiative is set to significantly enhance the operational efficiency and safety standards of the terminal.  The current method of manually checking tank levels is both time-consuming and prone to human error. Burhani Engineers' ATG system will automate this process, delivering precise, real-time data on tank levels without the need for constant human oversight. This automation not only reduces the need for frequent manual checks but also minimises errors. It will streamline operations and free up personnel for more critical tasks.  Precision and efficiency through automation  The core benefit of the new ATG system is its ability to provide continuous, real-time readings of fire water tank levels. Operators will have instant access to accurate data, allowing for informed decision-making and faster response times. This enhanced precision translates into a more reliable system, where tank levels are consistently monitored and maintained without the delays and inaccuracies often associated with manual methods.  By removing human intervention from much of the gauging process, Burhani Engineers is helping the Kurasini Terminal operate more efficiently. The automated system reduces the chance of miscalculations and human error, creating a seamless and reliable way to monitor tank levels, even in high-pressure situations.  Safety and reliability as key benefits  In addition to improving efficiency, the ATG system offers significant safety advantages. Continuous monitoring ensures that fire water tanks are always adequately filled and ready for use in emergencies. The risk of undetected water shortages, which could pose significant threats in the event of a fire, is dramatically reduced with this new system.  The installation of the ATG system also minimises the need for personnel to interact directly with the tanks for routine inspections, thereby reducing potential safety risks. By automating this essential process, the system enhances both the operational safety of the terminal and the well-being of its staff.  A new standard in fire water tank management  As a trustworthy engineering company in Kenya, Burhani Engineers is setting a new industry standard with the supply and installation of this advanced ATG system. This project not only modernises the way fire water tanks are managed but also aligns with global trends toward smarter, more efficient industrial practices. The upgrade represents a forward-thinking approach to tank management, combining the latest technology with practical, on-the-ground benefits.
