# Cardition: Far-Infrared Wave Vehicle Current Stabilizer, Launches on Indiegogo

ALBANY, NY, October 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- EROPGEHADA INC., a company dedicated to eco-energy and renewable energy research, is launching its innovative product, Cardition, on the global crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. This cutting-edge device stabilizes vehicle battery voltage and current.  Globally, fire incidents in both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles have become a significant safety concern. Among the various causes identified, EROPGEHADA INC. has focused on the growing complexity of electrical systems in modern vehicles, which rely solely on a single battery. The vehicle battery is charged only while driving, and discharges while idle, creating a cyclical drain on battery performance.  In response, EROPGEHADA INC. developed Cardition, which uses far-infrared waves to stabilize and optimize the current and voltage output of the vehicle's battery. This helps ensure that all onboard electronics operate safely and efficiently, enhancing overall vehicle performance, including the engine and transmission.  Cardition is a product that combines Illite, which has excellent conductivity and far-infrared emission, with a synthetic liquid developed in-house for 12 years. These waves influence the molecular structure of the battery's current, maintaining battery performance even while idle and delivering stable power output for optimal driving performance when the vehicle is in use.  Through internal testing, Cardition's far-infrared waves have been verified to emit continuously across various environmental conditions without any external power source. Additionally, Cardition has passed cesium, radon, radiation, and standard material certification tests, confirming that it is safe for human exposure.  In internal tests, attaching Cardition to a vehicle with a maximum output of 167.32 At increased output to 181.10 At. Test participants have also reported smoother driving and reduced noise, demonstrating Cardition's effectiveness. The device is simple to installâ€”just mount it onto the positive battery terminal without any need for additional batteries or wiring. With no need for charging or maintenance, Cardition optimizes battery performance with ease.  Cardition will be available for support on Indiegogo from October 29th, 2024. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cardition-vehicle-current-stabilizer/reft/38129856/starget_pr
