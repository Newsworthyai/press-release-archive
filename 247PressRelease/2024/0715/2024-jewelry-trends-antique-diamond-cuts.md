# 2024 Jewelry Trends: Antique Diamond Cuts

SAN DIEGO, CA, July 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With the 2024 wedding season in full swing, Carl Blackburn of C. Blackburn Jewelers in La Jolla is reporting increased interest in engagement rings set with antique cut diamonds.   "While antique design accents like hand-milgraining and hand-engraving are always popular," says Blackburn, "it's been a bit of a surprise how many couples this year want to discuss antique diamond cuts like the Old European Cut and French Cut."  Carl Blackburn welcomes this renewed interest, as he operates one of the few San Diego jewelry stores that specializes in antique cut diamonds. As both a successful jewelry designer and 2nd generation California estate jeweler, Blackburn has established C. Blackburn Jewelers in a unique niche: a La Jolla custom jeweler and a diamond estate jewelry buyer.  "I have been working with antique cut diamonds for decades," says Blackburn, "setting them into my custom designed engagement rings, and buying them from customers who visit my La Jolla store to sell antique diamond jewelry."  According to Blackburn, the main types of antique diamond cuts that today's couples may want to consider when creating a custom engagement ring are:  Old European Cut: Known for its round shape and high crown, this diamond cut features a small table and large facets that create a distinctive, romantic sparkle reminiscent of early 20th-century jewelry.  Old Mine Cut: Characterized by its cushion or slightly rounded square shape, this diamond cut has a high crown, small table, and a large, open culet, producing a warm, vintage charm.  Old French Cut: With a square or rectangular shape and large facets, this diamond cut is noted for its unique step-cut faceting that enhances the diamond's brilliance and depth, popular in early 1900s jewelry.  Rose Cut: Featuring a flat base with a domed top covered in triangular facets, this antique diamond cut offers a soft, subtle sparkle and was popular in Georgian, Victorian, and Art Deco eras.  Jubilee Cut: Designed to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, this diamond cut combines elements of the Old European and modern brilliant cuts, showcasing exceptional fire and brilliance.  Antique Single Cut: A simple cut with 16-18 facets that delivers a star like appearance, the single cut diamond is known for its understated elegance and was commonly used in early 20th-century jewelry for accent stones and smaller diamonds.  According to Blackburn, the most popular antique diamond cut is the Old European Cut, due to its romantic, vintage aesthetic, and distinctive sparkle, which makes it a beautiful choice for the center diamond of an engagement ring.  Carl Blackburn encourages San Diego couples who are interested in a custom-made antique diamond cut engagement ring to visit his boutique jewelry store in La Jolla, CA. Sellers of antique diamond rings and fine jewelry should also contact C. Blackburn Jewelers at 858-251-3006 to set up an appointment for a free market appraisal and cash offer.
