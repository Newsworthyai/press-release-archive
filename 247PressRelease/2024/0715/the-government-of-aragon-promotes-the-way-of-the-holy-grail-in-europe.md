San Juan de la Peña (Huesca), July 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a ceremony held on 1 July at the Royal Pantheon Monastery of San Juan de la Peña, the Government of Aragon and the Cultural Association The Way of the Holy Grail signed a collaboration agreement to promote the European Cultural Itinerary inspired by the Holy Grail.  The agreement was signed by the First Vice-President and Councillor for Territorial Development, Depopulation and Justice of the Government of Aragon, Mr. Alejandro Nolasco Asensio, and the President of the 'Cultural Association The Way of the Holy Grail', Dr. Ana Mafé García.  The Government of Aragon is the institution that holds executive power in the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Its responsibilities include land-use planning, sustainable development, the protection of cultural and natural heritage and the promotion of tourism.  The agreement aims to establish a framework of collaboration between the two entities to contribute to the sustainable development, protection and improvement of the European Cultural Route, which combines sites of great cultural and scenic value.  Developing 'The Way of the Holy Grail' in Aragon also means contributing to the sustainable development of the territory it crosses, while at the same time protecting and improving the rural environment along it.  This route combines sites of great cultural and scenic value. For this reason, both entities are committed to collaborate in various areas, such as historical and artistic research, the dissemination of the work carried out, the development of projects that generate positive impacts on the territory, the promotion of awareness and education on the Holy Grail Way, as well as technical and informative advice.  The Government of Aragon and the Cultural Association 'The Way of the Holy Grail' consider that this agreement is an important step to consolidate the European Cultural Route as an international reference in the field of cultural and religious tourism, and to promote the sustainable development of the territories that are part of it.  Among the work that will be carried out in the framework of this agreement, it is worth highlighting the elaboration of technical and informative material on the possible routes of the Way of the Holy Grail, the advice to the Association in the promotion of the Holy Grail as a European cultural itinerary and the collaboration in ideas for the signposting of the Way.  Both parties have stressed the importance of this agreement to enhance the cultural and natural heritage associated with the Holy Grail and to promote the socio-economic development of the territories through which the Route passes.  The signing ceremony was attended by numerous authorities such as the President of the Cortes de Aragón, Marta Fernández; the territorial delegate of the Government of Aragon in Huesca, Javier Betorz, and the Director General of Territorial Development, Luis Lorén. As well as representatives of the tourism and cultural sector, who wanted to show their support for this initiative. Among them were the Vice-president of the Cultural Association Rebeca Ruiz, the Secretary Jesús Gimeno Péris, members of the Board of Directors Jacinto Gil, Francisco Miguel, Javier Revilla, Pedro Cebrián and Mariano Arroyos.  As president of the 'Association of the Way of the Holy Grail', Dr. Mafé thanked the Government of Aragon for its active listening, as it has been more than 20 years working within civil society (the association) to give a global and universal dimension to this wonderful path that has its roots deep in the heart of the history of Europe.  About the European Cultural Itinerary inspired by the Holy Grail  The European Cultural Itinerary inspired by the Holy Grail is a route that covers different places related to the tradition and history of the Holy Chalice, from Jerusalem to the Cathedral of Valencia in Spain, where it is kept today. It is a project of great cultural and touristic relevance, which seeks to enhance the historical, artistic and natural heritage of the territories it crosses, as well as to promote the socio-economic development of local communities.  The Itinerary, which is recognised by the Council of Europe, aims to enhance the cultural and natural heritage associated with the Holy Grail and to promote the sustainable development of the territories through which it passes.  About The Way of the Holy Grail Cultural Association  The Cultural Association 'The Way of the Holy Grail' is a non-profit organisation founded in 2002 with the aim of creating and consolidating the land route between the Monastery of San Juan de la Peña and the Cathedral of Valencia, which is called 'The Way of the Holy Grail'. As president, Dr. Ana Mafé García presides over the International Cultural Itinerary Association The Way of the Holy Grail in Europe, which is in charge of requesting the certification of this itinerary to the Council of Europe.  The Association works to extol and publicise the history and symbolism of the Holy Chalice and to maintain and care for the continuity of this route in its recreational, religious and sporting aspects.  From the 'Cultural Association The Way of the Holy Grail' we would like to thank the General Directorate of Tourism and Hospitality and the Regional Ministry of Environment and Tourism of the Government of Aragon for the aid obtained in 2024 for private non-profit tourist entities for tourist promotion activities (BOA no. 12 of 17/01/2024).
