# Jenner Law Joins the Fight Against Sex Trafficking

BALTIMORE, MD, June 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sex trafficking is a grave violation of human rights, preying on the vulnerable and subjecting them to exploitation. The recent arrest of a Baltimore woman charged with operating a sex trafficking ring underscores the urgent need for comprehensive legal action against these crimes.   Jenner Law is supporting the fight against this crisis, offering survivors the legal support and advocacy they need to reclaim their lives. The firm's commitment to justice is demonstrated through decisive action.  Jenner Law Sues Choice Hotels for Alleged Role in Facilitating Sex Trafficking  On June 3, 2024, Jenner Law filed a lawsuit with a team of law firms on behalf of Jane Doe (J.S.H.) in the United District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit is against Choice Hotels International Inc., Choice Hotels International Services Corp., and GP4 Property Owner LLC, claiming they were involved in facilitating sex trafficking.   According to the lawsuit, from 2010 to 2016, Jane Doe was continuously exploited at the Suburban Extended Stay Bay Meadows in Jacksonville, Florida. The defendants are accused of benefiting from and allowing the activities despite obvious signs of exploitation.  Lawsuit Cites Federal Laws to Hold Defendants Accountable for Sex Trafficking  The lawsuit against the defendants is based on legal principles, including Perpetrator Liability under 18 U.S.C ยง1595(a) and ยง1591(a). These laws identify Jane Doe as a victim of sex trafficking and allow her to sue those who broke the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). The case also includes Beneficiary Liability, arguing that the defendants financially benefited from the trafficking and did nothing to address the clear signs of exploitation.  Combatting Commercial Business Involvement in Sex Trafficking  Jenner Law's efforts go beyond individual cases to address the broader issue of commercial businesses' involvement in these crimes. Sex trafficking isn't just carried out by common criminals. Many businesses like hotels, airlines, truck stops, and websites are also profiting by helping and promoting this modern-day slavery.   These businesses have ignored their responsibility for too long and have gotten away with it. By holding them accountable, Jenner Law's goal is to disrupt the systems that support and profit from human trafficking.  Joining Forces with the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force  Jenner Law supports the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force (MHTTF), a leading organization dedicated to eradicating human trafficking through prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships. The MHTTF works to raise awareness, provide victim services, prosecute traffickers, and foster collaborations to combat trafficking in Maryland.
