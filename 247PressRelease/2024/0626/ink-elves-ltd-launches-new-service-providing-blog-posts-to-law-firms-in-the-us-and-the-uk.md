MANSFIELD, ENGLAND, June 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ink Elves Ltd, a white label writing agency based in the UK, has launched a new website - We Write Law Blogs (www.wewritelawblogs.com/) - to provide custom blog writing services for lawyers. With a team of professional writers familiar with personal injury topics, the spin-off company aims to create high-quality, engaging blog content to help law firms and attorneys expand their online presence.  "After doing some research into personal injury lawyers both in the UK and stateside, we discovered that the majority are not making the most of their websites," said Laura Ginn, owner of We Write Law Blogs and Ink Elves Ltd. "A surprising amount of law firms don't have a blog on their website at all, and of those that do, 70% fail to keep it regularly updated."  We Write Law Blogs aims to eliminate the hassle lawyers face with keeping their blogs updated. The team offers a variety of packages, from one off blog posts to full blog management services, so law firms can be as involved in the content creation process as they like.  "Blogging has become an invaluable marketing tool for lawyers looking to connect with prospective clients online," said Laura Ginn. "We Write Law Blogs provides turnkey blog writing tailored specifically to the legal industry. Our team knows how to craft content that engages site visitors while also enhancing a law firm's visibility and credibility. We handle the writing so lawyers can focus on legal work."  In addition to blog content creation, We Write Law Blogs offers blog management services, including editing and ongoing blog maintenance. The company promises high-quality work, reliable writers, and competitive pricing.  Any law firms or attorneys interested in working with We Write Law Blogs can contact the company today for a free 1000 word blog post on a topic of their choice.  We Write Law Blogs is a new website from Ink Elves Ltd, a UK-based white label writing agency.
