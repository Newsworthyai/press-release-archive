NEW YORK, NY, June 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In 2022, MOGABI AMT INC successfully launched the Mogabi acoustic/classical guitar on Kickstarter, gathering support from around 400 backers. Following the feedback from these backers, the newly developed electric guitar will be revealed on Kickstarter for the first time.  The Mogabi V3 Electric Guitar retains the original recording function while upgrading the audio box to a fan shape for more than 20% improved sound quality.  The design allows for support and comfortability when playing seated. With a larger speaker area, the sound quality has improved by over 20%, and the low-end sound has been enhanced to minimize howling, resulting in cleaner original sound playback.  Equipped with a high-output sound system featuring a 40mm full-range 10W speaker with SPC 79dB/W, 15-step volume control, low-noise performance, and a built-in microphone preamp, this guitar meets all the needs of guitar enthusiasts. The audio box and neck are connected with a hinge that rotates 180 degrees, allowing the guitar to fold in half for easy portability. Making Mogabi V3 Electric Guitar perfect for playing indoors, outdoors, on business trips, or while traveling, regardless of time or place.  Additionally, it can record vocals through the microphone preamp. For an even stronger performance, the Mogabi 60W Bluetooth amplifier, available as an additional purchase, can be used for busking.
