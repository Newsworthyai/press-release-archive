# Shincheonji Church of Jesus Celebrates Record 111,628 Graduates Amid Explosive Growth in South Korea

ATLANTA, GA, November 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The growth of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Korea is explosive. While the decline in the number of Protestants and Buddhists is a social phenomenon, the increase in the number of Shincheonji Church of Jesus' followers has become a social trend.   Shincheonji Church of Jesus said in a press release on October 31, "Shincheonji Church of Jesus' Zion Christian Mission Center (Chairman Tan Young-jin) held the 'Zion Christian Mission Center 115th Class 110,000 Joint Graduation Ceremony' at the Shincheonji Cheongju Church on October 30. The total number of graduates was 111,628." They added, "Since the Gyeonggi Tourism Organization notified us of the cancellation on the day of the ceremony, we ended up inviting foreign graduates who entered the country from overseas and domestic and foreign religious figures for the graduation ceremony." It was announced that 111,628 people graduated from the 115th joint graduation ceremony of the Zion Christian Mission Center held at the Shincheonji Cheongju Church on this day.  Recently, the Korean religious community has been facing a wall of growth due to a decline in the number of believers. Temples and churches are being auctioned off. However, only Shincheonji Church of Jesus is showing a clear growth trend.  In his sermon at the graduation ceremony of the Zion Christian Mission Center, Chairman Lee Man-hee of Shincheonji Church of Jesus emphasized, "Shincheonji Church of Jesus is well-versed in the entire Bible, including the Book of Revelation. How proud and wonderful this is," and added, "Let's not condemn or persecute each other, but cooperate and help each other so that our country can truly shine." He continued, "The Bible says that the tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit every month. You are the embodiment of that," and congratulated them, saying, "Therefore, this graduation is an indescribably thankful and grateful thing." He also said, "I must be grateful for the church where I grew up. Because of that church, I was able to receive the word and grace," and emphasized, "Which church do believers choose to attend? The important thing is to teach the word to those who did not know it, so that we can learn from each other and grow together."  Shincheonji Church of Jesus emphasized that this year's graduates are the largest in the history of a single religious denomination and the fourth time that they have achieved over 100,000 graduates, following 2019, 2022, and 2023.   On this day, 10,000 overseas graduates and 1,000 domestic and foreign religious figures attended the Shincheonji Cheongju Church. In addition, 3,377 pastors graduated on this day, and 6,203 pastors are currently taking classes at the Zion Christian Mission Center.
