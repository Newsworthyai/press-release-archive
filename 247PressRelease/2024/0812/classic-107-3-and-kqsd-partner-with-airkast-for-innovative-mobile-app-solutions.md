# Classic 107.3 and KQSD Partner with AirKast for Innovative Mobile App Solutions

PLEASANTON, CA, August 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Classic 107.3, St. Louis' premier classical music station, and KQSD, the beloved Santa Cruz community station known for its eclectic mix of genres, are excited to announce their partnership with AirKast to enhance their mobile app experiences for listeners.  With this collaboration, both stations will leverage AirKast's cutting-edge mobile app and AirBridge technology to provide their audiences with a more interactive and user-friendly listening experience. The new apps will feature live streaming, on-demand content, playlists, and exclusive station news, bringing a rich and engaging experience to listeners' fingertips.  For years, public media has been recognized for having one of the most devoted listener bases in broadcasting. The primary hurdle? Demonstrating this loyalty to their partners. AirKast's sophisticated mobile analytics have bridged this gap with in-depth listening visualizations, specialized affinity categories, and comprehensive underwriting campaign analytics that surpass mere 'clicks' and 'impressions.'  Innovative Advertising Avenues - Public media has traditionally used audio messages to appreciate their sponsors, aiming to maintain streamlined on-air broadcasts. However, visual mobile messaging has emerged as a subtle yet effective means of connecting with listeners, increasing underwriting funds, and achieving the desired digital KPIs. This approach has opened doors to fresh revenue streams.  Julie Schuster, General Manager of Classic 107.3, expressed her enthusiasm for the partnership: "We are thrilled to join forces with AirKast. This partnership will allow us to offer our loyal listeners a seamless and enriched experience, ensuring they can enjoy their favorite classical pieces anytime, anywhere. AirKast's technology aligns perfectly with our mission to bring the beauty of classical music to a broader audience."  Rachel Anne Goodman, Board Chair of KSQD, is excited to expand the station's reach. "KSQD broadcasts over three frequencies on FM in the Monterey Bay area. We are excited to add the KSQD AirKast mobile app to listeners' choices to tune in from anywhere, interact with, and even play with contests. As a community radio station, this is one great way to connect people with a common vision and aesthetic."  AirKast is known for its innovative solutions in the radio industry. It provides stations with the tools needed to stay connected with their audience in a digital age. This partnership will enable Classic 107.3 and KQSD to enhance their listener engagement and expand their reach.  "Public radio enthusiasts are among the most engaged audio consumers. Our partners have always sought ways to demonstrate their listeners' loyalty. Until now, it was challenging to showcase the impact of an underwriting campaign on community connection. Our real-time ability to create and modify campaigns and our exclusive analytics provide granular demographic and psychographic insights, highlighting tangible growth for advertisers and sponsors. We are continually seeking new strategies for public radio to captivate audiences and generate new revenue.", says Larry Leung, CEO of AirKast.
