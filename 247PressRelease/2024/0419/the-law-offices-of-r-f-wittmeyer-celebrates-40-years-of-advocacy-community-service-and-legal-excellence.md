# The Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer Celebrates 40 Years of Advocacy, Community Service, and Legal Excellence

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL, April 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer, Ltd., a milestone celebrated with pride and gratitude. Founded by Ronald F. Wittmeyer Jr., the firm has steadfastly advocated for injured individuals and their families, providing legal representation with dedication.  For four decades, the Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer, Ltd. has been a pillar of legal advocacy in both Illinois and Wisconsin. Headquartered in Arlington Heights, with additional offices in Kenosha, Elgin, and Aurora, the firm has championed the cause of justice under the leadership of Ron Wittmeyer. The firm's philosophy centers on prioritizing the well-being of both employees and clients, delivering exceptional client service, with genuine caring and commitment.  The firm has a proven track record of handling multi-million-dollar cases, demonstrating an ability to produce favorable results for the firm's clients. Acknowledging that each case is unique, the firm has successfully obtained top-dollar verdicts and settlements in personal injury and wrongful death cases.  Among the firm's notable case results are a $2,650,000 jury verdict awarded to a body shop worker client, and a $2,400,000 settlement obtained on behalf of a family severely injured in a collision caused by a school bus driver.  While the RFW law firm is primarily focused on producing a financial recovery for the firm's clients, they are also committed to helping make their local communities better places to live and work. The Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer, Ltd. extends its commitment to the community through a diverse range of initiatives. In recognition of the importance of nurturing future community leaders, the firm annually awards the R.F. Wittmeyer Community Service Scholarship to a deserving college student who demonstrates their dedication to community service, as well as academics. "Over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to choose between the many outstanding young applicants for our annual community service scholarship," said Wittmeyer.  In partnership with the international organization, One Warm Coat, for the past several years, the RFW firm has held local coat drives in both Wisconsin and Illinois. Over the past several years, the firm has collected over 500 adult and children's coats, and delivered them to local non-profit organizations, where the coats are distributed to local families in need. Another one of the firm's favorite local community service organizations that they proudly support is Gerry's Caf√© (now open in Arlington Heights), which employs people who are 22 and older, with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Over the past 40 years, the RFW firm has also supported many other local community organizations and causes, like Salute, Inc., a non-profit organization that helps meet the financial, physical, and emotional needs of injured military service members, veterans, and their families.   Ron Wittmeyer has made it a point to give back to the community as well as to the legal profession. He has been a member of the Northwest Suburban Bar Association (NWSBA) for the past 40 years. For the past 20 years in particular, Ron has been very involved in the NWSBA, by holding various leadership positions, including proudly serving as NWSBA President in 2015. As President, Ron worked closely with the capable and dedicated NWSBA Executive Director, Julie Barth, who had this to say about Ron's dedication to the NWSBA.  "I've had the pleasure of knowing Ron for more than 15 years, when he was on the hiring committee for a new ED for the NWSBA. It was then that I was able to realize the vision Ron had for the NWSBA and the legal community. I worked closely with Ron over the years particularly when he became president of the Association. I think the most significant contributions Ron made were placing a strong emphasis on committee development, promoting the value of networking among colleagues, growing our membership and a commitment to serving the community in general when he opened the Legal Self-Help Center in the Third District courthouse, providing equal access to justice to those within our community. Ron continues to be a great advocate for the NWSBA and remains very supportive of the Association. It has been my absolute pleasure to work with Ron over the years and I congratulate him on his 40 years serving our community."  In reflecting on the past 40 years, and what the future holds for the RFW firm, Ron expressed his gratitude for all the dedicated people who are current and past employees of the RFW team. "Moving forward, we will continue to take exceptional care of our employees, who in turn are committed to taking exceptional care of our clients. We will also continue to strive to always be a respectful and positive workplace, where our team members feel appreciated and valued. The single most important asset of our business is our outstanding people, and we are genuinely grateful to each of them for being a part of our team."  About The Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer, Ltd.:  Our team at the Law Offices of R.F. Wittmeyer is passionate about helping people. We have successfully represented thousands of clients over the past 40 years, and we continue our commitment to aggressively fight for full and fair compensation for every one of our clients.
