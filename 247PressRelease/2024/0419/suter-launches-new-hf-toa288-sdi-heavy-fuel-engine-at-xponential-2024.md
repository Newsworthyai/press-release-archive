# Suter launches new HF-TOA288-SDI heavy fuel engine at xPonential 2024

TURBENTHAL, SWITZERLAND, April 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Suter is launching their new HF-TOA288-SDI heavy fuel engine at this years' xPonential 2024 in San Diego, CA (Booth #3650). This new 22.5hp unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) engine meets the growing demand for engines utilizing jet fuel (Jet-A1, JP5, JP8) to meet safety and logistics goals of global customers.   Suter has produced over 300 gasoline TOA288 engines to date and the increase in demand for larger heavy fuel UAV engines for group 3 UAV's was the driver for developing this new engine. The Suter HF-TOA288-SDI is a twin cylinder, horizontal opposed, air cooled, two cycle engine, with semi-direct fuel injection and a 1kW starter/generator (2 kW optional). Displacement is 288cm3. Power: 16.5kW (22.5HP) @6500rpm. The engine was a design collaboration between CAE GmbH and Suter Industries combining CAE's 25 years of manned & unmanned 2-stroke engine experience with Suter's over 25 years of 2-stroke motorcycle racing design & manufacturing experience. The result is a high performance, reliable, world class UAV engine currently produced in Switzerland.  Dietrich Kehe, CEO and founder of CAE GmbH said, "This new engine pushes further 2-stroke heavy fuel combustion technology resulting in an engine with reliable combustion through hot/cold/altitude operational conditions." Lars Jäger. CSO of Suter Industries went on to say, "We continue to expand our capabilities, personnel and facilities to advance our aerospace engine solutions to meet challenging customer performance and delivery requirements."   This new heavy fuel engine will be on display at the Suter Industries booth #3650 at xPonential 2024 APR 23-25th in San Diego, CA.
