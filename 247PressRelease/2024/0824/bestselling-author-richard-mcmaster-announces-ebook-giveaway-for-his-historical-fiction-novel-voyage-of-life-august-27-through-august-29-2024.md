WILMINGTON, NC, August 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Richard McMaster has announced that the ebook version of his historical fiction novel, Voyage Of Life, will be available at no charge August 27 through August 29, 2024 at Amazon.  McMaster considers Voyage Of Life to be one of his signature works. Readers and reviewers agree.  In a story printed by The Hudson Weekly, Dennis Keller said, "There have been multiple authors that have made a significant contribution to the world of literacy. In the current era, we have come across several first-time authors with the gift of writing. Richard McMaster is an accomplished author whose works have been praised for their depth, complexity, and emotional resonance."  Voyage of Life is a captivating coming of age in the sixties story about a secret that takes a lifetime to uncover. It is a story about a man's life, beginning with the period after WWII, continuing through the coming-of-age sixties, the triumphs and tragedies of manhood, and finding peace and resolution in old age. The breathtaking story has unfolding mysteries around losing a father, mother, wife, son, and friends and Sean's perseverance in life and, in the end, reuniting with his first love.  The story is told as Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings are portrayed by the women he loves; childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings are a metaphor for Sean's lifeâ€”the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood turn turbulent in youth, and then early in manhood, the rocky shores of manhood open to a promising sky of old age when he believes that his one true love left him for another man.  In the Hudson Weekly piece, Keller continued with "Richard McMaster never falls into the trap of presenting his characters as simplistic archetypes or caricatures, instead allowing them to emerge as fully-formed individuals with their unique voices and perspectives.  "In addition to his skillful characterization, he is also a master of plot and pacing. The structure of his novels keep readers engaged and invested in the story while also allowing for moments of quiet reflection and contemplation. The author's writing is often described as "page-turning" or "gripping," but it is also imbued with a sense of thoughtfulness and depth that elevates his work beyond mere genre fiction.  "Another notable aspect of his writing is his attention to historical detail. In Aaron's War, he meticulously recreates the time of World War II, capturing the sights, sounds, and smells of a world torn apart by war and genocide. In A Love Divided By Time, he offers readers a distinctive viewpoint on love and life. Overall, Richard McMaster is an author whose works are marked by a deep sense of humanity and empathy. Whether he is exploring the horrors of war or the complexities of human relationships, his writing is always grounded in a profound understanding of the human experience. His novels, Aaron's War and A Love Divided By Time, are powerful testaments to the enduring power of storytelling and are sure to captivate readers with their vivid characters, intricate plots, and emotional depth."
