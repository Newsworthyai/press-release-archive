# Local Cleaners Lend a Hand in Burlington, Ont. Flood Cleanup

HAMILTON, ON, August 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On July 16, 2024, Burlington, Ont. was hit hard by heavy rainfall, leading to significant flooding across the city. With around 75 mm of rain, the storm overwhelmed the local stormwater system, triggering a "Level 2" emergency. Many homes were flooded, including that of Burlington resident Jee in the Elizabeth Gardens neighbourhood.  Jee's basement was left in a terrible state, covered in dirt and debris. Struggling to find someone that could help quickly, he was relieved when Scrubly, a family-owned cleaning service based in Hamilton, answered the call.  The very next day, Scrubly's team arrived and got to work. They swept and vacuumed the dirt and debris that had been dragged in by the floodwaters. But they didn't stop thereâ€”they also removed the ruined rugs and sanitized the area, making sure the basement was as good as new.  Jee was impressed with the fast response and quality of work, saying, "Great company; they were on time and did an amazing job."  In response, Scrubly noted, "We're proud to have been able to help during such a difficult time, we will always stay true to our commitment to give back to our community, and provide reliable and thorough cleaning services to those in need."
