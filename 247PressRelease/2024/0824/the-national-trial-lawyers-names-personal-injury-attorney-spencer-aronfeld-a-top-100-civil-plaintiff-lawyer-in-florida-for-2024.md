I represent injured clients who not only seek compensation but more importantly, justice. Each case is an opportunity for me to help another human being and it's important that my clients receive the care and attention they need. Many of my clients face dangerous situations or suffer from life-threatening injuries. My job is to make sure that justice is served so that the dangers that my clients face do not happen to someone else," Aronfeld said.

Selection is based on a thorough multi-phase objective and uniformly applied process which includes peer nominations as well as third-party research. Membership is extended only to a select few of the most qualified attorneys from each state or region who demonstrate superior qualifications of leadership, reputation, influence, stature, and public profile measured by equitable and uniformly applied standards in compliance with state bar and model rule.
