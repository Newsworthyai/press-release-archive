# World's First Alternative Credit Scoring Solution Based on Creator-Advertiser Transaction Data 'Glow.B' Launches, Secures Funding

SEOUL, KOREA, August 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BYAHT, a technology startup, announced the successful launch of Glow.B, the world's first alternative credit scoring solution incorporating transaction data between creators and advertisers. Following the launch, BYAHT has secured its first round of funding, led by early-stage venture capital firm The Ventures, positioning Glow.B as a transformative tool for expanding financial accessibility in global markets.  Glow.B presents a new pathway in credit evaluation by analyzing real transaction histories and performance metrics between creators and advertisers. Unlike traditional credit scoring models that rely heavily on financial histories, Glow.B's innovative approach offers a more accurate and inclusive assessment of creditworthiness. This pioneering solution opens the door for smaller creators and emerging advertisers, who have historically been underserved by conventional credit systems, to access financial services with greater assurance.  During the three-month beta phase in Vietnam, Glow.B demonstrated its immense potential by analyzing over 1,000 transactions and attracting more than 20,000 creators and advertisers to the platform. These early achievements underscore the platform's scalability and the team's ambition to bring Glow.B's credit scoring solutions to diverse markets worldwide.  "The launch of Glow.B offers creators and advertisers a new opportunity to have their creditworthiness assessed based on their actual transaction data," said BYAHT CEO Kim Dong-kyu. "This will expand financial accessibility in the market, enabling more creators and advertisers to benefit from a transparent and trustworthy financial environment."  The Glow.B app is now available for free download on both the App Store and Google Play, with more information accessible on the official website. Glow.B is committed to enhancing trust and transparency between creators and advertisers, setting a new standard in the global financial market.
