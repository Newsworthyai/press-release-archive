# South Korean Company Infresh Makes Global Impact with Heartfelt Support in Thailand

NEW YORK, NY, August 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Infresh, a prominent South Korean company known for its commitment to global humanitarian efforts, has recently made headlines with a heartwarming gesture of support for a 93-year-old Korean War veteran in Ayutthaya, Thailand.  The elderly veteran, who returned to his homeland after the Korean War ceasefire, has spent decades enduring poverty, supporting a large family of 12 by collecting and selling empty bottles and old items. Faced with increasing rent and the threat of eviction, he turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs in Thailand, where it was discovered that he had served in the Korean War over 70 years ago.  In response to this discovery, Infresh swiftly took action. Representatives from the company flew to Thailand to provide a substantial donation aimed at improving the veteran's living conditions. The company also offered scholarships to the veteran's grandchildren, who have been unable to attend school due to financial constraints.  Founded in 2007, Infresh has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to honoring the sacrifices of veterans from the 16 countries that participated in the Korean War. The company currently provides medical support, supplies, and financial assistance in South Korea, Ethiopia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  The Thai veteran, moved to tears by the unexpected visit, expressed profound gratitude to the South Korean representatives. "It is our goal to provide as much support as we can to the veterans who sacrificed for South Korea," said a company spokesperson. "We plan to go wherever we can to help the veterans of the Korean War."  This act of kindness has resonated deeply with the international community, drawing praise from netizens worldwide. Comments such as "Korea never forgets to honor its combatant nations" and "It's amazing what a company can do on behalf of its country" have been widely shared on social media.  Infresh's actions extend beyond honoring the past; they set a powerful example for current and future generations. The company remains dedicated to upholding these values and continues to be a positive influence on global society.
