# Burhani Engineers Enhances Fuel Storage Accuracy with New Automatic Tank Gauging System in Ethiopia

NAIROBI, KENYA, August 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers LTD, an engineering company in Kenya, has successfully completed a state-of-the-art automatic tank gauging solution for a client in Ethiopia. This milestone underscores the company's dedication to providing top-tier engineering solutions. This specific solution was designed to meet the demanding requirements of the oil and gas industry.  The comprehensive project scope involved the design, supply, installation and commissioning of an automatic tank gauging system for six newly constructed storage fuel tanks. This project extends the capabilities of an existing automatic tank gauging system previously installed and commissioned by Burhani Engineers for another twenty tanks at the same facility. The team managed the entire lifecycle of the project, ensuring that every phase was executed with precision and excellence.  The primary challenge was the absence of an automatic tank gauging system for the new tanks, leaving the client dependent on manual dipsticks to measure fuel volumes. This manual approach was not only prone to human error but also failed to account for critical factors such as water presence and temperature variations, which can significantly impact volume accuracy.  The chosen automatic tank gauging solution was selected for its robustness, reliability and ability to meet both current and future needs. The system integrates highly accurate electronic components capable of measuring fuel levels, detecting water accumulation and adjusting for temperature variations. Also, the system provides remote access to live tank readings and enhances safety by reducing the risks associated with manual measurements.  The successful completion of this project is a testament to the expertise and dedication of the team at Burhani Engineers. Their extensive knowledge and experience were instrumental in ensuring timely project delivery while adhering to rigorous technical specifications and safety standards. The commitment to excellence reinforced their reputation as a leader in the field of engineering solutions for the oil and gas industry.
