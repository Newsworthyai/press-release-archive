# Sizzling Summers Can Cause Serious Burns to Unprotected Feet

SACRAMENTO, CA, August 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The summer of 2024 has been an absolute scorcher in California's Sacramento Valley. The continuing heatwave has broken daily heat records and the number of consecutive days in triple-digit temperatures. There are daily heat advisory warnings and reminders about staying safe in the heat and sun, including doing outdoor activities in the early morning hours, staying hydrated, applying sunscreen, and wearing lighter shades like pastels and whites (which are less likely to absorb UV rays) and wide-brimmed hats when outside to protect skin exposed to the sun rays. "You should also be paying attention to a part of the body that doesn't typically get much sunshine: your feet," says Phong Le, DPM, President of the California Podiatric Medical Association (CPMA).  At peak temperatures, pavement (cement and asphalt) can be dozens of degrees hotter than the surrounding ambient air and hot enough to cause second-degree and third-degree burns, according to a University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Medicine study (Journal of Burn Care & Research).  "Hot pavement can burn the soles of the feet in mere seconds," said Dr. Le. "It is not only excruciatingly painful, but it can also make it difficult to walk or wear protective footwear for a significant length of time, depending on the extent of the burns. Thermal burns to the soles of the feet are especially dangerous for young children, seniors, those with diabetes, poor circulation, and neuropathy that cause a loss of sensation in the feet," according to Dr. Le, a podiatric foot and ankle surgeon practicing in Elk Grove, CA.  "Early recognition of the signs of thermal burns to the feet caused by hot surfaces is essential," says Dr. Le. "These include: • Pain or burning sensation • Swelling • Redness • Blister formation • Skin peeling  "If you sustain thermal burns (or suspect that you have) to your feet, contact a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) – a highly trained podiatric foot and ankle medical professional – immediately to evaluate the severity of the injury and prescribe the appropriate treatment. Burns that are left untreated can lead to more serious complications such as infection, permanent tissue damage, or even amputation."   Dr. Le offers the following tips to help protect feet in the heat: • Don't go barefoot; this is especially important for those with diabetes and or neuropathy. The inability to feel the heat can result in 2nd and 3rd-degree burns to the feet. • Wear protective footwear: Always wear shoes or sandals when walking on hot pavement or sand. • If planning a day at the beach or in the sun, be sure to apply sunscreen to your feet, pay close attention to the top of the feet and toes, and wear footwear with adequate protective coverage.  • Stay in the shade: Whenever possible, walk on shaded paths or areas to avoid direct exposure to hot surfaces. • Also, walk pets during the cooler early morning and later evening hours. Their paws can get burned and damaged as well. Let's keep everyone's feet healthy in the heat.
