# Clear the Shelters!

MILPITAS, CA, August 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) is joining a month-long, nationwide campaign to help find loving homes for animals in need. Clear the Shelters is a partnership with NBCUniversal Local, and it unites hundreds of organizations across the country in a passionate plea for pet adoption and donation from August 10 to September 10.  Over 6 million companion animals are admitted to animal shelters in the United States every year, and over 25 million more animals are thought to live in poverty. Last year, the 2023 Clear the Shelters campaign helped over 150,000 pets find a loving home, and its fundraising efforts generated nearly $600,000.  "We are incredibly grateful to NBCUniversal Local for continuing to shed light on the issue of overcrowding in shelters," said Kristen Jahnke, Senior Director, Operations. "The number of animals adopted last year is a testament to the power of collective action, and we are looking forward to making a difference in animal lives again this year."  This year marks the 10th anniversary for the Clear the Shelters initiative, which has extended its 2024 campaign to celebrate surpassing 1 million total pet adoptions. Joining in on the celebration, HSSV will be offering a special adoption fee of only $50 for all animals over 6 months old, and each animal is spayed or neutered with all necessary vaccines and a microchip. Staff will be on hand to offer expert tips on all aspects of pet care and practical post-adoption advice for a new pet.  What's more, HSSV will be getting the word out on its Keeping Families Together initiative, which includes a pet food pantry and a mobile wellness clinic for families in need of medical services.  Visit hssv.org/clear-the-shelters to view animals available for adoption.
