# New Certified Farmers Market To Open At Valencia August 4

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, July 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The convenient lifestyle of Valencia by FivePoint continues to grow, with the August 4 opening of the new Valencia Farmers Market. Residents and visitors are invited to the new market, with the first opening on Sunday, August 4 from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.   The Valencia Farmers Market will be at the corner of Magic Mountain Parkway and Navigation Avenue. The market's spot is easy to see, and has easy access and ample parking. The address is 27426 Navigation Avenue, Valencia, CA 91381.  The new Valencia market will be held each Sunday and managed by California Farm Direct Markets, which operates the Saturday Old Town Newhall and the Wednesday Canyon Country Farmers Markets. "This new venue expands local choices for freshly harvested produce," said Market Manager Larry McClements.   "I'm delighted to get the Valencia market open, and to welcome new and regular customers!" added McClements. "I'm thrilled to bring this new market to the Valencia by FivePoint community."   The market will draw from Valencia's surrounding areas for food products and ready to eat foods, with offerings sold by the growers. "Our market is run by our Santa Clarita Valley-based team," said McClements.   McClements is a Santa Clarita resident and began selling produce for a farmer at the Newhall Farmers Market, taking over operations in 2019, when the former manager retired. The new Valencia market is a certified farmers market licensed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture and LA County Agriculture.

The community's hillside site features vista views and frames a delightful indoor/outdoor fabric woven by open spaces and leisure amenities.   "We work at home, and love that all you need to do for a great break is walk outside and take in the beautiful panorama of hills and sky," said Paul Butler, who purchased here with his wife Gaynor.  Hometown Living—Valencia's lifestyle pleasures enhance the local character of this planned community. A core gathering place is Confluence Park, which features lawn expanses, a pool complex and easy connections to other community points such as Adventure Playground, seating niches and trails for pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals. This is the place for the many special events that highlight Valencia's calendar. Ask about "Friday Night Happenings," Earth Day, the Easter Egg Hunt and Pumpkin Fest.   "Being near the community garden here is another big plus for us," said Diane Diamond, who bought here with husband Sean. "Our daughter is learning about plants and flowers, and we love being able to socialize so easily."
