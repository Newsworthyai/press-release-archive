# Innovatech Investment Education Foundation and Bertram Charlton Examine New RMD Regulations and IRA Strategies

WASHINGTON, DC, July 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On July 18, the Treasury Department and IRS released updated final regulations for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), influenced by the SECURE Act and SECURE 2.0 Act. The regulations affect retirement plan participants, IRA owners, and their beneficiaries. Despite public suggestions, the final rules maintain that beneficiaries must continue annual RMDs even if the account is fully depleted within 10 years of the account holder's death. The regulations also open the floor for public feedback on future changes.  Understanding IRAs and Their Benefits  Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are crucial for retirement savings, offering tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, with earnings growing tax-deferred until withdrawal, taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs, funded with after-tax contributions, offer tax-free withdrawals during retirement.  Types and Limits  The two main IRAs are Traditional and Roth. In 2023, contribution limits are $6,500 annually, with an extra $1,000 for those over 50. Historically, IRAs have evolved through legislation, enhancing contribution limits and eligibility.  How IRAs Function  To open an IRA, select a financial institution and choose the typeâ€”Traditional or Roth. Investments can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs are taxed, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free. Starting early, contributing regularly, and seeking financial advice can optimize retirement planning with IRAs, ensuring a secure financial future.
