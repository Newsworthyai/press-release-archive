# Nails You Deserve at Xochitl Nails in Georgetown

GEORGETOWN, TX, July 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The biggest roadblock to ownership for many in the beauty industry is the cost of leasing a retail location. Not so at Hill Country Salon Suites, as Lourdes Yanez found out.  "I was looking for an affordable location for my planned nail salon," explained Yanez. "By chance, I stopped in at Hill Country Salon Suites. I talked to the owners, liked what they said, loved the support they give each of their tenants, and found the entire operation to be first-class. I couldn't be happier."

The Hill Country Business Model Co-owners Richard Spradley and Melanie Scharton had a duel purpose when they opened Hill Country Salon Suites.
