SAN DIEGO, CA, April 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cozaint®, an innovator in video surveillance storage solutions, unveiled Marcia, a groundbreaking software platform that dramatically reduces storage costs while making video playback and review effortless.  Cozaint Marcia™ represents a significant leap forward in the video surveillance storage market.

Marcia abstracts the backend storage hardware from the front-end VMS solution, allowing for seamless, fully integrated, and managed online/offline storage while allowing for easy video playback for many VMS solutions.  "We are thrilled to introduce Marcia, a software solution that empowers integrators to unlock the full potential of video surveillance systems," said Jay Jason Bartlett, CEO of Cozaint. "With Marcia, organizations can finally overcome the burden of high storage costs while ensuring they have a clear and readily accessible record of their video data."  Marcia is already available for these organizations using Network Optix's NxWitness™, Digital Watchdog Spectrum® IPVMS, Hanwha Wisenet Wave, Cook Security Piko VMS, and Cozaint's BOBBYvms video management software systems. Other VMS to be supported soon. If you are a VMS vendor, speak with Cozaint about Marcia supporting for your system.
