# Medical Bill Acquisition Industry : Update

PHILADELPHIA, PA, May 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Medical Bill Acquisition Industry is a relatively new micro industry that is expected to grow over 500% in the next year. The industry acquires the medical bill obligations from patients, at a reduced price, and then ensures providers are paid for the services rendered to the patients. This situation is a win-win because the patient is able to pay for the care rendered and the provider receives payment when they might otherwise not have been paid.  The problem the industry helps solve: •	40% of Americans fear they won't be able to afford health care in the upcoming year.* •	As of April 2022, 14% of Americans with medical debt planned to declare bankruptcy later in the year because of it.*  *Source: www.retireguide.com/retirement-planning/risks/medical-bankruptcy-statistics/  Link: https://medicalbillacquisition.org  Medical Bill Acquisition companies assist patients with their medical bills and help providers obtain payment for care for which they otherwise may not be paid.
