# The Listening Path® Program Nominated For The Mom's Choice® Awards

PHILADELPHIA, PA, November 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Listening Path® Program designed for children in grades 3 to 5 has been nominated for the Mom's Choice® Awards. The Listening Path® Program is a one-of-a-kind program designed to teach children the skill of listening. It is available to schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. The Mom's Choice® Awards is globally recognized for establishing the benchmark of excellence in family-friendly media, products and services.  "I am very honored and humbled that The Listening Path® Program has been nominated for the Mom's Choice® Awards," said Christine Miles, founder of The Listening Path®. "The Mom's Choice® Awards are known globally by educators and parents for recognizing quality products and services that enrich and enlighten children in their journey of learning."  Educators say their greatest challenge is getting students to listen and comprehend. A reason for this, is because there is no program that teaches listening as a skill. This led Christine Miles, the founder of The Listening Path® to develop The Listening Path® Program for the classroom.   The Listening Path® Program is designed to be fun, easy, and educational. Children learn a new way to listen through a series of engaging, animated videos that take them on an educational adventure, while teaching them to Listen to Understand. To navigate their journey, the program includes everything they'll need: The Listening Path® map, posters, stickers, a compass, passports and more. The Listening Path Program® was developed with one thing in mind—to go deeper to truly understand what someone means, and not just what they're saying.   "Listening matters," said Christine Miles, founder of The Listening Path®. "Yet, while we have methods to teach children to read, write and speak, we have none to teach them how to listen. Listening is a skill and needs be taught as such."  About The Listening Path Program  The Listening Path® Program teaches children how to listen to understand fully what the speaker is saying. It is designed to help improve the overall aptitude of students by unlocking their listening skills. It is the only educational program in the United States designed just to teach listening—leading to a higher level of understanding, greater learning and increased emotional intelligence.
