# VALENCIA PROVINCIAL COUNCIL SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE RESIDENTS OF ALBALAT DELS TARONGERS

VALENCIA, SPAIN, November 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Town Council of Albalat dels Tarongers presented last Friday, 15th November, in the Espai Les Panses, the tourism project together with the itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, Path of Peace', a route framed in the Strategic Plan of the town. The event was attended by more than 60 people, including mayors, councillors from the Camp de Morvedre region and surrounding areas, professionals from the tourism sector and local residents. This initiative seeks to consolidate the current tourist attractions and also to develop new projects to boost the local economy, through public-private collaboration.  The mayoress of Albalat dels Tarongers, María Asensi, opened the event with a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the recent DANA in the Valencian Community. Afterwards, Asensi underlined the importance of this project as an engine of economic and cultural growth, highlighting the opportunity to position the town as a key tourist destination in the region.  Amongst the speakers was Dr. Ana Mafé García, president of the International Association Cultural Itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail in Europe', who highlighted the strategic value of this route for the cultural and touristic development of the Valencian Community. She also presented the Pilgrimage Credentials with the sponsorship of Turismo Valencia, Diputación de Valencia and the municipality itself.  Tourist attractions and outstanding projects The councillor for Tourism and Culture, Carlos Picón, presented the main tourist assets of Albalat dels Tarongers, such as the 14th century Castle, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, the cycling and hiking routes, and the archaeological sites of great importance, such as the cave paintings of the Cueva de l'Aigua Amarga and the site of Les Raboses, dating from between 1600-100 BC.  Picón also highlighted an ambitious cultural project: the creation of the permanent Joaquín Michavila Museum, in honour of the renowned local painter, whose works have been exhibited in cities such as New York, Brussels and Tokyo. This museum would place Albalat dels Tarongers as a cultural reference in the region and would attract international tourism with the support of the Diputación de Valencia and the Universitat de València. In addition, the richness of the local gastronomy was highlighted, with dishes such as Comediana rice and Tortell, which complement the touristic offer of the municipality.  International recognition and European funds During the event, it was announced that the project 'Declaration of Albalat: Creative industries as management tools for cultural and intelligent routes' has been included in the certification dossier of the itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail.'  This recognition, which depends on the Council of Europe, will allow Albalat dels Tarongers to access European funds for projects that benefit both tourism and other municipal services, consolidating its position as a cultural and tourist reference.  Albalat Declaration: creative industries as tools for the management of cultural and intelligent routes. Pilot experience of 'Albalat dels Tarongers' The presidents of the most representative and identitary routes of the Valencian Community met in February this year to endorse with a joint declaration, the management of the sustainability of the intelligent cultural routes in collaboration with the City Council of Albalat dels Tarongers, in the Valencian Community, Spain, and European Union.  All this with the aim of ensuring that its management is supported with a new model of orange economy based on sustainability, ecology, digital tools; with an inclusive vision, rooted to the land, resilient and responsive to meet the challenges ahead, helping to contribute to greater job creation and growth, and ensuring the long-term welfare of all members of the value chain, especially the local populations through which these routes and paths pass.  The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, Way of Peace is a central axis in the Declaration of Albalat dels Tarongers, where an innovative approach to the management of smart and sustainable cultural routes is promoted. This itinerary, recognised for its historical, spiritual and cultural value, is positioned as a catalyst for local and regional economic dynamisation, as well as for the development of the orange economy.  The route stands out for its Jubilee character in perpetuity, taking place every five years and attracting both pilgrims and tourists interested in profound cultural experiences. The initiative seeks to consolidate its impact through sustainable strategies that include digitalisation, the improvement of tourism competitiveness and the preservation of the cultural and natural heritage of the municipalities through which it passes.  Among its main objectives are •	Sustainable development: To promote regenerative tourism based on respect for the environment and the enhancement of local heritage. •	Inclusion and accessibility: Designing experiences that encourage the participation of all people, regardless of their abilities. •	Digital innovation: Facilitate access to digital infrastructures to improve tourism management and promote more competitive tourism. •	Institutional and fiscal support: Apply for the declaration of an Event of Exceptional Public Interest (AEIP) for the jubilee years, facilitating business sponsorship through tax incentives.  The project, led by the Town Council of Albalat dels Tarongers in collaboration with local and regional actors, reinforces the role of the Way of the Holy Grail as a Route of Knowledge and Way of Peace, integrating cultural, social and spiritual values in a sustainable tourism model with a high positive impact on local communities. All of this has to be added to the new panorama of solidarity in which the most representative territory of the Silk Road in the Valencia Region has been plunged, due to the tragedy that has occurred, affecting more than 500,000 people in more than 70 municipalities.  "It is necessary to rethink ourselves with 'Knowledge' and real talent for the management of new opportunities for the future," concludes Dr. Ana Mafé. Mayoress Asensi closed the event by stating: "Tourism is a key tool to boost our local economy and generate employment, while preserving and valuing our cultural and natural heritage."  With this strategy, Albalat dels Tarongers reinforces its commitment to sustainable development and the promotion of its identity as a complete and attractive tourist destination for national and international visitors.  Thanks to the sponsorship of Turismo Valencia, Diputación de Valencia and Ajuntament de Albalat dels Tarongers, it has been possible to carry out this event whose final objective is the creation of a technical office of intelligent tourist management based on 'Knowledge' and which is the creator of scientific methodologies applicable throughout the territory of the route. And, in turn, of the intelligent cultural routes too.  Report by 24/7 Valencia team
