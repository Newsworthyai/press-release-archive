# The Willow – A Riveting Fantasy Adventure That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat

SALINA, KS, November 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Willow, the highly anticipated debut novel by Frankee Sullivan, plunges readers into a world where political intrigue, ancient power struggles, and the discovery of one's true identity collide. Set in the fantastical land of Lorus, the novel tells the story of Siv, a young woman who believes her future is written for her—until she is forced to confront the harsh realities of a world on the brink of change.  Long ago, the Vaegarians wiped out the Nativus people and nearly eradicated the Krigs, leaving behind a fractured world and a kingdom teetering on the edge of conflict. In the Kingdom of Saleda, the aftermath of the Great War is still felt, and despite its relative peace, tensions are rising. Siv, betrothed to a prince she loathes, believes her purpose is to be a dutiful wife. But when a chain of events exposes a power within her, her quiet life is shattered. With her destiny now exposed, Siv must choose between becoming the hero her kingdom demands or embracing the darker path that her true self seems to be calling her toward.  Frankee Sullivan weaves a compelling tale of self-discovery, political tension, and the complexities of identity in The Willow. "This is a story about the journey to understanding who you truly are," Sullivan explains. "Siv has always been told who she is supposed to be, but when circumstances force her to question everything, she has to decide whether to fight for her life, her family, and her kingdom—or destroy it all."  About the Book Set in a world steeped in the aftermath of the Great War, The Willow tells the story of Siv, a young woman whose life is turned upside down when the truth about her hidden powers is revealed. Born into the peaceful Kingdom of Saleda, Siv has always lived in the shadow of the royal family's expectations, believing her only role is to marry Prince Seth, a man she detests. But as power struggles within the kingdom threaten to unravel everything, Siv's destiny is uncovered. Forced to make a choice between the role of hero or villain, Siv embarks on a journey that will challenge everything she thought she knew about herself and the world she lives in.
