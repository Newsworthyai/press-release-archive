# Precision Roller Celebrates 50 Years of Excellence in Office Machine Parts and Supplies

PHOENIX, AZ, November 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Precision Roller is proud to announce its 50th anniversary, celebrating five decades of innovation and service in the office machine parts and supplies industry. Since its humble beginnings in a garage on November 20, 1974, Precision Roller has grown into a leading supplier of OEM and aftermarket parts, supporting businesses worldwide.  Precision Roller initially manufactured urethane squeegee rollers for electrostatic photocopiers, a critical component at the dawn of modern copying technology. The company quickly became known for its high-quality products and pioneering techniques.  In 1977, as the imaging technology landscape evolved with Savin's introduction of the 770 copier, Precision Roller adapted by developing polyester foam rollers, becoming one of the few manufacturers capable of meeting the new demands of liquid copiers. This innovation helped solidify Precision Roller's position in a rapidly changing industry.  The 1980s brought further evolution with the shift to plain paper copiers mass-produced in Japan. Precision Roller was at the forefront, developing silicone fuser rollers and spray-coating Teflon heat rollers. These advancements were crucial for the new fusing processes that became the standard in the industry.  Despite challenges in the 1990s, including competition from Chinese manufacturers, Precision Roller demonstrated remarkable adaptability by transitioning from manufacturing to marketing. By 1997, the company had completely shifted its focus towards providing a comprehensive range of OEM and aftermarket parts and supplies.  Today, Precision Roller stands as a testament to American ingenuity and resilience, continuing to serve thousands of businesses around the globe. "As we celebrate this milestone, we reflect on our journey and the innovations that have propelled us forward," said Brian Kuhlmann, CEO/Founder of Precision Roller. "We are committed to continuing our tradition of excellence and adapting to the ever-changing needs of our customers."  We invite all our partners, customers, and the community to join us in celebrating this significant milestone. Precision Roller looks forward to building on its legacy of quality and service in the years to come.
