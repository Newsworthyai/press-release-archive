# 4 Key Ingredients to Fight Wrinkles and Revitalize Your Skin

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ESTHELIVE, a leading home care aesthetic brand, introduces a new standard in skincare by combining dermatology's finest ingredients with cutting-edge aesthetics. Each product is carefully formulated with advanced, effective ingredients designed to preserve youth and beauty, offering a superior skincare experience, drop by drop.  The focus of ESTHELIVE is on the power of natural beauty. Products are crafted to enhance the skin's inherent radiance, using only the highest quality ingredients supported by scientific research. These thoughtfully designed products ensure that skin's natural glow is enhanced without compromise.  According to the latest research from the U.S. Wrinkle Research Institute, approximately 74% of wrinkles that occur before menopause are caused by external factors such as continuous external stimuli, UV exposure, and smoking, rather than aging. The institute has categorized wrinkles into four stages: 'temporary wrinkles, cumulative wrinkles, permanent wrinkles, and aging-related wrinkles,' providing specific definitions and effective management methods for each stage.  The 4 Stages of Wrinkles: Causes and Features Wrinkles develop in four stages, each with distinct causes and characteristics. Temporary wrinkles are caused by repetitive facial expressions, posture, or habits, and while they initially disappear, they can become permanent over time. Cumulative wrinkles occur when temporary wrinkles become ingrained due to repeated facial movements and environmental factors such as UV exposure and smoking, which damage collagen and elastin, reducing skin elasticity. If not managed, they can progress to permanent wrinkles, which are deeply etched into the skin due to continuous damage and require professional treatments like lasers or fillers. Lastly, aging-related wrinkles result from natural aging processes, including decreased collagen production and skin elasticity, typically appearing as fine lines on areas like the face, neck, and hands. These can be managed with appropriate skincare and treatments.  Wrinkle Rehab Ingredients: A New Approach to Prevention The skincare industry is increasingly focusing on an innovative approach called "wrinkle rehabilitation" for preventing and improving wrinkles. Previously used in burn treatment and surgical tissue regeneration, protein repair ingredients like PDRN, 4GF, high-purity Bakuchiol (99%), and ultra-low molecular collagen are now being applied to wrinkle rehabilitation, offering a new paradigm in wrinkle treatment. PDRN promotes the regeneration of damaged skin cells and has anti-inflammatory effects, 4GF stimulates collagen production to improve skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles, high-purity Bakuchiol serves as a retinol alternative, enhancing collagen and elasticity while being safe for sensitive skin, and ultra-low molecular collagen enhances moisture absorption and prevents wrinkles. These ingredients are especially effective in the early stages of wrinkle development, such as with temporary and cumulative wrinkles, providing excellent results when applied before wrinkles progress to the permanent stage.  The Rise of Wrinkle Rehabilitation Products A team of researchers, in collaboration with the American Wrinkle Research Institute, analyzed 132 wrinkle ampoules sold worldwide and selected 25 products containing at least two wrinkle rehabilitation ingredients (PDRN, 4GF, high-purity Bakuchiol, and ultra-low molecular collagen). Among these products, Asian brands were found to have a relatively smaller representation. This suggests that the Asian skincare industry remains largely focused on cosmetic beauty. However, with increasing interest in wrinkle rehabilitation within the Asian market, the demand and supply of related products are anticipated to grow steadily.
