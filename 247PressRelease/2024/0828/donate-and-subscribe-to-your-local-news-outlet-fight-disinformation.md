# Donate and Subscribe to your Local News Outlet Fight Disinformation

SACRAMENTO, CA, August 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tired of established media outlets not covering issues specific to your area? Then there are places that cover local stories that are a direct concern in your area. By donating or subscribing to your local news outlet directly, the readers will ensure that there is reliable news and less political propaganda hitting Mayoral, Councils on the municipal levels, State Legislatures, Congress and Governors elections during these polarizing times in addition to the Presidential elections.  Voters are vulnerable to fall for political propaganda where there is no access to reliable news outlets or their local newspaper is on a paywall due to their financial concerns. We need to ensure that local news outlets are not on a paywall and there is reliable access for citizens to be well informed about the candidates on the state, county and city levels in the 2024 elections.  When making a donation with your local news outlet you can trust that your contribution is going to a great cause and making a positive impact. According to Jeff Jarvis a journalism Professor at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in an August 2024 CNN interview.  "Paradoxically, one of the largest local news deserts in America is New York. That's why The City was started," "The New York Times is not a local newspaper anymore, The [New York] Post is [Rupert] Murdoch's pulpit, The [New York Daily] News tries to be the Daily Mail."   If news deserts can exist in New York City of all places due to established local newspapers spending more time on national issues and not so much on local issues, then consider how it affects suburbs and small towns in other parts of the country where representation is either little stories or not represented at all. Sharing your donation on social media platforms is also highly encouraged, as it raises awareness and inspires others to contribute.   By participating in this initiative, readers will ensure that democracy, free speech and reliable information prevails during times of uncertainty on the local levels.
