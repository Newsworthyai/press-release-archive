# Hardison & Cochran Offers Free Magnets with Important Reminder: Look for Motorcycles

RALEIGH, NC, August 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hardison & Cochran Attorneys at Law is promoting motorcycle safety in North Carolina by giving away free magnets reminding drivers to keep alert for motorcycles.  The bumper sticker-style magnets contain the simple safety message "Look for Motorcycles." Many motorcycle accidents occur each year because automobile and truck drivers are not vigilant enough about checking for approaching motorcycles and cause crashes by overlooking them.   The personal injury attorneys at Hardison & Cochran have seen too many motorcyclists seriously injured in entirely preventable collisions. They could have been avoided if other drivers had been more alert for motorcycles. The motorcycle magnet giveaway campaign aims to raise awareness of the importance of sharing the road.  Motorcycle Safety in North Carolina  North Carolina had more than 3,700 crashes involving motorcycles in a recent year, including 2,869 involving injuries to motorcyclists and 206 fatalities, according to the N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles. Many of those were avoidable accidents caused by the carelessness or inattention of other drivers.  Ride a Motorcycle? Stay Visible!  Since motorcycles are smaller in size and have a narrow profile, they are easy to overlook in traffic. Motorcyclists can increase their safety and visibility by using their headlights at all times, wearing brightly colored reflective clothing, and avoiding riding in the blind spots of other vehicles.  The 9" x 3" bumper sticker magnets come in three colors — yellow, blue, and pink — while supplies last. If the color you selected is unavailable, you will receive an email with other options. The bumper sticker magnets are free to North Carolina residents aged 18 and older.
