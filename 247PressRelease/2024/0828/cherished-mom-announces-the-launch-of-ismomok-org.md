# Cherished Mom Announces the Launch of IsMomOK.org

KNOXVILLE, TN, August 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cherished Mom, a renowned nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the landscape of Maternal Mental Health, is proud to announce the launch of IsMomOK.org, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at providing essential support and resources for pregnant and postpartum women, with a specific focus on addressing maternal suicide and mortality.  Maternal suicide is an alarming public health issue and the second most common cause of death during the postnatal period. Maternal Mental Health Conditions account for almost 23% of pregnancy-related deaths, and 80% of pregnancy-related deaths are determined to be preventable. Through IsMomOK.org, Cherished Mom aims to raise awareness about this critical issue to address and prevent maternal suicide and its devastating impact on families.  Through IsMomOK.org, Cherished Mom aims to create a safe and nurturing space for mothers to access valuable information, connect with a supportive community, and find the resources they need to seek help and support. The platform offers educational materials, expert advice, personal stories, and resources for families experiencing perinatal mental health crises, with a dedicated focus on addressing maternal suicide and mortality prevention.  Founder and Executive Director of Cherished Mom, Kristina Dulaney, RN, PHM-C, expressed her enthusiasm about the launch and the potential impact IsMomOK.org can have on maternal mental health, particularly in addressing maternal suicide and its devastating consequences. "Through my own lived experience, I have a God-given passion to share and change the landscape around these conversations. Maternal suicide has become a critical issue that deserves more attention. We recognize the urgent need for the discussion of maternal suicide and hope to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and ultimately save lives."  IsMomOK.org is set to fill a critical void in maternal mental health support, addressing the leading cause of death in pregnant women and new mothers in the United States by providing a user-friendly interface, evidence-based information, and a supportive community. Cherished Mom hopes to reduce the stigma associated with maternal mental health, address the urgent issue of maternal suicide and mortality, and empower women to seek the care and support they need.  As part of the is MOM ok? Campaign, we will be hosting a Cherished Mom Butterfly Release Memorial event on Friday, September 20th, 2024, to remember and honor those lives lost to maternal suicide and highlight the devastating impact of this critical issue on families. This event aims to symbolize transformation, hope, and the need for support in the face of these challenges.  Cherished Mom invites individuals, organizations, and advocates to visit IsMomOK.org and explore the resources available, with a particular emphasis on understanding and addressing maternal suicide and mortality. Together, we can transform the dialogue around Maternal Mental Health, prevent tragic outcomes, and create a world where every pregnant and postpartum family is embraced, supported, and cherished throughout their unique journey.
