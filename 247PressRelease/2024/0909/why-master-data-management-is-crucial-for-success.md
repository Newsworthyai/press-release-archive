# Why Master Data Management Is Crucial for Success

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, September 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Master Data Management is "the key to getting more from your data," giving organizations a framework to manage exponential data growth in a way that drives insights and strategic advantage. Dave Curtis, Chief Technology Officer at RobobAI, a cutting-edge AI-driven analytics platform revolutionizing how organizations manage their master data, shares how.  Large organizations need a way to link all critical business data to a single point of reference; however, the data is often incorrect or incomplete. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help address these deficiencies at scale to give businesses high-quality, trusted, and compliant data to serve as the foundation of many business-critical scenarios, Curtis says, including:  • Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): 84% of CEOs are concerned about the integrity of the data on which they base their decisions. MDM ensures accurate and consistent data for optimum ERP migration. • AI Readiness: Data completeness and accuracy is a foundation of AI. MDM provides accuracy to support success of AI initiatives. • Increased Regulatory Compliance, Decreased Risk: MDM helps maintain compliance, mitigate risk, facilitate stringent reporting, and avoid penalties. • Cost Savings: High inflation has increased the need for astute financial management. Organizations need a clear 360° view of spend data to optimize supply chain strategy. MDM cleanses, classifies, and consolidates data, allowing organizations to quickly implement cost reduction strategies.  "To make valuable, effective, business-critical decisions, you need a trusted single view of your data with clear master data governance to ensure it stays that way," Curtis says. "RobobAI is committed to delivering measurable results to help organizations boost their bottom line and fuel long-term growth."
