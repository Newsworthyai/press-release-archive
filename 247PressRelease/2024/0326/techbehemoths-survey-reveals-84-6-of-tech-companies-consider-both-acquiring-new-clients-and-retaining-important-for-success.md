LONDON, ENGLAND, March 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TechBehemoths, the leading platform for matching projects with IT companies, conducted a global survey from February 20-28, 2024 to explore IT companies' strategies and challenges in acquiring and retaining clients.   Over 1,020 IT companies in 60 countries participated, with CEOs, founders, and sales executives represented. 53.30% of the companies have more than 10 years of experience suggesting the data reflects real-world client interactions.  Most respondents (84.6%) consider both acquiring new clients and retaining existing ones to be extremely important for success.   The survey showed that the most effective channels for attracting new customers are networks and referrals (85.2%), as people are more likely to trust a business recommended by someone they know, followed by partnerships and collaborations (62.70%). Content marketing (49.70%) and online advertising (46.70%) are also important strategies.  Among the top metrics used by IT companies to evaluate their client acquisition efforts are: - Conversion Rate from Leads to Clients (74%) - Number of Leads Generated (63.3%) - Return on Investment (ROI) (48%) - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) (44.4%)  When it comes to the challenges IT companies face in attracting new customers, survey respondents agreed that lead generation is the most difficult at nearly 60%. Converting leads into paying clients (50.3%), identifying ideal target clients (36.7%), and standing out from the competition (34.3%) are also significant challenges.  Survey data reveals that many IT companies invest less than €5,000 in client acquisition activities, with the most common range being €1,000 - €5,000 (42.6%). Most companies convert leads into paying clients within 1-3 months (59.7%).  Most customers (51.4%) stay with IT companies for 1 to 3 years, indicating success in retaining a large portion of the customer base.   Why do clients leave? Here are the top reasons identified in the survey: - Changed Business Needs (63.9%) - Found a Cheaper Provider (50.0%) - Poor Communication/Relationship (13.6%)  According to the survey, the main challenge in client retention is competition (50.3%), followed by client churn (32.5%), difficulty dealing with client complaints (20.1%), and failure to meet expectations (18.3%).  While client acquisition is important, retaining clients is equally important.  The companies surveyed highlight the top strategies for client satisfaction and retention: - Providing Consistent, High-Quality Work (84%) - Proactive Communication and Exceeding Expectations (76.3%) - Excellent Customer Service (74.3%)  TechBehemoths is a German-made platform that connects projects with reputable IT service providers from all over the world.
