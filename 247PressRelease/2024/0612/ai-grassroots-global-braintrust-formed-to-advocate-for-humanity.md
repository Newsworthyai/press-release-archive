# AI Grassroots Global BrainTrust Formed to Advocate for Humanity

SEATTLE, WA, June 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Global BrainTrust, a grassroots coalition representing diversity of voice in the human response to artificial intelligence's expansive adoption, has been formed to offer a human-centered perspective as the technology's rapid and unrestrained rollout continues.   The Global BrainTrust represents viewpoints from industry and community leaders not just from different backgrounds, but from different countries as well, in an attempt to expand representation of the 'human' response. The brain trust actively involves GenX, who are currently on the periphery of the debate, especially as the transformation will redefine their future.  "Artificial intelligence impacts everyone and will transform our entire world. Our aim is that viewpoints of the rest of the world are taken into consideration, not just those of technologists and policymakers in the west," said Sana Bagersh, Founder of the Global Braintrust. "We want to make sure more people, at a grassroots level, have a voice, and that they are heard. Here we are talking about people of different ethnicities, religions, ages and socio-economic backgrounds."   She added," The AI debate has to date been dominated by technologists who dazzle us with the incredible transformative power of artificial intelligence, and also by policymakers who appear to be struggling to make sense of it, let alone regulate it. We deeply appreciate the tremendous positive impact of AI on human life, but our aim with The Global BrainTrust is to present the voice 'on the ground', of 'Everyman' and 'Everywoman,' so to speak, who are being affected by it in their lives. We know such representation is ambitious and may not be entirely possible, but we intend to come as close as we can to doing it."  This brain trust aims to share its insights through statements, and communiques, about the issues being experienced at the user level, to help those in power address the concerns of the consortium, and mitigate the risks associated with AI's rapid deployment and proliferation.  Professor Ahmed Banafa, the Global Braintrust's Senior Technology Advisor explained further: "This is an early phase advocacy mobilization, a great mechanism for drawing input from a wide range of stakeholders, from different nations, that include technologists, practitioners, developers, policymakers, builders, shapers, artists, designers, and community champions. This diverse assembly of voices and perspectives will grow in size to reinforce representation. It will hopefully be a great resource to access balanced and diverse viewpoints on critical AI-related issues impacting people."  He explained that the coalition will share user-side insights that prioritize human welfare and societal benefit. Among the topics currently under review by the brain trust include the potential damage caused by AI hallucinations to businesses and individuals; the breadth and impact of imminent job losses; early warnings that AI could potentially deceive humans; and the erratic regulatory approach to safeguard AI.  Gabriella Kohlberg, Government Development Economics Advisor at the Global BrainTrust said, "We are humanity, and we want to ensure our world will prosper on this transformative journey towards a better future that we will hopefully leave to our children. This brain trust is intended to leverage the collective wisdom of users, and our aim is to provide valuable input to public and private sector stakeholders."  Katherine Shulock, Public Health Advisor at the Global BrainTrust added, "The BrainTrust invites collaboration. Through engaging community-minded leaders from diverse fields and industries, we hope to bring a human-centered and equity lens to critical conversations around AI today."
