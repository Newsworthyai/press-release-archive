# Rogue Space Systems Begins Work Under First Delivery Orders of R2C2

LACONIA, NH, October 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rogue Space Systems is excited to announce its continued support to the United States Space Force (USSF) with our recent award under the Space Rapid Capabilities Office's (Space RCO) Rapid Resilient Command and Control (R2C2) program. This award underscores Rogue Space Systems' commitment to advancing space operations and logistics capabilities.   The Space RCO announced the first $12 million in delivery orders to 20 small businesses for the R2C2 program, a USSF program co-led by Space RCO and Space Systems Command. The R2C2 program aims to modernize USSF satellite operations by leveraging technical innovation and harnessing expertise from a diverse set of partners. R2C2 is developing a cloud-based satellite operations infrastructure, providing military operators with enhanced flexibility to command and reposition satellites in response to emerging challenges. This infrastructure will support critical ground segment software for dynamic USSF satellites, enabling key functions such as Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) planning, antenna brokering, telemetry, tracking, and command.   Rogue Space Systems is among the twenty small businesses awarded a portion of the initial $12 million in delivery orders intended to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the R2C2 architecture and support the onboarding of essential personnel. Jon Beam, CEO of Rogue Space Systems, stated "We are honored to be part of the R2C2 program and contribute to the modernization of Space Force logistical operations. This opportunity allows us to showcase our innovative solutions and collaborate with other industry leaders to enhance the responsiveness of satellite operations."   Furthermore, Rogue Space Systems is eager to collaborate with other small businesses participating in the R2C2 program. These collaborations foster dynamic exchanges of ideas and expertise, driving innovation and ensuring the successful modernization of satellite logistical operations. By working together, we are able to leverage our collective strengths to meet the evolving needs of the U.S. Space Force and our allies.   The R2C2 program's Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle is capped at $1 billion over a five-to-seven-year ordering period. These initial delivery orders are designed to position small businesses like Rogue Space Systems to compete for future contracts aimed at advancing Space Force operations.   Rogue Space Systems has a strong track record of supporting the U.S. Space Force, including multiple Phase II contracts awarded through the AFWERX Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) program. Those awards support the development of innovative solutions that address the most pressing challenges in space operations.   Rogue Space Systems is committed to advancing in-space logistics technologies for a more sustainable and adaptable environment in space. By integrating our transformative concepts with the R2C2 infrastructure and associated delivery orders, we aim to provide comprehensive support for the emerging needs of space operations.
