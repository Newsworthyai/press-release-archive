# 'Harry Potter,' 'It' Prequel 'Welcome to Derry,' and Other Major Warner Bros. Series to Be Branded as HBO Originals Instead of Max

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Moving forward, major Warner Bros. tentpole projects like the highly anticipated It prequel Welcome to Derry, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and the recently announced Lanterns will be branded as HBO originals.  This decision marks a reversal from the previous strategy that placed big Warner Bros. IP under the Max banner—a strategy that was first implemented when Casey Bloys took on responsibility for Max Content in 2020. "We initially felt it made sense to differentiate HBO from Max by using Warner Bros. IP as the defining factor," Bloys explained. "But as we began producing these shows, it became clear that they shared the same level of quality, talent, and narrative approach as traditional HBO programming."  The branding change also arrives amid critics questioning the distinction between HBO and Max originals. The rebranding is intended to lean into the premium reputation that HBO has cultivated while avoiding the perception that certain shows might be considered fake "HBO" content. For shows like Lanterns, which features contributions from writers like Chris Mundy (True Detective) and Damon Lindelof (The Leftovers, Watchmen), the HBO label ensures that these series align with audience expectations. Even Peter Safran, co-head of DC Studios, described Lanterns as "a huge HBO-quality event" in the vein of True Detective. Given these connections, Casey Bloys and his team determined that the HBO label was more appropriate.  The change will officially take effect with shows launching in 2025. For now, projects like The Penguin and Dune: Prophecy, set to premiere later this year, will retain their Max Originals designation due to pre-existing international licensing agreements. "Although The Penguin would be a natural fit as an HBO Original, we're already too far along in the process for that change," Bloys noted.  The differentiation also safeguards against the confusion surrounding which platform new content should be associated with, especially as Max continues to develop series with a more traditional broadcast feel. Shows like the upcoming medical drama The Pitt and crime thriller Duster are expected to cater to formats that might not fit the HBO brand, ensuring a clear distinction in programming strategy.  Interestingly, the decision comes after rumors of secret meetings between content executives exploring how to streamline Warner Bros. Discovery's extensive library across both platforms. As the changes roll out, critics are curious to see whether this move will improve content consistency or if it could lead to new issues, such as confusion over fake "HBO" content masquerading as premium originals.  The rebranding also has practical benefits for HBO's linear network. With shows like Harry Potter and Lanterns now under the HBO umbrella, they'll be guaranteed a run on the linear channel as well as streaming on Max. This could lead to a more robust schedule in 2025 and beyond, with Bloys hinting at the possibility of expanding original programming slots on both Sundays and Thursdays.  Despite the branding adjustments, Casey Bloys emphasized that the streaming landscape remains complex. "We're in a time of rapid change in television, and we're trying to find the best approach for a world where streaming dominates," he said. "This shift in branding is about leaning into what viewers already assume—that these big, cinematic shows are HBO Originals."  While some consumers might not even notice the change, the realignment reflects a strategic effort to reinforce HBO's premium reputation while maintaining flexibility for Max's content offerings. As Bloys put it, "This gives us the freedom to experiment with creative formats on Max without the weight of HBO's expectations."
