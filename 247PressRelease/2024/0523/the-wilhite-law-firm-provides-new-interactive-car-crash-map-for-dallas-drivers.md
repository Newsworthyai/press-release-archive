DALLAS, TX, May 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Local news sources report that Dallas has the highest traffic fatality rate of the 10 largest U.S. cities. To combat this high risk, The Wilhite Law Firm has compiled Dallas car crash data into an interactive map pinpointing the city's danger zones. Users can filter by fatal wrecks, distracted driving collisions, and drunk driving accidents over a five-year period. The map displays 170 Dallas car accidents in the most recently documented year, many occurring along the city's major highways.  The page also analyzes which age groups cause the most accidents in Dallas and the common contributing factors. Data shows that the majority of the collisions were caused by speeding, followed by driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and distracted driving. Additional resources listed on the page offer a deeper delve into Texas car accident statistics, risk factors, and safety tips.  With the knowledge of where and why Dallas car crashes often happen, drivers can anticipate what behaviors to watch for and which areas to avoid. They may take a different route to avoid a danger zone or know to practice defensive driving when a vehicle starts swerving. While even the most careful motorists cannot avoid all collisions, the DFW law firm believes their new interactive webpage offers viewers valuable information to understand safety risks while driving in the city.
