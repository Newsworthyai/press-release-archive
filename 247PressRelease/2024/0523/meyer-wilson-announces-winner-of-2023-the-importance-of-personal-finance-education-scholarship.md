# Meyer Wilson Announces Winner of 2023 The Importance of Personal Finance Education Scholarship

COLUMBUS, OH, May 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The team at Meyer Wilson is thrilled to announce that Jace Beard of Lubbock, Texas, is the winner of the firm's 2023 Importance of Personal Finance Education Scholarship. Jace, 21, is currently studying business management at Texas Tech University and expects to graduate in May 2025.  Jace takes classes in marketing, financial management, and entrepreneurship. He's also pursuing a handful of extra-curricular certifications from which he hopes to gain the knowledge he needs to navigate today's business world.   The Importance of Personal Finance Education Scholarship prompts applicants to write a 500- to 1,000-word essay on how financial literacy can empower people and foster long-term financial stability. In his essay, Jace remarked that his interest in financial education began in 5th grade when he sold candy to his fellow classmates.  His fascination with finances carried through his adolescent years, leading him to research financial instruments, invest in stocks, and open his first credit account at age 18. Now, he plans to start a company that promotes entrepreneurship and financial literacy.  Jace sees a future where individuals and families have the knowledge and tools they need to achieve financial stability and live the lives they've always dreamed of living. He believes that financial literacy isn't just about analyzing numbers and making profits but also fostering an ability to think critically and plan for the future.  Jace sums up his views on financial literacy by describing it as "a powerful tool that empowers individuals to navigate the complex world of finance with confidence and clarity." This type of literacy helps people avoid impulse purchases and, instead, plan for their futures.  Driven by this mindset, Jace aims to teach people how to make informed financial decisions and lead them down a path to financial stability. In addition to empowering individuals with information, he also wants his company to offer a scholarship to help students learn more about the ins and outs of the financial world.  When asked how winning the Importance of Financial Education Scholarship will impact his life, Jace remarked that it will not only reduce the financial burden of higher education but also solidify his commitment to his education and make the world a better place.  Upon graduating, Jace plans to get his master's in Business Administration and eventually work in the financial sector or for a leading global corporation. Either way, he is still committed to starting his own organization with the goal of empowering communities through financial education and philanthropy.
