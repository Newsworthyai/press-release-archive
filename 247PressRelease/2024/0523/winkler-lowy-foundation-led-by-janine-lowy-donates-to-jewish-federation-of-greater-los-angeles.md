# Winkler Lowy Foundation, Led by Janine Lowy, Donates to Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Winkler Lowy Foundation, led by Janine Lowy, announced today that it has once again contributed to the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles (JFEDLA) at the Lion of Judah level to support its mission to uplift and enrich the Los Angeles Jewish community.   The Winkler Lowy Foundation's donation, which will be deployed throughout 2024, will help bolster JFEDLA's efforts to fight antisemitism at a time when anti-Jewish sentiment has skyrocketed in Los Angeles and across the nation.   "While we are always stalwart supporters of JFEDLA, the gift carried additional importance this year. Jewish communities across the United States have experienced alarming antisemitism, hate, and discrimination in the wake of the October 7th terror attacks in Israel," said Janine Winkler Lowy. "As one of the largest Jewish communities in the Diaspora, it is critical that we lead in this moment. This gift will help the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles to do so."   JFEDLA acts on shared values to create shared, joyful and connected Jewish life in Los Angeles, Israel, and around the world. Through a wide range of programs and activities—from facilitating Jewish summer camp experiences to sending delegations to Israel—JFEDLA combats antisemitism and hate, addresses poverty, inspires Jewish joy, builds bridges with Los Angeles' diverse communities, develops leaders, and supports emerging Jewish leaders.   The Winkler Lowy Foundation's founder, Janine Winkler Lowy, is a communal activist and philanthropist whose commitment to supporting the Los Angeles Jewish community has spanned decades. Lowy has participated in the creation of many noteworthy programs in the Los Angeles community, including the Master of Arts in Teaching at American Jewish University and the Education Twinning Program at The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles.
