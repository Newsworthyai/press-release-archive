# Minglecon Challenges Global Markets with 'Minglebot AI': Gamified Education for Learning AI & Computational Thinking

SEONGNAM, KOREA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Minglecon (CEO Helen Jean) is gaining attention for developing innovative content that integrates AI technology in a gamified manner.  Combining cutting-edge technologies like computer vision and machine learning with essential elements of computational thinking like pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms, Minglecon is helping users collaborate effectively with AI while developing problem-solving skills. This technological integration strengthens the ability to collaborate with AI across education and industries.  Minglecon's flagship AI education platform, Minglebot AI, is available on various platforms, including unplugged kits, mobile apps, and PC software. Minglebot AI goes beyond a simple coding education tool, supporting both Korean and English languages, and can be applied to a wide range of areas, from basic AI education and software programming to gamified automotive programs and dementia prevention programs.  Targeting mainly adolescents, Minglecon's education programs collaborate with schools, special education institutions, and home education franchises, boasting scalability through its B2B2C revenue model. These educational solutions offer applications that enhance problem-solving skills in everyday life and AI collaboration abilities, providing learners with a more practical and engaging experience.  Minglecon is also making strides in the global market. After successfully securing a content licensing export contract with Indonesia, the company is exploring further opportunities for content licensing in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Dubai. Through this global expansion, Minglecon is meeting the worldwide demand for AI education and solidifying its position as a pioneer in innovative technology integration and educational content.  Helen Jean, CEO of Minglecon, emphasized, "In today's AI-driven world, developing the ability to collaborate with AI is essential. However, many educational tools focus too much on coding and programming languages, lacking in broader computational thinking and AI concept learning."  Minglecon developed gamified AI educational content to fill this market gap and help users easily understand and apply AI technologies.  Minglecon is expanding partnerships in various sectors to promote growth through collaboration. Through hardware partnerships, Minglebot AI content is bundled with devices like tablets, and through educational partnerships, AI curricula are integrated into schools and academic institutions. The company also works with telecom companies to link Minglebot AI subscription services with mobile data plans.  Based in Pangyo Techno Valley, Minglecon benefits from collaborations and networking with numerous IT companies. The area provides an ideal environment for fostering innovation, offering infrastructure, digital equipment, and advanced meeting facilities, allowing Minglecon to maximize efficiency and create new business opportunities.  Minglecon anticipates growing demand for gamified AI content in industries beyond youth education, including healthcare and the automotive sector. In particular, AI educational content as a tool for dementia prevention holds great potential in healthcare, expanding the use of AI for problem-solving and personal development in daily life.  Minglecon aims to help users enhance productivity, creativity, and problem-solving skills by merging AI with computational thinking. The company also aims to break down barriers between technology and education and establish a strong presence in the global AI education market.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi-do's representative innovation cluster, Pangyo Techno Valley was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).  Furthermore, the Techno Valley Innovation Division of the Gyeonggi-do Business & Science Accelerator (GBSA) holds monthly events such as the Pangyo Evening Meet-Up, Pan-Pan Day, and the Pangyo Startup Investment Exchange "In-Best Pangyo" to maximize the value of Pangyo Techno Valley.
