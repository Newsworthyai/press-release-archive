# KAILASA Temples Worldwide Celebrate Navaratri: Reviving the Sacred Rituals of Sanatana Hindu Dharma

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The United States of KAILASA, established and revived by The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (THE SPH) Bhagavan Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam, is the First Sovereign State for Hindus. Its mission is to preserve and promote the indigenous sciences, traditions, and rituals of Sanatana Hindu Dharma, fostering an enlightened world based on peace, unity, and spiritual growth.  The global Navaratri celebrations connected devotees across continents, serving as a testament to KAILASA's mission to enrich spiritual lives through the revival of timeless rituals.  Highlights of KAILASA's Navaratri Celebrations:  Chandi Homam:  As a central ritual of Navaratri, the Chandi Homam was conducted in accordance with both the Shaivagamas and Shaktagamas. This fire ritual, revived by SPH Bhagavan Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam, invoked the blessings of Devi, seeking the removal of obstacles, the fulfillment of desires, and the manifestation of prosperity. The sacred fire—Agni—serves as a bridge between the devotee and the Cosmic Mother, allowing participants to experience deep spiritual rejuvenation and protection.  Sri Sri Durga Puja: The Sri Sri Durga Puja is rooted in the Shaktagamas, Tantras, and Brihad Nadikeshwara Purana, and has been revered for centuries as a regal offering to Durga Devi. This powerful ritual was revived during Navaratri to honor the Cosmic Mother's protection and grace. Traditionally performed by Hindu rulers, the Durga Puja is seen as a royal homage, bringing blessings of abundance and removing negativity, and inspiring collective prosperity and devotion.  Devi Mahatmyam Parayanam: The daily recitation of the Devi Mahatmyam—a scripture from the Markandeya Purana—formed a significant aspect of KAILASA's Navaratri rituals. Known for its deep phonetic significance, simply listening to these sacred chants can lead to spiritual transformation. The sacred scripture brings the divine narrative of Devi's greatness to life, allowing participants to experience her blessings and enlightenment.  Global Participation and Devotion  The Navaratri celebrations at KAILASA temples were streamed live, with more than 72 live streams sharing the grandeur and spirit of the festival. These live broadcasts received viewership from across the globe, with over 1 million people participating virtually in the celebrations. Dignitaries, royalty, and statesmen from 140 countries attended the virtual events, demonstrating the widespread reach and resonance of KAILASA's spiritual mission.  At more than 50 KAILASA temples worldwide, hundreds of varieties of traditional food offerings were made, and thousands of devotees gathered in person to celebrate the Cosmic Mother with devotion and gratitude. The spiritual power and unity experienced during these celebrations serve as a reminder of the enduring relevance of ancient rituals in today's world.
