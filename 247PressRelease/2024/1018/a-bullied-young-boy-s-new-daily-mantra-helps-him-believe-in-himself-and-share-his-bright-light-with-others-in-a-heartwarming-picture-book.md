# A bullied young boy's new daily mantra helps him believe in himself and share his bright light with others in a heartwarming picture book

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With a background as an educational consultant, global speaker on personal development, and pastor, children's author Eugene Hamilton has had a unique perspective on viewing first-hand the challenges that youth face today. By teaching through storytelling, Hamilton reaches young readers with a strong message of empowerment and self-belief in his vibrant new picture book, GO, GROW, GLOW.  In Hamilton's heartwarming story, Tony is a boy who has studied very hard for his spelling test in class the next day. But the following morning on the bus ride to school, the kids are rambunctious and noisy and become annoyed when Tony won't join in their antics. Worse, Tony is dejected when his best friend uses the opportunity to reveal to everyone a hurtful secret about Tony's family life. Upset and distracted, Tony understandably bombs on his test. When he confides in his teacher, she explains a set of actions that will help him through tough times: Go boldly—always think positive and believe in himself. Grow broadly—be open to learning new things. Glow brightly—never forget he is a bright light in the world.  When asked about his inspiration for writing GO, GROW, GLOW, Hamilton says, "While talking to children around the country I kept encountering kids having challenges with things that I went through and conquered when I was their age. So I decided to use my story to help them with insight and tools to manage." Families and educators of young children will delight in this impactful social emotional learning story that provides a valuable life lesson for kids to get through difficult occasions, be resilient, and remain a good friend  Related Link: https://www.eugenejhamilton.org
