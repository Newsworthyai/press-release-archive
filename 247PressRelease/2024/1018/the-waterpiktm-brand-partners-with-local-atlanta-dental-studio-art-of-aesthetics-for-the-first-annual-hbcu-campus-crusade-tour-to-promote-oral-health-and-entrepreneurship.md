ATLANTA, GA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The WATERPIK brand, a leader in innovative oral health products and technology, is partnering with Atlanta's Art of Aesthetics Dental Studio (AOA), founded by Dr. Quodarrius "Dr. Q" Toney to launch the HBCU Campus Crusade - a tour dedicated to promoting oral health, entrepreneurship, and educational opportunities among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) while empowering students with scholarship funding to support their college careers.   During the HBCU Campus Crusade, the WATERPIK brand and Dr. Q will host interactive sessions at educational tents where students can receive complimentary WATERPIK devices, Essentials Co. Toothbrushes, and other oral health essentials. Dr. Q and the AOA team will additionally offer live product demonstrations, tips on maintaining oral health, and guidance on accessing dental care resources—even for students without dental insurance.  To further invest in the next generation of dental professionals, the WATERPIK brand will award two scholarships to Howard University: $20,000 for a dental student and $5,000 to support Howard University's dental program.  "The WATERPIK brand is dedicated to making dental care more accessible and empowering underserved communities with the tools and knowledge necessary to maintain healthy smiles," says Charisse Winecki, WATERPIK VP of Global Marketing. "It was a no-brainer for our team to partner with Dr. Q and his team to embark on the HBCU Campus Crusade where we look forward to providing students with effective solutions to manage their dental care and continue to inspire the next generation of leaders in oral health."  "Oral hygiene is an essential part of overall health, yet college students often overlook it due to time constraints and limited access to care," says Dr. Q. "As an HBCU graduate myself, I'm well aware of the challenges that these students face and want to equip them with the tools and education they deserve to make informed decisions about their oral health. Through this partnership with the WATERPIK brand, my team and I can significantly impact these campuses."  In addition to the giveaways and demonstrations, a panel discussion will be hosted at each campus, featuring experts on oral health, entrepreneurship for minorities, and pre-dental career pathways. These panels aim to empower students with information on navigating healthcare challenges, starting businesses, and preparing for dental careers. The discussions will also provide opportunities for student engagement, including Q&A sessions and product giveaways throughout the event.
