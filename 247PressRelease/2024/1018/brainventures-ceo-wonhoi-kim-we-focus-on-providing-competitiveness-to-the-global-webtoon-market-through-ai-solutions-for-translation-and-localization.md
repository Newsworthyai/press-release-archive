# BrainVentures CEO Wonhoi Kim: "We Focus on Providing Competitiveness to the Global Webtoon Market through AI Solutions for Translation and Localization."

SEONGNAM, KOREA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BrainVentures (CEO Wonhoi Kim), founded in 2020, is gaining attention in the global webtoon market by providing an innovative AI-based solution that automates the webtoon translation and typesetting process. The company has developed the 'Webtoon OCR-Translation-Typesetting AI Solution,' which combines webtoon image recognition, automatic translation, and automatic typesetting. This solution significantly reduces the high costs and time involved in traditional manual translation and typesetting processes.  In 2024, with support from the Global Startup Commercialization Support Program, BrainVentures is accelerating its entry into the Japanese and North American markets. Based in Pangyo, the company is developing technology and expanding its market reach. BrainVentures' primary clients include webtoon creators and distributors, collaborating with major Korean platforms such as KT StoryWiz and Woongjin ThinkBig and Japanese companies like Funguild and Foom Tokyo. The company focuses on providing global competitiveness in the webtoon market, where translation and localization are essential.  BrainVentures' AI solution has a distinct competitive edge. It automatically recognizes text in webtoon images and provides natural translations that match the characters' personalities and the context, preserving the original emotional tone for readers. Its OCR technology is especially effective at recognizing onomatopoeia, which is common in webtoons, solving quality issues often seen in traditional translation methods. The solution also automates the typesetting of the translated text into high-resolution images, significantly speeding up the process. As a result, clients can reduce costs by over 60% while improving content quality.  The solution has attracted significant interest in Japan and North America. In Japan, where the webtoon market is rapidly growing, demand for translation and localization is increasing. BrainVentures has completed several proof-of-concept (PoC) projects with major production companies and established a local subsidiary in Japan. In North America, where the webtoon fanbase is expanding, BrainVentures is strengthening its collaborations with local platforms and publishers in preparation for full-scale market entry.  BrainVentures is a leading startup based in Pangyo, Korea's Silicon Valley, where IT and advanced technology companies are concentrated. The area fosters active collaboration and business networking. BrainVentures benefits from the region's proximity to Seoul and other major cities in the capital area, making communication with global clients and partners more convenient.  The company has set various goals for 2024 to expand its presence in global markets. BrainVentures plans to build on its successful PoC projects and strengthen partnerships with local companies in Japan. It aims to accelerate market entry in North America through strategic alliances with major webtoon platforms and publishers. The company also plans to continue advancing its AI solution and position itself as a leader in the global webtoon industry.  BrainVentures is rapidly expanding its presence in the global webtoon market by revolutionizing its translation and typesetting process with AI technology. Growing within the innovative environment of Pangyo, the startup aims to lead the future of the webtoon industry through continuous technological advancement and market expansion.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T).
