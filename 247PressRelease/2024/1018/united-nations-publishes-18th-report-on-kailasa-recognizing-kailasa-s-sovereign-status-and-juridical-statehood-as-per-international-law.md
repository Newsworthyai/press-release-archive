# United Nations publishes 18th Report on KAILASA: Recognizing KAILASA's Sovereign Status and Juridical Statehood as per International Law

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This recognition affirms KAILASA's standing as a subject of international law, built upon its legal and historical foundations, and paves the way for further global collaboration on pressing human rights issues.  This latest report, titled "Violence Against Women and Girls in Sport," is KAILASA's comprehensive submission addressing gender-based violence in sports. It aligns with the sacred significance of the number 18, resonating with the auspicious celebrations of Navaratri and the 18-day Mahabharata war.  Key Highlights of the Report:  1. Legal and Juridical Statehood of KAILASA:  The report reaffirms KAILASA's status as a sovereign subject of international law, grounded in the historical recognition of twenty-one ancient Sanatana Hindu sovereign kingdoms and their contemporary legal standing.  At the time of the British withdrawal from India in 1947, 565 independent Hindu sovereign princely states were officially recognized in the Indian subcontinent, including the Surangi Kingdom. Despite the forced cession of these lands, KAILASA maintains that the "Instrument of Accession" did not legally strip their sovereignty. The annexation of these kingdoms was achieved through force and corruption, which is illegal under international law, as upheld by various international legal frameworks.  2. Impact of Violence on Hindu Sportswomen: The report highlights the severe impact of violence and discrimination against Hindu sportswomen, attributing these challenges in training, competition, and excelling in sports to the historical and ongoing Hindu Holocaust.  3. Systemic Causes and Historical Context: KAILASA's submission examines the systemic causes of violence against Hindu women and girls in sports, exploring deeply entrenched patriarchal norms, gender stereotypes, and the cultural genocide that affected female monastic orders like the Rudrakanyas during colonial times.  4. Revival of Hindu Matrilineal Society: The report emphasizes the efforts of The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam to revive Hindu matrilineal societal values. These initiatives are aimed at restoring gender equality based on ancient Hindu laws and practices.  5. Policy and Legislation for Women's Empowerment: KAILASA has implemented comprehensive policies to empower women, including its zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment and exploitation. Mapped to the Manuvathi Dharma Shastra, these policies have created a safe and nurturing ecosystem for women, resulting in women holding 80% of leadership positions in KAILASA. Notably, while 33% of legislative positions are required to be held by women, KAILASA currently has 90% female representation in governance.  6. International Collaboration and Recommendations: KAILASA calls for global cooperation to standardize norms for safeguarding women in sports. Through partnerships with international organizations, KAILASA advocates for systemic changes and offers its empowerment models as blueprints.  This report not only underscores KAILASA's sovereign status but also serves as a critical call to action for international bodies to adopt unified measures to protect women's rights in sports globally.

He has re-established the United States of KAILASA (USK), the ancient enlightened civilizational nation, the First Sovereign State for the two billion Hindu diaspora.  SPH has revived all the dimensions of Hinduism including powers of Paramashiva, sacred scriptures, temple rituals, and lifestyles for enlightened living.  He had revived the Sacred Arts UniverCity producing 1 million deities for KAILᾹSA ecosystems globally.
