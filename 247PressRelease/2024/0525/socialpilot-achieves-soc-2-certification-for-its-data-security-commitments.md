# SocialPilot Achieves SOC 2 Certification for Its Data Security Commitments

LEWES, DE, May 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SocialPilot, a leading social media management platform, announced today its achievement of the SOC 2 Type 2 certification. Attained after a comprehensive auditing process, this certification validates that SocialPilot has been thoroughly assessed and meets the stringent security practices aimed at protecting customer data against evolving global cyber threats.   The SOC 2 Type 2 audit and certification underscores the proactive approach of SocialPilot in employing sophisticated security measures that align with international standards. These security controls ensure reliable access to accounts and product features, safeguard financial information, and protect users' privacy. The certification verifies the service commitments and system requirements of SocialPilot with controls such as role-specific access management, data encryption, incident response, and ongoing monitoring.   "Earning SOC 2 Type 2 certification is a key milestone for SocialPilot in its continuous efforts towards robust data protection," said Jimit Bagadiya, Co-Founder and CEO of SocialPilot. "Our customers trust us with their most critical data, and this certification reaffirms our dedication to protecting that trust through ongoing, rigorous security practices," he added.   The Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2 certification is an independent validation conducted by a licensed auditor. It confirms that a company's security controls meet rigorous security and privacy standards set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The SOC 2 Type 2 audit validates a company's security controls and procedures for managing customer data over a period of around 11 months.   Solidifying the position of SocialPilot as a trusted social media management tool, the SOC 2 Type 2 compliance signifies that the company has established and consistently adheres to the applicable trust services principlesâ€”security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These principles serve as an important benchmark in data protection within the industry and greatly help earn the trust of customers with regard to security protocols.   Furthermore, the certification assures that the internal controls, infrastructure, software, data, policies, and processes of the company are thoroughly reviewed based on the judgement criteria or standards set in accordance with AICPA. Also, SocialPilot leverages a leading security compliance monitoring platform to proactively track and report on the health of its information security program, as validated during the audit process.   "At SocialPilot, we take the security of our customer's data very seriously and proactively take measures to protect their information. The SOC 2 Type 2 certification assures everyone using SocialPilot that their data is managed under stringent, verified security measures," stated Tejas Mehta, Co-Founder of SocialPilot. He further added, "This certification reflects our systematic approach and consistent efforts to not only meet but exceed industry standards in security with utmost responsibility and continuous vigilance."  SocialPilot views SOC 2 Type 2 certification as just the starting point in its journey to becoming the most secure social media management platform. It recently upgraded its security features to prepare for the highly secure two-factor authentication login and SSO implementation. In fact, this initiative is a part of the plan to transform SocialPilot from a single product to a more expansive platform, bringing an interconnected suite of products available under one unified ecosystem.   A well-designed platform with robust security features greatly contributes to maintaining compliance by allowing for better user access control and potentially streamlining security protocols. Furthermore, integrating various tools within one system infrastructure helps standardize the security measures across the entire ecosystem. This streamlined approach simplifies security audits and potentially reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.   Moving ahead, the SOC 2 Type 2 compliance will be reviewed annually to ensure that the SocialPilot platform remains committed to top-tier security measures in its operations.  SocialPilot is an AI-driven social media management and automation platform trusted by thousands of marketers, influencers, and digital entrepreneurs worldwide.
