# VENTURE X® EXPANDS PRESENCE IN DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE, TN WITH STRATEGIC ACQUISITION

NASHVILLE, TN, March 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Venture X®, a leading provider of flexible office spaces, is thrilled to announce its venture into the vibrant city of Nashville, TN, with the acquisition of the former Serendipity Labs space at 159 4th Avenue in downtown Nashville. The newly acquired space, spanning approximately 27,000 square feet across three floors, is housed in a historic building dating back to 1925—one of the first true office buildings in downtown Nashville.  This historic building played a pivotal role in the post-World War II economic boom in Nashville. Its repositioning was a catalyst that set off a domino effect, contributing significantly to the city's growth. Venture X recognizes the unique story behind this building and aims to integrate its rich history into the design and marketing of the space.  To transform the space into a state-of-the-art coworking environment, Venture X is committing to approximately $1,300,000 in upgrades that will redefine the current buildout. The result will be a workspace that stands apart from its predecessor, Serendipity Labs, showcasing the brand's commitment to providing modern, innovative, and upscale office solutions.  Situated just one block from the historic Ryman Auditorium and two blocks from Broadway, the location offers a prime spot in the heart of downtown Nashville. This strategic placement aligns with Venture X's mission to provide professionals with convenient and inspiring workspaces in sought-after locations.  Landlords and brokers instrumental in selecting the location and negotiating the agreement include Dustin Ballard, President/Head of Leasing with Tricera Capital (Landlord), along with Dan Bauchiero, Shelby Hall, and John Mudgett with Foundry Commercial, and Giovanni Palavicini, President/Founder of Fronteras (representing Venture X).  Richie Parsons, the Venture X franchise owner, expressed excitement about Venture X's expansion into Nashville, stating, "We are so excited to bring Venture X to Nashville. We will be remodeling a historic building downtown and plan to have offices available in late summer. The solid economic growth in Nashville has created a demand for professional, up-scale office space, and Venture X is the perfect solution to meet this demand. More details will be coming soon."  With a target opening in mid-summer, Venture X looks forward to contributing to Nashville's thriving business community and offering professionals a dynamic and collaborative workspace.
