# KAILASA's Nithyananda Hindu University hosts Transformative Session at the 79th UN General Assembly Science Summit

NEW YORK, NY, September 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This session, telecast live to millions of participants around the world, focused on "Methodologies and Strategies for Sustainable Mental Health: A Holistic Mind-Body Approach with Quantitative and Qualitative Studies."   Attendees were introduced to KNHU's groundbreaking research and transformative practices aimed at improving mental health through a holistic and sustainable approach, aligning with the global goal of promoting well-being as outlined by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The UNGA Science Summit, organized by the International Science Council (ISC) and its partners, brings together scientists, policymakers, and thought leaders to discuss the critical role of science in achieving the UN SDGs. This year's summit features over 400 sessions with 1,700 speakers, addressing a wide array of global challenges.  KNHU's Session Highlights:  KNHU's session presented evidence-based strategies integrating ancient Hindu sciences with modern research to address mental health challenges.  Key speakers and topics included:  Dr. Peter Bloomfield, MD, MPH (KNHU Research Department) (https://new.nithyanandahinduuniversity.org/): Presented groundbreaking research on SPH Nithyananda Paramashivam's influence on mental health through mind-body-consciousness studies.   He detailed the cellular and psychological impacts of the Inner Awakening® and Paramashivoham℠ programs, which includes Nithyananda Yoga℠, pranayama, meditation, among other Hindu sciences.   Studies demonstrated significant physiological benefits, such as the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and the enhancement of stem cells and anti-aging markers (GATA-2 and Bmi1).   Additionally, Dr. Bloomfield shared research showing elevated telomerase activity and a 967% increase in mitochondrial metabolism among participants.  Dr. Bloomfield also emphasized the neuroscientific studies on SPH Nithyananda Paramashivam, showing how SPH's brainwave activity is significantly different from that of an average person.   PET scans and qEEG studies revealed heightened frontal lobe activity and unique brain patterns while performing spiritual healing, activating higher consciousness states, and demonstrating control over brainwave activity at will.   SPH's extraordinary ability to shift between states of consciousness has been a focal point in studies, demonstrating tangible mental health benefits​.  Dr. Shachie Aranke, MD (Neurologist): Focused on the neuroscientific effects of yoga, meditation, and diet on brain structure and function.   Dr. Aranke presented findings on how yoga and meditation lead to significant changes in brain physiology, enhancing areas related to emotional regulation, decision-making, and memory.   Functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that meditation activates critical regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are involved in attention, emotional control, and stress regulation.  Dr. Sandeep Pandove, MD (Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center) explained the role of the gut-brain axis in mental health, emphasizing how the microbiome influences serotonin and dopamine production.   Dr. Pandove presented evidence supporting the link between a whole food, plant-based diet and improvements in mental health.   Dr. Nirmala Sivaji, MD (Nithyananda Meditation Academy) presented on KAILASA's holistic approach, integrating Hindu sciences revived by SPH such as Nirahara Samyama℠ to promote overall brain health​.  Dr. Muktha Ananda (Artificial Intelligence Expert, KNHU): Demonstrated the innovative AI-driven platform, Nithyananda.AI (https://ask.nithyananda.ai/), designed to address mental health issues like anxiety and loneliness.   This conversational AI offers real-time support for spiritual and emotional challenges, serving as an accessible mental health tool​.  Dr. Prema Kothandaraman, MD, FACOG (OB/Gyn, Urogynecologist, Pelvic Reconstructive Surgeon, Women's Health Excellence Center): Delivered an impactful session on women's mental health, highlighting the significant challenges faced by women due to hormonal changes, societal pressures, and gender-based violence.   Dr. Kothandaraman emphasized the high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and trauma among women, who are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with mental health issues.   She presented KAILASA's efforts to tackle these issues, such as providing free healthcare services to women, including allopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, and spiritual counseling, contributing over $10 billion USD to women's health initiatives​.  Dr. Kothandaraman also highlighted SPH's unique contributions in empowering women through the revival of ancient Hindu practices, such as mother worship and Hindu matrilineal system.   Dr. Kothandaraman quoted SPH:  "Women by their very DNA, have the capacity and groundedness to hold an ecosystem or a family or a team or a community together. Women have their own intuitive intelligence in the field of keeping something very stable, keeping it together and making it functional. So Hinduism creates an ecosystem for every woman to manifest that possibility, that power."  - SPH, Presidential Address on November 7, 2021  Paramashiva declares in Atharvaveda 7.38.4 & 12.3.52, "Women should take part in the legislative chambers and put their views on forefront."   She remarked that women hold 80% of leadership positions in KAILASA. While KAILASA's policy stipulates that 33% of legislative positions should be held by women, currently, women make up 90% of the governance in KAILASA.  These initiatives, inspired by SPH Nithyananda Paramashivam, are designed to address the root causes of mental health issues by fostering an ecosystem that supports gender equality, social prominence, and spiritual well-being.  Dr. Shailesh Patel, MD (Psychiatrist, KAILASA LA): Presented research from Nithyananda Gurukul℠, focusing on whole-brain activation and enhanced intellectual development in the Gurukul children.   Dr. Patel highlighted studies demonstrating superior visual-motor skills, cognitive function, and IQ development among Gurukul students.   Utilizing the Bender-Gestalt II test and Slosson IQ test, these studies revealed that many students exhibit intellectual maturity several years ahead of their chronological age, with average intellectual ages up to six years ahead​.  This session underscored KNHU's commitment to blending ancient Hindu wisdom with contemporary science to offer innovative, sustainable solutions for mental health.
