SAN FRANSISCO, CA, September 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Poets&Quants presents an annual comprehensive list of the 100 highest-funded MBA startups of 2024. Done each year since 2014, MBA-founded startups were solicited from the world's best MBA programs to compile a list based on a single metric: how much funding a startup has raised in the past five years, the most accessible apples-to-apples comparison.   To qualify for this year's list, a startup had to be founded between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023. The startup must also have had at least one MBA founder during that same timeframe. Funding amounts were cross-checked on Crunchbase.com. Numbers verified at the time of reporting were used to compile the list.  The top 10 are below:   1	Capchase - INSEAD 2	Tamara - London Business School 3	Kyte - UC Berkeley Haas 4	Merama - Harvard Business School 5	Ajaib - Stanford GSB 6	MBX Biosciences - UCLA Anderson 7	AtoB - UC Berkeley Haas 8	Pathway Homes - UCLA Anderson 9	Forum Brand - Stanford GSB 10	Arc Technologies - Stanford GSB  To qualify for this year's list, a startup had to be founded between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, and must have at least one MBA founder during that same timeframe.
