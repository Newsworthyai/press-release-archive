BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA, September 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On the 18th, the 'HWPL 9.18 Peace World Conference 10th Anniversary Ceremony' was held and will have continuous celebrations in 40 countries around the world, including Korea. At Ceremony, the achievements of activities over the past 10 years were commemorated.   Under the theme of "Building a World Peace Community through Interregional Cooperation," the ceremony focused on reviewing HWPL's peace-building efforts and exploring future global harmony strategies.  The domestic event began with a progress report by the moderator at the Cheongpyeong Peace Training Center in Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do, followed by a video showing the peace activities of the past 10 years, followed by a commemorative speech by Lee Man-hee, CEO of Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), and IPYG Director Young-min Jeong. IWPG CEO Un Hyun-sook continued with her commemorative speech. In addition, the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) signing ceremony and appointment certificate awarding ceremony took place, a key highlight of the event.   Currently, the number of members of HWPL reaches 500,000 in 170 countries, an achievement accumulated through continuous peace activities over the past 10 years.  HWPL's various activities are highly regarded around the world for promoting peace awareness and contributing to the advancement of understanding between cultures and religions.  In particular, it has played a pivotal role in the international peace movement, such as concluding a civil peace agreement in the Philippines, and is attracting attention as a new model for resolving conflicts between countries, an example of presenting a practical strategy for establishing international peace.  Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) is an international NGO affiliated with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the Office of Public Information. It held the first World Conference on Peace in Seoul in 2014.  At that time, more than 1,000 leaders from politicians, ministers, religious, community leaders and from all walks of life and from over 140 countries attended and discussed various issues. Topics included conflict resolution, inter-religious harmony, and legal mechanisms to ensure sustainable peace.  Chairman Lee Man-hee of HWPL has always pointed out that division of religion caused tremendous loss of life, emphasizing that religions must take the lead in dialogue and understanding.   "We must work together to create a world of peace and leave it as a legacy for future generations. This is to fulfill our mission as a light that brings life to the global village. Only through love and peace can the world become one," he said.  At last year's commemorative ceremony, HWPL CEO Lee Man-hee said, "The victims of war are innocent young people," and emphasised, "We must pass on a peaceful global village as a legacy to our descendants."  At this ceremony, which marks the 10th anniversary, the peace project achievements of the past 10 years will be reviewed and future plans will be discussed. In particular, we plan to focus on building a 'regional network' to establish a peace strategy tailored to the characteristics of each region. Through this, each region plans to actively respond to threats to peace and focus its efforts on gathering common capabilities.  The core of this event is the establishment of a 'regional network', a peace strategy tailored to the characteristics of each region and to seek ways to jointly respond to factors that threaten peace. To this end, sessions targeting various classes of people will be held around the world.  At the commemoration ceremony, a launch ceremony and MOU signing was held for a public campaign called 'Together: Connecting the Republic of Korea.' This campaign is co-hosted by about 230 civic groups and is scheduled to expand nationwide. The goal is to inherit the spirit of the Saemaul Movement and overcome social conflict and promote harmony led by citizens.  Kim Dong-hee, head of the campaign promotion division, said, "With this commemorative ceremony, nationwide campaign activities will be carried out more actively. We plan to strengthen cooperation with local governments through customized activities tailored to the characteristics of each region." This campaign looks to connect generations and diverse cultures.  HWPL's ceremony is expected to be an important milestone in international efforts for world peace. Attention is being paid to whether a more practical and sustainable peace-building plan can be derived through strengthening inter-regional cooperation and expanding citizen participation.  Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) is an international peace NGO founded for global peace and cessation of war.  HWPL is a non-governmental organization registered with the Seoul Metropolitan Government of the Republic of Korea. It is associated with the UN Department of Global Communications (DGC) and in Special Consultative Status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In keeping with the spirit of the Declaration of World Peace, that HWPL aims to achieve world peace through the heavenly culture and restore the global community with light, we are carrying out peace activities all across the world.  With our partner group, the International Women's Peace Group (IWPG), and our affiliate group, the International Peace Youth Group (IPYG), HWPL is leading an international peace movement with leaders in all walks of life without being limited by national, cultural, or ideological boundaries.
