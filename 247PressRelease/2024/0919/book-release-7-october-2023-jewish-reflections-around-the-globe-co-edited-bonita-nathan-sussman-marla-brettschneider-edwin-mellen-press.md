NEW YORK, NY, September 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 7 October 2023 offers a broad spectrum of perspectives on how the Jewish community, in Israel and beyond, is processing the impact of the attack and its aftermath. From personal reflections on grief and survival to analyses of geopolitical dynamics and their implications for Jewish identity, the book serves as a significant resource for scholars, activists, and anyone interested in global Jewish affairs.  About the Book This book includes a wide range of contributors, from academics and activists to rabbis and community leaders, including voices from right to left and in between. The reflections grapple with themes of antisemitism, Zionism, genocide, war, pacifism, and the complexities and diversity of global Jewish identity. Together, these voices create a multi-faceted dialogue and provide documentation regarding the profound consequences of the October 7 events.  With the one-year anniversary of the attacks fast approaching, 7 October 2023, Jewish Reflections Around the Globe offers a critical opportunity to engage with these issues and foster meaningful dialogue. Journalists, academics, students, and community leaders will find a combination of deeply personal and fresh analysis.

We seek to create an inclusive Jewish world. Founded in 1994, we support isolated, emerging, and returning Jewish communities around the world. Some are discovering Judaism for the first time, others reinvigorating a forgotten practice, but all have experienced some kind of disconnection from global Jewry.  We raise awareness and support to assist these groups with their desire to learn more about Judaism and connect with Jews beyond their community. The connections we forge – through education, research, networking, fundraising, sustainable development, and publications – help "all of us" to enrich our Jewish lives.  Our backgrounds are diverse in terms of location and denomination, but we are bound by a common commitment to developing Judaism and Jewish life for all who seek this for themselves. You can meet our team here and learn about our partner communities here. We encourage you to join "all of us" by getting involved with Kulanu!
