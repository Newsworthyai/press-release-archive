# Black Girl Vitamins Launches Meno-Chill, an Innovative Menopause Supplement

CHICAGO, IL, September 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Black Girl Vitamins is innovating menopause care with the launch of Meno-Chill, a unique holistic supplement that supports the common and overlooked challenges women face. The holistic vitamin is formulated with traditional herbs and modern nutrients to support bone health, hormonal balance, overall vitality, mood stability, gut health, and digestive support which is often overlooked in products on the market. Black Girl Vitamins' customers highly requested a solution to meet their specific needs during this journey and the much-anticipated vitamin launched on September 6th on the brand's website.   Meno-Chill offers a natural solution to menopause and perimenopause management in which symptoms are experienced earlier and stronger in Black women than in other groups and often misunderstood by physicians leading to discrepancies in care and long-term negative health effects. Each vitamin is developed with a proprietary blend of science-backed and clinically-studied ingredients.   Why it Matters: Black Women and Menopause  -Black Women experience menopause earlier, with an average onset of 49, compared to 51 in other groups. -50% more likely than other races to report hot flashes. -More likely to experience incident depression over 7 years of follow-up. -Less likely to self-report sleep problems but more likely to have objectively measured poor sleep quality. -More likely to meet criteria for recommending preventive intervention and more likely to have untreated hypertension but less likely to use statins, cholesterol-reducing medication. -22% more likely to report having substantial limitations in physical functioning.  Dr. Bryanne Standifer-Barrett MD and Black Girl Vitamins Advisor shares, "Menopause is natural, but it doesn't have to be uncomfortable. Meno-Chill is designed to empower you through this stage."
