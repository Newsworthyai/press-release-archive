VANCOUVER, BC, December 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Phonedemic: The Unrelenting Loss of Humanity's Ability to Truly Connect (ISBN 9780968631263) by Ana Miranda is set to launch on December 18, 2024, and will be available for purchase on Amazon.ca and Amazon.com. Published by 3 Wolves Press, the book offers a poignant exploration of device addiction and its consequences on modern human connection.  Ana Miranda dives into the uncharted waters of what she calls the "Heads-Down Generation," (in which any generation may qualify). Shining a light on the growing dependency on digital devices and its profound impact on our ability to truly connect with one another. Woven through her investigation is the author's own compelling life story—a journey through struggle, peril, and alcoholism that ultimately led her to faith, self-discovery, and an acute awareness of how modern technology has altered the human experience.  "Everywhere I turned, I saw the pervasive grip of these devices," says Ana. "Having emerged from the global pandemic, which fundamentally altered our lives, I felt compelled to address the deeper societal shift—a dependency so entrenched it disconnects us from ourselves, others, and the world around us. Phonedemic came to me like a vision, demanding to be written as a wake-up call to humanity."  A Call to Reconnect  Ana's insights extend beyond critique. She challenges readers to consider the broader implications of our "scroll culture," offering hope and practical advice for breaking free from device dependency. By advocating for authentic, face-to-face exchanges and embracing life's raw realities, Phonedemic inspires readers to reclaim genuine connection in a world increasingly driven by screens.  Personal Story Meets Universal Truth  What sets Phonedemic apart is Ana's candidness. Through humour and vulnerability, she intertwines the broader narrative of device addiction with her personal journey and experience with addiction to mind and mood altering influences. From navigating her darkest struggles to finding light and faith, the author illustrates the transformative power of rediscovering what truly matters.  "Phonedemic is more than just a book about technology—it is a reflection on humanity's need for presence, authenticity, and true connection," Ana explains.  "It is my hope that this book inspires readers to step away from their devices and rediscover the irreplaceable beauty of real life—the love, joy, pain, and at times turmoil that shapes our shared human experience."
