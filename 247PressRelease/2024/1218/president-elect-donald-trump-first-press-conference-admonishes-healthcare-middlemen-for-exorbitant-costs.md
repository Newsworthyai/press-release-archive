# President-Elect Donald Trump First Press Conference Admonishes Healthcare Middlemen for Exorbitant Costs

KANSAS CITY, MO, December 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Medical Supply Chain LLC frees Healthcare markets from exorbitant single sources middlemen with intelligent automated procurement networks. Utilizing new AI-driven interfaces, health system managers can now factually verify in real time that their institution is getting the most competitive priced supplies from any distributor on any product to meet President Elect Donald Trump's healthcare advisory team's future standards to be set by the Department of Government Efficiency to be led by Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X; Vivek Ramaswamy, founder of Roivant Sciences; and Brad Smith, founder and CEO of the healthcare investment firm Russell Street Ventures. Now medical supply procurement managers will be able to easily meet the increased efficiency targets that will be set for all hospitals receiving Medicare or government subsidized insurance reimbursements in the post "Healthcare Middlemen" and Group Purchasing Organization "single source contract" era.  Medical Supply Chain has revolutionized healthcare procurement for global healthcare markets by sourcing multiple medical equipment and supplies manufacturers for every need.  Thanks to AI-driven tech and a super user-friendly platform, we make it a breeze for healthcare markets to connect directly with manufacturers from all over the world, including U.S. manufacturers. Imagine searching for medical products and having several manufacturers pop up on your screen like magic!  Behind the user-friendly interface, Medical Supply Chain is the first intelligent automated sourcing platform that creates new specific networks in real time to optimize the fulfillment of each request to the sole advantage of the individual health system making the request. Medical Supply Chain now utilizes Artificial Intelligence in combination with simultaneous real time data from worldwide producers of FDA approved materials, manufacturers of subcomponents, devices and instruments, along with thousands of separate consumables used each day by every hospital worldwide to coordinate the production, shipment, importation, and quality conformance acceptance of each health system request.  Your health system's needs share demand timing, sourcing and movement commonalities with other health systems, and the manufacturers they rely on. An individual manager self-sourcing a product is unable to coordinate all of these factors to create the best potential value for their health system. Similarly, a purchasing group or middlemen operating for its own profitability is still limited on what advantages or efficiencies it can realize for its sole source contracted vendors. The purchasing group inevitably increases costs for its health system customers above the rate of inflation. The transformative efficiency of matching all the advantages in production can only be reached by forming a unique network of trusted parties to produce, transport, warehouse, and supply the health system at the time of the health system's request.  When President Elect Trump's Department of Government Efficiency reviews Healthcare with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Healthcare Entrepreneur Brad Smith; the money Medicare , Medicaid and government subsidized private insurance firms pay to Health systems will be tied to increasing requirements of documenting that the percentage of compensation for actual patient care and not payments to 'Healthcare Middlemen" utilizing kickbacks, and anti-competitive tying contracts to extort far more profit from the medical supplies North American hospitals purchase than the manufacturers of those same supplies receive. Medical Supply Chain will enable hospital procurement managers utilizing AI-driven interfaces to monitor and evaluate those expenditures in real time to make sure their institution is not being victimized by soul source contract extortion schemes. Medical Supply Chain is committed to ending the artificial inflation of hospital supply costs that has plagued the industry for the last 30 years.
