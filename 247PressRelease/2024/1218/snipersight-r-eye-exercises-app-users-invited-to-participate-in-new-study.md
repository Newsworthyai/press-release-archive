# SniperSight®: Eye Exercises App Users Invited to Participate in New Study

CINCINNATI, OH, December 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr Bates' eye exercises were first trialed 100 years ago, as he and his associates recorded hundreds of case studies to prove the efficacy of his method; a century later, it's time for an update. The aim of the new study is to attract one of the largest samples of users ever and have them record their findings on the Apple App Store review platform, possibly using AI to assist with tabulation.   The method, originally devised in the early 20th century by Dr William Horatio Bates, consists of simple eye exercises designed to improve vision naturally. Today, the exercises can also be used to alleviate the eyestrain and distress caused by hours spent staring at screens. SniperSight: Eye Exercises is an exceptional app, based on Dr. Bates' method, that can help people who use glasses or contacts to regain clear, effective vision, even allowing some to avoid the need for glasses altogether.   To help with this study, users just need to download the app, SniperSight: Eye Exercises, from the App Store, use it for three months or more, and report their findings on the Apple App Store review platform, including their responses to the following: Condition (near-sightedness, far-sightedness, etc.) Age Gender History (how long they have been using glasses) Measurement of current vision (20/..) Treatment (which SniperSight techniques were used) Results (what happened)  The app offers a pattern of exercises designed for almost all kinds of eye conditions and the interface is robust and user-friendly. It is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. The exercises work for any age group and include clear step-by-step instructions with visuals.  The SniperSight app is available worldwide exclusively through the App Store in the Lifestyle section. Additionally, please visit our site for a free eye exercise chart and further information.
