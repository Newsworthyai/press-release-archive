# Longtime Resident and Family Lawyer Greg Steele Announces Candidacy for Anderson City Council District 6 Seat

ANDERSON, SC, March 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Born and raised in Linley Park as a fourth-generation Andersonian, Steele aims to leverage his strong ties to the area, professional experience, and family's legacy of public service to represent his hometown neighborhood and surrounding districts.   If elected, he pledges to manage future development responsibly, reinforce safe neighborhoods, and bring Andersonians together around shared spaces - upholding the city's character while advancing towards sustainable growth.  "From a young age, my parents showed me the importance of giving back to the community that raised you," said Steele. "Now, I want to take that passion for service to the city council level to ensure Anderson retains the small-town values and personality our citizens hold dear while welcoming appropriate progress."  Steele first got interested in law and governance by watching his father, esteemed County Magistrate Judge William P. Steele Jr., preside over courtroom proceedings as a kid. He also credits his mother and Judge Steele's head paralegal, Marietta, for emphasizing empathy, ethics, and treating people right. After graduating from Oakwood Christian School, Steele attended Covenant College in Georgia, where a political science class made running for office seem within reach.  Returning home always stuck out as a priority for the candidate, who opened Steele Family Law, LLC to help Andersonians with some of life's toughest situations. The firm focuses on personal, attentive counsel and legal support related to family law, estate planning/administration - and now, a campaign grounded in understanding the day-to-day impacts of municipal policy.  Top Priorities for Steele's City Council Agenda  If elected as District 6's council representative, Steele outlines several key issues he will champion:  Neighborhood Integrity: As Anderson attracts more residents and undergoes measured development, preserving the character of areas like Linley Park remains crucial. Steele wants controlled, sustainable growth that respects communities.  Public Safety: Expanding parks and economic opportunities must occur in tandem with strong policing and emergency response. Steele will fight for properly equipping those who keep Anderson safe.  Community Bonds: Steele supports initiatives like the Linley Park Renovation Project that create inclusive gathering spots, bring Andersonians together, and cultivate local pride.  Responsiveness: Understanding neighborhood priorities requires maintaining an open-door policy. Steele promises to solicit constituent opinions before advocating positions on the council.  "Ultimately, I'll take the approach I use with clients to the city level – truly listening to needs, seeking creative solutions together, and fighting tenaciously for the community," Steele remarked. "I'm ready to serve my hometown to build on the special place it is while navigating toward a bright future."  Steele's Longstanding Anderson Roots  Between his personal background, professional experience, and family reputation, Steele enters his first political race with robust roots in the tight-knit Anderson community.  As a longtime Linley Park resident and business owner located downtown, Steele interacts with locals daily to understand their goals for the city's growth. By concentrating his legal practice on family law matters with sensitive implications, he's honed the empathy and discretion constituents seek in a representative.  His mother, Marietta, leads administrative efforts for their church, demonstrating active community participation. And his well-regarded father set an example of effectively resolving courtroom conflicts. This demonstrates to voters that Steele comes from a family dedicated to serving the Anderson community.
