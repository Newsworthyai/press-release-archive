# Iron+Steel Threads: New Hockey Brand Brining the Game To More Communities

ROCKFORD, IL, March 09, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Iron+Steel Threads, a rising star in hockey apparel, was started by a small hockey-loving family in Northern Illinois. The company has rapidly made a name for itself in the hockey community since its founding in 2023. Beyond crafting a diverse range of hockey-inspired products, Iron+Steel Threads is committed to making the sport more accessible to families, supporting youth hockey, and fostering a community with a deep passion for the game.  "Our brand is more than just apparel; it's a celebration of hockey's spirit and a tool to bring the game closer to families and youth across the nation," said Kevin Lucca, the founder of Iron+Steel Threads. "We understand the financial challenges associated with hockey and are dedicated to helping to alleviate these through our support of teams and organizations that share our vision."  Iron+Steel Threads is making strides towards its mission by donating a portion of every sale to help reduce player fees and create more opportunities for youth to play hockey. The brand's original product range, which began with graphic t-shirts and now boasts over 150 designs, is designed to allow fans, players, and families to proudly express their love for the game.  In 2024, Iron+Steel Threads launched its Made in the USA collection, emphasizing products designed, printed, and manufactured in the United States. This initiative assures quality and aligns with the brand's goal of expanding product categories that support its mission.  Iron+Steel Threads has significantly contributed to various organizations, including the Wade Warriors, Seattle Women's Hockey Club, The Valkyrie Initiative, and the Walled Lake United Hockey Boosters. These contributions have supported events such as the Puck Place Market Tournament, the largest women's hockey tournament in the Pacific Northwest, and a charity cancer hockey game that raised significant funds for The Rainbow Connection.  "Our efforts have touched many, from enabling girls to connect and create memories through hockey to supporting community events that unite people for a cause. Each donation, each event, and each product sold brings us closer to a world where hockey is within everyone's reach," Kevin added.  As Iron+Steel Threads grows, its commitment to the hockey community and its mission remains steadfast. The brand is determined to become a household name among hockey families, enabling even more significant impact through donations and events that celebrate and support the game.
