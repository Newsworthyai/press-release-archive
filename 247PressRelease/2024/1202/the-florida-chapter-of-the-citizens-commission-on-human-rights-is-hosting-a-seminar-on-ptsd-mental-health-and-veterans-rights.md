# The Florida chapter of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights is Hosting a Seminar on PTSD, Mental Health and Veterans Rights

CLEARWATER, FL, December 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Please join the Florida chapter of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) for a complimentary seminar on what our veterans face today and the often misdirected and sometimes dangerous solutions that are offered up as help.  During the event, attendees will be introduced to a CCHR documentary titled, "The Hidden Enemy: Inside Psychiatry's Covert Agenda", which exposes concerning information on the diagnosis and treatment of veterans.  "Today, some 80% of vets labeled with PTSD receive psychotropic drugs; 89% of these are given antidepressants, with 34% treated with antipsychotics—drugs so powerful they were intended only for the most seriously disturbed. Since 2001, there have been more than 150 worldwide drug regulatory warnings and studies issued about the dangerous—often lethal effects—of psychotropic drugs such as these."  "Part of the rapid expansion of PTSD is due to increasingly lax diagnostic standards. Since the induction of PTSD into psychiatry's book of mental disorders, definitions of what qualifies to have PTSD have become softer, wider and much more general."  "Today, PTSD isn't just diagnosed in soldiers and veterans for war trauma, but has become a catch-all label for anyone—military or civilian—experiencing an adverse reaction to a distressing event. The result: tens of millions of people with a perfectly normal response to disaster now being diagnosed with a mental disorder."  Held in the Florida headquarters for CCHR located at 109 N. Fort Harrison Ave in Clearwater, the event is open to the general public, refreshments will be served and reservations are recommended.  The event is scheduled for Saturday, December 7th from 2:00pm to 3:00pm at 109 N. Fort Harrison Ave., Clearwater. Please call (800) 782-2878 to reserve a spot or register by clicking here.

The Florida chapter of CCHR is an award-winning nonprofit in the area of mental health human rights and government relations. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
