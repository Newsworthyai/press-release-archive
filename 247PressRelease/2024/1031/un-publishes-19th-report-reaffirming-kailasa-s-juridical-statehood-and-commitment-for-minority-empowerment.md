# UN publishes 19th Report reaffirming KAILASA's juridical statehood and commitment for minority empowerment

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This landmark report underscores KAILASA's commitment to fostering inclusive governance models and promoting frameworks that empower minority groups globally.  The United States of KAILASA, a sovereign nation with juridical statehood, represents the vision of THE SPH (Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism) Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, who, along with the citizens of KAILASA, has endured significant persecution for advocating for religious and cultural minority rights.   Despite facing immense challenges, KAILASA remains resolute in its mission to protect and uplift vulnerable communities, ensuring that their voices are heard, and their identities respected.  This latest report delves into institutional strategies that enhance minority resilience, build communal solidarity, and foster equitable political inclusion.   With a focus on aligning these policies with global human rights frameworks, KAILASA's recommendations offer a pathway for member states to implement sustainable and effective protections for minorities.   The report also sheds light on KAILASA's steadfast commitment to preserving cultural heritage and advancing human rights for all minority communities.  KAILASA's dedication to this mission extends to active engagement with the United Nations and international bodies, supporting policy reforms and promoting awareness on minority rights.   By highlighting successful institutional practices, the report serves as a resource for governments and civil society organizations seeking to safeguard the dignity, security, and rights of minorities.
