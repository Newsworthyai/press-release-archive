# ETICAT+: Eco-Friendly Cat Litter Made from Recycled Coffee Grounds, Launching on Kickstarter

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ALFRED PETS, INC, a company that envisions harmony between pets and the environment, is launching its eco-friendly cat litter ETICAT+, made from recycled coffee grounds, through the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  For cats, whose sense of smell is over 40 times more sensitive than humans, maintaining a clean and odor-free indoor space, especially in their litter box, is essential for their health. The most used bentonite litter poses environmental concerns due to the ecological damage caused by bentonite clay mining. Other types of litter, such as tofu, clay, and silica gel, also face limitations in terms of odor control, clumping ability, and litter tracking.  ETICAT+ offers 99.5% odor elimination. The ammonia is naturally absorbed by the fine pores created during the coffee roasting process, with lab data showing that 99.5% of ammonia odor is eliminated within 30 minutes. In addition, ETICAT+ utilizes upcycled pulp by-products to enhance clumping and absorbency, making it a highly effective eco-friendly cat litter.  Through patented processes, the product is 100% decaffeinated, making the product safe for cats. It is also fragrance-free, ensuring it does not irritate their sensitive sense of smell. Compared to other products, ETICAT+ has minimal dust, which helps protect the cat's respiratory system and maintains a clean, hygienic litter box environment. Moreover, ETICAT+ is compatible with other cat litter products, allowing users to mix it with their existing litter to improve odor control and clumping.  ALFRED PETS, INC plans to introduce a subscription service for ETICAT+, where used litter will be collected and recycled into agricultural fertilizer, minimizing waste and promoting a sustainable resource cycle.  The company has already partnered with Healthy Spot as a key distributor in California and has 12 additional partners who share their vision. These partners include 9 nonprofit cat rescue organizations (Spcala, kittyofangels, Sante D'Or, save a kitty, heavenlypets, Kitty Bungalow, National Cat Protection Society, Krazy for Kats, Auburn Valley Humane Society), 2 veterinary hospitals (Angel City Animal Hospital, Melrose Vet), and 1 cat cafe (KitTeaSF). ALFRED PETS, INC has donated ETICAT+ to these partners to help control odor in their facilities, demonstrating the product's effectiveness and committing to ongoing contributions.  The eco-friendly cat litter made from recycled coffee grounds, ETICAT+, will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting from October 31st, 2024.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2115954329/eticat-upcycled-coffee-grounds-cat-litter?ref=61q8sj
