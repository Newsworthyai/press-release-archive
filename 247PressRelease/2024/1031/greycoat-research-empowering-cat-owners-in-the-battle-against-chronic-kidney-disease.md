# Greycoat Research: Empowering Cat Owners in the Battle Against Chronic Kidney Disease

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Since the pandemic, pets have become more than just animals; they've become cherished companions, bringing joy and comfort to our daily lives. But when these beloved family members face a serious health crisis, how far are we willing to go to save them? This question was put to the test for Claire Luvcat, a popular pet vlogger, when her cat TT was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  In the spring of 2019, Claire's YouTube channel, known for sharing the antics of her many cats with over 7 million subscribers, went silent. TT, her beloved grey-coated cat, had been diagnosed with CKD, a condition that affects 68% of cats aged 7 and older. CKD is often referred to as a "silent killer", for by the time symptoms appear, more than 75% of the kidneys are often already irreversibly damaged.  Despite trying every available treatment, TT's condition showed no improvement. Determined to save her young cat, Claire embarked on a journey into the world of veterinary science, much like the parents in the true-story film Lorenzo's Oil. Like the story of the Odone couple's efforts to save their son Lorenzo's life, Claire's quest to save TT was a battle against time.  Though cats and humans live on the same world, the time they experience is worlds apart. Cats age faster than humans, especially during their early years. However, the development of the treatments they need is advancing at the slow pace of human progress. The harsh reality of the pharmaceutical industry further complicate matters. Phrases like "small market" and "low profitability" often loom over the development of treatments for pets.  Claire's relentless search for answers led her to groundbreaking research on AIM proteins at the Institute for AIM Medicine (IAM) in Japan. These proteins have the potential to slow kidney disease progression and improve kidney functions, providing a crucial resource for those seeking cat kidney supplements.  Claire flew to Japan to meet with Dr. Toru Miyazaki, the founder of IAM and a pioneer in AIM protein research. This meeting marked the beginning of a new chapter for TT and many other cats. With the help of IAM, Claire developed the AIM Dr. Toru Protocol, a supplement designed to support kidney health. TT's condition improved significantly, defying the typical three-year survival period for CKD patientsâ€”she remains healthy five years after her diagnosis.  As TT's story spread, other pet owners sought the AIM Dr. Toru Protocol, hoping to learn how to manage cat kidney disease effectively. Claire made the supplement available to the public, along with the Intensive Protocol, which combines key ingredients like resveratrol and quercetin to boost immunity and support kidney functions. These two cat kidney supplements have garnered countless testimonials from cat owners who have witnessed improvements in their pets' health.  Reflecting on her journey, Claire shares, "It's no longer a fight I face alone. Pet owners around the world are standing with us. When we fight for those we love, nothing is impossible." This sentiment underscores the collaborative effort that has emerged in the fight against feline kidney disease.  Claire's journey didn't stop there. She established Greycoat Research, named in honor of TT's grey coat, to focus on advanced feline CKD treatments. This global alliance of experts collaborates with veterinary communities, offering consultation services to pet owners fighting CKD. Today, Claire donates all proceeds from her YouTube channel to further CKD research, advocating for tailored treatments for cats.  As Claire Luvcat and Greycoat Research continue their commitment to advancing feline kidney health, they invite pet owners to join their mission. By supporting research tailored to the unique needs of cats and sharing their experiences, cat owners can contribute to a future filled with hope and better health outcomes for their beloved pets. Together, they can transform the landscape of veterinary medicine and create lasting change in the lives of cats battling kidney disease.
