NEW YORK, NY, October 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As an architecture photographer, Nicole England found that the shoots she enjoyed the most were the ones where dogs were present - nothing lightens the mood like a nonchalant pup. However imposing the architecture, some doggy hijinks can immediately bring an element of sociability and fun. With this in mind, Nicole set about setting up her Instagram, Resident Dog, and now this book, Resident Dog Around the World, which showcases over 25 of the world's most amazing houses, and the dogs that live there.   The photographs showcase incredible, amazing architecture and capture the personality of the idiosyncratic personality of each canine. Take a wander around the world's most stunning homes, from Mexico to Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, with the home pooch as your tour guide.   P&T Interiors features a beautiful award winning house located in Sag Harbor - The Hamptons including Pol Theis' two English bulldogs, Louis and Margot.
