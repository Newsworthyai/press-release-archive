# The Subdued Finale of 'House of the Dragon' Season 2: A Deliberate Choice?

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- While some fans were disappointed, there are reasons why the finale unfolded the way it did, including significant behind-the-scenes challenges that impacted the series.  After a strong debut, House of the Dragon's first season successfully reignited interest in Westeros, offering a fresh perspective on the Targaryens at the peak of their power. However, Season 2 encountered hurdles that left some viewers questioning whether the prequel series could maintain momentum. The season finale, "The Queen Who Ever Was," received mixed reviews, with ratings plummeting to 50% on Rotten Tomatoes and 6.3 on IMDb, marking one of the franchise's lowest points since the infamous final season of Game of Thrones.  A significant factor in the uneven pacing and narrative issues of Season 2 was the disruption caused by behind-the-scenes complications. Reports suggest that the season was initially intended to be longer, with two additional episodes culminating in the epic Battle of the Gullet. This battle, a key moment in the Targaryen civil war, would have provided a more satisfying conclusion. However, the decision to remove the battle, led many fans to desire a more climactic ending to the season. An HBO representative described the episode reduction as "story-driven," though some insiders speculate that budget constraints were a significant factor.  Further complicating matters, the WGA and SAG strikes severely limited the writers' ability to revise the season's trajectory. Showrunner Ryan Condal and writer/executive producer Sara Hess managed the situation as best they could, but the narrative suffered without the flexibility to adjust during filming. Hess explained, "We felt really good about what we had already. So, when the strike happened, we definitely were pencils down."   Despite these challenges, the creative team adhered to the established formula, where penultimate episodes deliver major twists, followed by a finale that sets up future storylines.  Season 2 may have ended on a subdued note, but there's cautious optimism for Season 3. With Casey Bloys and HBO reportedly aiming to return to more explosive storytelling, the series is poised for a potential comeback. The upcoming season is expected to open with two of the biggest battles in the series, setting a dramatic tone that fans have long been waiting for.
