# Fellowship Books Releases Updated Top Seller: Defeating Conservative Republicanism

KINGSMAN, AZ, September 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fellowship Books, a leading publisher of religious and political books, has announced the release of an updated version of their top-selling book, Defeating Conservative Republicanism. This revised edition offers a deeper perspective into the controversial topic of Donald Trump and his economic policy by pointing out that even George H. W. Bush ridiculed the Republican's current "trickle-down theory" as "voodoo economics."  In a recent interview, author and political commentator Eric Demaree made controversial statements about President Donald Trump and his economic policy. He argued: "Reasonable people can look at any third world country and see that if the rich get richer their money does not "trickle down" to the middle class and the poor." He added: "When the rich continually become richer that country ends with a failed economy, which is exactly where the Republicans are taking America with their continual obscene tax cuts for the richâ€”a failed economy."  Demaree continued: "Where is Trump's USFL? Belly-up! Where are Trump's casinos? Belly up times 3! Where is the Trump Shuttle? Belly up! Where is the Trump University? Belly up! What happened to Trump's construction business before he learned how to cheat his subcontractors? Belly up! And where do you think America will be if Trump gets elected? Belly up!"  In addition, Defeating Conservative Republicanism points out that the alliance between Trump and Evangelicals is puzzling. Many have questioned how Trump, who has abandoned traditional Christian values, could garner such support from a religious community. This book seeks to answer this question by bringing back into America's conscience the Biblical concepts of mercy, of hypocrisy, and of punishment for unrepentant immorality.  In that same interview, Demaree did not hold back in his criticism of Evangelicals, stating that they have trivialized God's Laws of Love and Mercy and joined the ranks of infamous groups such as the Pharisees, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Taliban when they decided to politically enforce their own idea of God's Laws.  Further, in his interview, Demaree pointed out that Trump has boasted he could murder someone and not lose a single voter. He argued that Trump's words and actions enable his devotees to be "as immoral as they want to be." He even argued that Trump is the "unsurpassed champion" for immoral people because he has "destroyed his conscience and is proud of it."   The author's comments have caused quite a stir among Trump's supporters, with many dismissing them as baseless, liberal attacks.  Nevertheless, while Demaree's statements may be controversial, they have brought fresh insights to the pressing issues of today's political debates. As the country prepares to head to the polls, the impact of Trump on the economy and on the moral fabric of society are hot topics of discussion.  Related Link: https://www.fellowshipbooks.net
