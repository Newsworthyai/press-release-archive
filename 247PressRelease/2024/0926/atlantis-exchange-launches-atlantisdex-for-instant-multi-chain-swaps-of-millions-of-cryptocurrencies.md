HONOLULU, HI, September 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Atlantis Exchange is excited to announce that global Web3 users now have access to AtlantisDEX, a revolutionary multi-chain swap hub! In a major step forward for decentralized finance (DeFi), the much-anticipated AtlantisDEX has officially launched and is now open to users worldwide at: https://AtlantisDEX.vip  As the decentralized arm of the lawfully-registered Atlantis Exchange, AtlantisDEX is designed to empower crypto traders with a seamless, efficient, and secure platform that allows them to trade millions of cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchain networks—all without needing to switch platforms.   This transformative multi-chain swap hub enables traders to access a wide variety of tokens, offering unparalleled flexibility and convenience for users.  1. Cross-Chain Trading Made Easy  One of the standout features of AtlantisDEX is its ability to support multiple blockchain networks, making it one of the most comprehensive decentralized exchanges available today. From Day 1, users can conveniently trade assets from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Linea, Zora, and opBNB—all in one place. With AtlantisDEX, traders no longer need to switch between platforms to access their favorite tokens. Instead, they can perform cross-chain swaps effortlessly, reducing complexity, saving time, and minimizing transaction costs.  This seamless integration across multiple blockchains is a game-changer for the decentralized finance landscape. Cross-chain integration at AtlantisDEX provides users with a frictionless experience, granting access to tokens from over a dozen blockchain networks. Whether swapping assets on any supported network, the process is efficient and hassle-free, allowing traders to focus on what matters most—managing their portfolios and seizing trading opportunities.  2. A Comprehensive Solution for Traders of All Levels  AtlantisDEX caters to both seasoned traders and newcomers to the world of DeFi. The platform is designed with user experience in mind, offering a simple yet intuitive interface that simplifies even the most complex transactions. Beginners can easily navigate the platform, while experienced traders will appreciate the straightforward tools available for portfolio diversification and liquidity management.  A key feature that sets AtlantisDEX apart is Custom Token Integration, allowing crypto developers and users to trade non-listed or newly launched assets by simply entering custom token addresses and activating the trading pair. This provides flexibility for traders looking to get in early on new tokens or access assets that may not yet be available on other platforms.   Additionally, the Taxed Token Support feature ensures compatibility with tokens that have built-in tax mechanisms, enabling smooth and seamless execution even for complex tokenomics.  3. Fast, Secure, and Decentralized  The decentralized nature of AtlantisDEX ensures that all transactions occur directly on blockchain networks, giving users full control over their assets at all times. There is no reliance on centralized authorities, meaning traders benefit from enhanced security and the trustless nature of decentralized exchanges.   With built-in Web3 validations, AtlantisDEX confirms all necessary checks before executing transactions, such as verifying wallet balances and ensuring sufficient gas fees, preventing failed transactions or errors due to insufficient funds.  Security remains a top priority at AtlantisDEX. Its decentralized architecture, combined with smart contract infrastructure, gives users peace of mind knowing their funds are always secure. Users are not required to deposit assets into centralized wallets, eliminating the risks associated with custodial exchanges.  Moreover, AtlantisDEX prioritizes speed and performance. Thanks to advanced smart contract technology, token swaps are processed almost instantly, with minimal delays. The entire process—from entering the amount to clicking swap, approving the transaction, and receiving tokens—typically takes less than 10 seconds, excluding third-party factors such as network conditions, wallet, and user devices. This fast processing makes AtlantisDEX an ideal choice for crypto traders who need to execute transactions quickly, whether to capitalize on market movements or manage liquidity efficiently.  4. MetaMask Integration and User Convenience  Another feature that enhances the convenience of AtlantisDEX is its MetaMask integration. By simply clicking the MetaMask icon on the platform, users can automatically import tokens into their MetaMask wallets, eliminating the manual process of adding tokens.   This feature greatly improves the trading experience, especially for users who frequently switch between wallets or trade across multiple chains.  AtlantisDEX also includes a 50/100% feature, which allows users to easily swap either 50% or 100% of their wallet balances with a single click, simplifying the process and making it faster and more efficient.  5. Expanding Cross-Chain on Schedule  As the decentralized arm of Atlantis Exchange, AtlantisDEX is committed to continuously expanding its cross-chain capabilities.  In Quarter 4 of 2024, the platform will integrate several new blockchains, including the fastest-ever AtlantisChain (ATC), Solana (SOL), and The Open Network (TON). These additions will allow users to instantly swap tokens across an even broader range of networks, further enhancing the scope and flexibility of cross-chain trading.  1) AtlantisChain (ATC): A super-fast, cost-effective utility blockchain supporting public services and a wide range of industries.  2) Solana (SOL): Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it ideal for DeFi applications.  3) The Open Network (TON): A scalable blockchain built for fast and secure transactions.  With the integration of these new blockchains, AtlantisDEX will offer one of the most comprehensive multi-chain trading experiences, solidifying its position as a global leader in cross-chain DeFi solutions.  6. Liquidity Mining, Yield Farming, and Staking Opportunities  Beyond token swaps, AtlantisDEX plans to offer a wide range of DeFi features, including liquidity mining, yield farming, and staking. Users can earn rewards while participating in the AtlantisDEX ecosystem, contributing to liquidity pools and enhancing market depth for all traders.  These opportunities position AtlantisDEX as not just a trading platform, but a comprehensive DeFi hub, allowing users to grow their portfolios while actively engaging with the platform's ecosystem.  7.
