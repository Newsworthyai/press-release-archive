# Could Simple Eye Exercises Help the More Than Four Billion People Globally Who Will Need Glasses by 2050?

CINCINNATI, OH, September 26, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In little over 25 years, according to projections made by researchers at the Brien Holden Vision Institute, more than four billion people globally will require glasses or some kind of corrective lenses. Meanwhile in the US, according to recent studies, 177 million people – more than 61% of the population – currently use some kind of vision correction. That's a staggeringly high number of people who need glasses, contact lenses, and/or corrective surgery to preserve acceptable levels of vision.

The method, originally devised in the early 20th century by Dr William Horatio Bates, consists of simple eye exercises specifically designed to improve vision naturally. The exercises – basically a workout for your eyes – can also help alleviate eye strain and distress caused by hours spent staring at screens as we use our computers, tablets and smartphones. SniperSight is an exceptional app, based on Dr. Bates' method, that can help people who use glasses or contacts to regain clear, effective vision, and even allow some to avoid the need for glasses in the first place.
