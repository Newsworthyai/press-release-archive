# Gregory Spektor & Associates P.C. Secures $1.5 Million for Victim of Crash with Unmarked Squad Car

NEW YORK, NY, September 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Personal injury lawyers at Gregory Spektor & Associates P.C. (Spektor) secured a $1.5 million settlement for the passenger of a car struck by an unmarked police vehicle.  The client was severely injured after a police officer struck the car they were riding in during an attempted stop. Local authorities (defendants) initially refused to pay damages, claiming they were shielded by government immunity. The defendants attempted to dismiss the lawsuit without success.  Spektor found evidence that the officer failed to use lights and sirens, and there was no justifiable reason for the attempted traffic stop. As a result, the local government agreed to pay compensatory damages for the victim's losses, including medical treatments, lost wages, and other losses arising from the crash, and the case was settled during a pre-trial conference.   Seeking Compensation from Government Agencies.  Quick action is essential if you have been injured by the negligent actions of a government agency, like law enforcement. Injury victims need to file a notice of claim within just six months of the injury. After that, they have just two years to file a lawsuit.  Understanding sovereign immunity and the exceptions to immunity is crucial to these types of claims. The general rule is that the State is immune from injury claims. Frequently, authorities will disregard injury cases, instantly claiming they are shielded from liability.  However, there are a few exceptions for those who have been injured due to negligence by government actors, including:  •	Vehicle liability  •	Medical-professional liability  •	Care, custody, or control of personal property  •	Dangerous conditions on Commonwealth real estate, highways, and sidewalks •	Care, custody, or control of animals, including police dogs and horses  Legal guidance and representation can be essential in these situations. Working with an attorney can be beneficial when taking on these authorities. They can assist you with navigating the procedures to file a claim, understanding concepts like sovereign immunity, and determining the amount of damages you can recover.
