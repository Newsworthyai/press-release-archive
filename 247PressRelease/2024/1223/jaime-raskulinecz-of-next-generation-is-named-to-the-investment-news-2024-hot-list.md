# Jaime Raskulinecz of Next Generation is Named to the Investment News 2024 Hot List

ROSELAND, NJ, December 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jaime Raskulinecz, CEO of Next Generation Trust Company, has been named to Investment News' 2024 Hot List of Top Financial Professionals. This is the second year in a row that she has been honored with this award, which recognizes the top financial professionals in the U.S. She is among 97 movers and shakers nationwide whose contributions have helped shape the wealth industry over the past 12 months.  Next Generation specializes in the administration of and asset custody for self-directed IRAs (SDIRAs), HSAs and ESAs. The firm also offers client education about self-direction as a retirement savings strategy, to help more investors diversify their retirement portfolios with assets they already know and understand; these include real estate, precious metals, royalties, private equity funding, commodities and many more. In addition, Next Generation provides education and specialized services to wealth managers and other financial services professionals.  "I am proud of the work we've done through the years to help investors broaden their investments—and of the high level of client service our team delivers," said Raskulinecz, who founded Next Generation over 20 years ago. The impetus behind that was the lack of financial services companies at the time that specialized in working with investors—like herself—who wanted to include alternative assets within their IRAs, which typically are limited to stocks, bonds and mutual funds.   Raskulinecz has won multiple awards throughout her career for entrepreneurship and business leadership. Next Generation has also been recognized numerous times for its growth and contributions to the financial industry and regional business landscape.
