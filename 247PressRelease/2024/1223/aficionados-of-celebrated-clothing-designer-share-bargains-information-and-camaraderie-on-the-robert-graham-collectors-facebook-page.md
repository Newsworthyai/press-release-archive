# Aficionados of Celebrated Clothing Designer Share Bargains, Information, and Camaraderie on the Robert Graham Collectors Facebook Page

FORT WORTH, TX, December 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Since its inception in January 2020, the Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook Group has grown in leaps and bounds. Now with 5,300 members, the group has become a popular spot for fans of clothing designer Robert Graham to buy RG fashions from other group members, or to sell RG items of their own. The page was started by Fort Worth entrepreneur and philanthropist Ron Sturgeon.  One of the best parts of the Robert Graham Facebook Collectors Group is that members can easily find incredible bargains on RG shirts. Members of the Robert Graham Clothing Collectors page know what they like, and often are in search of a deal or a steal. Numerous posts appear daily, describing a variety of RG clothing items available for purchase or trade. Frequently, members offer vintage RG pieces that are no longer available in retail stores.   As an added bonus, some sellers even offer free shipping or discount pricing on lots. For example, a recent post offered an incredible deal on a lot of three Robert Graham shirts in size XL, with an asking price of $100 plus shipping.  Another group member recently posted a holiday bundle deal of four Robert Graham shirts in size small, all in "phenomenal condition," for $100. You'd be hard-pressed to find this kind of bargain on RG shirts anywhere online, but in the Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook Group, it's commonplace.  Another post featured two Robert Graham men's long-sleeve shirts in size small, in good used condition for a paltry $20, and that price included free shipping. Again, this is just a small sampling of the marvelous bargains available daily on the Robert Graham Clothing Collectors Facebook page.  One member listed an incredible bundle of 13 Robert Graham T-shirts for $200. The lot included eight traveler tees and five RG-style tees, all in size large and in excellent condition. This deal didn't last very long, as someone speedily snapped it up.  Another seller offered three embroidered Robert Graham shirts – Jardin, Golden Nugget, and Carlyle – in size large, classic fit for $200, with free shipping. He followed up with another $200 deal for two Robert Graham shirts in size medium (one was a Limited Edition Lindemann) in "phenomenal condition." Both lots sold quickly.  And it's not just clothing that group members are offering for sale. Here we have a brand-new Robert Graham leather travel bag with its original tags, complete with a bonus grooming set. The original retail price was $98, and the group member was asking $30 plus shipping.  Some of the most delightful posts come from a gentleman who frequently offers photos of his Robert Graham "shirt of the day," along with mouth-watering images and an enticing description of his gourmet dinner. Here he is showing us the RG "Stonewall" shirt from the fall of 2014, featuring a spectacular, brightly colored array of iconic New York City buildings. On the menu that evening was chicken schnitzel with smashed potatoes and green beans, accompanied by a "fabulous" Montepulciano D'Abruzzo wine.  Now that December is upon us, Robert Graham's new arrivals include some gorgeous holiday-themed clothing. Whether it's brightly hued shirts or elegant formal jackets, the popular designer is once again offering a spectrum of striking textile creations to catch the eye of the most discerning clotheshorse.  The classic fit "Off Piste" long-sleeve button-down shirt features neon-colored skiers printed on a satiny stretch fabric. With its beautifully coordinated jacquard trim at the inside yoke and contrasting print on the collar, placket and cuff, you'll be the hit of the party in this shirt.  Designed specifically for this holiday's festive occasions, Robert Graham's Limited Edition "Majestic" Paisley Blazer is woven from a blend of wool, cashmere and silk. Part of Robert Graham's "Red Carpet" collection, this magnificent jacket boasts an oversized paisley jacquard design that is meticulously centered across the back. A hand-tailored jacquard lining coordinates perfectly, while metal-rimmed shell buttons add a touch of opulence. Robert Graham's trademark phrase "Knowledge, Wisdom, Truth" is appears in gold stitching under the back collar.  And for women, Robert Graham's new arrivals include the spectacular long-sleeve Limited Edition "Giverny Flowers." Inspired by Monet's dreamy gardens of Giverny, the blouse features detailed beading and embroidery on a floral print that's reminiscent of a vintage scarf. Contrasting piping at the inside collar and cuff lend an aura of finery to this 100-percent cotton beauty. "Giverny Flowers" is the perfect choice for all your holiday events.  Another new arrival for women is the relaxed-fit "Dylan" jacket, which features sparkly sequins carefully placed on the lovely paisley print. Robert Graham suggests wearing this "over a tee for a chic and cool look, or over your favorite solid-hued blouse for an elegant touch.
