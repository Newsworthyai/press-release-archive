# M3GAN 2.0: A First Look at the Highly Anticipated Killer Doll Sequel

LOS ANGELES, CA, December 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Vanity Fair recently shared a behind-the-scenes look at the sequel, featuring the iconic M3GAN doll alongside lead puppeteer Adrien Morot and returning star Violet McGraw, who plays Cady. With the first film becoming a box-office sensation and grossing $180 million globally, anticipation for the sequel is sky-high.  What We Know About the Sequel So Far The original M3GAN introduced audiences to Cady, a young girl grappling with the devastating loss of her parents. Her aunt Gemma (Allison Williams) steps in as her guardian, bringing the AI-powered doll M3GAN into their lives to help ease the transition. However, what begins as a solution to their struggles turns into a nightmare when M3GAN's sinister intentions come to light.  The sequel, announced in January 2023 shortly after the original film's release, promises to up the ante. Allison Williams, who reprises her role as Gemma, teased in an interview with Variety: "It's gonna be really fun if we get to work on it, to figure out how we can zig and zag that around the expectations of what it would be and try to keep things surprising while also delivering on the reasons that people want more in the first place."  Who's Back and Who's New? Returning to the cast are Violet McGraw as Cady and Allison Williams as Gemma, hinting that the sequel will delve deeper into their relationship and how it's impacted by M3GAN's reappearance. The cast also features new faces, including Timm Sharp, Brian Jordan Alvarez, Aristotle Athari, Jemaine Clement, and Jen Van Epps. Jenna Davis reprises her role as the voice of the M3GAN doll, ensuring the AI's signature sass and menace remain intact.  Davis shared her approach to voicing the character with People, emphasizing her desire to give the doll a unique personality: "I wanted to make sure she was an AI with personality, flare, and sass." Fans can only imagine how these qualities will evolve in the sequel as M3GAN becomes even more cunning and dangerous.  What to Expect from M3GAN 2.0 While plot details remain under wraps, it's safe to assume M3GAN's return will wreak havoc once again on Gemma and Cady's lives. The first movie highlighted the doll's ability to manipulate humans and adapt to situations, and the sequel is expected to amplify these traits. M3GAN could leverage her AI capabilities to become an even more formidable antagonist, possibly with new strategies to manipulate and terrorize her victims.  Horror enthusiasts are already speculating about how the sequel might top the original. Will M3GAN evolve beyond her initial design? Could she create an army of AI allies? One thing is certain: M3GAN 2.0 will deliver the thrills and chills that fans of the original crave.  Blumhouse Expands the M3GAN Universe Blumhouse isn't stopping with M3GAN 2.0. The studio is also developing a spin-off film titled SOULM8TE, featuring David Rysdahl, Lily Sullivan, and Claudia Doumit. With this expansion of the M3GAN universe, Blumhouse is cementing the killer doll as a horror icon for a new generation.  Additionally, the studio has other projects in the pipeline that horror fans won't want to miss, including Wolf Man and several untitled ventures. Blumhouse's commitment to innovative and engaging horror storytelling ensures that the next few years will be packed with must-watch films.  Release Date Fans can mark their calendars: M3GAN 2.0 is set to hit theaters on June 27, 2025.
