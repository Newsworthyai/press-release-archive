# Part One: From Farm to Feast—The Legacy of Char's Kitchen

TURTON, SD, December 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Char Barrie's journey began with a humble batch of homemade jellies and a local flea market stand in Turton, South Dakota. What followed was the creation of Char's Kitchen, a family-owned business that has grown into a lasting legacy. In this first part of our four-part interview series, Char shares how a small-town idea blossomed into a beloved brand, supported by family, community, and a dedication to quality.  From Humble Beginnings to a Legacy of Tradition  In 1995, Char embarked on a modest venture—selling homemade jellies at a flea market. Her daughter Glenda's idea to add fabric tops and labels made the jars stand out, sparking the interest of customers. "I wasn't sure anyone would buy them," Char laughs, recalling those early days. But the demand quickly grew, and by 1998, Char had set up a dedicated "jelly house" on her family farm to keep up with production while maintaining the homemade touch.  Interview Highlight  Interviewer: Char, your journey from a flea market to a thriving business is truly inspiring. How did your daughter Glenda's creative touch influence the early days?   Char: It was all Glenda's idea to add fabric tops and computer-printed labels. Those small touches made the jars look special, and people loved it. After that first flea market, the phone calls started coming in, and I realized this might be something. I never imagined it would grow this big.  Interviewer: You've built a lasting tradition over the years. What continues to drive your passion?   Char: It's about pride and purpose. I love keeping our family recipes alive, and while I don't experiment with new flavors, I focus on perfecting what we do best. This business has become a part of me. It's hard to imagine stopping.  Interviewer: Char's Kitchen is so closely tied to family and community. How have these elements shaped your success?   Char: My family has been everything. Glenda's creativity, and my husband Rolland's steady support—he's always there, whether it's picking rhubarb or helping in the jelly house. And the community of Turton has been incredible. In a small town, people truly come together to help each other succeed.  Interviewer: With the holidays near, what message would you like to share with your customers?   Char: The holidays are about family, love, and tradition—values at the heart of Char's Kitchen. I hope our products add extra joy to your celebrations. Thank you for letting us be part of your lives.  Stay Tuned  This is just the beginning of Char's Kitchen story.
