# The Anguish Of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) And The Path To Healing Addressed By Dr. Kixx Goldman, Author Of Bestselling Book, Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard

WILMINGTON, NC, October 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a very complex, life changing condition. The effects can be profound and can last a lifetime. Dr. Kixx Goldman, author of the bestselling book, Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard, discussed TBI in a series of posts on her website. The series, Crash, is raw and compelling, as "Samantha", the subject of the story, is the author's close friend. The damage went far beyond the effects of the TBI, as Samantha sadly lost a child in the accident that caused the TBI.  In Part 1 of this heart-wrenching piece, Dr. Kixx wrote, in part:  Back in the day, when I studied for my doctorate, I learned about human psychological, social and emotional development-- and challenges. During that time, I helped children with learning disabilities. I read about TBI — Traumatic Brain Injury — and strategies for re-education, from a glossy blue and yellow workbook called Brain Stars – Brain Injury: Strategies for Teams and Re-education for Students. An excellent source book, but no real people stepped out of the book and spoke to me.  Not until years later. After I'd met Samantha. Sam was also in a helping profession and we traded advice and became friends.  I was in awe of Sam's intellect and wit, and her awesome energy. That was before her injury and the story I wrote about it, Crash.  Recently, I ran across a description by Dixie Coskie, TBI Ten Years Later: A Mother's Story Continues. The author notes: "But the reality is — unless you have experienced the loss, the heartache, and the ripple effects that brain injury can inflict — you cannot possibly understand the magnitude and the seriousness of the life-altering implications. The long-term impact that TBI imposes on the injured person, family members, and friends is unthinkable.  The full text of the blog Crash is available at https://drkixxgoldman.com/trauma/missing-samantha-traumatic-brain-injury/  In her bestselling book, 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard - Stories Of Courage And Healing', Dr. Kixx takes readers on a journey that is an illuminating exploration into intuition, resilience, and emotional honesty. Through a collection of eight realistic but fictional stories, she begins to show us key strategies for navigating life's challenges with courage and authenticity. Every one of the stories serves as a compelling testament to the transformative power of honoring one's own inner voice. The key word here is "own". Every form of trauma is unique to the individual, and thus requires a one-of-a-kind approach. She has a talent that allows her to help guide readers to discover their own paths, without resorting to preaching or promising.  From the struggles of devoted fathers and resilient teachers to the often courageous defiance of therapists and survivors, the characters in "Speak from Your Heart" exemplify the resilience of the human spirit and will. Through these stories, readers are reminded of the inherent strength that lies within each of us, inspiring us to heal and reclaim our power. "Speak from Your Heart" is not just a book—it's a beacon of hope and healing, offering readers real insight for navigating life with grace and resilience.  The eight engaging fictional stories in this collection are personal, drawn from experiences in Dr. Kixx's life and the lives of her clients. The characters are tested by everyday traumas...  • A devoted father and his daughter find hope in rewriting their past. • With remarkable grit, a teacher escapes a surprise attack. • To heal his childhood wounds, a man must conquer his fears. • A therapist defies the establishment to protect her clients. • As she confronts the church, a therapist regains her standing. • A woman learns the risks of not speaking out. • By sharing her story and bonding with peers, a woman overcomes her trauma.  As the characters in these stories find the courage to triumph over their challenges, they heal and grow.  Inspired by real life people, characters show readers how to find the courage to transform difficult and traumatic life experiences, speak their truth and reclaim their power.  'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard: Stories Of Courage And Healing' has received rave reviews from readers and reviewers. Leslie S. Greenberg, PhD, distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, Dept. of Psychology, York University said, " In each story, the characters' resilience is illustrated by how they transform difficult life stories into constructive final narratives. They find the courage to triumph over challenges to heal and they grow. The message of the book: speaking one's truth makes for desired change and healing."  In her review, Liz Moulden said, "The short stories from Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard have given me a second chance and a voice, the voice I never had. What's exciting about this book is each main character in these short stories experienced some kind of abuse/ trauma but each finds their inner voice. With help, they're able to heal. Anyone who has ever experienced abuse or trauma as I have will be able to see snapshots of themselves in these stories."
