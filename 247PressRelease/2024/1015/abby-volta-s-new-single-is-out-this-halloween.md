# Abby Volta's new single is out this Halloween

BOSTON, MA, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Boston's Abby Volta is releasing her second single "Rabbit Catcher" this summer. "Rabbit Catcher" is a moving, upbeat ballad inspired by Sylvia Plath's poem of the same name. Focusing on themes of feminism and overcoming oppression "Rabbit Catcher" is telling a story so many women know and can relate to. With poetic lyrics Abby tells the story of a woman overcoming an emotionally dependent and draining man. Using a mix of echoing drums, organ and a uniquely harmonic bass line Abby creates a moody, mysterious tone in line with her previous single "Noble Beast".  Abby Volta is a unique new artist electrifying the Boston music scene. She defies typical genre boundaries and considers herself gothic indie rock. Fusing literary inspired lyrics with a driving bass line, Abby Volta's music tells meaningful stories with themes of feminism and queerness. She pulls from multiple genres including Indie, Alternative Rock and Goth, and is best described as a mix of Fiona Apple and Siouxsie and the Banshees. She began singing at a young age and learned the bass in highschool. While growing up she would write songs with support from her family. Currently Abby goes to Berklee College of Music and is playing gigs around Boston. In 2022 she released her first single "Noble Beast", inspired by Angela Carter's feminist fantasy story "The Bloody Chamber".  Related Links: https://linktr.ee/abbyvolta
