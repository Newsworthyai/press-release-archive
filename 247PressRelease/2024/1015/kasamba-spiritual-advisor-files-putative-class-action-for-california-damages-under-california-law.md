# Kasamba Spiritual Advisor Files Putative Class Action for California Damages Under California Law

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On September 9, 2024, a former spiritual advisor filed a lawsuit against Kasamba, Inc. ("Defendant"). The named plaintiff asserts individual claims and claims on behalf of other similarly situated readers (also referred to as astrologers, life coaches, counseling readers, tarot advisors, and psychic advisors). The Complaint alleges that Kasamba misclassified the Plaintiff and other Readers as independent contractors, seeking to avoid various duties and obligations owed to employees under California's Labor Code and wage orders. Specifically, the complaint alleges that as a result of the misclassification, Kasamba failed to pay minimum wages for all hours worked, failed to reimburse for business expenses, unlawfully deducted from earned wages, failed to furnish accurate wage statements, failed to provide all wages owed upon termination, and failed to comply with pay timing requirements.   The plaintiff brought the case as a putative class action seeking to recover damages, penalties, and other statutorily-permitted relief for himself and others.   Kasamba offers online psychic readings, tarot readings, astrology readings, and other types of readings via phone, live chat, and email. Kasamba claims on its website that "Since 1999, Kasamba's psychics have guided over 3 million people in their paths to true love and happiness, career success and self-empowerment."   The Plaintiff's attorneys, Daniel S. Brome of Nichols Kaster, LLP, explained, "Kasamba requires its Readers to use its platform, and then charges them for it. We believe Kasamba's misclassification of its workforce, and the violations that flow from that misclassification, are clear."  The Plaintiff is represented by Daniel S. Brome from Nichols Kaster, LLP in San Francisco, California, Reena I. Desai from Nichols Kaster, PLLP in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Christopher Q. Davis and Jessica S. Cahill of Working Solutions Law Firm, LLC in New York, New York. The case is Simic v. Kasamba, Inc. Case No.: 24STCV23254 (Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County).
