# Hell's Kitchen Introduces First-Ever PFAS-Free Cookware

IRVINE, CA, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The concern over PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) is growing. And with good reason.   PFAS are a group of widely used, manmade chemicals that accumulate over time in humans and in the environment, earning them the name "forever chemicals." Recently, the focus on their potential health risks has surged, in large part because they are integral in producing fluoropolymers -- most notably, PTFEs -- a substance found in many non-stick cookware items.   Due to concerns about possible exposure to PTFE-based coatings, consumers are seeking non-PTFE alternatives, such as ceramics. In response to these concerns, Hell's Kitchen Cookware now offers a new line of hybrid cookware featuring a ceramic non-stick coating. Hell's Kitchen PFAS-Free Cookware boasts all the benefits of hybrid cooking technology without the chemicals used in most non-stick and hybrid cookware.   The Hell's Kitchen PFAS-Free line instead uses a ceramic coating that creates a natural, non-stick surface without the use of PFAS in manufacturing. The coating can be found in its full line of hybrid cookware, including 8-inch, 9.5-inch, and 11-inch stainless-steel, hybrid non-stick pans; a 4-quart sauté pan; a 7.5-quart pot; a 2.5-quart saucepan; and a 12-inch stir fry wok.   The ceramic coating features advanced non-stick properties that no longer require the user to pre-season their hybrid cookware before use (seasoning is optional). This is likely to prove attractive to consumers who don't want to be troubled with the seasoning process or who don't fully understand it; they can instantly begin creating their culinary masterpieces.   The absence of PFAS is just one aspect of Hell's Kitchen's allure; in fact, the new hybrid line offers the best of all gastronomic worlds. It heats up quickly and evenly; it's versatile for most foods and works with all stovetops (including induction and in the oven); and its non-stick properties means it can be cleaned up with minimal effort. Hell's Kitchen PFAS-Free Cookware is a mix of stainless-steel performance, non-stick convenience, and cast-iron durability.   "Creating a cookware line with the Hell's Kitchen brand means it absolutely has to be first-class," said Hell's Kitchen CEO Jeff Leitman. "We have achieved that through the functionality, beauty, and versatility of the product. We also placed significant emphasis on keeping PFAS out of our line. We were not only striving for the highest performing cooking experience possible but the safest one as well."  The new Hell's Kitchen line will be sold in bundles and individually, with a 6-piece set starting at $289.99. Hell's Kitchen PFAS-Free Cookware comes with a limited lifetime warranty. The line is available on the Hell's Kitchen Store website, as well as Amazon.com and other retailers.
