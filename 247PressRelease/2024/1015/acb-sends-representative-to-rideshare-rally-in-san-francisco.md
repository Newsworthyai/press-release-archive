# ACB Sends Representative to Rideshare Rally in San Francisco

ARLINGTON, VA, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The American Council of the Blind is proud to be sending a representative to speak at the Rideshare Rally in San Francisco being organized by the National Federation of the Blind on October 15th. (Rideshare Rally link: https://tinyurl.com/2s3kc6su)   The Rideshare Rally will draw attention to Uber's and Lyft's failures to stop discrimination against blind individuals, particularly those accompanied by guide dogs, which violates state and federal laws and the companies' own stated policies. The rally, which is drawing blind people from across the nation, takes place on White Cane Awareness Day, which celebrates the ability of blind people to travel independently.  "Blind riders with guide dogs are routinely refused service by Uber and Lyft drivers. The reasons for denials are plentiful, but they all violate the Americans with Disabilities Act," says ACB's Director of Advocacy and Governmental Affairs, Claire Stanley. "It feels as if the problem is getting worse, not better. I've lost count of how many times I have been denied a ride because of my guide dog. Something has to change."  "This is not a local problem, it is a national and even an international problem," stated Kim Charlson, ACB's Immediate Past President and representative to the rally. "People who are blind or have low vision depend heavily on rideshare companies; it's a game-changing transportation option for our community! But drivers continue to refuse to transport blind people traveling with guide dogs, taking this vital transportation and independence resource away from us. ACB will stand with the greater blind community on October 15th to express our great frustration with these companies. More must be done by rideshare companies to prevent such blatant discrimination and protect the civil rights of guide dog handlers."
