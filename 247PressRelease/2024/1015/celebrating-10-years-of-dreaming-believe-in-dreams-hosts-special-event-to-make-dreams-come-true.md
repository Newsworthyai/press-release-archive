# Celebrating 10 Years of Dreaming: Believe in Dreams Hosts Special Event to Make Dreams Come True

CLEVELAND, OH, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From October to December 2024, we invite our community to join us in honoring a decade of dreaming by helping us fulfill 10 special dreams for deserving children.  Over the past 10 years, Believe in Dreams has fulfilled over 775 dreams for children across Ohio, partnering with over 80 nominating organizations to identify those needing a little extra hope. These dreams have included everything from lessons and classes to family trips, VIP experiences, and bedroom makeovers – dreams that create lasting memories and inspire children to believe in a brighter future.  As part of the "10 for 10 Dreams" campaign, we're asking supporters to donate in increments of $10 – whether it's $10, $100, or $1,000, every contribution brings us closer to our goal of raising $15,000 to fund 10 new dreams. These dreams will be tailored to each child, providing them with experiences and opportunities that can change their lives.  "Dreams can transform a child's outlook on life," says Katie Eichenauer, Executive Director at Believe in Dreams. "By helping to fulfill these dreams, you're not just giving a one-time experience; you're giving hope, joy, and the belief that anything is possible."  To participate, donations can be made online at https://believeindreams.org/ . Every dollar counts, and your support will go directly toward making a child's dream a reality.
