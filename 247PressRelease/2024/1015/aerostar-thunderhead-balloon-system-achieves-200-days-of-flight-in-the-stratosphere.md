# Aerostar Thunderhead Balloon System Achieves 200 Days of Flight in the Stratosphere

SIOUX FALLS, SD, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, an Aerostar Thunderhead Balloon achieved 200 days of stratospheric flight. The balloon, identified as HBAL 676, was manufactured by Aerostar International LLC in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It was launched from New Mexico on March 28, 2024, to conduct research and development activities associated with navigation. Since then, HBAL 676 has traveled more than 50,750 nautical miles and continues to be navigated by operators using Aerostar's machine-learning-enabled wind models and Thunderstorm software.  Over the past decade, advances from the commercial sector in materials, navigation, solar technology, batteries, beyond line-of-sight communication, and software have increased the operating range and endurance of high-altitude balloons and expanded potential use cases. Aerostar Thunderhead balloons have been used to perform diverse objectives, from facilitating crucial scientific endeavors for NASA to monitoring methane emissions in the Permian Basin and providing sensing and signal collection for the U.S. Department of Defense.  On the significance of this achievement, Russ Van Der Werff, Aerostar Vice President of Stratospheric Solutions remarked, "The Aerostar team has worked hard to achieve this milestone, combining continuous manufacturing quality improvement, a commitment to operational excellence, specialized flight electronics design, and groundbreaking wind modeling algorithms. Thunderhead's cost-effective ability to provide sensing and communication is truly an unmatched capability in aviation today!"   With hundreds of flights yearly, Aerostar has exceeded more than 2 million total flight hours in the stratosphere and operated over all seven continents. Aerostar's dedicated Flight Operations Team operates balloons 24x7 world-wide, with a system airborne every day since December 12, 2022. This achievement of constant balloon operations for the past 673 days, combined with a single system operating for 200 days continuously, clearly demonstrates the maturity of both Aerostar's technology and operations.  The company plans to continue refining what can be accomplished with their Thunderhead Balloon Systems, with further flights and operational deployments anticipated in the near future.
