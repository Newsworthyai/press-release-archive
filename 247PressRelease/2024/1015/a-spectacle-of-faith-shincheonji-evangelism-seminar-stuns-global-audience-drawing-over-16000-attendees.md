# A Spectacle of Faith: Shincheonji Evangelism Seminar Stuns Global Audience drawing over 16,000 attendees

PERTH, AUSTRALIA, October 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Held at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Jeonju, South Korea, the seminar was a celebration of faith, filled with captivating performances by a military band and traditional folk music troupe. Shincheonji's General Assembly Chairman, Lee Man-hee, delivered a compelling lecture, drawing on scripture to plainly illustrate the fulfillment of its prophecies.   Chairman Lee's speech emphasized the ongoing fulfillment of the Book of Revelation in today's world. He invited attendees to see the Bible not as a closed book of ancient teachings but as a living, breathing scripture that is unfolding before our eyes. Chairman Lee highlighted that, just as Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies 2,000 years ago, the prophecies of Revelation are being fulfilled today. He encouraged attendees to explore their identity in the scriptures and understand their role in these times of prophecy.   A key message from Chairman Lee was the importance of studying the Bible clearly and free from confusion. He urged those in attendance—and the broader global audience—to take advantage of the opportunity to study the Bible through Shincheonji's free Bible courses. These courses offer a structured and comprehensive approach to understanding scripture, including the prophecies of Revelation, in a way that is clear and accessible to all. The fact that these courses are available free of charge underscores Shincheonji's commitment to making this knowledge widely available to anyone seeking truth.  Chairman Lee's message about the importance of personal verification also resonated strongly. He urged attendees to investigate the teachings for themselves, encouraging them to ask questions and seek clarity wherever doubts arise. This invitation extended to pastors and congregants around the world, including those in Australia, who followed the seminar online.   The Shincheonji Word Seminar not only celebrated faith and learning but also reinforced the importance of accessible Bible study. With continued support for the message of Revelation and Biblical teachings, the Shincheonji Church in Australia stands with the global community in its shared pursuit of religious clarity and growth, ensuring that the opportunity to study the Bible remains open to all through the many Mission Centres that open around Australia, and globally.
