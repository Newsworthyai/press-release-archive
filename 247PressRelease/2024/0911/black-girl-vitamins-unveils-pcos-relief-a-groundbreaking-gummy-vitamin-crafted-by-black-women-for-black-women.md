# Black Girl Vitamins Unveils PCOS Relief: A Groundbreaking Gummy Vitamin Crafted by Black Women, for Black Women

CHICAGO, IL, September 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Black Girl Vitamins is shaking up the wellness industry with the launch of PCOS Relief, a gummy vitamin specifically formulated for Black women, by Black women. In a groundbreaking collaboration, the Chicago-based brand, and its advisory team of doctors and chemists tackle the unique challenges that Black women face when dealing with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  PCOS Relief is a game-changer, addressing the key symptoms that disproportionately impact Black women, including hirsutism, bloating, irregular periods, and hormonal acne. Each gummy is packed with powerful, science-backed ingredients: inositol to ease hirsutism and acne, vitamin D and DIM (Diindolylmethane) to reduce bloating and irregular periods, vitamin B12 for a boost in energy and metabolic health, and zinc citrate for overall skin health.  This much-anticipated vitamin launched on August 11th on the brand's website and sold out within 12 hours of its release.   Why It Matters: PCOS and Black Women PCOS is a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, characterized by a range of symptoms including hirsutism (excess hair growth), bloating, irregular periods, hormonal acne, and weight gain. The stakes are even higher for Black women:  - Twice as likely to face fertility challenges compared to white women, yet half as likely to receive treatment. - Increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. - More severe experiences of hirsutism and insulin resistance. - A higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than any other racial group. - Systemic healthcare disparities lead to longer delays in diagnosis and treatment.  Black Girl Vitamins advisor and lead chemist, Lorraine Lawson shares, "Creating new supplements for PCOS management is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Each gummy brings our innovations closer to empowerment in women's health by providing effective tools to better navigate health and wellbeing."  Founded in 2021, Black Girl Vitamins is a wellness-focused company on a mission to address the nutritional needs of Black and minority communities. Co-founder Maxine's personal experience with healthcare disparities inspired the creation of expertly developed, tested, and fast-acting vitamins designed to tackle scientifically proven deficiencies. Committed to health equity, Black Girl Vitamins offers a range of gluten-free, soy-free, and non-GMO products, including probiotics, prenatal vitamins, age-defying supplements, and more. Products start at $25 for a 1-month supply and can be purchased individually or in bundles at BlackGirlVitamins.co, Amazon, and other retailers.  With every bottle sold, the company gives back by donating $1 to scholarships awarded monthly to Black women pursuing degrees in healthcare-related fields.
