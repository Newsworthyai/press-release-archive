# MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar: The Ultimate One-Man Band Experience, Now Live on Kickstarter

NEW YORK, NY, September 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MOGABI AMT INC., a leading manufacturer of fusion travel guitars, has announced the launch of its foldable MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar on Kickstarter, the global crowdfunding platform.  In 2022, MOGABI AMT INC. successfully completed its first Kickstarter campaign, raising funds from nearly 400 backers for the MOGABI Acoustic/Classical Guitar. Based on feedback from these backers, the company has now developed and is unveiling the electric guitar, the MOGABI V3, on Kickstarter for the first time.  The MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar retains the original sound recording function but has been upgraded with a fan-shaped audio box to improve sound quality by over 20%. This design offers stable support on the player's lap during seated performances while improving sound quality by over 20%, thanks to the larger speaker surface area. The enhanced bass response minimizes howling, resulting in a cleaner, more authentic sound. Additionally, the guitar provides sufficient performance for outdoor busking without the need for an external amplifier.  The MOGABI V3 is highly compatible with effectors, allowing musicians to record both original and effect sounds simultaneously. It also offers the ability to extract and edit audio files and features a microphone preamp for voice recording, making it an ideal guitar for one-man-band performances.  Equipped with a 40mm full-range 10W speaker, SPC 79dB/W high-output sound, 15-level volume control, low-noise performance, and a built-in microphone preamp, the MOGABI V3 meets the diverse needs of guitar enthusiasts. Its innovative hinge mechanism connects the audio box and neck, allowing the guitar to fold in half for easy portability, making it suitable for indoor use, outdoor gigs, business trips, and while traveling.  The MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar will be available at a special discounted price exclusively for Kickstarter backers, ensuring more guitar lovers have access to this unique instrument. Further details and purchase information can be found on Kickstarter starting September 10, 2024.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/134517265/mogabi-v3-guitar-unleash-your-creative-power-anywhere-0?ref=476hs5
