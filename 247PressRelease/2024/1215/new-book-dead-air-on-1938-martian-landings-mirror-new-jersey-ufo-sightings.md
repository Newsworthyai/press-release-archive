# NEW BOOK "DEAD AIR" ON 1938 MARTIAN LANDINGS MIRROR NEW JERSEY UFO SIGHTINGS

CHICAGO, IL, December 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ --"Dead Air The Night Orson Welles Terrified America" (Rowman and Littlefield Nov 19)has become suddenly very relevent to today in its description of an alien landing in Grovers Mill New Jersey in 1938. New Jersey is now the epicenter of a second ailen landing of either Martians or drones depending on what you read. William Elliott Hazelgroves book has been garnering critical acclaim from The Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, Booklist, BBC, Daily Mail, and the New York Journal of Books. Describing the night of October 30 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast a radio play based on HG Wells War of the Worlds, about a Martian landing in New Jersey, the broadcast set off nationwide panic with deaths, accidents, and complete coast to coast terror.   The panic set off in 1938 is similar to the wild Social Media theories on the orign of UFO sightings in New Jersey in the past week. Hazelgroves' book describes Martians landing in Grovers Mill New Jersey and then exterminating humans with heat ray guns and poisonous gas. The nationwide panic from the broadcast play in 1938 resulted in deaths, heart attacks, accidents, with people literally running for the hills. "Reality is stranger than fiction," Bestselling author Hazelgrove says, "People think that kind of terror could not happen today, but look what is happening now with the wild speculation. I think it could happen again if people believe aliens had actually landed."   Dead Air The Night Orson Welles Terrified America was released November 19th by Rowman and Littlefield and is already in it's third printing. "I think people do believe in aliens," Hazelgrove continues. "They did in 1938 and apparently, they do now."  William Elliott Hazelgrove is the National Bestselling author of ten novels and fourteen nonfiction titles. His books have received starred reviews in Publisher Weekly Kirkus, Booklist, Book of the Month Selections, ALA Editors Choice Awards Junior Library Guild Selections, Literary Guild Selections, History Book Club Selections, History Book Club Bestsellers, Distinguished Book Award. and optioned for the movies.
