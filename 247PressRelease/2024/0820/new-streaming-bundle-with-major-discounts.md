# New Streaming Bundle with Major Discounts

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This bundle unifies the extensive content libraries of these streaming giants into a single subscription, giving viewers seamless access to a diverse selection of popular and critically acclaimed movies and TV shows.  What's Included: Subscribers can now enjoy a vast range of beloved TV series, including hits like Family Guy and Bob's Burgers from Hulu, alongside iconic franchises such as Disney's The Avengers and Star Wars, and Warner Bros. Discovery's Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. The bundle also includes highly anticipated upcoming premieres, such as Only Murders in the Building Season 4 on Hulu, Agatha All Along on Disney Plus, and The Penguin on Max.  Pricing: Ad-supported bundle: $16.99 per month, offering a discount of up to 38.8% compared to purchasing each service individually (Disney Plus Basic at $7.99, Hulu with ads at $7.99, and Max with ads at $9.99). Ad-free bundle: $29.99 per month, allowing subscribers to save nearly 35% compared to the combined standard monthly prices of $13.99 for Disney Plus Premium, $17.99 for Hulu without ads, and $16.99 for Max ad-free.  Marketing Push: To support the launch, a comprehensive national marketing campaign has been rolled out, featuring a cross-platform blitz across broadcast, social media, digital channels, and each platform's own networks. This campaign aims to highlight fan-favorite TV shows, movies, and characters from the bundle's extensive collection, ensuring subscribers are well aware of the wealth of content now at their fingertips.  Why It Matters: This new bundle is part of a broader strategy by Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max to provide a more streamlined and cost-effective way for subscribers to access their favorite content across various genres and studios. By bundling these services together, the companies aim to increase user engagement and reduce subscription cancellations.  Future Plans: Looking ahead, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox Corp. are preparing to launch the Venu Sports bundle of live channels this October, further expanding their bundled offerings.  How to Subscribe: You can subscribe to the Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max bundle directly through any of the three websites. Current subscribers can easily transition from their existing Disney Plus, Hulu, or Max plans to this new bundle. However, it's important to note that this bundle does not include Hulu + Live TV or the Max Ultimate Ad-Free plan.  If you're looking to save up to 38% while enjoying a vast array of content, this new bundle could be the perfect solution. Head over to Hulu, Disney Plus, or Max to start streaming your favorite movies and shows at a discounted price today.
