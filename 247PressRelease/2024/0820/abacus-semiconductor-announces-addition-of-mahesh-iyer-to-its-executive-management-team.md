# Abacus Semiconductor Announces Addition of Mahesh Iyer to its Executive Management Team

SAN JOSE, CA, August 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mahesh Iyer has a career spanning over 3 decades building cutting edge systems & technology centered around solutions accelerated in silicon. Since 1997, this has been entirely in chip companies in a startup culture. Every leadership role required him to wear multiple hats to cover all aspects of software product definition and development, with successful customer delivery and deployment, and product life cycle management. These efforts successfully culminated in generating a total of several billion dollars of incremental annual revenue, having delivered well over 25 chips in his career. It is a rare occurrence in the industry to have designed both ASICs and the accompanying firmware and software for those ASICs, and Mahesh is one of the very few who fit this bill. He has an intimate understanding of the complex interactions between hardware and software, and as such his contributions to the company include the delivery of the firmware and software as well as giving input to the hardware team when and if necessary. Mahesh has a Masters' in computer Science and a Diploma in Engineering Leadership.  Mahesh Iyer says that "ultimately, it will turn out that accelerators will do most of the computational work in AI and all related fields, and the challenge is to make the use of the anticipated breadth of types of accelerators as easy as possible, and that will require open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are independent of a single supplier."  Dr. Axel Kloth, Founder and CEO of Abacus Semiconductor, adds "I am proud to have Mahesh Iyer join the leadership team here at Abacus Semiconductor. His consistent ability to deliver firmware and software for complex chips and his unique understanding of both hardware and firmware as well as software will position us well in the ever-changing environment of accelerated compute."
