# DoJiggy Unveils New Brand Identity and Platform Redesign

DENVER, CO, October 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DoJiggy, a leader in the fundraising software industry, is excited to announce a major rebranding initiative, marking a significant milestone for the company. The GolfRegistrations platform is being sunsetted and will be integrated into the DoJiggy Golf line. This change reflects DoJiggy's strategic commitment to innovation and its continued focus on meeting the evolving needs of its nonprofit customers.  Founded in Boulder, Colorado, in 2003, GolfRegistrations pioneered online event registration for golf tournaments, offering an e-commerce solution for golf courses and event planners. As online fundraising evolved, the company expanded its offerings to include peer-to-peer and auction software. By 2006, DoJiggy was born to power all kinds of fundraising campaigns, and GolfRegistrations was established as a signature product of the DoJiggy service offering.  After over 20 years, the original GolfRegistrations platform has retired and been integrated into the DoJiggy free fundraising platform. This transition will streamline services under one unified brand, further positioning DoJiggy as a leader in the fundraising software market.  "Our software clients do so much more than just golf registrations," says Lisa Bennett, Sales and Marketing Director at DoJiggy. "Even those that host golf tournaments raise money through raffles, peer-to-peer campaigns, online auctions, and more. With new features like text-to-donate, support for digital wallets, QR codes, and custom URLs, we are helping our customers achieve greater success."  Key elements of the rebrand include an upgraded platform with enhanced fundraising tools, such as text-to-donate. "After two decades in subscription software, we're excited to move forward with a new, free platform that aligns with our vision to provide industry-leading fundraising solutions for schools and nonprofits," adds Bennett.  With this transformation, DoJiggy reaffirms its dedication to delivering cutting-edge fundraising tools and an exceptional customer experience.  DoJiggy is a leading provider of free fundraising software for nonprofits and schools. With tools designed to streamline online fundraising, DoJiggy offers a powerful platform for peer-to-peer and crowdfunding, fundraising raffles and sweepstakes, online auctions, event ticketing, donation campaigns, and more. The donor-friendly platform empowers organizations to maximize their fundraising potential with innovative, flexible software options.
