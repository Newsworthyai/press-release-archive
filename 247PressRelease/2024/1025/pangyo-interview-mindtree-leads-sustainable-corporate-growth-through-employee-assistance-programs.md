SEONGNAM, KOREA, October 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mindtree Co., Ltd. (CEO Hwang Pil-su) is a company focused on addressing psychological issues in the workplace and building a healthy organizational culture. Mindtree emphasizes the importance of employees' mental well-being in a rapidly changing business environment, introducing a new paradigm that values mental health in corporate growth. Beyond simple psychological counseling, Mindtree offers customized solutions that maximize organizational productivity and welfare, helping companies design their future.  Hwang Pil-su stated, "For a company to grow, excellent products, capital, and talented employees are essential. However, many employees experience psychological barriers that prevent them from fully utilizing their abilities in the workplace."  With 15 years of experience in psychological counseling, Hwang founded Mindtree to resolve these issues and create an environment where employees and companies can thrive.  Mindtree's core business is its Employee Assistance Program (EAP). This program helps employees identify and resolve workplace stresses, anxieties, and interpersonal conflicts early on. By promoting psychological stability for workers, the program is crucial in enhancing company productivity and job satisfaction.  Mindtree collaborates with major domestic companies to offer psychological counseling, crisis response, and customized corporate welfare programs online and offline. The company has established a strong network by working with nationwide psychological counseling centers and associations, providing real-time psychological support services.  Mindtree's greatest strength lies in its expertise and reliability. Its employee-tailored psychological support services, built on 15 years of counseling experience, offer high confidentiality and professionalism, gaining employees' trust. Unlike other EAP services, Mindtree distinguishes itself by directly partnering with counseling centers nationwide, transparently providing the clinical experience of its counselors.  In addition to standard psychological counseling, Mindtree focuses on providing tailored solutions that reflect the diverse needs of employees. The company offers services beyond individual counseling, including family, financial management, and healing programs, designing more structured and effective corporate welfare programs to meet the specific needs of each organization.  Mindtree plans to expand globally, targeting advanced markets in the U.S., France, Japan, and Singapore. The company aims to establish a competitive edge in the international market by introducing EAP services for expatriates and global corporations. Additionally, Mindtree is working on developing more innovative programs by integrating IT technology, further expanding its market presence.  With its headquarters in Pangyo, Mindtree is tapping into the networking opportunities that come from being in the heart of Korea's tech and innovation hub. "Pangyo is often called Korea's Silicon Valley, with many IT and advanced companies concentrated here. Mindtree is finding opportunities to grow through collaborations with various companies," said Hwang. He also praised Pangyo's convenient transportation, facilitating smooth collaboration with companies nationwide.  Mindtree will continue to prioritize the psychological welfare of employees, providing innovative solutions that contribute to building healthier corporate cultures.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi-do's representative innovation cluster, Pangyo Techno Valley was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).  Furthermore, the Techno Valley Innovation Division of the Gyeonggi-do Business & Science Accelerator (GBSA) holds monthly events such as the Pangyo Evening Meet-Up, Pan-Pan Day, and the Pangyo Startup Investment Exchange "In-Best Pangyo" to maximize the value of Pangyo Techno Valley. They also support the Pangyo Overseas Promotion Program to publicize information about Pangyo's companies, products, and services to domestic and foreign investors and the media, thereby facilitating foreign investment.
