# [Pangyo Interview] KnowHow.zip Poised to Lead Global Business Innovation with Multilingual Collaboration Tool

SEONGNAM, KOREA, October 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KnowHow.zip (CEO Minji Kang) is a startup specializing in educational tools and SaaS solutions for global businesses based in Pangyo Techno Valley.  Last year, the company received approximately 100 million KRW in institutional support. This year, it solidified its growth foundation by securing an additional 250 million KRW through its selection for the K-Academy Unicon 14th and K-ICT Global Mentoring 23rd cohorts.  One of its flagship products, Document translator.ai, is a SaaS tool revolutionizing multilingual document collaboration. Currently, in beta, this tool primarily targets multinational companies and research institutions, and it plans to expand as a solution for global corporations with overseas branches.  Document translator.ai offers an innovative multilingual viewer function, allowing users to simultaneously view documents in multiple languages simply by uploading a file or inserting a link. Traditionally, translated documents had to be managed and downloaded separately for each language. KnowHow.zip says its Document translator.ai enables teams to instantly view documents translated into over 60 languages on one screen and share them in real time. Its Gen AI Glossary feature allows users to select an AI-based glossary for more precise translation.  Minji Kang, having firsthand experience with international workshops and programs, witnessed the challenges of document management and language barriers during global collaboration.  She explained, "Issues that could be resolved in 10 minutes in Korea would take 4 to 5 times longer when collaborating with multinational team members, highlighting the need for a tool that could revolutionize multilingual document management."  KnowHow.zip is rapidly expanding globally, with approximately 2,000 monthly active users (MAUs) in countries like the U.S., Korea, and India. The company plans to extend its reach through software partnerships with graduate schools and corporate research labs. This year, it achieved notable success in the Gyeonggi Innovation Center's MAP3 business audition, and it plans to further collaborate with major VCs based on performance metrics after the tool's official launch.  Document translator.ai by KnowHow.zip transcends being just a document translation tool, offering a glimpse into the future of global collaboration by breaking language barriers. In an ever-changing business landscape, this innovative tool aims to enhance communication efficiency and productivity for multinational teams. As it evolves, it is expected to shift the paradigm of international collaboration.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi-do's representative innovation cluster, Pangyo Techno Valley was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).
