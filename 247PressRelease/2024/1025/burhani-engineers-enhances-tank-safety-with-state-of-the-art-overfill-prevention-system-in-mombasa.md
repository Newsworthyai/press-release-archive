# Burhani Engineers Enhances Tank Safety with State-of-the-Art Overfill Prevention System in Mombasa

NAIROBI, KENYA, October 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers is excited to announce the successful completion of the design, supply, installation and commissioning of an Overfill Prevention System at a major tank farm in Mombasa, Kenya. This complex project, focused on preventing overfill incidents, further underscores the company's expertise in delivering high-performance engineering solutions. These solutions are tailored to the needs of industrial clients.  This latest project involved the installation of an independent overfill prevention system for 13 storage tanks. As part of a larger upgrade effort, the new system is an extension of an overfill prevention system that Burhani Engineers Ltd. had previously installed for two other tank farms at the same facility. The seamless integration of the new system with the existing infrastructure ensures that the entire tank farm is now protected by state-of-the-art overfill prevention technology.  Scope of work  The project's scope covered the entire lifecycle of the Overfill Prevention System, from the initial design to supply, installation and final commissioning. The system was designed to comply with API 2350 standards, ensuring safety and operational efficiency. This compliance guarantees that the system meets international best practices in overfill prevention for storage tanks, making it a crucial safety feature for the facility.  Their team was responsible for managing each phase of the project, ensuring that all technical and safety specifications were met. The system offers detailed warnings and alarms, enabling facility operators to make quick, informed decisions in the event of potential overfill scenarios.  Overcoming challenges with tailored solutions  One of the key challenges faced during this project was the lack of a fully independent overfill prevention system for the tank farm. To address this, the team designed a modular, scalable and extensible solution. The system provides real-time data on tank levels and triggers alarms when necessary, offering facility operators enhanced control over tank operations. By automating the process of monitoring storage tank levels, the system helps minimise human error and ensures timely responses to any potential issues.  Expertise and commitment to quality  The success in this project can be attributed to the expertise and dedication of its highly skilled team. Engineers and technicians applied their vast knowledge of tank management and safety systems to complete the project on time and to the highest quality standards. Their attention to detail and strict adherence to safety protocols ensured that the system was implemented seamlessly, without disruption to ongoing operations at the facility.
