# NinaData Announces Registration to IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework

HELSINKI, FINLAND, June 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NinaData, an innovator in contextual advertising solutions, proudly announces its approved status as the latest vendor to join IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF).  NinaData's buying intent platform leverages near real-time contextual data to drive in-moment online results for brands. Utilizing purpose-built AI for semantic content analysis, NinaData creates sustainable data value and insights for brands and content owners.  Launched in April 2018, the TCF is a cross-industry voluntary standard designed to facilitate compliance with certain provisions of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR. It applies principles from these legislative instruments to the online industry, considering EU-level guidance from the EDPB and national-level guidance from Data Protection Authorities.  As global trends such as regulation, third-party cookie deprecation, and consumer choice reshape the advertising technology landscape, there is a growing need for solutions that operate effectively without third-party cookies. NinaData addresses this need with its contextual "privacy-first" AI tools, which analyze web page content to understand reader purchase intent and match ad campaigns to the most relevant pages. This next-generation Internet advertising solution allows marketers to run ad campaigns in relevant media through any programmatic platform without tracking users.  "We are thrilled to join IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework," said Markus Bäckström, Chief Operating Officer at NinaData. "This collaboration underscores our commitment to upholding the highest standards of data privacy and user consent. By integrating with this industry-leading framework, we can provide even greater transparency and trust for our clients and their users. It's an important step forward in our mission to ensure ethical and compliant data practices across all our operations."  The TCF, developed by IAB Europe in collaboration with online industry professionals, enables publishers and technology partners to offer users a standardized experience when making privacy choices. It allows users to grant or withhold consent and exercise their 'right to object' to data processing. The TCF includes minimum requirements based on Data Protection Authorities' guidelines and jurisprudence for informing users, providing privacy choices, and respecting those choices.  NinaData's platform integrates into its custom-built demand-side platform (DSP) with several innovative features:  - Precise Keyword-Level Page Analysis: Continuous page-level analysis of URLs to identify those with the strongest correlation to specific keywords.  - Real-Time Semantic Targeting: Deconstructs web page meaning at the word level to enhance performance against display ad inventory based on various factors, including sentiment and emotional connection.  - Exact-Match Keyword-Targeting: Utilizes advanced semantic disambiguation to target highly relevant web pages.  - Cost-Effective High-Quality Engagement: Delivers high-intent audiences for clicks or conversions at a lower cost compared to high-demand keywords in search engine bidding.
