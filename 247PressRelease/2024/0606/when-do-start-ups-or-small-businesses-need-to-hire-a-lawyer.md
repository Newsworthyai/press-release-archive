# When Do Start-ups or Small Businesses Need to Hire a Lawyer?

HOUSTON, TX, June 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Start-ups and small businesses may benefit from hiring a lawyer at various stages of their development. "A good business attorney can offer guidance tailored to specific circumstances, industries, and local laws, helping clients make informed decisions and minimizing legal risks," says Attorney Andrew Weisblatt. Some areas they can assist with include:  1.	Business Formation: •	When establishing a new business, it is crucial to select the appropriate legal structure, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation. A lawyer can provide guidance on the legal and tax implications of each option, helping you make an informed decision.  2.	Contracts and Agreements: •	Whether it's lease agreements, vendor contracts, customer agreements, or employment contracts, having a lawyer draft or review them can protect your business interests and ensure legal compliance. •	If you have co-founders or shareholders, a lawyer can help create agreements that define ownership rights, responsibilities, profit distribution, decision-making processes, and dispute resolution mechanisms.  3.	Intellectual Property Protection: •	If your business has unique logos, names, or creative works, securing trademarks and copyrights can safeguard your intellectual property. An attorney can guide you through the registration process and help enforce your rights. •	If your start-up or small business has invented a novel product or process, obtaining a patent can provide exclusive rights and prevent others from using or selling your invention.  4.	Employment Matters: •	Developing legally sound hiring practices, crafting employment agreements, and ensuring compliance with labor laws are essential steps a lawyer can assist with, minimizing the risk of potential disputes or legal violations.  5.	Regulatory Compliance and Licensing: •	Certain industries have specific regulations and licensing requirements. An attorney familiar with your sector can ensure your business complies with these regulations, reducing the risk of penalties or legal issues.  6.	Dispute Resolution and Litigation: •	If your business becomes involved in a contractual dispute or conflict, a lawyer can help explore mediation or settlement options, aiming for a resolution without going to court. •	In the event of a legal dispute or litigation, having legal representation is crucial. An attorney can advocate for your business's interests and provide strategic advice.  About Weisblatt Law Firm  Andrew D.
