# A Chance For the World To Look Beyond The Haitian Crisis, Thanks to Julie Nicolas's Soon-to-be-Released Book!

MIAMI BEACH, FL, November 16, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It will educate the world about the many heroes who stood firmly against all odds to free the country from the conquerors who did nothing but exploit its resources, including the Haitian people.   Julie Nicolas, a teacher and an exceptional storyteller, has taken it upon herself to make the world see the power of her home country, which only seems like a land of crisis and conflict. Almost always in the negative light due to its ever-going economic crisis and political unrest, this country deserves to be known for its people—heroes who fought tirelessly to ensure that the future generation breathes in a land that is free.   "…they wanted to release Haiti from the shackles of brutality and torture. They spoke from their hearts and minds. They were also determined to bring about the changes they dreamed of, which were evident in the history that followed…" Nicolas, in her book, also wrote, "…the bravery that pursued the forefathers has now become the fuel which energizes the echo to strengthen the hope of Haitians whether living inland or abroad."  The book is set in a classroom where Julie, as a beloved teacher, introduces the students to the journey of Haiti's freedom and the 'heroes and heroines' that made it possible. Starting from the forefathers, she takes her students to the modern-day heroes who are ensuring that the country is stripped of its hard-earned freedom.  Perfect for readers as young as twelve years old, this book will prove a powerful reference to the bravery and courage of a people who are only known for their homeland's instability and unrest. Soon to be released on Amazon and your favorite stores, this book is not one to miss, especially for the history buffs.
