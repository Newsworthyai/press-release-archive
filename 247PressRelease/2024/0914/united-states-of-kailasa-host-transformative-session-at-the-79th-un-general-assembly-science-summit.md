# United States of KAILASA Host Transformative Session at the 79th UN General Assembly Science Summit

NEW YORK, NY, September 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Under the auspices of The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the United States of KAILASA (USK) hosted an extraordinary 2-hour virtual session at the Science Summit during the 79th UN General Assembly.   The session, telecast live and attended by thousands virtually and on livestream, focused on "Integration of Indigenous Knowledge into Modern Science" and provided a multi-faceted and groundbreaking exploration of how ancient indigenous Hindu sciences and traditions can seamlessly integrate with and augment and elevate modern scientific practices.  The UNGA Science Summit is an annual hybrid event organized by the International Science Council (ISC) and its partners around the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).   The 10th edition of the summit is taking place from September 10-27, 2024 during UNGA79.  The main objective of the Science Summit is to enable science collaborations to demonstrate how science supports the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030.  Additionally, it aims to prepare input for the United Nations Summit of the Future, which will take place during UNGA79.  This year the Science Summit is featuring over 400 sessions and 1,700 speakers across diverse scientific disciplines and sectors. It brings together thought leaders, scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to discuss and strategize on pressing global issues and the role of science in achieving the SDGs.  USK's Session Highlights  1. Indigenous Hindu Medicine:  The session illuminated the ancient healing practices of Ayurveda and Siddha, which trace their roots over 11,000 years back to the illustrious Sanatana Hindu civilization.   These holistic approaches emphasize comprehensive well-being and offer profound insights into sustainable health practices, showcasing their timeless relevance in today's world.  The distinctive focus on the healing properties of natural sacred herbs (Aushadha), along with the practices of fasting and dietary discipline, is richly elaborated in ancient Hindu texts.   These timeless teachings have been beautifully revived by The SPH, emphasizing their transformative power for holistic well-being and spiritual growth.  2. Hindu Environmental Conservation:   - The immense reverence Hinduism holds for nature and how traditional practices nurture environmental stewardship were discussed.   Hinduism expresses reverence for Mother Earth as a life-giving entity, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of respecting nature, reminding us of our responsibility to protect and cherish our planet, and promoting harmony between humanity and the environment. KAILASA's efforts to promote sustainable development through initiatives such as the Clean Air Initiative, the Go Zero Waste and ISHANYASM Initiative were showcased.  The importance of fostering a vegetarian lifestyle to mitigate the environmental impact of meat consumption was also discussed, elaborating on SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam's guidance on global warming solutions rooted in traditional Hindu principles.  3. Hindu Cosmology and Astronomy:  The segment offered a dive into the Surya Siddhanta.  Surya Siddhanta is an ancient Indian text that serves as a foundational work in astronomy and mathematics within Hindu tradition.   It provides detailed calculations regarding the movements of celestial bodies, including the sun, moon, and planets.   The text outlines principles for predicting astronomical events such as eclipses and the positions of celestial bodies over time.  Surya Siddhanta also emphasizes the relationship between cosmic phenomena and time measurement, presenting a sophisticated understanding of cycles and rhythms in the universe.   The concepts of Pindanda (microcosm) and Brahmanda (macrocosm), decoded by The SPH, and their significance in understanding the interconnectedness of the universe and our spiritual practices were elaborated.   SPH had revealed, "Universe itself is consciousness. Scientists are yet to catch up. Science is too young to catch up with this revelation to reach this conclusion."  The audience was introduced to the form of Paramashiva with 25 heads, the Primordial Hindu Divinity.  Paramashiva with 25 heads represents the comprehensive understanding of the universe and its intricate dimensions.   Each head symbolizes a distinct aspect of cosmic reality, encompassing various dimensions such as length, breadth, depth, time, and space.  The 25 heads signify the ability to perceive and comprehend the universe from multiple perspectives, highlighting the interconnectedness of all celestial phenomena.  The session also provided a groundbreaking perspective on Einstein's equation, revealing why E is not equal to mc².   In 2018, SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam revealed that neither time nor the speed of light is constant; instead, it is the Superconsciousness that remains constant.   You can watch the enlightening discourse by SPH here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIh1QNTfMg.  While these revelations triggered ridicule for proclaiming that E is not equal to mc², in 2022 two scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for validating this very assertion.  4. Power Manifestation:  - The final segment focused on the science of Power Manifestation as revived by SPH.   It was emphasized that our inner space is pure consciousness, inherently powerful and infinitely capable, reflecting the divine nature of Aham Brahmasmi ("I am that").  - The awakening of Kundalini Shakti, the dormant potential energy within every being, and how its activation by SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam can lead to extraordinary capabilities such as heightened intelligence and miraculous powers, were discussed.  - The session explored Third Eye AwakeningSM, explaining how this yogic power when initiated by SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam can unlock abilities like blindfold reading, telescopic vision, and remote viewing.   The sacred science behind these powers, as described in the Agamas (ancient Hindu scriptures), was elaborated.  - The science of levitation, where participants learned about balancing the samana energy to experience physical levitation through intensive yogic techniques and SPH's initiation, was discussed.  - The Vedic science of teleportation and materialization was explained, highlighting real-life demonstrations and scientific validations of these extraordinary abilities, underscoring how matter and energy are interconnected and can be manipulated through advanced yogic practices.  Significance  The session highlighted the immense contributions and unwavering dedication of SPH Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, even in the face of persecution.   His work has illuminated pathways for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fostering global peace, bridging ancient wisdom with modern scientific thought.  The integration of these ancient practices has far-reaching implications for humanity.   It offers a transformative lens through which we can view health, environmental stewardship, and our place in the cosmos.
