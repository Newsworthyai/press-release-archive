# Bestselling Author Eric Madeen Announces No Charge Download Of Contemporary Romance Ebook, Water Drumming In The Soul

WILMINGTON, NC, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Eric Madeen has announced that his highly praised contemporary romance novel, 'Water Drumming In The Soul', will be available at no charge in ebook format October 24 through October 26, 2024 at Amazon.  In this fiery tale set in steamy equatorial Africa, Peace Corps volunteer David Fields is on mission: to build a medical dispensary in a village where spells are cast on enemies and fear of a geek-shaman reigns. David seldom has his bearings – cultural or geographical – and must fight a cocktail of tropical maladies as well as social taboos as he throws himself into work. Until... he meets Assam. Captivated by her water drumming, her playing the stream as a drum, David is drawn to her early on and becomes the hunter captured by the game. And what a rollicking game of love it is - with a tension or excitement between them that never dissipates, … until the haunting end.  "The beginning pops like a string of firecrackers and from there the energy escalates, drawing in both the average to the more literary reader," Madeen stated. "Moreover, there's much to stir around in 'Water Drumming in the Soul: A Novel of Racy Love in the Heart of Africa', as it's layered with a deceptively simple surface atop depths of emotion. As Part II takes off, jumper cable sparks fly off of the prose as much of it is told from Assam's third-person limited point of view, as in limited to her consciousness as praised by readers worldwide. The tug on emotional hamstrings in the multiplication of what happens in the end and why resonates with the truism of Nabokov of Lolita fame: 'The best art is not simple and sincere but deceitful and complex.' Here I add, Think of the Mona Lisa's smile. And when you finish the novel, you'll be left with your soul strummed elegiacally in a deep down knowing as to why this story had to be told."  Readers and reviewer have expressed high praise for 'Water Drumming In The Soul'. Zaheer Baber; Professor of Sociology; University of Toronto said, "Madeen's storytelling prowess shines through and resonates with authenticity. The characters, particularly Assam, are beautifully developed, challenging traditional stereotypes as in presenting a more nuanced and genuine portrayal of African culture."  Elizabeth Montano, author of The Eternal Dawn Trilogy, called the book " a novel so beautifully and realistically written I found it on par with works by whom we consider masters … Hemingway definitely comes to mind."  One Amazon reader said, "Water Drumming in the Soul not only tells a passionate love story, but it also delves into thought-provoking themes like culture, identity, and the power of human connection. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that'll have you laughing, crying, and everything in between. This isn't your typical love story! This novel is well-written and full of unexpected twists that keep you flipping those pages. Plus, the characters are so well-developed that you'll feel like you've known them forever. So, if you're ready for a wild and adventurous ride, grab a copy of this modern-day classic ASAP!"

Eric Madeen writes cross-genre, and is the author of a number of books:  Tokyo-ing! - This is an apt word for this trio of tales chiming with anyone even slightly interested in Asia's most dynamic metropolis and its glazing of layers – be they cultural or taking-wing exuberant. Madeen does deep dives in three fascinating directions and voices, including the persona in first-person female. Then doesn't let readers come up for air because they don't want to -- until the delicious end.  Tennis Clubbed, Snubbed and Rubbity-Dub Dubbed - In historically rich Yokohama, where Captain Perry and his Black Ships cracked open Japan, the wicked shiver of the tennis snub in the postmodern present pits David Adams against K: a puffed-up xenophobic tyrant who rules over the courts of a club that has as its anthem, ironically, the promotion of international friendship.  Asian Trail Mix - An Amazon bestseller, this smorgasbord of travel essays scales down the sprawl of Asia by focusing on the unique and revelatory in sharp, crisp prose. See up close and personal the razzmatazz of novice monks at play in northern Laos, the hustle of pedicab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City, rainforests blazed on gutsy treks across Borneo and Thailand's Elephant Island. Served up nice and spicy, it's a travelogue at its most sumptuous.  Eric Madeen is available for media interviews and can be reached at ericsan@gol.com.
