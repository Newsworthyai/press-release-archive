# SMAART Company Reports Robust Q3 2024 Performance, Begins Transition to Equity Financing for Growth

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SMAART Company, a rising leader in accounting, tax, and business consulting services—and now in community association management — is proud to announce a better-than-anticipated Q3 2024.   This achievement was marked by strong sales performance, effective client retention strategies, adjustments to pricing structures, and improved management of the company's financial position.   SMAART Company continues to grow at an accelerated pace, outperforming similarly sized competitors and delivering an unparalleled client experience.  The company not only met its sales and profit targets by successfully completing its transitional period with Royale Management Services but also strengthened its cash reserves and significantly increased its assets.   SMAART Company has reached the milestone of technological feasibility for its SMAARTforce; the company's main software for client and workflow management. This important step adds profound value to the company's intangible assets and future goodwill.  In line with this progress, the company is taking a bold step by diversifying its financing strategy—shifting from relying solely on debt financing to incorporating a more balanced approach between debt and equity financing.  Q3 2024 Financial Highlights:  1. Exceeded sales goals for the quarter. Q3 2024 revenue increased by 101.69% compared to the same period last year.   2. Expenses in Q3 2024 also increased due to an expansion of our professional staff. The company added 2 CPAs, 1 EA, and other licensed professionals to help build the foundations of what is to be a much bigger company.   3. As of the end of Q3 2024, SMAART Company grew its assets to $9,513,493, up 611% from the same period last year.  4. Strengthened cash flow and asset base, positioning the company for sustained growth. The company has diversified its cash positions into short-term treasuries and other highly liquid money markets to generate additional income via interest from idle cash reserves.   It has also increased its access to capital by renegotiating with its financial backers for expansions of its credit facilities, all of which continue to have a zero balance—SMAART Company is sufficiently profitable to pay for its operations and growth.  "SMAART Company is driven by a dedicated professional team that has helped us achieve remarkable results," said Ray Dominguez, CEO of SMAART Company. "As we look ahead, we're taking a thoughtful approach to our financial strategy to ensure long-term success."  Shifting Toward Equity Financing  As part of its growth plan, SMAART Company is transitioning from an exclusively debt-financed model to a more balanced mix of debt and equity. This strategic shift will allow the company to welcome third-party investors, tap into additional capital to sustain more rapid growth, and offer investors opportunities for a return on investment.  The company's leadership views this move as key to sustaining growth and creating a more flexible, secure, and diversified financial structure.  Here's why this change matters:  a. Increased Flexibility: A mix of debt and equity financing provides the company with greater flexibility, allowing it to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.  b. Long-Term Vision: This shift supports the company's long-term vision by creating a stronger financial foundation for future expansion.  c. Managing Risk: Diversifying funding sources helps the company mitigate financial risks, ensuring stability regardless of external factors.  d. Confidence in Growth: SMAART Company is confident in its future, with a current valuation of $84 million—approximately eight (8x) times its asset base—demonstrating its growth potential.  This shift toward equity financing opens the door for outside investors to participate in the company's success while reinforcing its financial strength and flexibility.  Looking Ahead: Potential Acquisitions  As part of its strategic expansion plans, SMAART Company is actively pursuing opportunities for growth through acquisition. Management has identified and narrowed down potential targets to three firms located between northeast Miami-Dade and southern Broward County. These firms have asking prices ranging from $1.7 million to $2.2 million.  "Acquisitions are a key component of our growth strategy," said Ray Dominguez. "We are carefully evaluating these opportunities to ensure they align with our commitment to excellence and will add value for our clients and stakeholders."
