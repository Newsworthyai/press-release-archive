# Villa Roma Sausage Co. Provides Hurricane Helene Victims Support

ONTARIO, CA, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ontario CA. based Villa Roma Sausage Company, supplier of fresh and natural sausages, was moved to offer support to the victims of Hurricane Helene, even though they had no direct connection to this cross-country state.  "Looking at the TV seeing the extent of the massive devastation I was deeply moved", said John Brown, VP & General Manager of Villa Roma Sausage Company. "We knew the western North Carolina people are in need of supplies including food, so we thought this was an area where we could help.  Villa Roma donated over $100,000 dollars' worth of fresh sausages. Their efforts were supported by Jimenez Mexican Foods as they not only donated their food products, they reached out to these companies that also donated their products: Bar-S Foods, Tuscany Cheese Co., Magnolia Foods and Supremas Foods. The 53' refrigerated truck traveled almost 2,500 miles and Jear Logistics and Eco Food Pak donated the shipping fees.  "It didn't matter to us that Villa Roma only ships to the western half of the US," said Ed Lopes, President of Villa Roma Sausage Company. "I've never seen that type of devastation and I knew we could play a small role in their recover efforts. We wish the North Carolina residents all the best during this difficult time."  This is the largest donation in Villa Roma has ever done in the company's history. The product just arrived in one of the most hard-hit areas of North Carolina and will be cooked and served to those still without power as well as distributed directly to those in need that have power and can cook.
