# UC San Diego neurosurgeon Alexander Khalessi a two-time Castle Connolly Top Doctor

SAN DIEGO, CA, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alexander A. Khalessi, MD, MBA, MS, has been recognized as a 2024 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, the second year he has received the prestigious Top Doctor honor. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are selected annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors in their regions for their specialties.  Dr. Khalessi is a neurological surgeon, or brain surgeon, at UC San Diego Health. He has special expertise in performing complex cranial surgery, as well as minimally invasive, catheter-based/endovascular neurosurgery to treat a number of complicated conditions and concerns.  These include brain cancer (both primary and metastatic tumors); stroke; vascular conditions such as cavernomas, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); Moyamoya disease; and carotid artery disease.  Dr. Khalessi is certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery.   In addition to his clinical responsibilities, he also is an executive leader with the UC San Diego School of Medicine â€” serving as the chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery, the Don and Karen Cohn Chancellor's Endowed Chair in Neurosurgery, and a professor of neurological surgery, radiology, and neurosciences.  "We are fortunate to live in a time that technology has put surgeons in a much stronger position to treat structural problems in the nervous system," Dr. Khalessi says. "Personalized care and a longitudinal relationship are what we are all about."  "Having a new diagnosis is a scary moment in the patient's life. We want to support them in that journey and make it clear we are in a great position to get them back to their life before they needed a neurosurgeon. That starts by listening to their concerns and meeting them in the moment."  Dr. Khalessi earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He completed a seven-year residency in neurological surgery at USC University Hospital and a fellowship in advanced clinical endovascular neurosurgery at SUNY Buffalo School of Medicine-affiliated hospitals.  He also holds an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management and an MS degree in health services research from Stanford University School of Medicine.  Dr. Khalessi speaks English, Farsi/Persian, and Spanish.  In addition to his numerous professional honors, he has been repeatedly named a San Diego Magazine "Top Doc" in the publication's annual survey.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications.
