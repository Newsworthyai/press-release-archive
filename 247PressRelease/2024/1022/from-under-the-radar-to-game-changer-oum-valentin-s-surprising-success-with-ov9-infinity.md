# From Under-the-Radar to Game-Changer: Oum Valentin's Surprising Success with OV9 Infinity

HONG KONG, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- OV9 Infinity Limited, chaired by Oum Valentin, announces a major milestone with the acquisition of a 15% stake in a 1,520-hectare gold mine in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This strategic investment, valued at $10 million, not only enhances OV9's presence in ASEAN's commodities market but symbolizes the start of new alliances, including partnerships with notable figures such as His Excellency Yupi Haryanto. The acquisition signals OV9's growing influence and commitment to sustainable economic growth across the region.  The gold mine, situated in Lalundu Village, Dolo District, Donggala Regency, is expected to increase its weekly production from 5 kg to 100 kg following the deployment of new technologies and machinery financed by OV9. This is part of a broader effort to establish OV9 as a key player in Southeast Asia's mining sector, leveraging its strategic position to support sustainable development and regional integration.  "Symbolizing a New Era of Strategic Alliances"  "This acquisition is more than just a business deal; it's a statement about our direction," said Oum Valentin. "It represents a new era of collaboration, where key stakeholders like His Excellency Yupi Haryanto play a central role in supporting regional growth. It also marks the beginning of our 'Typhoon' strategy—a robust expansion plan where OV9 aims to establish a powerful presence in each ASEAN country, serving as a catalyst for economic progress."  Valentin explained that the 'Typhoon' strategy will involve dedicated investments in strategic sectors, including mining, energy, and infrastructure. Each "Typhoon" represents a fully funded OV9 initiative designed to support and accelerate local economic development in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar, and others. The Indonesian gold mine acquisition is the first of many, reflecting OV9's commitment to building lasting partnerships that enhance national industries and bolster ASEAN's role in the global economy.  "A Journey Marked by Challenges and Accountability"  Oum Valentin's journey to this milestone has not been without challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted OV9's operations, leaving it exposed to vulnerabilities and, at times, to individuals who sought to exploit the situation. Reflecting on this period, Valentin candidly admitted: "I made mistakes, and I hold myself accountable for them. I allowed myself to be taken advantage of because I wasn't prepared for the post-pandemic challenges. But I am not a victim—these setbacks have only made me stronger and more focused on our goals."  His determination has not only driven OV9's recovery but has also allowed the company to secure new investments, forge critical partnerships, and implement innovative solutions for sustainable growth across ASEAN.  "Supporting ASEAN's Economic Development"  OV9 is committed to contributing to the economic development of each country where it operates. As part of its broader strategy, OV9 will offer financial support to local communities and industries through targeted investments, providing infrastructure, technological upgrades, and educational initiatives that promote skill development. "We are here not only to profit but to build," Valentin emphasized. "Our goal is to support sustainable, long-term growth that benefits the communities we engage with, ensuring that local economies are empowered and resilient."

By focusing on ethical business practices and delivering measurable results, OV9 aims to position itself as a reliable partner in ASEAN's ongoing economic transformation.
