# Law Offices of Robert E. Brown, P.C. Files Lawsuit in High-Profile Home Care Attendant Neglect Case Involving Alleged Violent Assault on Elderly Hospice Patient

STATEN ISLAND, NY, October 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Law Offices of Robert E. Brown, a leading legal advocate in home care neglect cases, has filed a lawsuit against three Visiting Nurse Service entities and individual defendant Joy Odunze-Matthew, following the violent assault of Carolyn Albanese, a terminally ill hospice patient under their care.  The complaint, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Richmond County, details the disturbing events surrounding the case of Ms. Carolyn Albanese, who was brutally attacked by her home care attendant, Joy Odunze-Matthew, on multiple occasions with a weapon. The most recent attack, which occurred on September 10, 2024, was captured on video and involved the defendant striking the elderly patient with a weapon, leaving Ms. Albanese who was trapped with this home care attendant, with severe physical injuries and mental anguish.  The complaint alleges gross negligence by VNS and its affiliates for failing to properly vet, train, and supervise their staff, specifically the defendant Odunze-Matthew. The defendant was arrested on September 17, 2024, and is currently facing criminal charges for felonious assault, with her criminal case pending. In addition to the criminal proceedings, the civil lawsuit includes multiple causes of action, including negligence, negligent hiring and retention, assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  "This is a case of egregious neglect and abuse by those entrusted with the care of one of society's most vulnerable individuals," said Robert E. Brown, attorney for the Albanese family. "No family should have to endure the trauma of watching their loved one suffer at the hands of a caregiver. We are committed to holding all responsible parties accountable for their role in this horrific series of events."  The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages to address the physical, emotional, and psychological harm suffered by Ms. Albanese and her family.
