# eQuorum Alleviates Organizational Challenges in the Change Management Process With a Centralized Product Data Management Solution

ATLANTA, GA, April 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- eQuorum has made significant improvements to its engineering workflow and document management solutions (EDMS) technology with better workflow management and maintenance tools. These new enhancements in Version 12.1 promote faster problem resolution and quicker delivery of innovative products that comply with customer requirements and regulatory standards.  The new features in eQuorum's EDMS solutions, ImageSite® and EngineBox™, include configuration management, calibration measurement, custom markup symbol import, enhanced workflow management, and QR code printing/scanning.   With the new configuration management capabilities, engineers can easily create, track, and control multiple product and facility configurations throughout the product or construction lifecycle. The enhancement enables multiple asset and product configurations for historical review and the use of common or template drawings. Engineers can also calibrate scales within CAD files to measure drawing elements, and users can import custom markup (redline) symbols allowing them to markup drawings using proprietary symbology, thereby promoting more accurate and efficient review and approval processes while reducing rework.  eQuorum has also launched ScanNTap™, a new technology designed to provide instant and easy access to critical drawings and documents, O&M manuals, safety data sheets, Standard Operating Procedures, and more. The system generates a QR code to tag equipment, facilities, and other assets, enabling access to associated documents or drawings with a single scan using any mobile device, and without needing a mobile app.  All the new enhancements in Version 12.1 support various industries, including manufacturing, facilities management, utilities and energy providers, and Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). These new features represent a significant advancement in eQuorum's commitment to streamlining workflow, enhancing efficiencies and collaboration among teams, providing mobile access to information, and optimizing the product development process.  "ImageSite and EngineBox have always been known in the industry as one of the most rock-solid and affordable engineering document management systems. We understand that document management is foundational for organizations, especially as they grow. If you don't have adequate control and securitization of your digital files, all the other systems become significantly less useful. For the last few years, eQuorum has added additional functionality on top of these document management capabilities with workflow, design, and operational maintenance features to create an integrated ecosystem for the lifecycle of the assets and products. And because we're HTML5-built, this means all functionality is equally available on our private Cloud, SaaS Cloud, and on-premise solutions," shares Scott Brandt, President and CEO of eQuorum.  Version 12.1 will be available Spring 2024.  About eQuorum  eQuorum is the developer of EngineBox.com, the first SaaS Cloud engineering workflow management and document control systems (EDMS) in the U.S. Their product portfolio also includes ImageSite, an on-premise engineering document management system and workflow solution—also offered as a private cloud EDMS solution.
