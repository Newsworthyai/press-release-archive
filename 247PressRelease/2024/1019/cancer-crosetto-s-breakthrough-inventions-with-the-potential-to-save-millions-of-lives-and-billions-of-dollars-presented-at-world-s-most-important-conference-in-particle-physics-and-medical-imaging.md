# Cancer: Crosetto's Breakthrough Inventions with the Potential to Save Millions of Lives and Billions of Dollars Presented at World's Most Important Conference in Particle Physics and Medical Imaging

DALLAS, TX, October 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Crosetto Foundation for the Reduction of Cancer Deaths welcomes Transparency in Science.  Italian-American scientist Dario Crosetto expresses his gratitude to the IEEE-NSS-MIC-RTSD General Chair and NSS Chairs for supporting Transparency in Science.   They approved the presentation of his six articles, the title of which are available at the conference program (https://www.eventclass.org/contxt_ieee2024/scientific/online-program/session?s=N-29), each supported by two pages accepted by reviewers (https://bit.ly/4h45UMe), allocating Crosetto nearly two hours on October 31, 2024, starting at 16:20 EST to present his 3D-Flow and 3D-CBS (3-D Complete Body Screening) breakthrough inventions on particle detection and cancer detection at the world's most important conference in particle physics and medical imaging, where nearly 2,000 scientists will gather in Tampa, Florida, from October 26th to November 2nd, 2024.  IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization with over 460,000 members dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.  1.	Crosetto 3D-Flow and 3D-CBS inventions  Crosetto will demonstrate the superiority of his inventions in flexibility, performance, and cost-effectiveness compared to all current and past projects in the field. His inventions provide powerful cost-efficient tools for physicists to discover new particles and for doctors to detect tumors with as few as 100 cancer cells —long before the 1,000,000 cells needed to be detected by CT, MRI, mammograms. This innovation represents a significant advancement in early cancer detection, enabling the saving of many lives through timely intervention  Despite the scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of Crosetto's proposed solutions, funding to build two 3D-CBS devices has been denied. This would have demonstrated experimentally that when, combined with timely treatment, can significantly reduce premature cancer deaths  He challenges his colleagues to provide references to any current or past project, funded or unfunded, that can match his 3D-Flow and 3D-CBS in terms of flexibility, performance, and cost with the potential to deliver superior results in discovering particles, reducing premature cancer deaths and lowering healthcare costs.  2.	Call for Other Scientific Institutions to Join 2024-IEEE-NSS-MIC-RTSD Chairs in supporting Transparency in Science  Given the unrefuted calculations and claims that demonstrate Crosetto's inventions could have already saved millions of lives, billions of dollars, and advanced science and technology in multiple fields, it is essential that experts from CERN, all Science Academies, and particularly the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (PAS) —boasting 86 Nobel Laureates among its past and present members —take responsibility by attending (in person or remotely) his presentations. He urges them to provide references to calculations and demonstrations of any project or idea with greater potential to reduce cancer deaths and costs.   Among the members of PAS are the Director General of CERN —leading in particle detection and former Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), —world's leading healthcare institution, who is currently the scientific advisor to the President of the United States.  3.	Appeal to Funding Agencies and Philanthropists to Contribute Funding for Crosetto's Lifesaving Inventions to Obtain Experimental Results  Funding agencies, which spend $2 trillion annually on research and development, and government institutions responsible for delivering the best services to their employees and citizens, along with the 236 wealthy individuals of the Giving Pledge —who have committed to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropy —and entrepreneurs who declare commitment to funding impactful projects, are invited to consider contributing just 0.00000067 of the over $30.000.000.000.000 already spent on R&D since Crosetto's inventions. This would enable him to build two 3D-CBS devices and let experimental results serve as the final judgment.  4.	Urging Political and Social Institutions to Champion Truth for the Benefit of Humanity  Crosetto urges politicians such as The President of Italy Honorable Sergio Mattarella, his cousin, Minister of Defense, Honorable Guido Crosetto, his other cousin, Member of the European Parliament Honorable Giovanni Crosetto, and Texas Secretary of State Honorable Jane Nelson to appoint trusted scientists to attend his presentation and participate in a public discussion comparing his inventions with other publicly funded projects aimed at reducing cancer deaths and related costs.  Crosetto points out to the Italian politicians that just 0.1% of the annual Defense budget could fund two 3D-CBS devices, potentially saving over 400 Defense employees from premature cancer deaths every year. He also points out to Honorable Jane Nelson that he served for ten years in a cultural exchange with his native town in Italy, the opportunity for this Transparency in Science for the cancer cause she championed by appropriating $6 billion of taxpayer money, as stated in her video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7VJhz7easo).  Since, the strength for positive change lies in young people, he has also reached out to the President of SERMIG (www.sermig.org), an organization with 1,000 volunteers, 8,780 students in its schools, 22 nationalities, 476,000 medical visits provided, 28 million hours of volunteer work, 3,730 development projects, and 14 million participants.  With their sincerity and intellectual honesty, he hopes that today's youth can explain the benefits of his inventions to the public administration of tomorrow, to politicians, and perhaps even to researchers managing €2 trillion annually for R&D.  5.	An Appeal to the Media to Disseminate Revolutionary Discoveries  Journalists working in the public interest and social media managers serving ethical organizations are urged to inform the public about Crosetto's upcoming presentation and his 3D-Flow and 3D-CBS inventions accessible remotely or in person at the IEEE-NSS-MIC-RTSD Conference in Tampa, Florida, on October 31, 2024 with the potential to save billions of dollars and millions of lives from premature deaths.  Crosetto Foundation for the Reduction of Cancer Deaths is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization with the mission to "Significantly Reduce Premature Cancer Deaths at a Lower Cost per Life Saved Compared to Current Cost."  Two-page open letters (https://bit.ly/3MNoFpc), supported by 60 pages of detailed information (https://bit.ly/3wMUBpH) —including Crosetto's professional curriculum pp. 7-16 —testify to his commitment to defending science and cancer patients.
