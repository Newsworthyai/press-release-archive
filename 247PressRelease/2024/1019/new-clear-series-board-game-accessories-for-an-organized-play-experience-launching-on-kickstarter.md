# New Clear Series: Board Game Accessories for an Organized Play Experience, Launching on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, October 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BoardM, a company specializing in producing and distributing board games, is launching the New Clear Series on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. This series includes the newly developed Standard Smart Card Tray, designed to organize board games and poker cards efficiently.  BoardM successfully launched the Clear Series on Kickstarter in 2023, attracting over 500 backers. Based on feedback from these backers, the newly developed Standard Smart Card Tray will be introduced for the first time on Kickstarter.  The new Standard Smart Card Tray features a 2-in-1 structure with removable dividers inside the tray. When the dividers are up, discarded cards can be separated from active game cards. When the dividers are removed, the tray allows cards to be stored horizontally, perfect for gameplay. The tray also features interlocking grooves on the sides, enabling endless vertical or horizontal expansion when connecting multiple trays.  The New Clear Series enhances transparency by adding a high-gloss finish to its existing high-quality polycarbonate material, allowing the images and text on cards to appear clearer and sharper. Additionally, all products in the New Clear Series are certified safe, having passed FDA, MSDS, and RoHS certifications, and are made from environmentally friendly materials that can be sustainably recycled.  The New Clear Series set includes the new Standard Smart Card Tray, a two-tier Card Holder, a Standard Card Tray, a Mini Card Tray, and a Component Tray. Each product can also be purchased separately, allowing board game and poker players to customize their setup according to their needs.  Designed to efficiently organize cards, tokens, miniatures, and other game components, BoardM's 'New Clear Series' helps keep your game table tidy and ready for action. The series will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting October 8th, 2024.
