# iuvo Earns No. 141 on the 2024 CRN® Fast Growth 150 List

BOSTON, MA, August 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CRN®, a brand of The Channel Company®, has named iuvo to the No. 141 spot on CRN's 2024 Fast Growth 150 list. With this list, CRN recognizes the fastest-growing and strongest-performing North American technology integrators, solution providers, and IT consultants.  Solution providers on the Fast Growth 150 have achieved significant sales growth over the previous two years—with business acceleration driven by forward-thinking strategies and expert technology knowledge.   When asked about the award, iuvo President and CEO Bryon Beilman stated, "It is great to be recognized for our consistent growth year after year. Achieving this level of growth is never a given, and I'm aware that many of our peers have been struggling with growth this year. Being acknowledged as one of the fastest growing companies feels great." When asked what key factors contributed to iuvo's significant growth over the past two years Bryon spoke to the importance of company culture stating, "When you take great care of your employees and prioritize their wellbeing, they deliver their best work. Happy employees provide exceptional service, which not only retains existing customers but helps generate referrals to other companies that also want great service."  Bryon spoke to iuvo's commitment to continue to deliver exceptional service and value to its clients stating, "We develop deep relationships with our customers so that we can have honest dialogs about what is important to them and to ensure that we are always adding value. We continually check in via Net Promoter Score assessments which gauge how we are doing as a company and benchmark ourselves against the best customer service companies in the world."   Bryon also spoke about the biggest challenges the IT industry has faced recently, and how iuvo has adapted to these challenges stating, "AI and consolidation are two things that are currently disrupting the IT industry. Those of us who have embraced AI have been able to leverage efficiencies for growth as well as use it to help our customers grow. At a recent IT conference, I realized many MSPs are still only considering using AI. Frankly, if you haven't embraced AI yet, you risk future growth. Both MSPs and IT tool vendors are consolidating, creating uncertainty in the competitive landscape and affecting tool pricing and service delivery. However, iuvo is leading the way in AI and our expertise has allowed us to stay competitive by effectively leveraging the new tools that result from this consolidation."   "Companies spotlighted on the 2024 Fast Growth 150 leveraged extensive technology expertise along with innovative business strategies to accelerate growth and stay ahead of the curve in the always-changing IT landscape," said Jennifer Follett, VP, U.S. Content, and Executive Editor, CRN, The Channel Company. "This achievement demonstrates an exemplary commitment to success, agility in the face of rapid industry change, and creative strategies that drive lasting results."
