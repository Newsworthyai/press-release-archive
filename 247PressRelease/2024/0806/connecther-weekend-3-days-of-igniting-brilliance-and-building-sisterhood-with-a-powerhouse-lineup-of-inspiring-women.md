"I'm thrilled about what continues to unfold as my team and I put the finishing touches on the ConnectHER Weekend Retreat!" shares Tammy Barnett, Founder of ConnectHER Weekend. "The time in between the conclusion of the retreat each year to the beginning of the next, I remind myself of all the relationships being built and connections made! I've found that as much as we say we want to support one another in our various journeys, sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. I continue to curate this three-day experience to give women (including myself) a venue to celebrate imperfections, identify missing elements in our lives, and receive & share valuable information for our individual paths."  The 3-day weekend is brought to you by HCRC (Human Capital Resources and Concepts), HERWine, Vanover Legal & Consulting, Kingdom Dentistry, and Infinite Destinations Travel through Sponsorship and Partnership.
