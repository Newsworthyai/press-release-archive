# Scoop Up Sweetness on National Frozen Custard Day at BurgerFi®

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, August 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BurgerFi®, owned by BurgerFi International, Inc., invites you to chill out this National Custard Day with a sweet offer. On Thursday, August 8, 2024, guests can cool off from the summer heat by adding a small Vanilla Frozen Custard for only $2 to any dine-in purchase.   "National Custard Day provides us with a fantastic opportunity to celebrate BurgerFi's exceptional frozen custard, such as our beloved vanilla custard cup. Guests rave about our frozen treats, and these unique holidays allow us to celebrate with our Fi-natics," said Carl Bachmann, Chief Executive Officer for BurgerFi International. "We want our guests to indulge with a cup of this sweet treat and at a good value."   BurgerFi's frozen custard desserts–including its sensational custard shakes, are made with high-quality ingredients, including a milk supply that is free from steroids and bovine growth hormones.   "The secret for a delicious custard lies in the addition of egg yolks, making it richer and creamier than ice cream," said Cindy Syracuse, Chief Marketing Officer. "At BurgerFi, we craft our frozen custard desserts to deliver that ideal, indulgent creaminess. It's the perfect way to cool off and treat yourself in this summer heat."   The National Custard Day offer will be available all day at participating BurgerFi locations for dine-in customers only.
