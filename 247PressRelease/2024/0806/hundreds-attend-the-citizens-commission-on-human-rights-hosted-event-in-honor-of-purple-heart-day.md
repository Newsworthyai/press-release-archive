# Hundreds Attend the Citizens Commission on Human Rights Hosted Event in Honor of Purple Heart Day

CLEARWATER, FL, August 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), an award-winning nonprofit that works to protect mental health human rights, hosted an event commemorating Purple Heart Day on Saturday, August 3rd at the historic Fort Harrison in downtown Clearwater.   For seven years, the Florida chapter of CCHR has held an event to commemorate Purple Heart Day honoring members of the U.S. military and veterans who received a Purple Heart Media for their sacrifice. Hundreds of people attended this year's event including veterans, active-duty military, civilians and Purple Heart recipients.   The event began with a formal presentation by the MacDill Air Force Color Guard. This dramatic and skilled example of close-order presentation drilling set the tone for those in attendance.   Speakers for the event included, Robert Groover, president of the Florida Veterans Coalition, who led the Pledge of Allegiance; Father Bob Swick, Senior Chaplain for the Clearwater Police Department for almost two decades, who gave the invocation and Commander Mal Clingan, who received numerous distinguished awards during his service, including the Purple Heart, spoke about the meaning behind the medal.  The featured speaker for the evening was Brian Halstead, President of the United States Army Ranger Association. Speaking on how research has shown, over and over again, that the three biggest factors which allow for a smooth post-military life are; sense of community, sense of purpose and sense of spirituality, Mr. Halstead pointed out that everyone has a role to play in the prevention of veteran suicides. Asking the audience to reach out to a veteran, Halstead stated, "remember, being teammates puts an onus on you to try and make your buddies better. So, I implore you to reach out. You and your buddy will be glad you did."  The final speaker, the president for the Florida chapter of CCHR, Diane Stein, noted that according to the most recent Department of Defense Report, suicides in Air Force, Navy and Marines in the first quarter of 2024 topped pandemic-era rates.   "Unfortunately, the solution to military and veteran suicide is too often the prescription of psychiatric drugs. These drugs have the known side effects of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and completed suicides," said Ms. Stein.  Stein went on to state, "CCHR continues to fight for alternative solutions to assist our soldiers and veterans and we are here today to make it known that as the Mental Health Watchdog we will not sit idly by while those that gave so much for this country are subjected to abuse."  The event ended with a moving rendition of Taps followed by a group photo of the Purple Heart recipients in attendance.

About CCHR: Initially established by the Church of Scientology and renowned psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz in 1969, CCHR's mission is to eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
