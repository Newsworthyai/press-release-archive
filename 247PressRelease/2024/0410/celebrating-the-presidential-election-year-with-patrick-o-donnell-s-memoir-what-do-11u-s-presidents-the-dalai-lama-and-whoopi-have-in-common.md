SANTA ANA, CA, April 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Celebrating the Presidential Election Year, the eagerly awaited memoir by seasoned photojournalist Patrick O'Donnell, "WHAT DO 11 U.S. PRESIDENTS, the DALAI LAMA and WHOOPI HAVE IN COMMON?" is now available on Amazon, captivating readers since its release on February 9, 2024. This memoir offers a charming retrospective of O'Donnell's illustrious 60-year career, chronicling his encounters with 11 U.S. Presidents, the Dalai Lama, and Whoopi Goldberg, among others.  O'Donnell's journey into photography began in the late 1950s during high school, igniting his passion for capturing moments through the lens. He was in college working for the local newspaper when his assignment was a dinner honoring Richard Nixon following his loss in the California governorship bid. Nixon was giving up politics and leaving the state to practice law in New York. Then, in 1964, he had an assignment to shoot the Rose Bowl game, where Eisenhower was in attendance, as he was the Grand Marshall that year. The memoir delves into O'Donnell's early experiences, providing a unique perspective on historical events.  Throughout his career, O'Donnell gained access to pivotal moments, including Nixon's return to Orange County after his resignation from the White House and intimate encounters with figures like George H.W. Bush. Beyond presidential coverage, his memoir explores encounters with diverse personalities such as Margaret Thatcher, Jerry Brown, Kevin Costner, and Tony Bennett, providing a rich tapestry of experiences.  Described as a "part journalism passion project, part who's who of 55+ years behind closed doors," O'Donnell's sometimes tongue-in-cheek memoir offers readers a glimpse into a bygone era when newspapers reigned supreme and dark rooms were commonplace. With over 130 captivating photos, the memoir promises to enthrall news aficionados and photography enthusiasts alike.
