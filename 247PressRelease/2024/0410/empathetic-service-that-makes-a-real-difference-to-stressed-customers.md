# Empathetic Service That Makes a Real Difference to Stressed Customers

DES PLAINES, IL, April 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The best lending services representatives have a lot of patience and empathy," says Christen Hodges, lending services team lead for online lender SAIL Loans. "All day we're talking to customers who are in stressful situations or are very frustrated. It's our job to listen, help as much as we can and leave them in a better state than they were at the beginning of the call."  SAIL Loans offers Illinois consumers an innovative savings and installment loan that gets customers the money they need for immediate expenses while they build savings that provide greater financial stability.  The stress of unexpected expenses raises the tension  Christen makes sure her team of eight lending service representatives demonstrates patience and understanding with every phone call.  "We know real life happens, with events that may be beyond someone's control," she says. "Our top priority is to let customers know we'll do everything we can to help them. Once we get a customer to relax, things can move forward more smoothly."  Christen and her team assist customers who face a wide range of unexpected expenses. "A customer may be short on rent or can't pay their monthly utility bills," she reports. "A loved one may have just passed, and the insurance company won't get them the money for the funeral on time. Some customers need money because a beloved pet needs surgery.  "In many cases, our savings and installment loan can be just what these folks need," Christen states. "They get the money to pay their pressing expenses. And as they pay off the loan, they build savings that take them to a better financial situation."  Setting sail for greater financial stability  With the SAIL Loans savings and installment loan, Illinois consumers can build savings and get funded for an installment loan up to $4,000 in three simple steps: •	apply online or by phone •	get approved •	receive funds plus build savings and credit history  "What makes our savings and installment loan special," says Christen, "is that a portion of the loan amount goes directly into a secure customer savings component that grows as the customer makes regular installment payments on the loan. Once the loan is repaid in full, the customer gets full access to the funds in the savings component.   "The SAIL Loans savings and installment loan is unlike many of the lending solutions available to folks who are financially stressed," Christen states, "because its purpose is to help customers get to a more secure financial state."  Online convenience backed by responsive customer support  Illinois customers can apply for a SAIL Loans savings and installment loan up to $4,000 by visiting the SAIL Loans website, downloading the convenient app or by calling 833-700-7245 to speak with a lending services representative.   SAIL Loans customers can take advantage of: •	a quick and easy application process •	same-day funding •	the choice of a 12-month, 15-month or 24-month installment plan (which offers lower installment payment amounts) •	the chance to build their credit history as they pay off their loans  "We want to make it as easy as possible for our customers," says Christen. "I train my team to stay on the call until the customer signs the loan documents, so all we have to wait for is the direct deposit.  "My team tries to break down walls during our conversations with customers," she adds. "Some customers become very comfortable with us and may tell us things they wouldn't share with a friend or family member. And many repeat customers will ask to work with the lending services representative who helped them the last time.  "It's very gratifying when a customer thanks us for our patience at the end of a call," Christen concludes. "They often tell us that it felt like they were talking to a friend. We think that's a great compliment."
