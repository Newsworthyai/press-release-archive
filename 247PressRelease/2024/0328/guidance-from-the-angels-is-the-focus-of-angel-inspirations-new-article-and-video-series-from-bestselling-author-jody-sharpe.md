# Guidance From The Angels Is The Focus Of Angel Inspirations, New Article And Video Series From Bestselling Author Jody Sharpe

WILMINGTON, NC, March 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Whether you believe angels exist or not, in our culture they have emerged as timeless symbols of spiritual enlightenment. But why do they instill such inspiration within us?  Angels serve as symbols of virtue, beckoning us to aspire to loftier heights and embrace the noblest aspects of our humanity. Their presence, shrouded in mystique yet resonating with divine purpose, prompts us to contemplate life's deeper mysteries and ponder the boundless potential that lies dormant within each of us, regardless of our beliefs. Angels inspire us through the profound truths they embodyâ€”the timeless virtues of love, compassion, and unwavering faith.  Nobody knows this better than bestselling, award-winning author Jody Sharpe. She has devoted a major part of her life to writing about them. She recently announced a new initiative, 'Angel Inspirations', where she will present some of the wisdom she has gained as the result of her efforts. In a recent blog post, she wrote in part:  "Angels have surely been with me all my life. As a child I had shelter, comfort but parents who I couldn't totally rely on. Yet, I made it through decades of living making good choices along the way. Where did the resilience come from? It was faith, faith in the knowledge of a higher power that I call God. Sometimes contemplating this gift of life is overwhelming. The knowledge that billions of people have lived before me and during my lifetime is indeed humbling. But I have been given the ability to write positive stories about angels. How?  "After my daughter, Kate, passed away years ago, I met a man I know was an angel. He comforted me with his presence one day at a chance meeting in a store and then the next day of my vacation, there he was again unexpectedly walking up to me and my friend when we were an hour away in a different town and store. His presence and meeting helped me through the grief that encompassed my whole being. He inspired me to write novels about angels who appear as humans in a town where no one knows the secret. My fictional town of Mystic Bay that I write about have angels watching and guiding people in town just like I'm sure they do in our lives. I believe they encourage us through unseen and sometimes seen messages. Knowing angels are near inspires me to be as kind as I can be in all life's circumstances. To be resilient and have enthusiasm for life with no resentment toward others has changed my life.  "As I write my books I hope to inspire just one person to keep fire and gratefulness in their heart for the goodness in life."  The full text of the piece is available at http://jodysharpe.com/tuesdays-with-the-angels-angel-inspirations/.  Sharpe's message resonates with readers, offering a beacon of hope. She passionately champions the transformative influence of uplifting literature, which can provide a ray of optimism in the face of depression and anxiety. Her anti-bullying message illuminates a path towards healing and resilience. Readers will discover in her books a profound shift in perspective that will carry over into their daily lives. They serve as an invitation to view the world through a different lens, one that empowers us to find the strength within to see the good in all people.  Her most recent work, 20 Moon Road, An Angel's Tale, features a character from her Mystic Bay series, Madam Norma. Madam Norma is based on a woman who influenced Sharpe's life in a number of unforgettable ways. The book trailer is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqJxbFTE1U  Diane Donovan at Midwest Book Review stated, "Do angels come to children with special needs? In Mystic Bay, they do. As the truth emerges about the town's makeup, history, and mission, readers become immersed in a spiritual story of angels and beliefs that drive positive changes and kindness in the world and spread beyond the small town of angels.  "Sharpe's Mystic Bay series embodies hope, belief, the power of conviction and angel influences, and the acts of kindness that lead humanity on a better, gentler path. 20 Moon Road's revelations of relationships with Madame Norma that changed lives and transformed beliefs through documented angel sightings by special needs children makes for a warm tale of revelation and discovery that explores guardian angels, lasting legacies, and blessings.  "Libraries and readers looking for blends of fantasy and spiritual examination will welcome the Mystic Bay series as a whole and this latest addition in particular, which expands the nature, purposes, and insights of Mystic Bay upon the larger world outside its borders."  Mark Walker of Midwest Book Review said, "The last paragraph reflects the unique vision and mysticism, which exudes throughout this book:  As we fly away from the beach on a mission to help someone in need, I know what God and all angels know and what Madam Norma always shared. Only love can mend our hearts and our Earth. Only love can set us free. Madam Norma's life was simply made of pure love, for as she told me once, 'Kindness is the first ingredient of love.'  "I look forward to someday seeing the Mystic Bay Series on the Hallmark TV channel!"  Books by Jody Sharpe include:  To Catch an Angel - Jody is also the author of 'To Catch an Angel', written in memory of her late husband Steve. In 'To Catch an Angel', miracles happen in Mystic Bay, California, the town with the psychic and angel vibe. Angels are calling. Psychic Maggie Malone returns home to find she's swept up in the miracle of it all. She can't imagine why her mother left or who her father might be. But these questions pale in comparison to the wonder of the angels. Maggie meets writer, Noah Greenstreet. They realize they've met before, but where? Maggie and Noah embark on a journey to find our world is all awash with angels.  The Angel's Daughter - A secret lies in Mystic Bay, California, and only two people know it. First, there's Hannah, a tender curly-headed half-angel. Then there's her father, Gabe, an effervescent, teddy bear of a full-blooded angel.

Now he's written a book exposing the secret to the world.  Town Of Angels - Angel vs. Bully in the town of Mystic Bay, California, where a well-kept secret lies. Angels live as humans there.

And with the help of the indomitable oldest psychic in town, Madam Norma, the bully meets his match through the soft voices and intuitive minds of his neighbors.  Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  Her latest book, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California. While sleeping, an angel sent her a vision in a dream of a future event. Gayle realizes she must use her intuition to save an old man from drowning. But who is this old man?  With the help of intuitive attorney, Alex Knight, she finds they are caught in the middle of a future crime. But can Gayle and Alex solve the case and save the old man before it's too late? With surprising twists and turns of intrigue and love, Gayle and Alex find there are angels at the helm as they help prove the bully never wins.  In addition, on the "Tuesdays With The Angels" section of her site, Sharpe presents stories of real-life encounters with angels.
