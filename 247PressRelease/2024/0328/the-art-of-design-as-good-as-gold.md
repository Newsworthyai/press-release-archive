# The Art of Designâ€”As Good As Gold

IRVINE, CA, March 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 2024 Gold Nugget Awards invites real estate development professionals to showcase their finest work in this renowned design/planning competition. Submittals are due April 15, and builders, developers, planners, architects, designers and other industry professionals from throughout the U.S and internationally are encouraged to enter this renowned competition, which is integral to PCBC's annual trade show and conference. www.pcbc.com   Since 1963, the real estate development world has viewed Gold Nuggets as an industry bellweather for progressive design and planning, and for its recognition of those who improve our communities through exceptional development concepts. Themed as "The Art of Design," the 61st competition promises to sustain this tradition of excellence across a range of project types.   Maybe your best work transformed a vacant infill site into a thriving, mixed-use development. Perhaps you have a complex renovation story to tell, or your interior design showcases thoughtful responses to a new home floorplan. Or you have a fresh concept for supportive/transitional housing that you're eager to share.   Or maybe you create the best of the best in the bread-and-butter projects that serve thousands of renters and buyers in diverse locales. From custom homes, faculty housing, housing for seniors through attached and detached homes in multiple plan sizes and density yields, Gold Nugget likely has a category that your best work best fits. See www.goldnuggetawards.com for all 2024 categories.  "The benefits of winning a Gold Nugget honor reach far beyond the presentation ceremonies," said Greg Fuson, PCBC Vice President. "Colleagues, lenders and consumers pay attention and respect award-winners, especially when those winners leverage their honors, now and over time."   GNA Judging Chair and program administrator PMP (Peter Mayer Productions) Lisa Parrish emphasized that requirements for Gold Nuggets' online entries are streamlined for ease of use. "We're here to help you make sure that your entry is highly competitive, and to answer all your questions," she said.
