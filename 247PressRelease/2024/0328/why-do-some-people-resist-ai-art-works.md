# Why Do Some People Resist AI Art Works?

VANCOUVER, BC, March 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a Facebook discussion group, someone posted a black-and-white coloring page, and another person commented:  "Love this. Is AI involved in any way? If not, I'd love to color/post your pages."  Clearly, she was interested in coloring the pattern but hesitated if AI was involved. This hesitation underscores a broader debate regarding the essence of art and the identity of its creators.  Traditionally, art has been regarded as a purely human endeavor, a sacred domain where individual expression and personal touch reign supreme. Artists' craftsmanship and unique emotions imbue art with its soul, making the encroachment of AI into this realm a challenge to longstanding beliefs about authorship and creativity.  Can a machine encapsulate human experiences? Does AI earn a place among the creators we hold dear?  Kevin Kang, the founder of Coloring Kitchen, a website that offers free downloads of AI-generated coloring pages, shared his thoughts:  "As technology advances, the nature of creation evolves. Art, in its most basic form, is about evoking emotions, stimulating thoughts, and admiring beauty. Whether a piece is handcrafted by humans or generated by algorithms, its value lies in its ability to resonate with viewers. The development of AI as a tool for artistic creation isn't the end of human creativity but an invitation to expand it. It's an invitation for artists to explore new perspectives and for audiences to challenge their perceptions."  In conclusion, the true value of art lies in its power to stir human emotions; the focus ought to be on the artwork itself, not on its origin. We should welcome, not resist, the tools that augment our creativity. In the future we may see more collaborations between human artists and AI, by doing so, we probably can unlock new forms of art that continue to inspire and awaken our shared human spirit.
