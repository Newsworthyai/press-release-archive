"Of course, each client makes the final decision. But I'll point the way and explain why. They know I've got a special color sense."  Licensed as a stylist since 2018, Ana learned and honed her skills at the TONI&GUY Hairdressing Academy in Keller/Fort Worth.  Nowadays, Ana is the wonderfully content resident hair artist and operator of her Heavnly Hair by Ana G, offering hair color and women's cuts and men's cuts.  "When I'm coloring, how light or how dark to go, it's all about the details, which I'm totally into," says Ana. "At the end of the day, what gives me joy is making my clients happy.
