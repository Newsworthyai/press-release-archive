# Saving Today's Generation Of Girls - Building Resilience And Self Esteem Is The Answer Says Bestselling Author Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein

WILMINGTON, NC, March 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As children, we all had to learn to face the challenges the world presented to us. Today however, those challenges loom much larger and are more pervasive. Social media offers both connection and isolation. Loneliness, even in a world that is seemingly completely connected via smart phones and computers, exacerbates the vulnerability of our youth. The specter of school shootings forces us to equip elementary age school children with self-defense skills, while cyberbullying breeds depression and tragically, even suicide. As pixels outweigh spoken words, parents and educators grapple with how to help their children in this digital age.  These challenges are unique to this generation. They spawn anxiety, depression, and a profound sense of isolation among children, perpetuating damaging comparisons and cyberbullying. Amidst this mental health crisis plaguing American youth, attempting to overcome the effects of school shootings, climate change, the pandemic, and peer pressure on an individual basis, using approaches that are many decades old, is frankly impossible. We need new answers for new problems.  Bestselling author Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein has found the answer. She is on a profound mission: nurturing resilience and self-esteem in young girls—a goal embraced by mental health pros, parents, grandparents, and educators.
