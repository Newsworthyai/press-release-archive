"We are delighted to be part of this year's Parade," said Jim Perry, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of WPG Idaho. "We take pride in the new homes we offer and look forward to showcasing a design that reflects WPG's longstanding commitment to quality homes and neighborhoods."  Bald Eagle Point—in the city of Eagle, Bald Eagle Point is adjacent to the Boise River, with ready access to parks, trails and ponds, and close to shopping, dining and entertainment.

"Residence 10 epitomizes the appeal of Bald Eagle Point, with custom-caliber features and homesites close to neighborhood amenities," said Perry. "At Bald Eagle Point, buyers can choose a great design, and personalize that design from the many choices we offer."  Perry said Residence 10's design is especially popular with local move-up families. He noted pricing, plan flexibility and proximity to neighborhood amenities as key attractions, adding that availability includes move-in ready and under-construction homes.
