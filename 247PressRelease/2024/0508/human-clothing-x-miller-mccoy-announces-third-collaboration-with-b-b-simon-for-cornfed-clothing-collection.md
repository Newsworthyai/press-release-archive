From embellished jean jackets to plaid shirts, each garment is a harmonious blend of practicality and luxury, reflecting the robust spirit of the Midwest's farming community with an added touch of sophistication.  "Crafting each garment in the CornFed collection was a labor of love, blending traditional Midwest aesthetics with modern luxury." â€“ B.B.
