"In writing this book I sought to create a suspenseful thriller that was realistic by drawing upon my experience in the military and law enforcement. I have often thought of how letters are used to connect us with long lost friends and in this technological age we don't write letters as our parents did. Yet in the military, letters are the only thing that truly keeps us connected with the outside world and from this my book was developed,  "I seek to create characters that readers can relate to and see themselves in," concluded Prine. "The Letters is designed to be entertaining, thrilling, and suspenseful as possible. I am confident that readers will be glued to the story plot and be held in suspense until the last page."  Set in South Carolina, The Letters is a suspenseful thriller and romance with riveting characters.

Sam and her child are in danger from a crazed stalker. Mike must save both or lose Sam and her child forever. Written in a way that is a cross between Jack Reacher and Bosch, The Letters is a must a read book for 2024.
