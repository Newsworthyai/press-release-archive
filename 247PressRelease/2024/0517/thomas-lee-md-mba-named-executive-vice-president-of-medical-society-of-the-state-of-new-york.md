WESTBURY, NY, May 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Medical Society of the State of New York (MSSNY) today announced that it has named Thomas Lee, MD, MBA as its Executive Vice President. In addition to running a successful independent medical practice for more than 20 years, Dr. Lee brings to MSSNY a wealth of leadership and executive experience in medical professional organizations, medical regulatory agencies, and a hospital board. He has advocated for public health and other healthcare issues for 20 years at both the state and federal levels, including spearheading the passage of the NY State surprise medical bill into law.  "We are thrilled to have Dr. Lee join the MSSNY staff as Executive Vice President," said MSSNY President Jerome Cohen, MD. "He has been a MSSNY volunteer leader for many years and has been involved in various committees, including legislation and physician advocacy, finance, insurance, MSSNY-PAC, and several task forces. As a physician himself, he has a unique understanding of the needs of New York doctors."   "Dr. Lee has extensive experience helping a broad range of organizations and agencies navigate operational challenges," said MSSNY Board of Trustees Chair Nameer Haider, MD. "His expertise will be invaluable as MSSNY continues to work to support doctors and patients seeking improved access to quality, affordable health care."  "I am honored to join the MSSNY team as Executive Vice President," said Dr. Lee. "As a longtime volunteer leader of MSSNY, I have a unique perspective on the organization itself coupled with an understanding of what it means to practice medicine as a physician in New York."  "I look forward to bringing to MSSNY my expertise in the practice of medicine as well as operations, healthcare finance, political advocacy and fundraising for nonprofit institutions," Dr. Lee continued. "Physicians in our state face numerous challenges—chief among them are the exorbitant medical liability costs—and our goal is to have a robust organization that continues our mission to represent the interests of patients and physicians to assure all New Yorkers have access to quality healthcare services."  Dr. Lee's broad experience includes building an independent practice association (IPA) from the ground up—which involved membership recruitment, initiating clinical integration programs, and securing insurance contracts—and subsequently merging the operations. He helped engineer the further merger of the IPA with another to form an even larger IPA.  Dr. Lee served on the NY Governor's task forces on Delivery System Redesign Incentive Payment program implementation in 2015-16, and Out-of-Network Insurance Law Implementation in 2016-17. In these capacities, he worked in close cooperation with DOH, DFS and the Governor's Executive Office. He was Chair of St John's Riverside Hospital's Board of Trustees from 2012-2016 and the inaugural chair of its Audit and Corporate Compliance Committee.  A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Lee graduated magna cum laude with a BA in biochemistry from UC Berkeley. He graduated as a Dean's Scholar from UCLA's School of Medicine and completed his neurosurgery residency at the University of Miami. He is a board-certified neurosurgeon. Additionally, he received his MBA from George Washington University.  The author of approximately 40 peer-reviewed professional journal articles and book chapters in neuroscience and clinical neurosurgery, Dr. Lee received a Certificate of Congressional Recognition citing his "Leadership, Vision, Generosity and Outstanding Contributions to the Fields of Medicine and Neurosurgery."   Dr. Lee resides in Bronxville, New York with his family.  Founded in 1807, the Medical Society of the State of New York is the state's principal non-profit professional organization for physicians, residents and medical students of all specialties.
