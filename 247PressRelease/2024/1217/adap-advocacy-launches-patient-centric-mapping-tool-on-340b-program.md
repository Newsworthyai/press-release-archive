# ADAP Advocacy Launches Patient-Centric Mapping Tool on 340B Program

WASHINGTON, DC, December 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today, as part of its 340B Project, launched a patient-centric interactive digital mapping tool focusing on key data for the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The new 340B Map highlights how generally under the program, revenues for covered entities and executive compensation their CEOs have both skyrocketed since gaining eligibility to participate in the program. Additionally for hospitals receiving generous tax breaks, their uncompensated charity care is declining despite rising patient medical. The ADAP Advocacy-sponsored Ryan White Grantee 340B Patient Advisory Committee has increasingly focused on medical debt and its impact on patients living with chronic illnesses and rare diseases.  The 340B Map can be vied online here: https://340bmap.org.   Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, emphasized the importance of this new tool: "This new interactive map equips patients with yet another tool to monitor what is happening in their local communities relative to the 340B Program. Patients are increasingly learning that for big hospital systems and mega service providers this program is serving as a cash cow for them and their CEOs. ADAP Advocacy contends our focus should be on incentivizing smaller, community-based providers who are leveraging the program's rebates for their intended purpose: increasing patient access to care."  The 340B Map highlights increases in covered entities' revenues and executive compensation pre-eligibility under the program to the present day, as well as changes in charity care percentages for hospitals.
