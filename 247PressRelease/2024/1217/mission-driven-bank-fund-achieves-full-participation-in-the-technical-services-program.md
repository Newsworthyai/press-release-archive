# Mission Driven Bank Fund achieves full participation in the technical services program

CLEVELAND, OH, December 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Mission Driven Bank Fund (MDBF) today announced that all seven portfolio banks are actively participating in its technical services program, which provides targeted support to the Fund's portfolio banks to build organizational capacity. The participation rate is well above the program's 75% goal.   All MDBF portfolio banks have access to the technical services program upon a capital investment. The program, designed to be collaborative, has two key goals. The first is to promote sustainability by strengthening the bank's financial performance and building staff capacity. The second is to help banks better serve their communities by deepening or growing their existing clients, expanding service areas, and/or investing in technology to improve the customer experience.  The technical services program includes five main components:  •	Introductions or referrals to consulting services •	Access to tools, products, and services to help banks navigate the growing technology landscape •	Webinars and trainings •	Peer-to-peer mentoring •	Financial support to implement the program through a subsidy or complementary service  The technical services program is a key differentiator for MDBF as an investor and a critical tool to help achieve its mission of driving significant growth and financial resiliency in the mission-driven bank sector.   "When the FDIC developed the conceptual framework for the MDBF in 2021, we gathered input from numerous MDI and CDFI banks about needed services the Fund could provide," said Betty Rudolph, director of the Office of Minority and Community Development Banking at the FDIC. "The response was that capital investment alone wasn't enough. Banks asked us to include in the blueprint that the fund manager could provide advisory services such as strategic, financial, operations, and technology consulting support to complement the capital investments provided by the fund."  MDBF portfolio banks receive an annual subsidy to work on a technical services project. The banks use the subsidy to fund various needs, including improved marketing and communications materials, updated technology services, and talent recruitment solutions. The technical services team continuously seeks to improve the program through a formal evaluation process with portfolio companies.   "The early feedback is encouraging. Banks say the planning process for the annual subsidy is 'extremely easy' to facilitate, and "they wouldn't have engaged in their chosen project without the encouragement and support of the MDBF," said Devin Olmack, who leads the technical services program for the MDBF.   The MDBF seeks to expand its roster of consultants or organizations available to portfolio banks through the technical services program, particularly new technology solutions specific to the mission-driven banking sector.
