# Mike Speedy Tapped As Indiana State Chair For U.S. Term Limits

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, December 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, U.S. Term Limits announces that former State Representative Mike Speedy has agreed to be the Indiana State Chair for U.S. Term Limits. He is succeeding Micah Beckwith who was elected lieutenant governor of Indiana. Speedy brings a depth of both private and public service to this role. He has seen first-hand the need for term limits at the federal level and will work vigorously in his role as Indiana State Chair to see that the Indiana State Senate adopts a resolution for term limits. The Indiana State House passed the resolution earlier this year.  ""It has been a great honor to serve as the Indiana Term Limits Chairman," said Micah Beckwith "I strongly believe it is the way to transform Congress by allowing new voices and new idea. With my new role as your Lt. Governor, I am proud to hand this off to Mike. I look forward to working with him to see that Indiana joins the growing list of states passing the term limits resolution."  "I am very honored to be serving as the Indiana State Chair for U.S. Term Limits and succeed our new Lt. Governor Micah Beckwith who has been a tireless advocate for congressional term limits. Now more than ever before, the need for term limits is crystal clear. Polls show that this is the one issue where all Hoosiers, regardless of political affiliation, stand united.  "Serving in Congress has become, for many, a lucrative lifelong job rather than a public service. Term limits will help end career politicians and make Congress work better for all Americans," concluded Speedy.  "We are honored to have Speedy leading our efforts in Indiana," said Philip Blumel, President of U.S. Term Limits. "Under his guidance, I am confident we will get our term limits resolution passed in the Indiana State Senate."  Speedy was born in Beech Grove, Indiana, and grew up in Franklin and Columbus, Indiana and in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Like his late father before him, he earned his B.S. in Real Estate Finance from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. Speedy also attained a law degree from IU's McKinney School of Law at Indianapolis. A second-generation real estate investor, he runs a small real estate development business based out of Indianapolis. His company owns properties in three states. He maintains his law license and a designation Certified Commercial Investment Member.  Speedy credits his late mother for instilling a sense of duty to serve his community and protect its values and taxpayers. In 2024, Speedy retired from the Indiana House of Representatives after fourteen years of service. There he served as chairman of two committees, Financial Institutions and Environmental Committees, while being Vice Chairman of Roads and Transportation before that. At various points, he sat on the Judiciary, Employment, Labor, & Pensions, Utilities, Energy & Telecommunications Committees.  Prior to serving as a state representative, Speedy served on the Indianapolis City County Council for nearly seven years. In this capacity, he concluded his council services as Chairman of the Public Works Committee.   As an avid instrument-rated pilot, Speedy has nearly 2,000 hours experience. When not using his Kodiak 100 aircraft for business and family purposes, he enjoys flying humanitarian, ministerial and charitable missions. He has given many young people their first flight experience through the Experimental Aircraft Association's Young Eagles program. He serves on the board of the Aeronautical Center of Technology, a STEM school for high schoolers interested in aviation at the Indy Greenwood South Airport.  Speedy and his wife Amy reside near Acton, Indiana, and spend much of their time with their three young adult children and dog, Winnie. They also stay actively engaged in their community by attending meetings and events. They attend Living Word Bible Church of Indianapolis.  U.S. Term Limits is the largest grassroots term limits advocacy group in the country. We connect term limits supporters with their legislators and work to pass term limits at all levels of government, particularly on the U.S. Congress. Find out more at termlimits.org.
