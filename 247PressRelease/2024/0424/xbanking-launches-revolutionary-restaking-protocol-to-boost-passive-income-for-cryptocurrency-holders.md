# XBANKING Launches Revolutionary Restaking Protocol to Boost Passive Income for Cryptocurrency Holders

NEWARK, DE, April 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- XBANKING, a leading innovator in the cryptocurrency staking sector, is proud to announce the launch of its groundbreaking restaking protocol, designed to enhance passive income opportunities for cryptocurrency investors significantly.  With a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding $1 billion, XBANKING stands as one of the largest restaking protocols on the market, supporting a wide array of tokens across Ethereum, Solana, and The Open Network.  Restaking redefines the utility of staked assets by allowing them to be used for additional staking in different programs or platforms, thereby offering holders the chance to accumulate more rewards.  XBANKING's protocol enables users of ETH, SOL, or TON to connect to smart contracts, facilitating the reuse of their tokens for extra rewards, making it an attractive option for those looking to maximize their cryptocurrency holdings.  XBANKING has quickly positioned itself as the largest provider regarding the number of supported restaking tokens, offering high potential returns to its users. The restaking market has seen substantial growth in 2024, with Ethereum restaking, led by XBANKING, capturing most of the market's total value locked.  Supported tokens within the XBANKING ecosystem include, but are not limited to, stETH (Lido), rETH (Rocket Pool), oaETH (StakeWise), OETH (Origin), ETHx (Stader), WBETH (Binance), sfrxETH (Frax), mETH (Mantle), cbETH (Coinbase), ankrETH (Ankr), eETH (Rocket pool), swETH (Swell), hTON (Hipo), wsTON (Ton Whales), stTON (Ston fi), jitoSOL (Jito), BSOL (BlazeStake), EdgeSOL (Egevana), mSOL (Marinade), among others.  Plans to expand support to more tokens are underway, promising even greater flexibility and earning potential for users. The benefits of restaking are manifold. It promotes competition among security providers, lowers barriers for new protocols, and strengthens the resilience of Ethereum, Solana, and The Open Network against attacks.  Validators earn income through this process, and stakeholders can increase efficiency by diversifying their staked assets across multiple protocols.  "In addition to restaking, XBANKING offers staking services and liquid pools for over 140 tokens, with attractive APR yields," said Alexey Salashny, CEO at XBANKING. "Our mission is to provide cryptocurrency holders with innovative ways to maximize their investments, and our restaking protocol is a testament to this commitment."
