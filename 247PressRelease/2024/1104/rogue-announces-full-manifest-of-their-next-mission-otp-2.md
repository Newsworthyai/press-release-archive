# Rogue Announces Full Manifest of Their Next Mission: OTP-2

LACONIA, NH, November 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rogue Space Systems Corporation (Rogue) announces its next mission featuring new mission capabilities and a compliment of commercial hosted payloads. The OTP-2 spacecraft is planned to launch NET February 2025. The primary objective of this mission will be the testing of Rogue's developments in mission operations and algorithms for future In-Space Logistics services, requiring close-proximity maneuvering and docking. OTP-2 will have one undisclosed payload, a new propulsion system, an encryption system, a new edge computing device and 5 optical sensors in addition to the spacecraft's star tracker. Additionally, Rogue will carry out the demonstration and on-orbit testing of these four cutting-edge payloads that will uniquely augment OTP-2.   Rogue will be flying their next generation Scalable Compute Platform (SCP) to provide critical computer vision, autonomy, and AI computations through Edge Computing. Rogue will be using the SCP as a testbed for algorithms that will support future RPOD and Logistics operations like the new ASTRA autonomy system. Rouge will be testing ASTRA's ability to autonomously maintain the spacecraft's health and execute operational "goals" given to it by the operators, selecting appropriate actions to balance competing priorities and opportunities. Rogue is also offering commercial software hosting on board the SCP to customers to test out their algorithms in space. This effort will be supported by a customer test bench at Rogue HQ to confirm suitability before uploading to the satellite. https://rogue.space   OTP-2 will also have 5 cameras of two classes that directly interface with the SCP. Rogue anticipates using OTP-2 as a cooperative target for the next RPO capable mission OTP-3 planned for launch in 2026.   "This is a foundational next step for Rogue Space Systems, propelling us forward towards our vision of providing in space logistics services, and for establishing our credibility as a reliable in-space service provider" says Rogue's CEO, Jon Beam.   In addition to Rogue's own custom technology, OTP-2 will be flying three other hosted payloads for some of the most exciting newcomers to the space market.   Forward Edge AI will be flying their new Isidore Quantum® Space Encryptor to demonstrate protocol free quantum resistant encryption in a very small form factor. https://forwardedge.ai/product/   IVO Limited will be flying their new revolutionary Quantum Drive to demonstrate the world's first propellant free pure electric propulsion system. http://ivolimited.us   Rogue CRO Brent Abbott states "Our hosting program gives Rogue a unique perspective on new technologies that could enable our cutting-edge logistics offerings."   Customers that missed flying with Rogue on OTP-2 may still have the opportunity to fly with us on OTP-3, planned to launch in 2026. This will be a roughly 200kg bus with planned RPO/6DOF maneuvering capability, tremendous Delta-V, and a docking port for refueling and "maneuver without regret".
