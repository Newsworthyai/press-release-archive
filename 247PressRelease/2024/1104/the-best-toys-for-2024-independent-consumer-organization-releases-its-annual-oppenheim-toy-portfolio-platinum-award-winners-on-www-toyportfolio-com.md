# The Best Toys for 2024: Independent Consumer Organization releases its annual Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award Winners on www.toyportfolio.com

NEW YORK, NY, November 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Co-founder Stephanie Oppenheim will launch the award list on NBC's TODAY Show on November 5th.  Notable Trends in Toyland:  Wooden Toys. Parents are asking for more sustainable toys – and the industry is responding. Even major companies like Fisher-Price that usually focus on plastic toys, introduced a new collection of wooden toys.  Fun Props for Pretend. Our testers loved playing Barista with a coffee set designed for toddlers and a classic train set that will be enjoyed by preschoolers.   Building Sets. There are great builds this season. A classic Pirate Ship from Playmobil, a Space Theme set from Magna-Tiles and for older builders, LEGO Wicked: Emerald City.   Crafts. Activity kits with holiday-themed sets from Creativity for Kids, a fun Light Board from Crayola and very special jewelry sets from Super Smalls all got high marks from our testers.   Family Games and Puzzles. Our award list has so many engaging games that can be enjoyed by multi-generational family members. There are storybook puzzles, classic card games, board games as well as a new gaming console that calls for active play.   STEM toys. An old-fashion volcano kit, a VR Science Kit featuring Weather Events and dolls that represent different STEM careers – are all on our list this year. These are toys that are educational and fun - rather than just good for you.  The Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Awards are given to the most outstanding and innovative products of the year. The independent consumer organization was co-founded in 1989 by child development experts Joanne and Stephanie Oppenheim. The Oppenheims are Contributors to NBC's TODAY Show. Other notable awards: the Gold Seal Award is given to highly recommended products; Blue Chip Award honors classic products; and the Special Needs Adaptable Product Award recognizes toys most appropriate for kids with special needs.
