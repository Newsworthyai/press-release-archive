WILMINGTON, NC, November 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bijou Entertainment has announced that their action thriller novella, "50 Wanda Drive," will be available at no charge in ebook form November 6 through November 8, 2024 at Amazon.  In the darkly comedic chaos of this book, a yuppie housewife, touted as a hero for saving a cat, wages all-out war against two crazed dysfunctional robber-murderers who crash her celebration party and wreak havoc on friends and family.  Paige Martin's world spirals into danger amidst absurdity when her family's celebration is crashed by dysfunctional but cruel criminals Reed and Otis, two brothers whose philosophy is best summed up as "God Hates You. That's Why." What should have been a fun day escalates into a whirlwind ﬁght for survival, complete with a war-obsessed grandpa, a signiﬁcant cat, and homemade bombs.  As these intruders hatch a half-baked plan to exploit the family's connections, they're met with comical but deadly defense tactics courtesy of Paige with the help of her teenage son. The secluded woods become a backdrop for a circus of errors, with villains inadvertently sabotaging themselves amidst botched escapes, and an all-out confrontation that sees Paige evolving from an accidental hero to a master of improvised warfare.  "50 Wanda Drive" is a dark comedy with a spunky female protagonist who doles out suspenseful vigilante justice in true thriller fashion. The book upends the home invasion narrative, proving that in a battle against clowns, it pays to have a few tricks up your sleeve.
