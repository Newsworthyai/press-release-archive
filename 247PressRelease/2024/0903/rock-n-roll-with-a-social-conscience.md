# Rock N' Roll With A Social Conscience

VANCOUVER, BC, September 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rich Chambers' music is kind of retro, but not really. It hints at country, but it isn't quite that. It is a little bit modern rock and also a little bit pop. It's even a little bit bubble-gum pop (Chambers blames watching endless amounts of Partridge Family reruns as a kid for that). Essentially, his music is a little bit of everything, sitting comfortably in the crossroads of music genres. This is on full display in his latest socially conscious, guitar-driven single, "An Ode to Rishell."  In Chambers words: "An Ode to Rishell" is about teen pregnancy and the turmoil that will often precede and serve as a catalyst for this life-altering predicament. But it is also about the strength of the human spirit. From a societal perspective we sometimes put too much focus on failures than successes. So, with this song I wanted to celebrate the countless generations of young girls who in nine months had to become women—and they did!"  The song is receiving glowing reviews: "An Ode to Rishell" is more than just a song; it's an experience that invites listeners to reflect and connect on a deeper level. Rich Chambers proves once again that he is a master of Rock, and "An Ode to Rishell" is a shining example of his talent and vision." –We Write About Music   A little over three years ago, Rich had a life epiphany. He was looking into life's metaphorical mirror and asking himself, "Rich, music has, and always will be, your passion. Why then are you not going all in?" The middle-aged man staring back at him did not have an answer to this question, so despite his age and any preconceptions surrounding the notion that breaking into the music industry is only for the young, he decided right there to indeed go all in and follow his dream. And now, with approximately four million streams on Spotify, over three million views on YouTube, radio and press that is beginning to span the globe, and over 110,000 Facebook and 65,000 TikTok followers, people are taking notice!  With bombastic guitars and a vocal style that oozes rock n' roll, Rich Chambers, from Vancouver Canada, is giving us something that rock n' roll has not seen in quite some time—energy, thoughtfulness, and fun. His latest single, "An Ode to Rishell" is a thought- provoking testament to this. It's Rock N' Roll Reimagined!
