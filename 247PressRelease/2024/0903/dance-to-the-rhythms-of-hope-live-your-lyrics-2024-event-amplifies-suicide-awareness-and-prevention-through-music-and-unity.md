LAFAYETTE, CO, September 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This September, as we observe Suicide Awareness and Prevention Month, prepare to be moved by an extraordinary event that blends music, unity, and a profound mission at the 2024 Live Your Lyrics event. This powerful musical gathering is dedicated to breaking the silence on suicide, fostering open conversations, and supporting those in need, all while celebrating the strength of community and togetherness.  Date: Sunday, September 15, 2024 Time: 2:00 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. (Doors open at 1:00 p.m.) Venue: Nissi's Entertainment & Events Center, 1455 Coal Creek Dr., Lafayette, Colorado  A special thank you to Nissi's for hosting us! Your partnership exemplifies true community spirit.  Live Your Lyrics has become a beacon of hope and understanding, thanks to its visionary founder, Dave Sluiter. After experiencing the devastating loss of his partner to suicide, Dave was driven to illuminate the critical importance of suicide prevention. With his band, Lakota Ridge, Dave initiated an annual suicide awareness event at his church, which has since evolved into Live Your Lyrics.  "The inception of Live Your Lyrics was born out of a deep need to raise awareness and advocate for suicide prevention," Dave explains. "Our mission is to dismantle societal stigmas surrounding mental health and offer hope and alternatives to individuals contemplating self-harm or suicide."  This event promises a day filled with joy, music, and camaraderie, encouraging open dialogues about suicide and self-harm. This year, all proceeds will support Mental Health Partners (MHP), a local organization dedicated to providing expert mental health and substance use care. MHP's mission is clear: "Healing is our purpose. Help is our promise. Health is our passion." Their crisis center offers 24/7/365 walk-in care for those facing substance use issues or needing urgent mental health support.  Attendees will be serenaded by the soul-stirring melodies of three outstanding local bands: Funk Knuf, Hey Lady and Special Guest Pianist Brandon Swing. Each band will deliver a captivating 1.5-hour set, and Brandon Swing will play 30 to 45 mins, each generously donating their time and talent to this cause. Throughout the day, Live Your Lyrics also offers experiences for sharing and connection, creating opportunities for joy, new friendships, and meaningful conversations.  This event is made possible by the generous support of our hosts David Sluiter and Melodie Reagan, our sponsors Crazy Good Marketing, i2i Workforce, Azafran, PelleyConnects, and Red Rock Roofing, and our community partners Colorado Companies to Watch, First United Methodist Church of Lafayette, and ProsperBridge. Their dedication to this cause underscores the unity and determination that defines Live Your Lyrics.  Tickets are available for $25 (adults), $10 (ages 3-20), and free for children two years old and under. Purchase tickets at https://liveyourlyrics.life/.  Live Your Lyrics promises an unforgettable musical experience and a chance to unite for a critical cause. Let's stand together, embrace hope, and drive change. Join us at Nissi's on September 15th and be part of a movement that champions understanding, compassion, and life.
