# Nail and Beauty Bar Now Open at the Salon and Spa Galleria Bridgewood in Fort Worth, Texas

FORT WORTH, TX, September 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tieshia Johnson proudly announces the opening of her new Nail and Beauty Bar, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Bridgewood in Fort Worth, Texas.  A graduate of the Fort Worth Beauty School, Johnson is a licensed nail technician and has been working in the industry doing nails for 14 years. Referring to her salon suite as a "one-stop shop for your beauty needs," Johnson said the main reason she decided to enter the industry was because she enjoys helping people feel pretty.  "I really love playing a role in bringing out people's self-confidence and personality," Johnson said. "When my clients come in to get their nails and toes done, I'm helping them look and feel better."  One of the specialty services Johnson offers is Gel-X nail extensions. Molded from gel, Gel-X is a "soft extension," so it's flexible instead of rigid. Gel-X is cured before application to the nail, instead of after. Available in a variety of shapes, they can be trimmed and filed into any shape and length after application.   Open from 8 a.m-5 p.m. Monday-Saturday, the Nail and Beauty Bar is currently accepting new clients. Appointments can be made via the booking site or by sending a text to Johnson at (682) 597-8023.
