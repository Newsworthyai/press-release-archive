# Bestselling Author Norman Brewer's Domestic Terrorism Political Thriller Ebook, 'Blending In', Will Be Available At No Charge September 5, 2024 At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, September 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Norman Brewer has announced his compelling political thriller, 'Blending In' will be available in ebook form at no charge September 5, 2024 at Amazon.  The threat of domestic terrorism is unlike any other threat we must face in the US. To thwart such attacks, it is necessary to first predict, then prevent. That is no easy task. Authorities often struggle to monitor both activity and intentions. This requires a completely different approach. It involves massive resources, and sophisticated intelligence gathering. Domestic terrorism disrupts the very fabric of society, fostering an atmosphere of suspicion, division, and fear.  'Blending In: A Tale Of Homegrown Terrorism (The Anti-Hero Rebellions Book 1)' is a gripping exploration of domestic terrorism told through two protagonists who defy conventional stereotypes. Unlike typical portrayals of terrorists as isolated extremists, Stickman and Maple are everyday individuals who seamlessly blend into society while secretly plotting catastrophic attacks. This makes this narrative all the more compelling and thought-provoking.  The novel details planned attacks on two soft targets - including a press conference in Washington, D.C., and a bustling mall in the American Heartland. As other extremists rally to their cause, the tension escalates, leaving readers to grapple with the urgent question: can these homegrown terrorists be stopped? The story provides a haunting reflection on the nature of extremism and the thin veneer of normalcy that can mask the most dangerous threats, found right here in our streets.  Readers and reviewers have high praise for 'Blending In'. One Amazon reviewer said, "Fantastic read- the best I have read all year! Relaying the story from inside the homegrown terrorist mind is brilliant as it takes the reader through intertwining actions of terrorism. Too realistic for comfort . . . "  Another said, "Excellent, just excellent! Brewer has written an extremely interesting book. Very, very believable. Non-stop action. Taken together with his follow-up book, Killer Politics, he has raised the standard for this genre. I can't wait to see what he writes next!"  Another stated, "For fans of thriller novels, Blending In does not disappoint. Characters are well developed throughout the story, with non-stop action that is not only lively, but also frighteningly realistic.It's one of those books that can be easily imagined as someday becoming a movie."  The ebook version of 'Blending In' will be available at no charge on September 5, 2024 at https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0756KLHZM?ingress=0&visitId=8a27b798-3613-4155-9ef5-71cdf7e8bd00&ref_=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1.  'In Book 2 of the series, 'Killer Politics: A Satirical Tale of Homegrown Terrorism,' a Trump-like president inspires a white supremacist to launch attacks on innocents in a ruthless bid to incite civil war – and defend the "American way of life." Hoss, the supremacist, teams up with a "Most Wanted" terrorist to attack a rock concert, contaminate the food supply, destroy a reservoir, and flood homeowners living downstream. People die. Fear mounts. A rogue FBI agent is in hot pursuit. Razor-edged satire, aimed at a so-called President Tower, is "keen and stinging," one reviewer said.  Book 3 in the series is Brewer's latest political thriller, 'January 6: A Novel'. In this masterful political tale, democracy is assaulted when the President's rally morphs into a mob and storms the Capitol. Right-wing extremists take the House Speaker hostage, force a horrific standoff, and unleash terrorist attacks nationwide. The President weighs declaring martial law to restore order – and justify refusing to leave office.  General Michael Hayden, retired four-star Air Force general and former director of the CIA and National Security Agency said, "January 6: A Novel underscores my worries that the assault on the Capitol could happen again, defiling our freedoms and threatening our democracy."  In their review, Midwest Book Review stated, "Although a work of fiction, 'January 6: A Novel' provides genuine and vivid insider glimpses of what might come next in 2024 in real life. All kingdoms, empires, and nations throughout history have risen, flourished, and then fallen. America may not be an exception. Following a disputed election in 2020 and the possibility of an insurrectionist political candidate being once more defeated at the polls, the very real possibility of what is described in 'January 6: A Novel' makes it an unreservedly recommended addition to community and college/university library collections – and essential reading for those with interest in politics, terrorism, freedom, and the future of the United States of America."  Norman Brewer was interviewed recently on The Authors Show. His interview can be accessed at https://wnbnetworkwest.com/channel/1/?play=January%206%3A%20A%20Novel.
