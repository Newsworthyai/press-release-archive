# The 2nd World Invitational Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation successfully completed: "It will become an international event in the future."

PAJU, KOREA, November 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "I have been learning the Bible for a year through a Bible exchange program. I am truly happy to have learned that through the Word, I can awaken my spirit and live a happy life. As heaven chose me, I will now work hard to participate in God's work and do my best to lead everyone into God's family."  Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (hereinafter referred to as Shincheonji Church of Jesus) held the event at Shincheonji Cheongju Church located in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province. Buddhist religious leader Bharat Dashrath Sshat of Triratna Buddha Meditation, who completed the 2-day, 1-night event of the '2nd World Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation', said this.  He attended the World Invitation Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation held in Seoul for the first time last February, and was so moved by what he learned that he also participated in the second All Nations Invitation Lecture on the Book of Revelation. Shincheonji Church of Jesus stated many religious leaders participated in the second event because they could not forget the emotion and lingering emotions of the first event.  The universal invitation special lecture on the Book of Revelation began with the purpose of eliminating conflict and creating peace in the world by increasing mutual understanding between religions based on the scriptures.  Lee Man-hee, president of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, also said at the '1st World Invitational Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation', "The contents of the 'scriptures' of each religion may be slightly different, but there will be no significant difference in the fundamental content." He emphasized, "All Christians and religious people in each country must recognize and confirm each other based on their scriptures and now truly become one."  About 1,000 religious leaders from 57 countries who sympathized with this idea attended the second universal invitational special lecture on the Book of Revelation, held again after an 8-month hiatus. The scale is more than 10 times larger than the number of religious leaders who attended the first session, which was about 80 people from 27 countries. All those who attended came to Korea at their own expense with the intention of realizing peace. It is evaluated that these minds came together to truly realize a 'place of great religious unity'.  They started by attending the 115th joint graduation ceremony of the Zion Christian Mission Center held at the same location on the 30th of last month, and on the 31st, they were introduced to Shincheonji Church of Jesus and learned about the fulfilled Book of Revelation. Also, during a time of prayer for global peace, people came together despite their different religions.  On the last day, the 1st of November, religious leaders from Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam represented each religious denomination and gave speeches about the Book of Revelation that they had been learning about, receiving cheers and applause from the attendees. Among them there were those who were participating in the 'Peace Center' created by religious leaders who had attended the first universal lecture on the Book of Revelation after returning to their home countries.  Monk Hyeonsan, who represented Buddhist religious leaders, gave a speech on Revelation 1:1-8, and said, "We have established and run an association for the disabled and a school for the disabled in order to create a merciful world without prejudice. By chance, I learned about Chairman Lee's peace movement, and I am also working to become a member of the peace service and learning about the Bible."  Monk Hyeonsan then said, "I realized the greatness of the Book of Revelation while I was learning it." He also confessed, "I think the Book of Revelation is great because we can see a new world through it, and because of that world, we have gained insight into a new world."  Swami Shaileshand, CEO of Giri Shant Advait Ashram Center, who followed Monk Hyeonsan as a representative of Hindu religious leaders, gave a speech on Chapter 4 of the Book of Revelation. At the end of his speech, he said, "I am studying at the 'Peace Center' to experience various religions in order to perfect my enlightenment." He also said: "When I talk about religious harmony and peace, people raise questions, but I strongly say that it will happen and that the world will look to Korea."  Following speeches by religious leaders from each religious denomination, Chairman Lee appeared as a special lecturer on the Book of Revelation. Chairman Lee said, "Heaven and God are one. In order to become one, we need to talk and introduce each other. If anyone in the world wants to compare scriptures, they can come to Shincheonji Church of Jesus and compare. We want to open the door wide and become one," he emphasized.  He continued, "We must open the door to dialogue with everyone. There is no reason to refuse," he said. "To understand the Word, you must dig and dig to understand it 100%. You have to dig to the end and know what's right and what's wrong," he added.  After Chairman Lee's lecture, all attendees raised the 'O' sign in response to the moderator's question about continuing word exchange and cooperation to make the world a peaceful world by cooperating with Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The sign and peace center plaque presentation ceremony followed.  At the end of the 2nd World Invitational Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation, a female pastor from India said, "I read a lot about the Book of Revelation, but I didn't know anything about it. But now that I know that the Book of Revelation has been opened so brightly, I am just grateful," she said. "I think it is my mission from now on to learn it well and teach it to the saints of our church. Furthermore, I will spread it to all Indian people who do not yet know the fulfillment of this Book of Revelation," she said.  Pastor Koroi from Fiji also said, "Through today's lecture, it was an opportunity to hear exactly how the Book of Revelation was fulfilled and confirm the truth. When I return (to Fiji), I will take the truth with me, and I will share everything I experienced here." "I plan to play the role of spreading the word," he said.  In addition, many religious leaders confessed that it was a motivation for their religious growth, saying, 'I want to come and learn with fellow religious leaders at the third event,' 'I will return to my country and spread the excitement of this day,' and 'This program will be used internationally in the future.'  Meanwhile, during the 31st itinerary, a documentary was watched, 'Great Heritage: Mindanao', which tells the story of how Catholics and Muslims ended the conflict and chose peace on the Philippine island of Mindanao, where they had been at odds for 40 years without understanding each other.  An official from Shincheonji Church of Jesus said, "After the All Nations Special Lecture on the Book of Revelation held last February, there have been consistent inquiries from religious leaders who returned to Korea saying, 'I want to participate in the program again with fellow religious leaders. In this way, I believe that the foundation for international religious harmony is being built as religious leaders from around the world act as a catalyst for exchange of scriptures and realization of peace. "We will do our best to advance this," he said.
