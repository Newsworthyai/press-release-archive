In his sermon at the graduation ceremony, Chairman Lee Man-hee said, "Shincheonji Church of Jesus masters the entire Bible, including the Book of Revelation. How proud and good this is," he said, emphasizing, "Let's not condemn or persecute each other, but rather cooperate and help each other to make our country truly shine."  Nevertheless, the number of graduates this time was the largest in the history of a single denomination, and the fourth time after 2019, 2022, and 2023, that the number exceeded 100,000. Although the location was changed in one day, traffic guidance and service were provided with an emphasis on safety and order, so the event ended smoothly without a single safety accident.  On this day, about 10,000 overseas graduates and 1,000 domestic and foreign religious figures attended the Shincheonji Cheongju Church. Additionally, there were 3,377 pastors who completed the course on this day, and there are 6,203 pastors currently taking classes at the Zion Christian Mission Center.  In addition, a special performance was held in the square in front of the Shincheonji Cheongju Church building to encourage religious people to stop conflict and hostility and come together to end war and achieve peace, which received loud applause from attendees.  Graduates who were unable to attend due to limited space participated in the graduation ceremony online on the same day at each Shincheonji Church of Jesus and overseas churches across the country.  Chairman Man-hee Lee said to the graduates, "In the Bible, it is said that the tree of life bears 12 kinds of fruit every month. You are the reality," he said, congratulating them, saying, "Therefore, I am so grateful and grateful for this completion that I cannot express in words."  Chairman Lee also said, "I must have a grateful heart for the church where I grew up. Because of that church, I was able to receive the word and grace," he said. "It is a believer's freedom to choose which church to attend. The important thing is to teach the Word to people who don't know it, so that we can learn and grow together," he explained.  Lastly, he said, "Now that you have completed the course, I hope you can freely give the words you learned to many people. This is the basis of being a believer who has received grace and is also an expression of gratitude. Let's not swear or curse in any way. Even if we are persecuted, let us do good deeds," he urged.  After receiving the certificate, graduate student Kang, who presented his speech as a representative, attracted attention by revealing that he served as a pastor in the Presbyterian Church of Korea for 25 years and that he still runs a church.  He said, "I thought I should learn properly, and after taking a course at the Zion Christian Mission Center for three days, I fell in love with the word of truth, and immediately started preaching in worship using the word I had learned. I was once again deeply touched and blessed by the sight," he said.  He also said, "After signing an MOU with Shincheonji Church of Jesus, church members' participation in worship, evangelism, and volunteer work became more enjoyable and active, and the church also found vitality." He added, "On the 11th, all members were confident and changed the sign to Shincheonji Church of Jesus," he said.
