# Parent Coaching Institute Fall Conference: A Success!

BELLINGHAM, WA, November 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Parent Coaching Institute (PCI) proudly announces the successful completion of their fall conference. Held in Chicago at Eaglewood Resort, current students, recent graduates and seasoned PCI Certified Parent Coaches® gathered to exchange ideas and mutual inspiration. Gloria DeGaetano, founder and CEO explains: "We intentionally chose Chicago as our location since it is centrally located and easier for parent coaches from both coasts to attend. And, of course, we had our international community on Zoom, as well. The last time we were at Eaglewood was in 2014. It was wonderful to be back. Their service is reliable and the food, always outstanding—more than expected."  A lot of learning took place during the weekend. Presentations included a panel discussion on how three graduates have built their successful parent coaching practices, each in their own way, highly individualized. This gave a vision, and possibly a signature plan, to those still studying with PCI to become parent coaches. Emily Schweppe, PCI's Communications Coordinator points out, "The PCI Conference in September allowed participants to spend the weekend learning, collaborating and networking with our peers. Much was gained by all participants whether it was from the thought-provoking speakers or the lasting relationships that were made."   The Parent Coaching Institute is committed to growing a global community of like-minded professionals dedicated to supporting parents in these stressful and complex times. Recognized by Life Coach Magazine as the overall front runner for parent coach training, PCI attracts highly skilled professionals to its year-long Parent Coach Certification® program. The conference gathering is one of the add-on values of getting to know others in this dynamic community serving parents worldwide.  Emily Schweppe, who went through PCI's parent coach training adds her thoughts: "As a recent grad, this was my first time attending a PCI Conference and it was nothing short of energizing! There were so many a-ha moments to take into my new business and I was deeply inspired not only by the presenters, but by the informal discussions with other participants. The energy of being with like-minded individuals is invigorating. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow from the connections that I made over the weekend."
