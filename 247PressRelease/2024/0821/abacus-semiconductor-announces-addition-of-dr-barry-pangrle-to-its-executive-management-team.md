# Abacus Semiconductor Announces Addition of Dr. Barry Pangrle to its Executive Management Team

SAN JOSE, CA, August 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Barry Pangrle is a Co-Founder of Esperanto Tech and prior to joining Abacus Semiconductor Corporation, he worked at Nvidia, SiFive, Synopsys and Mentor Graphics (now Siemens EDA); he is an early proponent for the RISC-V ISA and a toolset luminary. His 30-year career in Silicon Valley has encompassed leading teams in fabless semiconductor startups and EDA companies designing new and innovative products. For the past two decades he has specialized in power analysis, management and optimization starting with revitalizing the Synopsys Power Compiler and PrimePower R&D teams circa 2002 which led to tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue for these products. He has twice led the design methodology and flow efforts starting from scratch at fabless semiconductor startups XStream Logic and later at Esperanto Technologies. Pangrle received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Engineering both from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.   Dr. Pangrle states that "the days of compute in software on a CPU (Central Processing Unit) are in their sunset, and the recent trend towards GPGPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) Compute will give way to more efficient heterogeneous compute with a variety of special-purpose accelerators directed by RISC-V CPUs."   Dr. Axel Kloth, Founder and CEO of Abacus Semiconductor Corporation, says "I am proud to have Barry join the Executive Management Team at Abacus Semi, as this is a major endorsement of our technology, of the existing team, and of the outlook into the future. Barry is a huge asset to the company and to the industry. His insights are invaluable."
