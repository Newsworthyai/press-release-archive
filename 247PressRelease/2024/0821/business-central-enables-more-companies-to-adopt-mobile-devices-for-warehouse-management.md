# Business Central Enables more Companies to Adopt Mobile Devices for Warehouse Management

EDMONTON, AB, August 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Insight Works, a leading Independent Software Vendor (ISV) specializing in manufacturing and distribution apps for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, proudly announces a fast and effective solution to deploy a warehouse management system (WMS) that transforms warehouse operations from paper-based processes to mobile devices and barcode scanning with the Warehouse Insight app with limited interruption to existing operations. This quick deployment highlights Insight Works' commitment to delivering efficient, user-friendly WMS solutions that drive warehouse accuracy and productivity. With Warehouse Insight, you'll improve warehouse accuracy and boost efficiency through seamless mobile devices and barcode integration.  Transitioning from paper-based to mobile devices and barcode scanning with the Warehouse Insight app modernizes warehouse operations by eliminating the inefficiencies of manual processes. Traditionally, warehouse workers rely on clipboards to record information or pick orders, which they must manually enter into a computer system—a time-consuming and error-prone process. With mobile computers, workers access warehouse documents in real-time, directly inputting data and reducing the risk of errors.   This modernization improves productivity, cuts costs, and ensures more accurate inventory tracking, significantly minimizing discrepancies and maintaining optimal stock levels. With comprehensive setup assistance, hands-on training, and ongoing support, Insight Works empowers businesses to adopt barcoding technology rapidly, achieving operational efficiency without the typical challenges or delays.  "Our goal is to help businesses transition to a digital Warehouse Management System (WMS) by integrating mobile and barcode technologies with Business Central," said Brian Neufeld, Director of Marketing at Insight Works. "This approach redefines operations, reduces errors, and ensures precise, efficient management throughout the warehouse, all while being straightforward to implement with the Warehouse Insight app."  Why Warehouse Insight  The Warehouse Insight app, designed for Dynamics 365 Business Central, is a comprehensive warehouse management system (WMS) that streamlines warehouse operations and enhances efficiency by eliminating manual data entry, reducing errors, and providing real-time inventory visibility.
