# Author Saverio Monachino Announces Bestseller Status, And A New Ebook Giveaway For 'Little Bit of Faith', His Psychological Fiction Thriller

WILMINGTON, NC, August 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Saverio Monachino amalgamates an odd collection of authors like John Irving, Tom Robbins, and Louise Penny into one, and the servings he presents—psychological fiction thrillers—come complete with a side order of comedy. Saverio believes adding a bit of humor helps wash down the truth while he discusses how open to interpretation the human condition can be.  Monachino announced that his latest psychological thriller, 'Little Bit of Faith', recently achieved bestseller status in the Mystery Thriller and Suspense category in the Kindle store.  Saverio Monachino's traumatic brain injury left him in a coma. It took a while but, when he made it back to a conscious state, he had an amazing story to tell. That became the basis for 'Little Bit of Faith'.   The book is a masterful work of fiction that is unlike any medical thriller available today. Through skillful storytelling and rich character development, the book offers a captivating and often humorous exploration of the creativity of the human mind and the interconnectedness of all existence. The book is multifaceted, in that it leaves readers pondering the nature of true faith, the boundaries of one's perception, the foundations of belief itself, family love, religious fanaticism, and the meaning of existence. There is a message. It is one word, four letters.  Dr. Selwood (a neuropsychologist) had a real doozy of a case assigned to her: Dr. Arthur McAiden. When McAiden first began his outpatient stint at the Kessler Institute he had trouble stringing cognitive sentences together. Selwood suggested he write his thoughts down, and so he did. At first, he wrote of the accident itself, which had her wondering how, if he was comatose, he knew what he did. Then his story moved on and intertwined his recovery process with what she believed to be a work of fiction. If he was trying to have fun at her expense, she did not know. Either way, it didn't matter, but when he moved on and began describing his take on the triune others have used to describe his faith, she wanted to file this away in the circular trash can beside her desk. Then one of his characters came to life and paid her a visit. While her patient had struggled to re-enter the three-dimensional space those living on earth call home, Dr. Selwood, in turn, now struggled to accept the continuum of life Arthur had presented to her.  In a recent interview with Theresa O'Brien, published in the Lehigh Valley Press and titled "The Power Of Love And The Nature Of Belief", Obrien wrote, "Nearly 20 years ago, a pharmaceutical researcher and novelist was in a horrific accident. He spent weeks in intensive care and inpatient rehab, followed by several months in outpatient rehab. As he worked to regain his ability to move the thoughts in his brain to orally expressed ideas, he also remembered things about his first weeks of inpatient treatment, and he wrote.  "What he remembered, what he wrote, and his musings on the nature of belief and the power of love became the book "Little Bit of Faith," which he published under the same pseudonym, Saverio Monachino, as his previous works of fiction. Some of his fictional characters have personalities based on people in his real life, and to protect their privacy, he does not use his real name in his literary professional life.  "The book is a complex tale in which Dr. Arthur McAiden gives his therapist, Dr. Emily Selwood, a written account of his accident and various intersecting narratives around it. Selwood reads the account and uses it to determine that McAiden has recovered cognitively and can be discharged from therapy. It is only after she meets characters from McAiden's account whom she assumed were fictional that she begins to wonder what is real, and how we can tell."  The full text of the interview is available at Monachino's website at https://comicfictionnoir.com.  The ebook version of 'Little Bit of Faith' will be available at no charge August 20 and August 21, 2024 at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Saverio-J.-Monachino/author/B002BMEFXS?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2&qid=1723671609&sr=1-2&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true.  He will also appear the Doylestown Bookshop at 16 S Main St, Doylestown, PA 18901 on August 31 from 1pm to 3pm. Several other local authors will be in attendance.   Monachino is also the author of a murder mystery titled "By Any Means." Leaking top-secret information to the Press happens all the time. Just ask those holding office in Washington D.C. Up north in Montreal, Inspector Gervais has experienced a perfect storm of this art form. Gervais's story started on a typical summer night with a slightly overweight grocer sitting on the roof reciting poetry, dressed from head to toe in leather, and watching a man in the alley commit murder … with a hard salami. His life literally falls into the hands of the good Inspector, and that's when the fun begins. "What," Inspector Gervais wants to know, "do an overweight grocer, Batman, tax attorneys, a dysfunctional Italian family, city politics, and an esoteric secret society that may or may not be the remnants of the Knights Templar have in common?" Not much, but this is all he has to go on as he races to solve a gruesome murder By Any Means. Montreal in the summertime can be fun; murder can be funnier.  Saverio Monachino is available for media interviews and can be reached by email at r1234f56r@yahoo.com.  More information is available on his website at https://comicfictionnoir.com.   "A Little Bit of Faith" and "By Any Means" are available on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Saverio-J.-Monachino/author/B002BMEFXS?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2&qid=1723671609&sr=1-2&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true.  About Saverio Monachino:  Saverio Monachino has worked in the Bio-Pharmaceutical arena in various regions of the U.S. and Canada (and dragged his family along with him). He had discovered compounds that advanced into clinical trials while managing large R&D teams. Things happen, life changes, comas come and when lucky, they go, and now, as a TBI survivor, he has had to, as the saying goes, 'move the cheese'. Now, he lives, writes, and has fun.  One book he co-authored, "Frenchtown New Jersey: History Along the River," during his free time while helping run a bookstore in Frenchtown NJ. During his recovery process, he also organized a radio theatre troop which performed both on air and on stage and, more recently, became a founding member of a very distinguished philosopher's guild where old men can pontificate on any topic they wish while asking the proverbial question 'is anyone listening to me?'. Of course, first and foremost, writing about the experiences within his head while comatose is what drives his works of fiction.
