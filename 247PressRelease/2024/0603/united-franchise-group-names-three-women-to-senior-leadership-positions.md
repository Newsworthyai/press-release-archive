WEST PALM BEACH, FL, June 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- United Franchise Group™ (UFG), home to an affiliated family of brands and consultants, has appointed three highly experienced employees to key positions. The appointees, all women, bring impressive credentials to their new roles with the franchise industry giant.  The company promoted Meghan Fletcher to Director of Launch Services and Donna Wichman to Vice President of Operations for the UFG brand Signarama. It hired Cathy Jean-Louis as Director of Compliance.  "We're proud to announce the appointment of these dynamic women, two of whom have contributed immeasurably to our industry and this company and one of whom impressed us with her outstanding skills and experience," said Ray Titus, CEO of United Franchise Group. "I'm confident that their appointments will make United Franchise Group an even more powerful force in building our brands and teams."  Director of Launch Services Meghan Fletcher, CFE, was promoted from her position as Director of Compliance, where she oversaw the franchise locations compliance program and ensured alignment with the company's brand standards. She is known for her keen attention to detail, leading design improvements to internal control structures, and ability to implement effective processes and procedures. Fletcher started at UFG seven years ago and has since held several positions in the company with various responsibilities including operations, business development, and compliance. However, one thing has remained constant throughout her career: her passion for supporting UFG franchise owners, which is why Fletcher is perfect for this position. In her new role, she will oversee the launch department and will work hand-in-hand with new franchise owners as they launch their business to ensure a seamless process and provide support to new franchise owners along the way.  Stepping into Fletcher's previous role, newly hired Director of Compliance Cathy Jean-Louis brings a multidisciplinary background spanning many industries, including human resources, hospitality, healthcare, technology and energy. Jean-Louis' strong organizational awareness, business acumen and attention to detail have allowed her to be successful at managing multiple complex projects and driving strategic corporate initiatives. She holds a bachelor's degree in communications from Florida International University. In this role, Jean-Louis will oversee location compliance programs and monitor operating procedures to ensure franchise owners are upholding brand standards. In addition, she will review and continue to enhance existing processes and procedures to provide the best experience possible for current and future franchisees.  Signarama Vice President of Operations Donna Wichman joined United Franchise Group nine years ago as an executive assistant and worked her way up the ranks through various roles. Most recently, she held a senior position in the company as the Vice President of Operations for its franchise brands. In that role, Wichman, along with her team of 12, ensured that all franchisees opened their businesses as quickly and efficiently as possible. In her new role with Signarama, she will provide support and guidance to franchisees regarding operations and ensure that all adhere to brand standards and achieve success. Additionally, she will enhance the brand's operational standards, oversee the integration and management of technology solutions and systems, customer service initiatives and new location openings. She will continue to be at the helm of the planning and executing of the company's Expo, responsible for the entire trade show component and securing vendors. She serves as a mentor for the UFG Mentor Program, where she works to enhance employee skills, boost team morale, and foster a culture of learning and development. She has a bachelor's degree in business administration and a wealth of experience in project management.
