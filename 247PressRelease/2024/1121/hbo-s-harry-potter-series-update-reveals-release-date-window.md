# HBO's Harry Potter Series Update Reveals Release Date Window

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an interview with Deadline, Bloys confirmed that pre-production has officially begun, with writing and casting already underway.  "Writers have started. [Director] Mark Mylod has started," Bloys shared. "The team is in the process of hiring department heads, casting, and we're off."  Warner Bros. Television recently announced an open casting call in the UK to find the new Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. The call specifies that the actors should be between 9 and 11 years old by spring 2025, though that doesn't necessarily mark the start of production.  "We haven't announced any production start date," Bloys said. "The casting call mentioned age in March, but that doesn't mean a production date."  Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav revealed plans to launch the Harry Potter series in 2026. Bloys confirmed that timeframe but noted the possibility of delays.  "Late '26-'27," Bloys stated when asked about the series' potential release. "Writers are just getting started, so it's too soon to lock in an exact airdate."  Who Is Involved in the Harry Potter Series? In June, Francesca Gardiner was appointed showrunner and writer for the Harry Potter series, with Mark Mylod set to direct multiple episodes. Both Gardiner and Mylod have worked together on HBO's award-winning drama Succession, which positions the series in strong hands.  Each season of the Harry Potter series will adapt one of J.K. Rowling's seven books, starting with The Philosopher's Stone and continuing through Deathly Hallows.  Executive producers for the series include J.K. Rowling, Neil Blair, Ruth Kenley-Letts, David Heyman, Gardiner, and Mylod. The series is a production by HBO in association with BrontÃ« Film and TV, and Warner Bros. Television.  Although there has been enthusiasm for the series, reactions have also been somewhat divided, with some fans expressing excitement for the new take while others have concerns over revisiting such a beloved franchise. Regardless, with the backing of a powerhouse team and top-notch creatives, Harry Potter is poised to become one of HBO's tentpole projects.
