Norton, 2012), won a 2013 ASCAP Award and the 2016 Prix Des Muses in France; it has been published in six languages and has helped catalyze the global movement for social change through music. Tunstall is the co-founder and advisory editor of The Ensemble, the foremost communications hub for the international field of music education for social impact. She is a frequent speaker and consultant in the field and led the formation of the El Sistema New Jersey Alliance, the first U.S. statewide alliance of programs.
