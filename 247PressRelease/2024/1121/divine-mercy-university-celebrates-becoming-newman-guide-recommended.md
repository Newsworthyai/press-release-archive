# Divine Mercy University Celebrates Becoming Newman Guide Recommended

STERLING, VA, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Cardinal Newman Society announced that Divine Mercy University is now recommended in The Newman Guide. The Newman Guide is the trusted hallmark of faithful Catholic education and an important guide for Catholic families. Divine Mercy University is the first Catholic graduate program focused on psychology and counseling and one of the first of seven graduate institutions nationwide to achieve this honor.   "We are thrilled to hold up Divine Mercy University as a model of faithful Catholic education," says Kelly Salomon, Vice President of Newman Guide Programs at The Cardinal Newman Society. "Catholic families rely on The Newman Guide to find the best in Catholic education, and we are excited to point students and parents to the faithfully Catholic graduate programs at Divine Mercy University."   "Our society today often distorts the truth about the human person, but Divine Mercy University upholds the Catholic understanding of the human person, showing the unity of faith and reason," Salomon continued.  The Cardinal Newman Society recently began to recognize graduate institutions for their commitment to faithful Catholic education. A Newman Guide Graduate Program strives for the very best in Catholic education and stands as an exemplar for other programs nationwide.  "It is a great joy for us to be recommended by the Cardinal Newman Society," said Fr. Charles Sikorsky, LC, President of Divine Mercy University. "Over the years we have been blessed by a plentiful number of students who received their undergraduate degrees from Newman institutions. We have found that these students have a solid foundation in the liberal arts and a Catholic worldview that prepares them extremely well for a graduate education that brings Christ and the wisdom of the Church to the field of mental health. We are hopeful that many more will join us to become the professionals God needs for the future."   The Cardinal Newman Society's criteria for recognition are derived from guidance provided by Church councils, popes, Vatican congregations, bishops conferences, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and other Church documents.
