# America's leading farm futurist Jack Uldrich wraps up 2024:

MINNEAPOLIS, MN, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- America's leading agricultural futurist Jack Uldrich concludes a transformative year of speaking engagements with two significant keynotes designed to bring cutting-edge insights to farming communities in Montana and Indiana.   Uldrich, whose work continues to shape the conversation about agriculture's future, will deliver powerful presentations on the convergence of technology and farming at AgWest's annual convention in November and, in December, he will be the keynote speaker at the Indiana Farm Bureau's annual conference in French Lick, Indiana.  The presentations, which focus on "The Future-Proof Farm" and "Agriculture's Age of Intelligence," showcase Uldrich's expertise in emerging agricultural technologies and their practical applications for modern farming operations.   Drawing from his latest book, "A Smarter Farm: How Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Agriculture," Uldrich engages audiences with insights into breakthrough developments in autonomous machinery, precision agriculture, and climate-smart farming practices.  "As we approach 2025, agriculture stands at a pivotal moment. The integration of artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced data analytics isn't just changing how we farm â€“ it's redefining what's possible in agriculture," said Uldrich. "From Montana's vast grain fields to Indiana's diverse agricultural landscape, farmers are embracing technologies that were once considered science fiction."  Throughout 2024, Uldrich has addressed over 40 agricultural organizations, including major industry leaders such as the American Farm Bureau, Bayer, Compeer, CHS, FCCS, Land O'Lakes, Keystone Cooperative, The Kentucky Commodities Group, Nutrien, Pipestone, the U.S. Soybean Council, Vermeer, and numerous state farm bureaus. His presentations combine deep agricultural knowledge with an understanding of emerging technologies, helping farming communities prepare for and adapt to rapid technological change.  The Montana and Indiana events will highlight critical developments in agricultural technology, including advances in soil sensors, drone technology, weather prediction systems, and sustainable and regenerative farming practices. Attendees will also gain practical insights into implementing these technologies and understanding their potential return on investment.
