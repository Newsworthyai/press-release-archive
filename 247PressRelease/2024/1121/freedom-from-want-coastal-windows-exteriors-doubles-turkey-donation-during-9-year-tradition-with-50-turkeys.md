# "FREEDOM FROM WANT" — Coastal Windows & Exteriors Doubles Turkey Donation During 9-year Tradition with 50 Turkeys

BEVERLY, MA, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Coastal Windows & Exteriors is proudly carrying on its Freedom from Want tradition for the 9th consecutive year by doubling its turkey donations in response to heightened community needs. This year, the local, woman-owned home remodeling company will donate 50 turkeys this Thursday November 21st to North Shore residents at the The Open Door Food Pantry. They also donated 25 Thanksgiving fixin' food bags to Beverly Bootstraps last week. Inspired by Norman Rockwell's 'Freedom from Want,' the company's annual campaign supports its ongoing mission to give back to the community–especially as local food insecurity continues to rise. The Open Door Food Pantry reports a double-digit increase in requests for food assistance in 2024, underscoring the urgent need for a warm turkey dinner on the table for local families this holiday season.   "We deeply appreciate the trust that so many North Shore homeowners have placed in us to protect and secure their most important investment, their homes," says Stephanie Vanderbilt, owner of Coastal Windows & Exteriors. "In response to that trust, we've made it part of our mission to give back to the communities we serve in whatever way possible. This Thanksgiving, we're doing so on behalf of our current October and November customers, which makes the gesture even more fulfilling."  The purchasing of turkeys and fixin' bags is a true community effort and event. Each year, the Thanksgiving turkeys are purchased from Henry's Market by Coastal Windows & Exteriors and donated to The Open Door.   "Henry's Market is excited to once again have the opportunity to partner up this holiday season with our good friends at Coastal Windows & Exteriors," says Mike Halle, Operations Manager at Henry's Market. The challenges brought forth by the increased cost of living have caused a dramatic increase in food insecurity throughout the North Shore. Stephanie and her team make it a priority to creatively find ways to assist people in need, and we're proudly here to help lend support in that noble cause."   The mission of The Open Door is to alleviate the impact of hunger in our community, using practical strategies to connect people to good food, to advocate on behalf of those in need, and to engage others in the work of building food security. With the request for food assistance increasing by double in the last year, the turkey dinner donation from Coastal Windows & Exteriors is more paramount than ever.   "Thanksgiving dinner is more than just a meal; it's a time to make memories with loved ones and share in the joy of the season," said The Open Door President and CEO Julie LaFontaine. "We are grateful to partners like Coastal Windows who step up to support the community, ensuring that families can maintain their cherished holiday traditions even when times are tough."  The 25 Thanksgiving food bags are donated to Beverly Bootstraps. Each of the 25 food bags includes staple items that families can use for their Thanksgiving Day meal. Henry's Market generously donated the insulated bags for this initiative. Community-funded and supported, Beverly Bootstraps provides critical resources to families and individuals so they may achieve self-sufficiency–all while embodying Rockwell's vision of a community united in providing for one another.  "Coastal Windows has been supporting Beverly Bootstraps for so many years. We are grateful for their contribution to Fixin's for the Feast," says Beverly Bootstraps executive director Sue Gabriel. "Their efforts will make so many families happy on Thanksgiving."   Inspired by the famous Norman Rockwell's Freedom From Want we recreated this image with our Coastal Family with the focus on feeding those in need this Thanksgiving… Give Thanks - Give Back. The turkeys are tagged with the donor's name on behalf of Coastal's October and November customers adorned with the Rockwell themed image.   The Four Freedoms were initially articulated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt with the Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want and Freedom from Fear. Freedom from Want means to never be in a situation of worrying about basic needs and comfort in life, ranging from a roof over your head, the ability to afford energy bills, or a hot Thanksgiving Day turkey dinner on your table.   Coastal Windows & Exteriors recently sponsored two other significant community events: the Merrimack Valley Chamber of Commerce Veterans Recognition Breakfast Program and the North Shore Chamber of Commerce Salute to Veterans Breakfast Event. Both annual gatherings bring together local businesses, veterans, and community members to recognize the dedication and sacrifices of our military heroes. Sponsoring these events shows gratitude to all military personnel—past, present, and future—along with the commitment to those who have dedicated themselves to our nation's safety and freedom. Along with GAF Roofing's partnership, the company's Roofs for Heroes initiative provides a free roofing system to veterans in need.  Stephanie Vanderbilt was recently named 2024 Small Business Person of the Year for Massachusetts by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Stephanie's resilience, creativity, and steadfast support for the community and veterans have been vital to the company's success and its mission to give back to those who serve.  Coastal Windows & Exteriors continues to support the community as a whole by offering energy efficient windows, doors, roofing, and siding. With insulated and energy efficient products and a newly-available solar roofing system, all North Shore homeowners can enjoy increased indoor comfort this season. Farmers Almanac is predicting a wet, cold, and snowy winter–expected to impact energy bills and home comfort levels all throughout New England.
