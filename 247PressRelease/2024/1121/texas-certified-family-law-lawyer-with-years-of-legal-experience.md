# Texas Certified Family Law Lawyer With Years of Legal Experience

AUSTIN, TX, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ben Carrasco, the founding attorney of the Law Office of Ben Carrasco, PLLC, has been helping clients handle all aspects of family law matters. Although the firm focuses on family law, its founding attorney also has experience with complex commercial litigation.  Family law matters can significantly affect your life, finances, and future relationships. Whether going through a divorce or fighting for custody of your children, understanding family law is essential to protecting your rights and achieving a fair resolution of issues. The emotional and financial stakes are high, making it crucial to have reliable legal support.  "At the Law Office of Ben Carrasco, PLLC, we focus on helping clients navigate complex family law issues. We provide tailored legal representation for cases such as high-net-worth divorces, contested child custody, property division, modifications, spousal support, paternity, and obtaining protective orders. While most cases should, and do, settle, my firm is distinguished by its commitment to going to trial and winning. Since the firm's founding, I have achieved outstanding results on behalf of both moms and dads in highly complex child custody and property disputes that often involve mental health professionals, court-appointed guardians, and financial experts. Through meticulous and diligent preparation, we put our clients in a position to tell a compelling story at trial. I am also distinguished by my credentials. In addition to being board-certified in family law—a distinction earned based on achieving specific experience milestones and passing a rigorous, blind-graded examination—I am the only Central Texas family attorney to have graduated from one of the nation's top three law schools. Educational pedigree is by no means a perfect proxy for legal ability, but it demonstrates some level of intellectual aptitude that you want in your attorney. Do I necessarily "win" every case? Of course not–and any lawyer who promises a particular outcome in your case is a lawyer you should run from. But when you hire me, you can feel confident that you've hired a fighter who will work passionately to achieve the best possible outcome in your case," said Ben Carrasco, the founding attorney of the Law Office of Ben Carrasco, PLLC.  Ben Carrasco received his undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley. After that, he spent several years in Washington, D.C., working as a legislative aide on Capitol Hill. He then went on to earn his law degree from Stanford Law School, where he served as an associate editor of the Stanford Law and Policy Review and was recognized for excellence in legal writing.  Before opening his practice, he began his legal career practicing complex commercial litigation, first with the Austin office of a global law firm and later with an Austin-based firm.  Ben Carrasco is board-certified in family law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization, a distinction shared by less than one percent of licensed Texas attorneys.  The Law Office of Ben Carrasco, PLLC, is located at 108 Wild Basin Road South, Suite 250, Austin, TX 78746. You can contact them via phone at 512-256-1537 to schedule a consultation.
