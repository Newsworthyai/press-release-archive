# Roberts Next Door Work on Vertical Series with Karma Mechanic

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 21, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Last December, friends and collaborators Robert Christopher Smith and Rob Banks.joined forces officially to form their own entertainment company Roberts Next Door LLC to develop and produce a variety of film and episodic entertainment, along with their own comic book publishing imprint. This December, in 2024, they celebrate the release of their second feature film, "Vengeance Turns: Volume Two", have a thriller/slasher "SPREAD: Pigs to Slaughter" entered into film festivals, are wrapping post-production on "Succubus Next Door" (horror feature shot in July 2024), and are wrapping the year with their first episodic "Karma Mechanic". The series is an experiment in more than one way for the team.  Banks explains that aside from being their first series, the project will be developed and shot simultaneously as vertical "mobisodes" to be released all over social media, especially focusing on Tik Tok and Instagram, and also released as extended "unrated" widescreen episodes containing nudity and violence not seen in the social media-friendly versions. According to Banks the final version of the project is planned as "a privately released R-rated short feature film."   Banks says he and Smith are excited about taking on multiple challenges with the project. He goes on to explain, "All this started just as a one-act play we wrote and performed for a charity showcase. Now we have developed what was 'Killer Session' into a 20-episode series called 'Karma Mechanic' that goes places the play only hinted. And just like the play, we wrote and are starring in the series." He laughs, "Not only that, we will also be handling the cameras and directing then working all the way through post-productionâ€“ just me and Bobby (Smith) doing literally almost everything."  Calling Roberts Next Door LLC his "baby", Banks raves about his partnership, "Bobby and I have accomplished more in a year than I ever imagined possible when I was just a kid moving out to LA from Cleveland, OH over 11 years ago." In that year, the two have released two films, written and developed several others including a feature film about a time-traveling bigfoot and a TV comedy series looking behind the scenes in Hollywood that has already attracted the interest of well-known actors, managers, and producers. "Karma Mechanic" is the perfect project for Roberts Next Door LLC to end their inaugural year, with a planned weekly release in early 2025.  ABOUT "KARMA MECHANIC" "Karma Mechanic" is a hybrid project, being released as both vertical "mobisodes" and as a short feature film from Roberts Next Door LLC. Cofounders, Robert Christopher Smith and Rob Banks, co-wrote the series based on their original one-act play "Killer Session". The team will also co-direct, co-star, co-produce, and release "Karma Mechanic" as a 20-episode vertical series for TikTok and Instagram as well as other social media sites as well as a feature film.
