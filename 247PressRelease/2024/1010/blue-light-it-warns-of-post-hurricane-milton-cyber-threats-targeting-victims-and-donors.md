# Blue Light IT Warns of Post-Hurricane Milton Cyber Threats Targeting Victims and Donors

BOCA RATON, FL, October 10, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As Florida begins its recovery from Hurricane Milton, Blue Light IT is urging individuals and businesses to remain alert for cyber threats, scams, and frauds that often follow in the wake of natural disasters. Hurricane Milton, now recorded as one of the strongest storms to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast, is expected to leave both physical and digital vulnerabilities in its path.  "We've seen this time and time again after major storms," said Amir Sachs, CEO of Blue Light IT. "Cybercriminals seize the chaos of the aftermath to exploit those affected and those wanting to help. It's crucial that everyone remains alert and take proactive steps to protect themselves and their businesses during this time."  Cybercriminals often exploit the confusion after hurricanes. Following Hurricane Katrina, over 4,000 fraudulent websites posed as charities, and similar phishing attacks surged after Hurricane Harvey, with scammers impersonating organizations like FEMA. They target vulnerable individuals and businesses seeking assistance or looking to donate. During recovery, weakened defenses make businesses more susceptible to ransomware attacks, as seen after both Sandy and Harvey, where critical systems were locked while companies struggled to restore operations.  The key threats to be aware of are: Phishing Emails: Scammers often pose as trusted agencies, offering aid or requesting personal details to claim relief funds. These emails may carry malicious links or attachments that can steal data or cause financial loss. Always verify the source by contacting the organization directly before sharing any information.  Fake Charity Websites: Scammers often set up fake websites after hurricanes to solicit donations. Always donate through legitimate organizations by visiting their verified websites directly. Be cautious of suspicious domains or urgent requests, especially if they ask for unconventional donations like cryptocurrency.  Business Vulnerabilities: After disasters, businesses are prime targets for ransomware due to weakened IT defenses. Hackers exploit the chaos to breach systems or lock data, as seen after Hurricane Sandy, when companies faced both physical recovery and cyberattacks.  Identity Theft and Financial Fraud: Scammers often pose as aid providers after disasters, asking for Social Security numbers or banking details to commit identity theft. Be cautious with personal information during recovery efforts.  To protect yourself and your business, always donate through trusted organizations like the Red Cross and verify their legitimacy using tools like Charity Navigator. Be cautious with unsolicited emailsâ€”avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments and confirm any offers by directly contacting the organization.
