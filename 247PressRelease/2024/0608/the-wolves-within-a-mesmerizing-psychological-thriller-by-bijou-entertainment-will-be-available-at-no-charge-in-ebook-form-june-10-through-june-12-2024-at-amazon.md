WILMINGTON, NC, June 08, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- J Bartell and Ginger Marin of Bijou Entertainment have announced that their latest psychological thriller, 'The Wolves Within,' based on a true story, will be available in ebook form at no charge from June 10 through June 12, 2024. The new spy drama takes readers deep into the waters of subconscious conditioning and its harrowing repercussions. Unlike many in the genre, the book is based on a true story, making it a must-read for fans of spy thrillers. Because it is produced by Bijou Entertainment, it is a story that will create a movie in the minds of readers.  After an expert in subconscious conditioning is recruited by a CIA black ops unit, during the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, his ordered world descends down a dark path leading to sanctioned kills and questioned loyalties, forever altering his concept of self & country.  'The Wolves Within' unfolds the tragic descent of Nick Bryant, a brilliant therapist whose innovative subconscious mental conditioning techniques ensnare him in a perilous web of international espionage and intrigue in the volatile 1980s. Recruited by the enigmatic William Kearney, ostensibly for the CIA, Nick's talents become instrumental in manipulating geopolitical events, from high-stakes missions in Morocco's royal corridors to entanglement in the notorious Iran-Contra affair. As he spirals deeper into this shadowy realm, employing his psychological expertise for harrowing ends—orchestrating assassinations, enduring brutal torture in Nicaragua, and extracting classified information—Nick is estranged from his beloved fiancée, Kate, ultimately losing his identity and the life he once cherished.  Ultimately, the book is a compelling exploration of the duality within us all, asking the poignant question: which wolf do you feed? The book's depiction of Nick's tragic unraveling is both riveting and deeply human, offering a profound commentary on the cost of lost redemption and the price of loyalty. For aficionados of psychological thrillers and spy dramas alike, this spellbinding tale is an absolute best in its genre, blending suspense, intrigue, and emotional depth in a manner that is as gripping as it is unforgettable.
