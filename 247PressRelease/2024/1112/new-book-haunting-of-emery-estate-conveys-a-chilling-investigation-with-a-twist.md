# New Book "Haunting of Emery Estate" Conveys a Chilling Investigation with a Twist

BOSTON, MA, November 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new true-paranormal book, "Haunting Emery Estate" is about chilling communications with three ghosts encountered during a 5-hour public paranormal investigation in a historic mansion in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The book was a collaboration between best-selling true paranormal author and medium Rob Gutro and Monique Toosoon, New England's paranormal drag queen with a sensitivity to earthbound ghosts.  The Kindle version of the book is available now on Amazon pre-order. The book will publish on January 1, 2025, with the paperback and audiobook.  "This was my first paranormal investigation with Monique," Gutro said, and we connected with three ghosts, two of whom we proved their identities, and one who affected mirrors in a frightening way. They all conveyed their personalities, their stories, and one double-crossed us." Gutro provided sketches of some of those ghosts, whom he could "see."   The Emery Estate is a large home on a huge tract of land in Weymouth, Massachusetts, and now has a reputation for its hauntings. In July 2024, a unique team of seasoned paranormal investigators led a ticketed public investigation in the triple-floor mansion and basement that uncovered three different ghosts.   The investigation was coordinated and hosted by Monique Toosoon. "I was absolutely attracted to the beauty of it," she said. She also noted, "I tend to call myself "The best trigger object you can bring investigating" because locations always tell me that the energy is completely different and much more elevated when I am around."   Three teams of seasoned paranormal investigators led approximately 60 people through the home, and Monique, Rob, and Alaura Hewey were the team assigned to the second floor. It was there the team encountered all three ghosts using paranormal equipment including motion-activated lights, thermal temperature sensors, and a voice generator.   The book walks you through the investigation from the beginning to the end, as the investigators try to piece together the identities, stories, and reasons why these ghosts remained behind. One of the ghosts even affected a public investigator who had to be protected. Gutro noted several residual hauntings in the home, too. Those are not interactive ghosts, but imprints left behind from living people.   Rob Gutro is a medium, pet medium, and paranormal investigator. He has encountered ghosts everywhere he has traveled. He has crossed many ghosts over and is known for sketching them.   "Haunted Emery Estate" is Gutro's twelfth true paranormal book. He has three series of best-selling books. One is the award-winning "Pets and the Afterlife" series, which teaches how pets communicate from the other side. Another series, "Ghosts on a Medium's Vacation," combines the history and hauntings Gutro encountered in England, Ireland, and the Bird Cage Theatre, Arizona. His third series is "Ghosts and Spirits" about ghosts on paranormal investigations and spirits he met. He is the first in the paranormal field to make the distinction between earthbound ghosts and spirits who have crossed over.   Monique Toosoon is a captivating force in the world of drag and paranormal exploration. With a career spanning 2 decades and named New Hampshire's "Ghostess with the Mostest," she was crowned Best Local Entertainer for four years. Monique's ascent knows no bounds, from sold-out extravaganzas across New England to riveting appearances on esteemed paranormal showcases like Dark Echoes Paranormal Show and Ghost Finders. Monique also graced the grand finale of Ghost Finders in the Fall of 2024. She is also the host of a YouTube and podcast program, "Ghosts and Glitter," and the host of Scared Toosoon Tours.
