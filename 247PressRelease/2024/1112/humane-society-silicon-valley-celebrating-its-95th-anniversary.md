# Humane Society Silicon Valley Celebrating Its 95th Anniversary

MILPITAS, CA, November 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) in Milpitas, CA, one of the country's top animal shelters, is celebrating 95 years of innovation, compassion, and service to both pets and their people.  After an amazing history of impactful program launches, partnerships with passionate people, state-of-the-art facilities, and being on the cutting edge of care — all resulting in over half a million animals finding loving homes — HSSV is now looking back at its major milestones, all accomplished thanks to its community, donors, and supporters:  •	HSSV was originally founded in 1929 as "The Santa Clara County Humane Society," a sanctuary for retired horses. For decades, HSSV's primary function was animal control.  •	In 2001 came the name change to "Humane Society Silicon Valley", as well as a strategic shift to rescuing animals, the foundation of HSSV's life saving mission.   •	In 2004, Honorary Board Member Judy Marcus was part of the original fundraising team that created a unique gala for animals and people with the iconic name "The Fur Ball."  •	2009 saw the opening of the Peter Detkin and Michelle Oates Detkin Animal Community Center, which changed the paradigm from simply warehousing animals to being a safe and welcoming place for both pets and people.  •	As one of a handful of residency-trained Shelter Veterinarians in the country, Dr. Cristie Kamiya joined HSSV in 2012 and eventually became the Chief of Shelter Medicine in 2014.  •	In 2017, using the 543 guidelines put forth by the Association of Shelter Veterinarians, HSSV became the country's first "Model Shelter," ensuring that animals under its care stay as healthy as possible on their journey to a loving home.  •	As of 2024, the now legendary shelter has helped over half a million animals find loving homes!  Now with 95 years under its belt, HSSV's future promises to be just as bright as it continues to expand the impact of its three Strategic Priorities by saving more animals, keeping families together, and helping shelters across the nation do the same:  1)	"Saving Lives": More animals are euthanized in California shelters than in almost any other state. Through the Sue and John Diekman Regional Rescue Program, HSSV rescues animals from partner shelters that are struggling with the high number of animals entering their doors. Today, HSSV has 20 shelter partners from all over California.  2)	"Keeping Families Together": Economic uncertainty and rising living costs have led to an increase in pet owners struggling to find affordable veterinary care. With the Wellness Waggin', a fully-equipped mobile surgical unit, HSSV can provide free spay/neuter and wellness clinics. Pets can also receive free food through HSSV's Pet Pantry Program when their owners are going through tough times.  3)	"Changing The Game": Shelters nationwide face common problems such as a shortage of veterinary staff, lack of standards of care, and limited resources. In addition to educating veterinary interns, investing in programs that encourage students to enter the field, and becoming the nation's first "Model Shelter," HSSV also commits to each of its partner shelters that it will not only transfer in animals to prevent overcrowding but also be there as a resource when they need it most.  About HSSV: Since 1929, Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) has been a steadfast presence in the community, serving people and pets as we've secured permanent, loving homes for more than 500,000 animals. HSSV is an independent, privately funded, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and is not funded by the Humane Society of the United States, ASPCA, or state and federal government entities. Our mission is to save lives, keep families together, and create a better future for pets and their people. We offer a wide range of services, including adoption, access to affordable veterinary care (including community wellness clinics), a targeted spay/neuter program, and a pet pantry to support pet owners in need. In 2017, HSSV became the first organization to earn model shelter status according to the guidelines set forth by the Association of Shelter Veterinarians. We envision a better world for animals and the people who love them, and we are dedicated to making that vision a reality. For more information, visit HSSV.org.
