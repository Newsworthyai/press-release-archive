Fellow managing partner Jeff Kovatch is proud of his families military history, having an uncle who was a decorated infantryman in Vietnam, his father who served in the Air Force, and a niece who is currently at her third year at West Point.  "Honoring those who served means recognizing their courage, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to protecting our freedom," said Kovatch. Prestige Auto Spa NJ is proud of the fact that they are a locally operated and family owned business, and that they are able to employ many from the Toms River, NJ area rather than going the ever more popular route of replacing human employees with artificial intelligence. This allows them to stay more connected to their community and better serve their clients and customers.  "So many competing car washes are going the AI route, where people drive in and out without seeing or speaking to anyone," said operating partner Jorge Reyes. "This removes all personality from business and from the community. Our goal is to get to know those who visit us and make sure their experience is the best there is, each and every time."
