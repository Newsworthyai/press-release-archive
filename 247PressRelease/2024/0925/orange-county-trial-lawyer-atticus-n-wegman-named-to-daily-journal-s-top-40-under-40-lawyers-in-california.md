IRVINE CA, September 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Atticus Injury Law, PC is thrilled to announce that its Founder and Managing Partner, Attorney Atticus N. Wegman, has been named to the Daily Journal's prestigious list of Top 40 Under 40 Lawyers in California for 2024.   This recognition highlights Wegman's significant contributions to the legal field, outstanding client advocacy, and exceptional personal injury litigation success.  Wegman, who has been practicing law for nearly 15 years, is a passionate and dedicated attorney who attributes his career choice to his family's legacy of public service. "Growing up surrounded by my family's passion for law and government profoundly impacted me."   His connection to his namesake, Atticus Finch, from To Kill a Mockingbird, also influenced his journey. "The story's themes of courage and integrity resonate deeply with me. These are the values I strive to embody in my practice."  Throughout his career, Wegman has secured significant victories on behalf of his clients, often overcoming challenging legal obstacles. His work in several high-profile cases, including a recent $1.5 million jury verdict in Orange County and other multi-million-dollar verdicts, has earned him award recognition.  One such case involved a 23-year-old nursing student who suffered significant injuries when she was alleged to have caused a crash on the freeway after rear-ending another vehicle. Although initially seen as a challenging case to win, Wegman uncovered key evidence showing that a truck had dangerously re-entered traffic, ultimately leading to a jury awarding his client $1.5 million for medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering.  "This case was not just about compensation- it was about recognizing a young woman's strength and holding those responsible accountable," said Wegman.  In addition to his courtroom success, Wegman has secured significant settlements, including an $8.6 million resolution from multiple defendants for injuries sustained by a Caltrans inspector near the 10 freeway in LA County in July 2020.
