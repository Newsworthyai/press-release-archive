STOWE, VT, September 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Carlos Alberto Serrano – Award-Winning Symphonic Composer  Carlos Alberto Serrano, an internationally acclaimed composer with over 100 film festival accolades, announces the release of his newest symphonic poem, Adversidad y Tenacidad. This deeply personal work encapsulates Serrano's ongoing journey of recovery and resilience following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite the challenges of living with TBI, Serrano continues to demonstrate how artistic expression can flourish even in the face of adversity.  Educational Excellence: Serrano holds a Master of Fine Arts in Music Composition from the Vermont College of Fine Arts and a Master of Music in Film Scoring from the prestigious Berklee College of Music, reinforcing his mastery of orchestration, composition, and scoring for diverse mediums.  His compositions, blending traditional orchestration with modern techniques, transcend limitations and showcase the emotional depth of classical music infused with contemporary sensibilities.  A Story of Overcoming Limitations through Orchestral Sound  Adversidad y Tenacidad is a powerful symphonic poem spanning 8 minutes, narrating a poignant story of struggle, survival, and ultimate triumph. The piece unfolds in three distinct sections, each reflecting Serrano's personal experience recovering from TBI. The symphony opens with turbulent, chaotic melodies that mirror the confusion and mental unrest following the injury. As the music progresses, fragmented harmonies symbolize the struggle to heal and regain a sense of identity, before concluding with a triumphant resolution—an auditory metaphor for overcoming personal limitations and embracing a new way of thriving.  Advocating for TBI Awareness and Capability  Serrano's Adversidad y Tenacidad is more than just a musical composition—it's a testament to the capabilities of TBI survivors and their potential to overcome the obstacles they face. As an advocate for TBI awareness, Serrano emphasizes the importance of providing opportunities for survivors to thrive. His work is a beacon of hope for those who may feel limited by their injuries, showing that while the road to recovery is long, it is possible to rise above those limitations and create something truly remarkable.  "While many TBI survivors, including myself, will never fully recover, this piece is proof that it is possible to rise beyond the 'limitations' imposed by such an injury. TBI survivors are capable of producing great things—if given the chance." 										 – Carlos Alberto Serrano  Musical Influences and Orchestral Innovation  Drawing inspiration from Post-Romanticism and Modernism, Serrano channels the grandeur of Mahler and Sibelius while experimenting with the harmonic boldness of Shostakovich and Bartók.

These ethereal elements represent the psychological fragility explored in the composition, lending the piece an otherworldly quality that evokes both struggle and resilience.
