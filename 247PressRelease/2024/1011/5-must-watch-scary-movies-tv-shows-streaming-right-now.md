# 5 Must-Watch Scary Movies & TV Shows Streaming Right Now

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From classic horror films to new eerie TV series, here are five must-watch movies and shows currently streaming across platforms like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and Prime Video.  1. The Shining (1980) When it comes to Stephen King adaptations, The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this psychological horror film follows Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer who slowly descends into madness while serving as the caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel. King famously disliked the film for its deviation from his novel, but Kubrick's haunting, slow-burn take on the story has cemented The Shining as a horror classic. Nicholson's performance is unforgettable, and the eerie atmosphere is as unsettling today as it was in 1980.  How to watch: Streaming on HBO Max.  2. The Sixth Sense (1999) M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense remains a must-watch, even if you know the iconic twist ending. Haley Joel Osment stars as a boy who can see dead people, delivering a performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. Toni Collette, as his concerned mother, is equally outstanding, and Bruce Willis shines as the troubled child psychologist trying to help them. Shyamalan's eerie, suspenseful storytelling put him on the map, making The Sixth Sense a perfect psychological thriller to revisit.  How to watch: Streaming on Hulu.  3. The Witch (2015) Set in 1630s New England, The Witch is a chilling period piece that takes place decades before the Salem Witch Trials. Director Robert Eggers crafts a disturbing tale of a Puritan family plagued by supernatural forces after their infant is taken by a mysterious entity. Anya Taylor-Joy, in her breakthrough role, leads the cast in this atmospheric and deeply unsettling film. Rather than relying on jump scares, The Witch creates dread through its slow pacing and tension, making it a must-watch for fans of historical horror.  How to watch: Streaming on Prime Video.  4. The Fall of the House of Usher (2023) From acclaimed horror director Mike Flanagan, The Fall of the House of Usher reimagines Edgar Allan Poe's classic short story. In this modern adaptation, the wealthy and corrupt Usher family, headed by Roderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood), is systematically hunted by a mysterious figure (Carla Gugino). Combining horror with the ruthlessness of shows like Succession, this series is a bloody, thrilling ride, with Flanagan once again proving his talent for creating chilling, character-driven horror.  How to watch: Streaming on Netflix.  5. Midnight Mass (2021) Also from Mike Flanagan, Midnight Mass is a masterclass in atmospheric horror. Set on the isolated Crockett Island, the series follows a community that experiences miraculous events after the arrival of a mysterious priest (Hamish Linklater). But as the town's religious fervor grows, it becomes clear that these miracles come at a terrifying cost. Mixing themes of faith, loss, and redemption, Midnight Mass is an unsettling exploration of the supernatural, perfect for those who enjoy horror with emotional depth.  How to watch: Streaming on Netflix.  Whether you're a fan of supernatural thrills or psychological horrors, these picks will set the perfect mood for spooky season.
