# Shred Like the Cool Kids

VANCOUVER, BC, October 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Many hundreds of businesses all over BC have already embraced a significant number of reasons to have Micro Com Systems scan hundreds of boxes of irreplaceable business records. What happens next? Well, for starters, be prepared for a significant increase in levels of customer service and ease of efficiency.

The request can most likely be traced to an auditor. Instead of the usual delays and fretting while someone skulks off to the warehouse to look through multiple file boxes, imagine locating the requested item in just a few keystrokes on the computer before emailing it to them.  What about the paper files sent to Micro Com for scanning? Good question. Over the decades, the MCS team has evolved a set of rules to benefit both clients and the company. Every client gets a 90-day window during which they are encouraged to examine copied digital files for quality, completeness, as well as accuracy of metadata and legibility.   Micro Com employs a highly skilled and experienced team, but they are humans, and errors can happen. If anything is discovered that requires correction, just contact the team to make things right.  After three months expire, client permission is requested to delete the digital files from MCS servers. There's also a written agreement to return or shred paper files.  Shockingly, most clients prefer not to have documents returned and elect to have the team at Micro Com shred them securely on-site. Micro Com collaborates with a third-party team to provide this service, and their purpose-built trucks can digest roughly 300 banker boxes per trip.
