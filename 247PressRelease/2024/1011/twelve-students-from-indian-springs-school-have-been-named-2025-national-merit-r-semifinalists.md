INDIAN SPRINGS VILLAGE, AL, October 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Twelve students from Indian Springs School have been named 2025 National Merit® Semifinalists: Nate Albert, Avery Biga, Evie Frohsin, Aviva Goldberg, Ibrahim Hamo, Josie Kim, Erik Ledvina, Max Lizee, Radyn Moradkhani, Syla Steinman, Audrey Wang, and Samuel White.  Indian Springs School, recognized as a top boarding and private day school in Alabama, continues to provide an environment where academic excellence thrives.  Of the 16,000 Semifinalists, about 15,000 are expected to advance to the Finalist level. Finalists will have the opportunity to compete for some 6,870 scholarships worth more than $26 million. 2025 Semifinalists were selected based on their Preliminary SAT/National Merit® Scholarship Qualifying Test scores. They represent less than one percent of U.S. high school seniors and include the highest-scoring entrants in each state.  The school's strong academic foundation helps students consistently achieve remarkable milestones like this one, further reinforcing its reputation among one of the top boarding and private high schools in the US.  To become a National Merit® Finalist, semifinalists must submit a detailed application including their academic records, participation in school and community activities, demonstrated leadership abilities, employment, honors, and awards. Semifinalists must also be endorsed by a school official, write an essay, and have outstanding grades throughout high school.  National Merit® Finalists for the Class of 2025 will be named in the spring, with nearly half going on to win a National Merit® Scholarship, which would earn the recipient the Merit Scholar® title.
