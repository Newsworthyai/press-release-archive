# Conversion Logix Unveils CLiQ: The Premier Marketing Operating System for Multifamily Leaders

SEATTLE, WA, October 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Conversion Logix is proud to announce the launch of Conversion Logix iQ (CLiQ), a revolutionary marketing operating system designed specifically for multifamily and senior living property management leaders. CLiQ is set to transform how marketing leaders manage and optimize their campaigns, providing unparalleled insights and performance through advanced AI-driven tools.  "As the multifamily landscape becomes increasingly complex, the need for a centralized system to streamline marketing activities has never been greater," said Andrew Cederlind, President of Conversion Logix. "CLiQ offers a strategic partnership, empowering marketing leaders to scale their advertising, profitably launch large portfolios, centralize campaign management, and uncover critical attribution that goes beyond first and last touch."  Unlike other multifamily marketing operating systems, CLiQ leverages unparalleled industry-specific advertising expertise and proprietary lead attribution data to provide campaign recommendations that outperform market standards, ensuring that every dollar spent drives maximum leasing velocity.  "Deciding where to invest marketing dollars shouldn't be guesswork," says Martin Stein, Chief Analytics Officer at Conversion Logix. "With CLiQ's Unified Attribution capabilities, we've been able to move beyond traditional reporting methods, enabling us to more accurately credit marketing activities that have historically been misrepresented and undervalued," says Stein. Utilizing sophisticated probabilistic modeling, CLiQ delivers real-time, actionable insights that enable marketing teams to make data-driven decisions with confidence.  One thing that separates CLiQ from other marketing solutions is the focus on keeping human expertise in the process. CLiQ is designed to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it. The platform combines automation, AI, and expert human insights, allowing marketers to efficiently scale their operations while maintaining human oversight.  For marketing leaders looking to optimize their strategies and achieve measurable results, Conversion Logix's new marketing operating system delivers the peace of mind needed to thrive in a competitive market.  General availability for Unified Attribution coming later in Q4. To learn more about CLiQ or to schedule a demo, visit conversionlogix.com/cliq.
