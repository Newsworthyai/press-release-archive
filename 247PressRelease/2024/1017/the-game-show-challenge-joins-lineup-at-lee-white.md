# The Game Show Challenge Joins Lineup at Lee + White

ATLANTA, GA, October 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Game Show Challenge, an interactive experience that lets guests enjoy the excitement of being game show contestants, is coming to the Lee + White adaptive reuse development in Atlanta's West End. Targeting a late 2024 opening, this will be the third location for the game show concept, joining locations in Columbia and Greenville, S.C.  Kelly Wilson, Senior Vice President of Ackerman Retail, completed the lease with The Game Show Challenge on behalf of Lee + White owners Ackerman & Co. and MDH Partners. Robert Satcher Jr. of Pintail represented The Game Show Challenge.  The Game Show Challenge has leased 3,889 square feet in Building 1000, next to Monday Night Brewing and Grady's new neighborhood health center. The venue will feature two studios where contestants can engage in interactive games, hosted in a style similar to popular TV game shows, including spin-the-wheel challenges, trivia, word puzzles, and more. Typical games involve six to 14 contestants, but can accommodate larger groups.  "Lee + White is a perfect fit for us. We love to be in areas like this with a steady flow of people. This is a great opportunity for us to be in a redeveloped space with a lot of character, surrounded by a great mix of tenants in a part of town that's rejuvenating," said Josh Brickey, Managing Partner of The Game Show Challenge.   "We're excited that The Game Show Challenge is joining the lineup at Lee + White.
