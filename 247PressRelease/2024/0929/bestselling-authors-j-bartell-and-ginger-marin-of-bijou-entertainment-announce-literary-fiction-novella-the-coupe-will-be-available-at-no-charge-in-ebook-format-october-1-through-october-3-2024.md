WILMINGTON, NC, September 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bijou Entertainment has announced that their latest action adventure novella, 'The Coupe,' will be available in ebook form at no charge from October 1 through October 3, 2024 at Amazon.  In this exciting book, an ex-con finds redemption through forgiveness and returning to his past work with cars only to find new challenges from gang violence and personal betrayal.  In gritty East Los Angeles, 'The Coupe' roars to life, a saga of redemption, love, and the relentless grip of the past. The protagonist, Luis Alvarez, emerges from a 17-year nightmare in prison, haunted by a vehicular tragedy and ﬁnds himself in his old neighborhood marred by gang violence. The world he must navigate is shadowed by former love, Rosealia, the quiet strength of his history, and her son Bobby, a young man on the cusp of falling into the gangland abyss. Old friend Miguel, harboring secrets entwined with their shared history, becomes both a reminder of a life Luis wants to forget and a link to the past he needs to reconcile.  As Luis confronts his demons personiﬁed by a car—a symbol of his darkest moment—he's pulled back into the vibrant lowrider culture, standing as their community's lifeline. The drama shifts into high gear with the emergence of Sanchez, a gangster with a deep, enigmatic grudge against Luis, turning his path to redemption into a perilous battle for survival. 'The Coupe' hurtles towards a pulse-pounding climax: an unusual drag race where Luis stakes everything. It's no longer just about winning but reclaiming a life unmoored, rescuing a family threatened by the encroaching violence, and seizing a last shot at redemption –– providing a much needed second chance for them all.
