LOS ANGELES, CA, March 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The Winkler Lowy Foundation is committed to supporting the Jewish community across the globe. In the wake of the horrific October 7th attacks, this effort is particularly important in Israel," said founder Janine Lowy. "We are allocating additional resources to support Israel and her people, and are grateful to each of these organizations for their incredible work."   The foundation's gift has been divided among several organizations including IDSF Habithonistim (Israel Defense And Security Forum), the Together We Will Win National Emergency Fund established by JGive and its partners, Brothers & Sisters for Israel, and the Maglan Friends Association.   "We are thankful for Janine Lowy and the entire Winkler Lowy Foundation for their ongoing commitment to combating atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people," said Ori Ben Shlomo, CEO of JGive. "In these trying times it is so important to support and empower Israeli causes that are doing outstanding work on the front lines."  This gift was preceded by another $100,000 donation deployed by the Winkler Lowy Foundation in November to fund important efforts in southern Israel.  ABOUT: The Winkler Lowy Foundation was founded by Janine Winkler Lowy and her four children in 2019 to help ensure that all families can access formative Jewish programming that nourishes young minds, strengthens the future of the Jewish community, and builds bridges between Israel and the Diaspora.
