# Death of Skiing?

COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, March 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Skiing, a beloved winter pastime cherished by millions worldwide, faces a pressing crisis as revealed in the 2024 Annual Ski Industry Report by MySkiLessons.com.   The report paints a grim picture of declining interest in skiing, threatening the very existence of ski resorts and the livelihoods of thousands employed in the industry.  With a gradual decrease in visitors to ski areas since 2004, over 45 ski resorts have shuttered their operations in the last two decades alone, underscoring the urgency of the situation. Despite advancements like snowmaking technology, which has extended seasons and mitigated weather-related challenges, the industry remains in peril.  The report highlights a stark reality: interest in skiing has plummeted by over 70%, evidenced by declining Google searches for skiing-related terms since 2004. Even snowboarding, a sport traditionally associated with skiing, has experienced an 82% decrease in interest during the same period.  While climate change and its impact on snowfall patterns are often cited as culprits, data suggests that reduced interest in extreme sports transcends weather conditions. Factors such as increased medical expenses, fear of injury, and soaring resort prices have contributed to a broader withdrawal from such activities.  Despite these challenges, signs of resilience are evident, with ski areas reopening after closure and record visitor numbers recorded in recent years. To navigate these turbulent times, resorts must diversify offerings, integrate innovative technologies, prioritize safety measures, and embark on collaborative marketing campaigns.  Skiing's Return to Prominence: A Shared Vision While the road ahead may be daunting, MySkiLessons.com remains steadfast in its belief that skiing can reclaim its former glory. Through concerted efforts from industry stakeholders and a commitment to innovation and inclusivity, skiing can once again thrive as a cherished vacation activity and lifestyle choice.
