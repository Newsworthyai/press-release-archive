# Dr. Ward Ulmer Named New President of Trinity Medical Sciences University

ROSWELL, GA, March 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Trinity Medical Sciences University is proud to announce Dr. Ward Ulmer as its new President. Dr. Ulmer brings with him over 25 years of experience in higher education and a vast knowledge of how to lead faculty, administration, and students to success.  With a profound dedication to academic excellence, Dr. Ulmer has held leadership positions in education and business throughout his career. Prior to joining Trinity Medical Sciences University, Dr. Ulmer served as the Co-President for Academics at West Coast University, a university with specialties in healthcare-focused fields. In addition, Dr. Ulmer has previously served as the President of Walden University, an online institution serving adult learners pursuing degrees in nursing, mental health counseling, education, and business. During his tenure with Walden, Dr. Ulmer served in several leadership positions, including Chief Learning Officer and Vice President of College Administration, Associate Dean in the College of Management and Technology, and Vice President of Walden's Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership. Dr. Ulmer's additional experience includes holding leadership positions in education and business, serving as Chief Academic Officer and Chief Information Officer for Latimer Education and Senior Vice Provost for Strayer University.  Dr. Ulmer holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Charleston Southern University and a Master of Arts in Computer Resources and Information Management from Webster University. In addition, he earned two PhDs as a working professional, husband, and father: a PhD in Higher Education Leadership from Clemson University and a PhD in Applied Management and Decision Sciences from Walden University. It was this first-hand experience that has made Dr. Ulmer uniquely aware of the challenges adult learners face in pursuing an advanced degree.  In addition to his academic achievements, Dr. Ulmer has contributed significantly to the higher education field through publications, presentations, and guest podcast interviews on topics such as preparing for an encore career, leadership in a global workforce, and diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. Dr. Ulmer also serves as a site visitor team member for the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) and the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC). In his personal life, Dr. Ulmer is an active member of the Men's Ministry Leadership and has been associated with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes for over 35 years.  While Trinity's outgoing President, Steven Wilson, will continue to be involved with the institution by serving as CEO, he is excited to pass the presidential baton to a new visionary in medical education. "It is bittersweet to relinquish a post I've held since the creation of the school," says Mr. Wilson, "but then I think of the innovation and experience that Dr. Ulmer is bringing to the role and I am reminded that with new leadership comes new possibilities for our students. I am confident in his ability to lead with integrity, ingenuity, and a steadfast commitment to our mission."  The Trinity family is excited to welcome Dr. Ulmer to the team in the coming weeks and we look forward to supporting his visionary leadership and commitment to advancing medical education.
