ORLANDO, FL, December 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Congratulations to car accident lawyer Justin Presser and his legal team for securing a whopping $1.675 million settlement for a car accident victim client. Justin and his team worked tirelessly to prove fault in a collision that happened when the at-fault car violated his client's right of way. The plaintiff sustained injuries as a result.   Justin fights hard for his clients, focusing on their unique needs and taking on any defendant, no matter how powerful. In his career, he has litigated claims against corporate entities and powerful insurance companies and come out on top.

Medical malpractice harms thousands of people each year and is a type of personal injury case close to his heart. Justin doesn't want any other family to suffer as his has, and fights for the rights of the injured against the insurance companies to ensure his client's obtain full and fair value for their case.  Anyone who has seen Justin argue a case in court, fight for a fair settlement for injured people, or hear him talk about his clients will see the empathy and compassion he shows his clients.
