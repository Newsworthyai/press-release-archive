# Free Quiz Helps Businesses Become Sensory-Friendly and Inclusive

SAINT JOHN, NB, June 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sensory Friendly Solutions is excited to announce the launch of our free, Sensory-Friendly Business Quiz. This quick and easy online tool helps businesses of all sizes assess their current level of sensory-friendliness and identify areas for improvement.   Why Sensory-Friendly Businesses Matter   Creating a sensory-friendly environment benefits a wider customer base than you might think. Many underlying disabilities (we've counted at least 25, including autism, hearing loss, PTSD and traumatic brain injury) make someone more likely to experience sensory sensitivities or the potential for sensory overload. By taking steps to be more inclusive, businesses can:   Expand their reach: Attract new customers who may have previously avoided your business due to sensory concerns.   Enhance customer experience: Create a more welcoming and comfortable environment for everyone.   Demonstrate commitment to inclusion: Show your community and your team that you value diversity and accessibility.  The Sensory-Friendly Business Quiz: A Simple Path to Inclusion   Our free quiz takes just minutes to complete and asks nine key questions about your business environment. You'll receive immediate results along with actionable steps to improve sensory friendliness. These steps may include:   Lighting adjustments: Offering areas with lower lighting levels.   Noise reduction strategies: Providing noise-canceling headphones or designated quiet areas.   Visual clutter reduction: Simplifying signage and displays.   Training staff: Educating employees on sensory sensitivities and how to best assist customers.   "The free Sensory-Friendly Business Quiz from Sensory Friendly Solutions is a game-changer for our city's businesses," says Nancy Tissington, Executive Director of Uptown Saint John in New Brunswick, Canada, she adds, "The quick quiz helps our business members identify simple adjustments – like adjustable lighting or quiet areas – that make a big difference for customers with sensory sensitivities.
