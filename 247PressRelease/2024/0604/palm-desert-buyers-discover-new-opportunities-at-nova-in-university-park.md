# Palm Desert Buyers Discover New Opportunities At Nova In University Park

PALM DESERT, CA, June 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In California's Palm Desert, the enticing, casual lifestyle offers indoor/outdoor settings for the arts, dining, shopping and recreation. Now, this alluring destination also features fresh design opportunities at the Nova neighborhood in University Park, by award-winning Woodbridge Pacific Group (WPG).  "When Nova shoppers told us they wanted plan layouts with more versatility, we listened and responded," said WPG President Todd Cunningham. "Nova's new plan variations serve the range of buyers Palm Desert attracts—people who want the lock-and-leave ease of a winter home, others who want to be closer to their adult children and others seeking a new, high-quality home for permanent residence."  Nova's new choices include homes of 2,328 to 2,751 square feet, in floorplans that offer 4 to 5 bedrooms and 3.5 to 4.5 bathrooms. Priced from the high $600,000s, Nova's distinctive floorplan designs now provide layout choices for an array of households and preferences.   Depending on plan and elevation selection, Nova's new layout choices can include a downstairs bedroom with a full bath, or a casita. Lofts, ADUs and multi-gen suites are also among the collection's new variations.  Nova's ADUs are self-contained with sleeping and living space, a bathroom and wardrobe, washer/dryer space and a compact kitchen. A separate entry further privatizes the ADU layouts.  Great rooms, covered outdoor living space and two-car garages are part of every Nova home. Per plan highlights of these two-story designs also include a den, lounge, and project room.   Nova buyers Rose and Dan Arguin are pleased with all aspects of their move from San Diego to University Park. "It was the best decision we ever made," said Rose. "We owned and rented homes in San Diego, and we wanted something fresh and attainable, in a place we could enjoy. Nova, University Park and Palm Desert combined to make the perfect choice."   Proving ideal for the Arguins and many others, University Park collections also include Verve and Esprit. Verve offers 4 two-story plans with 2-car garages and 1,871 to 2,490 square feet of living space, with 3 to 5 bedrooms and 2.5 to 4.5 bathrooms. Pricing is from the high $500,000's for available homes. At Esprit, plan sizes range from 1,992 to 2,925 square feet, with 3 to 5 bedrooms and 2 to 3.5 bathrooms. Pricing is from the $700,000's for available homes.   Premium Lifestyle—All residents can enjoy their new home in a well-situated Palm Desert locale. University Park is near the 10 Freeway, with the intersection of Gerald Ford Drive and Portola Road offering easy access to WPG's neighborhoods.   Area work centers are within easy reach, including Eisenhower Medical Center, which is a draw for buyers employed here or those seeking ready access to renowned services. For family buyers, strong schools are another plus. The Desert Sands Unified School District and Palm Springs Unified serve University Park with quality schools for K-12.   Abundant retail and dining choices are convenient, and so are hiking trails and other recreational options. Signature destinations include El Paseo Shopping District and the new Acrisure Arena, which hosts sports and entertainment events.   Close To Home—Leisure fun is close at hand in nearby parks that include one dog park and one with a covered play area, basketball court and lawn. Additional choices await at The Grove, the master plan's amenity center, which is slated for a festive summer opening. The Grove features a resort pool, a lap pool and a kiddie pool. A shaded playground, pickleball court, a stage area, lawn areas for events and games, a firepit and a BBQ area add to enticing leisure time venues.   See more of the University Park setting.

"Jeff's ability to navigate today's purchase process is exceptional," said Chad Ross, WPG Community Sales Manager at Nova.  Dan and Rose were glad to accept the help. Having retired from her career in finance, Rose was the Arguins' point person. "Since I was no longer working, I could devote my time to deal with the financial details, and U.S. Bank was super helpful," she said. "They explained each step, told us what to do and what not to do, and all went as smooth as silk!"

"We have confidence in our quality and service, and welcome shoppers' due diligence," said Cunningham. "University Park is definitely evolving as we had hoped when we envisioned this community."
