# Valencia Invites You To Summer's Friday Night Happenings

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, June 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The glorious outdoor environment of Valencia by FivePoint is blooming, with the popular "Friday Night Happenings." June 7 and August 14 are the scheduled dates for these gatherings, with residents, their friends and families and visitors all invited. This special event combines live music with food and drinks and is geared for all ages, so please join in at Valencia on June 7, from 6 to 9 p.m. Address is 27426 Navigation Avenue, Valencia, CA 91381. See the details at www.valencia.com.  "Friday Night Happenings" is just one of the opportunities to share in a community lifestyle that is rich with special events and activities. Created after years of thoughtful planning by FivePoint and County of Los Angeles, Valencia features an inviting backdrop for living well, and the people who make their home here are bringing its thoughtful concepts to real and vibrant life.   Here is a community inspired by the beauty of big nature. Its vision combines many pleasing features—with homes, surroundings and residents uniting to create a unique neighborhood culture. Visitors find much to explore, with new home choices in 10 design collections (and more are coming!), interconnected green spaces, trails and pathways, and leisure amenities.  Designed for Living—Home to some 1,100 households, Valencia offers both detached and attached design collections. Pricing is from the upper $400,00s to the mid $1 millions for homes with 1,018 to 4,723 square feet of living space. Versatile layouts feature indoor/outdoor living space, luxurious retreats, flex spaces and sleek, high-function kitchens. Single- and multi-level plans are designed to optimize privacy and view opportunities.  Choices here draw young singles and couples, growing households and empty nesters. Most plan to live in their new home full-time. Others are helping their adult children achieve first-time ownership. Some are helping parents find a fresh, easy-care home, or seeking the right design for a multi-generation household.   This mix supports close to home choices for dynamic living. Your neighbors may offer services you can tap without freeway travel. Personal trainers, tutors for your kids, dance instructors, salon professionals and more may make house calls, or in nearby offices and studios.  Connectivity—Situated in the heart of Los Angeles County's Santa Clarita Valley, Valencia is close to retail, dining and leisure choices. Adjacency to I-5 puts area job centers within easy reach, as well as Cal Arts, College of the Canyons and Henry Mayo Hospital. Connectivity includes nearby access to Metrolink, freeways and airports.  Programmed events and choices abound throughout the year. Check out The Gardening Club, where residents can gather to tend and harvest the community garden beds. Ask about Earth Day, the Easter Egg Hunt, Pumpkin Fest and Holiday Giving.   Inspiring Spaces—The panoramic hillside site features vista views, and site planning weaves open spaces and amenities to create a delightful indoor/outdoor fabric for everyday living. Within this distinctive backdrop, residents find much to enjoy without a long drive. And that helps people take time, to slow down, walk or ride their bikes to parks and connect with their friends, families and neighbors.   "When we toured new homes, we saw people out and about with their kids and dogs," said Kristen, who bought here with her husband Spencer. "That's a happy sign for our son, our dog and any future children we add to the family."  Enticing lifestyle pleasures include award-winning Confluence Park, which combines outdoor expanses, a pool complex and easy connections to many other community points. Be sure to see Adventure Playground, tailored for kids and parents to enjoy. Seating niches are here, and trails for pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals.   Well-ranked schools add further to the value equation of life at Valencia. The William S. Hart District serves junior high and high school students, while elementary school children will be part of the Newhall School District or the Saugus School District.   Sustainability, A Key Priority—Valencia builders support FivePoint's abiding commitment to sustainable development, with energy efficiency incorporated in each design collection. Among per plan features are low-E windows, upgraded insulation, rooftop solar and tankless water heaters with closed loop systems.   Neighborhood and community planning optimizes open space and protects trees and natural vegetation. Reduced use of motor vehicles is integral, and core amenities are within easy walking distance of most homes. Seating niches, smaller parks and bike trails invite residents to enjoy their community without driving.   Start with an online check at www.valencia.com and plan your personal visit.
