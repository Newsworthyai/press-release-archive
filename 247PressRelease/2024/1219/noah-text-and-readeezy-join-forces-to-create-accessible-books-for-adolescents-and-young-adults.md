# Noah Text and Readeezy Join Forces to Create Accessible Books for Adolescents and Young Adults

OLD MYSTIC, CT, December 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Readeezy is an interactive platform that offers students illustrated, animated eBooks with age-respectful storylines at accessible reading levels. Noah Text® is a patented method of displaying text that makes it easier to decode, thereby enhancing reading fluency, comprehension, and accuracy. Now the two companies have joined forces to offer Readeezy's interactive eBooks in print form, providing engaging stories that give students opportunities to engage in wide reading.   Readeezy was created by Maria Finaro Cleary, a retired school superintendent with a cognitively disabled daughter. By middle school, she had outgrown the picture books that supported her reading, but books that were age-appropriate were not illustrated and difficult to understand. So, she just stopped reading altogether. Her daughter struggled so much with books that she often said, "Reading makes my brain hurt."   Dr. Cleary started Readeezy to help solve this problem for kids like her daughter, providing illustrations and a variety of interactive features that make its age-respectful, reading-level appropriate eBooks accessible and fun to read. Readeezy's research among schools shows that comprehension, retention, and engagement are amazing among Readeezy users.   Based on the science of reading and recommended by structured literacy specialists, Noah Text is an evidence-based word-level scaffold that shows readers the structure of words. It is highly effective for striving readers, those with dyslexia, and multilingual learners. Noah Text helps readers access and learn complex words, many of them multisyllabic.  Under the two companies' partnership, Noah Text has converted the text of Readeezy's books to its proprietary method of displaying text and is distributing the books through its retail bookstore at https://noahtextbookstore.company.site/ and through wholesaler Ingram's retail distribution network. The companies have released nine illustrated Readeezy/Noah Text titles to date:  •	Different by Maria Finaro Cleary •	Crazylegs by Andrew Killeen •	Perfect Pitch by Maria Finaro Cleary and J.A. Cleary •	The Courage to Dream by Grace Bonds •	K-Lass by Andrew Killeen •	Bossgirl by Andrew Killeen •	How a Dog Saved My Life by Debbie Schrack •	Vacation Island Mystery by Molly Hamilton •	Missing by Laura Holloway  Noah Text also offers free conversion tools to teachers and students, including a Chrome extension that converts web pages to Noah Text, and has developed specialized software in partnership with New Century Education Foundation and Michigan State University that is helping improve literacy in secondary schools and adult prisons. Notably, for dyslexic readers, Noah Text can be included as a modification on IEPs or an accommodation in 504 plans. Noah Text also provides API integration for businesses that want to expand their accessibility offerings.   For further information, please contact the CEO and founder of Noah Text, Sarah K. Blodgett, at sblodgett@noahtext.com, or visit the companies' websites at www.readeezy.com and www.noahtext.com.  About Readeezy Readeezy is the only interactive digital library specifically designed to support the acquisition of grade-level reading skills for struggling adolescent/teen readers who are poor, uneducated, emotionally challenged, marginalized, disabled or academically struggling, to empower them to achieve life and career success. Its research-based features target those identified by the science of reading and include self-assessment and social-emotional learning. Readeezy has been recognized in a number of competitions for start-up organizations: GitLab Foundation; NSF Vital Prize Challenge; Learning Tools competition (Schmidt Futures, Gates and Walton Foundations); DARPA Tools for Adult Learning; SIIA Finalist for Innovation of the Year; Future of Educational Technology Conference.   About Noah Text, LLC Noah Text, LLC, was established in 2016 when it released its patented methodology under the registered trademark Noah Text®. Grounded in the science of reading, Noah Text is an evidence-based, scaffolded text that shows readers the structure of words, enabling them to read independently and enjoy wide reading. In so doing, Noah Text enhances reading skills while freeing up cognitive resources that readers can devote to comprehension. Noah Text simulates simpler writing systems (e.g., Finland's) in which learning to read is made easier due to visible, predictable word patterns. As a result, Noah Text increases reading fluency, stamina, accuracy, and confidence while building skills that transfer to plain text reading. Highly recommended by structured literacy specialists, Noah Text enables resistant and struggling readers to advance their reading skills beyond basic proficiency, and beyond decodable text reading, so that they can tackle higher-level learning. Noah Text is highly effective for striving, dyslexic, and ELL readers.
