WILMINGTON, NC, December 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Animal books have always been important in the lives of kids. Books about animals have been favorites of children of any age, from newborns to teens. Most are both entertaining and educational. Seldom however do we find a book that features that special class of animals found in the Sonoran desert of Baja, California. That is the focus of Earl Vincent de Berge's latest story book about animals, 'Big Ears Jack and Friends', a book that would make a perfect gift for youngsters and for Moms whose children love to hear stories about coyotes, foxes, jackrabbits and other desert animals.  This new young adult fantasy book is an enchanting collection of 15 short fantasy stories celebrating the wild animals and plants that live in the hottest desert in the Americas, on the narrowest peninsula in the world, Baja California, Mexico.  The main character in these charming stories is Big Ears Jack: a very big jackrabbit with huge ears -- and magical powers to use for good! Jack is the king of desert kindness, a good friend to all desert critters.  Among Jack's friends readers will meet Nosey and Wag, mischievous coyote brothers; Blue Dasher, a racing dragonfly; the Kangaroo Rat Chorus; tree-lizard Boris; Giro the dust devil; Hawk Conchita and the red ants; Lady Treble Clef, a watchful cactus; Paulina, the puma poet; Diana the musical tarantula; Lady Chrona, a sea lion who dreams of flying; a scheming sea gull named Swindler; the beautiful bobcat Miss Mucha Purrs; Mr. Shellie the chatterbox tortoise; and Young Red Fox and his sweet love, the lovely rabbit Adorna -- along with many others.  And just for fun, a short essay is included about how to enjoy a hike or walk in the desert in a safe and respectful way.  'Big Ears Jack And Friends' is now available in Kindle and softcover version at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Ears-Jack-Friends-Earl-Berge-ebook/dp/B0DM6PR8HW?ref_=ast_author_dp. Add it to your Christmas shopping list today.  Earl Vincent de Berge is also the author of 'A Finger of Land on an Old Man's Hand'. This coming of age memoir is more than just another adventure story; it's a meditation on resilience, friendship, and the inescapable pull of self-discovery. Each challenge—be it physical or emotional—becomes a steppingstone in the explorers' evolution, perhaps reminding readers of their own capacity for growth. It offers a compelling testament to the human spirit's capacity for transformation.  The Baja Peninsula serves as both a backdrop and a mirror. It immerses readers in four explorers' transformative journey through Baja California in 1962 and 1964, inspired by 'The Forgotten Peninsula' by Joseph Wood Krutch.  Photography enthusiasts will be thrilled to know the book offers a treasure trove of previously unreleased photographs of the area.  One reviewer called the book, ". . . a beautifully written, fabulous tale of an incredibly brave and daring journey." ReaderViews, in their 5-star review said, "A Finger of Land on an Old Man's Hand by Earl Vincent de Berge is the stark, witty, and profound memoir of four college students testing their limits on the Baja Peninsula in the summer of 1962. One could think of this as the classic literary assignment, 'How I Spent My Summer Vacation.' Only to do so would be to grossly underestimate this narrative."  Earl's adventures in Baja deepened his youthful fascination with the Sonoran Desert and its plants and animals, and inspired him to write a collection of charming stories for young readers. The main characters are Big Ears Jack – a huge magician jackrabbit – and other animals, birds and plants of the Sonoran Desert and its coastal regions. 'Big Ears Jack and Friends,' is now available on Amazon in both print and e-book formats and would be a unique and delightful addition to anyone's Christmas stocking.  The book took Best In Category 2024, Nonfiction, from the Arizona Authors Association.  To date, Earl has also published three collections of his poems, 'Allegro to Life,' 'Swans to Carry Me,' and 'Wind in the Elephant Tree,' which touch on nature, human nature, love, desert silence, and life in Guatemala.  All of de Berge's books are available at Amazon and other online book retailers. More information, including an excerpt from the book and a PDF of selected photos from 'A Finger Of Land On An Old Man's Hand', with insider details revealing Baja in the 1960s, is available at his website at https://www.earldeberge.com/.
