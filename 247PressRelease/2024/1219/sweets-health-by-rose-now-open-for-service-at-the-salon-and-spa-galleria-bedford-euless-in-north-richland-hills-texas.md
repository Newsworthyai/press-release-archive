# Sweets Health by Rose Now Open for Service at the Salon and Spa Galleria Bedford-Euless in North Richland Hills, Texas

NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, TX, December 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Holistic Licensed Massage Therapist Calena Rose White proudly announces the opening of Sweets Health by Rose LLC, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Bedford-Euless Rd in North Richland Hills, Texas. White provides massage services that include Swedish massage, deep-tissue massage, hot stone therapy, chair massage, lymphatic drainage, pregnancy massage, and sports massage.  White received her training as a student in the Massage Therapy program at Tarrant County College South Campus. A member of the American Massage Therapy Association, White has been working in the massage industry for two years. As a native of New Orleans, White is well-versed in Southern hospitality. That, combined with her background as a military veteran, provided her with everything she needed to effectively run a massage therapy business.   "It's my goal to help others feel better and improve their quality of life," White said. "I believe healing is inclusive to the mind, body and soul," she added.  White offers a variety of massage treatments, and some of the more popular therapies she performs include Swedish massage, pregnancy massage and hot-stone therapy.  Swedish massage combines oils or lotion with an array of strokes to help improve circulation. Rolling, kneading and percussion can help increase flexibility and provide relief from pain. Other benefits include lowered stress levels and enhanced mental clarity.  Pregnancy can create tremendous stress in a woman's body due to dramatic physical and emotional changes. Using various techniques specially developed for the expectant mother, pregnancy massage helps relieve joint pain due to extra weight and postural imbalance, and also helps with relaxation and improved breathing.  Hot stone therapy is a style of massage using heated stones placed at specific sites on the body to encourage relaxation and promote circulation in muscles. When muscles are heated with these stones, they release tension and stress much more deeply and quickly than with a traditional massage.   "With hot stone therapy, the overall experience is very relaxing, nurturing and rejuvenating," White said.  Sweets Health by Rose LLC is currently accepting new clients, and White is offering a 10-percent discount for first-time customers.
