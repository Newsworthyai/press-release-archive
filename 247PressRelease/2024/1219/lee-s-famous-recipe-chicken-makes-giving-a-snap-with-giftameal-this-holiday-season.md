# LEE'S FAMOUS RECIPE CHICKEN MAKES GIVING A SNAP WITH GIFTAMEAL THIS HOLIDAY SEASON

SHALIMAR, FL, December 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lee's Famous Recipe® Chicken, known for over 55 years for its home-style fried chicken, is making it effortless and delicious to give back this holiday season through its partnership with GiftAMeal. This innovative cause-marketing program turns customer photos into meals for local families in need by reminding restaurant guests to share the season, utilizing technology to benefit those who are food insecure.   In addition to the 195,000 meals the brand has already donated, Lee's is challenging its customers to snap and share photos of their meals through the GiftAMeal platform so that collectively the brand can donate another 40,000 meals between now and the new year.   "Hunger is a growing issue in our country, and Lee's is incredibly proud to team up with GiftAMeal to support their efforts and help bring an end to food insecurity," said Dan Sokolik, VP of Marketing of Lee's Famous Recipe® Chicken. "The program makes it very easy for guests to make an impact in their local communities for no extra cost, plus they can enjoy our great tasting chicken at the same time!"   To make it easy for customers to know how to make their photos count, Lee's printed "how to" messaging about the program on its packaging along with a QR code to access GiftAMeal. Additionally, the new Lee's mobile app features a GiftAMeal button that allows guests to engage directly and effortlessly. By simply clicking the button and uploading a photo of their dining experience, guests trigger a restaurant-funded donation to a local food bank to help provide a meal to a family in need.    Lee's GiftAMeal initiative runs throughout the year, allowing guests to participate at any time.
