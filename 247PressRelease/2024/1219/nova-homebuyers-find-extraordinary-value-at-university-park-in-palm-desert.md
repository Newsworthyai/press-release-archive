# Nova Homebuyers Find Extraordinary Value at University Park in Palm Desert

PALM DESERT, CA, December 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For home shoppers considering the California desert, Nova at University Park is a highly desirable choice for diverse and changing households. "We love living here," said empty nester Rose Arguin, who moved from San Diego with her husband Dan. "We love the house, the area and our neighbors, and we will never move."  High style at attainable price—Nova features distinctive architecture with enriched detailing, upscale interiors and builder-included extras. Prices begin in the low $700,000s. Plan sizes range from 2,328 to 2,751 square feet and provide 4 to 5 bedrooms and 3.5 to 4.5 bathrooms. All homes include a 2-car garage.  Model homes for Nova's two new casita designs highlight the latest from award-winning Woodbridge Pacific Group. Both designs add to buyer choices for new homes with independent living capacity.   Casita and ADU Designs—Nova designs are ideal as a permanent residence or as a winter home with lock-and-leave ease, and casita and ADU layouts provide additional flexibility. Empty nesters, first-time buyers, seniors and multi-gen households are among recent shoppers.   "Our ADU and casita shoppers want a stylish new home that answers lifestyle questions now, and over time," said Todd Cunningham, WPG President. "Examples include homeowners whose parents—or adult children—want to come to Palm Desert for extended visits in the winter. We also see young buyers who want extra income to help with the mortgage, and the potential for higher resale value is attractive to all."  Self-contained layouts—these designs include sleeping and living space, a bathroom and wardrobe, washer/dryer space and a compact kitchen. A separate entry further privatizes the homes, optimizing an ADU or casita for income potential, or as independent space for parents, live-in help or long-term guests.   "The best bet is to come to our model center, tour the ADU and casita model homes, and ask WPG Community Counselor Chad Ross your questions," said Cunningham.  Indoor/outdoor connectivity in every Nova home features great room layouts, through-plan views, and private side courts. Sleek kitchens are ideal for entertaining and for everyday pleasure. Secluded primary suites with spa baths and walk-in wardrobes strengthen luxurious design quality.   Nova residents can enjoy their new home in a well-situated Palm Desert locale. University Park is near the 10 Freeway, with the intersection of Gerald Ford Drive and Portola Road offering easy access to WPG's neighborhoods.   Key Destinations—Eisenhower Health draws Nova buyers who are employed here, as well as residents seeking ready access to renowned medical services. With multiple facilities throughout the desert, Eisenhower Health offers an exceptional array of services and providers. See www.eisenhowerhealth.org for more on out-patient and hospital services in Palm Desert, Palm Springs, North Palm Springs, Indio and other locales.   Strong schools—For family buyers, area schools are another plus. The Desert Sands Unified School District and Palm Springs Unified serve University Park with quality schools for K-12.   Shopping and Leisure—Abundant retail and dining choices are convenient, and so are hiking trails and other recreational options. Signature destinations include El Paseo Shopping District and the new Acrisure Arena, which hosts sports and entertainment events.   Close To Home—Leisure fun is close at hand at The Grove, the master plan's amenity center. The Grove features a resort pool, a lap pool and a kiddie pool, plus gathering rooms, kitchen and an indoor fitness center. A shaded playground, pickleball court, a stage area, lawn areas for events and games, a firepit and a BBQ area add more enticing venues.   Residents of University Park will also find leisure time choices at nearby parks. These include a dog park and a park with covered play area, basketball court and lawn.
