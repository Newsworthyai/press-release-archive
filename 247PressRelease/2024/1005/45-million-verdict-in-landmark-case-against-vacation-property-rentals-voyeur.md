# $45 Million Verdict in Landmark Case Against Vacation Property Rentals Voyeur

AIKEN, SC, October 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a landmark decision, an Aiken County jury awarded Heather and Gabriel Crespo $45 million in damages after evidence revealed that landlord Rhett C. Riviere had secretly recorded them in a South Carolina vacation rental. Ryan Beasley, a prominent criminal defense and civil litigation attorney, along with co-counsel Wes Few and Debbie Barbier, worked tirelessly to ensure Riviere was held accountable for his actions.  On Wednesday, September 25, 2024, the jury awarded the couple $27 million in compensatory damages and an additional $18 million in punitive damages—underscoring the severity of Riviere's violations. In 2001, Riviere covertly filmed the Crespos while they stayed at one of his rental properties, using hidden cameras in their bedroom and bathroom. Over two decades, Riviere recorded more than 20,000 unsuspecting renters.  The hidden recordings came to light in 2019 when Riviere's ex-fiancée discovered microSD cards containing videos of men, women, and allegedly minors filmed at multiple properties. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) seized 3.7 terabytes of data from Riviere's properties, leading to civil and criminal investigations.  During the trial, the legal team highlighted the emotional distress that Heather and Gabriel Crespo endured. "We will never know how many times Mr. Riviere hit play or rewind," the legal team shared. "We do know that their suffering will continue long after the cameras have stopped."  Riviere's actions violated privacy laws and resulted in voyeurism charges. The case is one of several lawsuits filed against him. Representing the Crespos, a team of attorneys, including Ryan Beasley Law, worked to bring the full extent of Riviere's conduct to light, ensuring that justice was served for both the Crespos and other potential victims.  Ryan Beasley's legal team emphasized that Riviere's actions reflected an unchecked sense of entitlement. The jury's decision to award punitive damages further cemented the seriousness of the offense and sent a strong message about the consequences of violating privacy laws.  The Crespos' victory is a significant step toward safeguarding renters' privacy rights. "This case is a reminder that no one is above the law," the legal team concluded.
