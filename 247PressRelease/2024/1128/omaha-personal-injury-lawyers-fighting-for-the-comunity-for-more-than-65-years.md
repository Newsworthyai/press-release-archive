# Omaha Personal Injury Lawyers Fighting for the Comunity for More Than 65 Years

OMAHA, NE, November 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Omaha personal injury attorneys at Welsh & Welsh PC, LLO have been helping their clients in a wide array of personal injury cases for over 65 years. They are licensed to practice law in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.  Recovering after a serious injury or accident can be difficult, but when that injury or incident was caused by the careless, reckless, or otherwise negligent actions of another person or corporation, the recovery process can seem needlessly brutal. You may feel like the entire world is collapsing and wonder if the American justice system has perhaps left your side.  "We're here to tell you that there is always hope. Our team approach to personal injury and wrongful death cases has helped people in our home of Omaha and throughout Nebraska, as well as the surrounding parts of Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. With our help, you won't have to wonder if a reckless drunk driver may get behind the wheel again. Hiring an experienced injury lawyer from Welsh & Welsh can give you the room you need to recover in a stress-free environment as we take over all legal tasks—including dealing with overbearing insurance adjusters. You can rest easy knowing that a personal injury lawsuit never costs the victim a cent unless their case is successful—and even then, our attorney's fees are taken out of the final verdict or settlement. Nothing is ever owed upfront in an injury-related case. This ensures that every victim can get the help they need to move forward. Whether you were involved in a serious car accident or truck accident or need help with a product liability or medical malpractice claim, we're on your side", said the spokesperson for Welsh & Welsh PC, LLO.  Attorney Christopher P. Welsh has worked on both sides of the law as a defense attorney representing insurance companies and a personal injury lawyer for private practices. That is important because it means he knows the mindset and perspective of his opposition–their strengths and weaknesses and who to talk to in order to move a case forward.  Moreover, he is committed to continuing the legacy of excellence that his father, attorney James R. Welsh, established in Welsh & Welsh PC, LLO, before his retirement.   Christopher P. Welsh received his Bachelor's Degree from the University of St. Thomas. He obtained his Juris Doctor (Cum Laude) from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.  Among other recognitions, he was the President of the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys in 2014 and was named one of the Top 100 by the National Trial Lawyers in 2018.  Welsh & Welsh PC, LLO is located at 9290 W. Dodge Rd, Suite 204, Omaha, NE 68114. You can contact them via phone at 402-749-0887 to schedule an appointment or a free initial consultation. Online inquiries can be submitted by filling out a brief form on their website. Visit their website or Facebook page for additional information regarding their services.
