# Announcing Our 2023 Farmer & Morris Law, PLLC Volunteer Service Scholarship Winner

RUTHERFORDTON, NC, July 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jordan Tye is the 2023 winner of the Farmer & Morris Law, PLLC Volunteer Service Scholarship. With this scholarship, Tye has the financial means to continue her studies at Arizona State University College of Law, but getting to this point has been a hard road.   Tye states that she was forced to grow up at age six as her mother struggled with drug addiction. Tye spent five years living with her grandparents, and it was during this time that she acquired a love of learning. She voraciously read books, learned math, and wrote short stories.   During her freshman year at high school, she worked as a Teen Court volunteer in the El Paso County Courthouse. From that experience, Tye decided to pursue a degree in law. She saw how lawyers could make a positive impact on the lives of others and their community, much like her role model, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   It was also during her time as a Teen Court volunteer that she learned not to judge a person solely on a police record. While reading a particular one, she let her biases form the wrong conclusions. Instead, she found an innocent young teenager who needed help.   Tye graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder where she earned a degree in Marketing with a minor in Political Science. She is presently attending Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law and should graduate in 2025.   Now, she hopes that with the Farmer & Morris Law, PLLC scholarship, she can finish school and earn her law degree, helping those stuck in the criminal justice system rebuild their lives.
