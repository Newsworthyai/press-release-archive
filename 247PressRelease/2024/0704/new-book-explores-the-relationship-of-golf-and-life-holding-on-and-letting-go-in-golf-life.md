CHICAGO, IL, July 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new book that delves into the game of golf and its parallels to everyday life. "Holding On and Letting Go (in) Golf & Life" by Michael J. Young, M.D. and John L. Perri, M.D. offers a unique perspective on the mental challenges of golf and how they mirror the struggles we face off the course.

Young and Perri provide insights into human behavior both on and off the golf course. The book explores topics such as managing expectations, dealing with failure, and finding balance - all through the lens of golf.

Key features of the book include: - Analysis of common psychological pitfalls in golf  - Fictional character studies that illuminate real-world behaviors - Parallels between golf challenges and life challenges - Insights on finding balance and enjoyment in both golf and life  "Holding On and Letting Go" will appeal to golfers of all skill levels, as well as non-golfers interested in psychology and self-improvement.
