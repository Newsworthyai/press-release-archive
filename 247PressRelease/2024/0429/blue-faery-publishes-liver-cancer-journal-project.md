# Blue Faery Publishes Liver Cancer Journal Project

LOS ANGELES, CA, April 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Blue Faery: The Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association announces its first book, I'd Rather Be Dead Than Deaf: A Young Woman's Journey With Liver Cancer. In her own words, the book is the journal of Adrienne Wilson, a teenage artist, poet, and beloved sister. Before her death from liver cancer at age 15, Adrienne expressed her funny, bright soul in this prolific journal. Her musings on life, relationships, music, love, and the beautiful grime of her adopted hometown of Los Angeles leap off the page. Her deep sensitivity and perspective are captured in full-color prints of her award-winning artwork. Steeped in late-90s nostalgia, this artistic journey through a teenage girl's eyes is moving, often hilarious, and unforgettable. Grab a free copy from Book Sirens!  E. Adrienne Wilson was a talented artist, gifted writer, voracious reader, and a budding musician when she was diagnosed with liver cancer in May 2001. Some of her academic achievements include a UCLA Creative Writing Scholarship, a Presidential Academic Achievement Award, a California Junior Scholastic Federation Gold Sealbearer, and more. Adrienne was an honor student with a 4.0 GPA. She completed two years of fine art studies at the Ragan Art Academy; she was the youngest person accepted into the program at that time. Adrienne received honorable mentions in many art competitions; her artwork was displayed in three Los Angeles galleries.  President Andrea Wilson Woods stated, "I'm thrilled to share Adrienne's voice with the world. The book begins one year before her diagnosis and continues until weeks before her death. I started Blue Faery in honor of Adrienne. All book proceeds go toward our free programs for patients and families."  Blue Faery's mission is to prevent, treat, and cure primary liver cancer through research, education, and advocacy. Blue Faery hosts an online Liver Cancer Community for patients and caregivers. Blue Faery provides free comprehensive patient education with its Patient Resource Guides for Liver Cancer. Blue Faery has three public education and awareness programs: Love Your Liver, The Truth About Liver Cancer, and You and Liver Cancer.  Exelixis, Elevar Therapeutics, and Eureka Therapeutics supported this project.
