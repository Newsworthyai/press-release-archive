# Burhani Engineers Strengthens Ethical & Professional Standards with Comprehensive Training Programme

NAIROBI, KENYA, November 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers Limited recently completed a comprehensive Code of Conduct and Ethics Training aimed at reinforcing the company's commitment to ethical and professional standards. This two-week training initiative was meticulously structured to educate employees on the principles of proper conduct, ensuring that both company policies and national labour laws are respected and adhered to. Led by an experienced Compliance Officer, the programme emphasised the importance of aligning daily practices with the company's core values and legal obligations.  The Compliance Officer played an integral role in the success of the training, overseeing the identification of potential compliance risks and ensuring policies were effectively understood and implemented across the organisation. By reinforcing these practices, Burhani Engineers aims to create an environment where every employee not only recognises the rules and expectations but embodies them in their work and interactions.  The training served multiple key objectives. It provided clarity on the expected behaviour of employees, both within the workplace and as representatives of the company beyond the organisation's walls. This clarity extended to communication protocols, outlining appropriate practices for interactions both internally and externally.   Another primary objective was to ensure adherence to laws and uphold the highest ethical standards in all aspects of business operations. Employees were taught to maintain compliance and make decisions that align with Burhani Engineers' values and legal requirements. The programme also aimed at fostering a positive and inclusive workplace culture, placing a strong emphasis on mutual respect, prevention of discrimination and anti-harassment measures.  Throughout the training, a range of important policies was covered to equip employees with the knowledge needed for effective and compliant conduct. These policies included Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC), Antitrust and Anti-Fraud, Child Protection, Conflict of Interest (COI) and detailed procedures for handling grievances and disciplinary matters. Employees were also instructed on the company's recruitment policies, social media guidelines, travel and out-of-station procedures and the whistleblower policy.   Training on third-party due diligence further underscored the company's vigilance when engaging with external partners, ensuring that every collaboration aligns with Burhani Engineers' ethical framework. General codes of conduct were explained in depth, alongside procedures for investigation planning to handle potential violations effectively.  The training highlighted the importance of strict compliance with laws, setting clear expectations for employees to observe relevant legal standards and act with integrity. It reinforced the significance of maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment, underscoring the protocols necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment. The responsible use and protection of company property were also key topics, ensuring employees understood their duty to safeguard Burhani's assets.  Through this initiative, Burhani Engineers Limited seeks to empower its workforce, enabling them to act in ways that reflect both compliance and the company's deeply held values. By educating employees on their roles and responsibilities, the training supports a culture of transparency and accountability.   The programme aimed not just to instruct but to inspire employees to uphold ethical conduct as a foundation for both personal and organisational success. This strategic emphasis on integrity ensures that Burhani Engineers' practices continue to exemplify the highest standards, strengthening its reputation and fostering a sustainable, value-driven work environment.
