# Mango Animate Developed a Free AI Video Generator for Creators

HONG KONG, September 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the last few years, the use of video creation has skyrocketed for education and marketing purposes. This surge has fueled the need for tools that empower creators of all levels to produce professional-looking videos quickly and easily. Mango Animate, a leading animation software provider, responded to the surging demand for video creation tools by launching Mango AI, a free AI video generator that simplifies the video-making process for creators across all industries and experience levels.   Mango AI is a free AI video generator with an intuitive interface that is designed for absolute beginners with no prior video generation experience. The user-friendly interface allows creators to generate videos from text in a few clicks, making video generation accessible to creators with limited technical expertise. All they need to do is pick an appropriate template, add their script, and pick an AI avatar.   Mango AI empowers creators with a vast library of lifelike AI avatars that seamlessly mimic human expressions. To complement these AI avatars, Mango AI offers a powerful voiceover system integrated with AWS Polly, Azure, and ElevenLabs, providing over 120 distinct voice options. This combination enables creators to meticulously select the suitable voice and avatar pairing to bring their scripts to life with remarkable realism.  What makes Mango AI stand out is its built-in whiteboards, which keep content on the same page. Creators can select a whiteboard from the free AI generator's diverse collection of whiteboards. They can customize the whiteboard by changing the 3D tilt effects, including 10% to the left and 10% to the right. Creators can position the AI avatar anywhere on the whiteboard, while the script text is displayed for a clear and engaging presentation.  "Users can not only convert text to videos but also create talking avatars from images. We also provide essential tools to polish your footage, including photo enhancements, background removal, and blurring," says Winston Zhang, CEO of Mango Animate.
