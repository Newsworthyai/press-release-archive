Antisemitism, PTSD, and substance abuse are just some of the topics explored in the gripping narrative of Aaron's War. All of these issues are viewed through the eyes young Aaron, an innocent protagonist thrust into the harrowing reality of World War II. Far from being modern-day phenomena, these challenges have persisted across generations, making their exploration in historical contexts all the more relevant and compelling.   Aaron's War is a masterful piece of writing that will likely take its place as one of the best WWII historical fiction novels ever written.  In this coming of age story, Aaron Vanko, an innocent Iowa farm boy, must wrestle with the ultimate test of humanity that so many veterans have faced: the willingness to kill in the name of duty. Aaron finds himself torn between his allegiance to his country and his personal belief system. Remarkably, just hours before deployment, a shocking revelation rocks his world: he discovers his Jewish heritage, shattering his sense of identity to its core.  Despite his sense of dread, Aaron forges ahead, driven by a profound sense of duty and patriotism. But now he finds he must battle on two fronts - the enemy forces without, sworn to wipe the Jewish race from the face of the earth, and the ethical dilemma within himself.  The ebook will be available September 17 through September 19 at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-McMaster/author/B01LDIJ2QU?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true.  Readers and reviewers has have praised Aaron's War. USA Today bestselling author Holly Roberts called Aarons War, "A coming of age story that grips your soul and takes you on a thought-provoking journey." Tom Porter, author of All I Need To Know About Business I Learned From A Duck stated, "An engaging, informative and thought-provoking tale of survival, love and faith. Make room for Richard McMaster on your list of up-and-coming authors." Lynn M. Safris said, "The descriptions and details given throughout this author's writing draw the reader into each page, making Aaron's journey feel like their own. I believe this book would appeal to a wide audience of readers. I truly enjoyed reading Aaron's War and I highly recommend this book."  Richard McMaster is also the author of A Love Divided By Time, described as "one part The Notebook, one part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter and find peace by joining her in the ever after.  In McMaster's latest book, Voyage Of Life, the life journey of Sean Buchanan is detailed through metaphoric depictions of the four stages of life in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings, childhood, youth, manhood, and Old Age. The painting's depictions are a metaphor for his lifeâ€”the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood become turbulent in youth, and early in manhood the shores turn rocky when he faces one obstacle after another. Secrets that live in darkness can take a lifetime to see the light of day and the secret that has hovered over him since Youth is revealed late in his life.
