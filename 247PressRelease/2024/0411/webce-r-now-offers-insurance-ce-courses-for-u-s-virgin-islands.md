# WebCE® Now Offers Insurance CE Courses for U.S. Virgin Islands

DALLAS, TX, April 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- WebCE®, a leading provider of online professional education and training solutions, is excited to announce the addition of the U.S. Virgin Islands to its insurance continuing education (CE) catalog.   Available now, these courses include comprehensive selections in Life and Health (L&H) and Property and Casualty (P&C) along with a variety of ethics courses to help licensees meet requirements while selecting CE topics that match their professional needs and interests.   Effective January 1, 2024, the Virgin Islands Division of Banking, Insurance and Financial Regulation has implemented new insurance CE requirements for all resident licensees holding Insurance Producer, Public Adjuster, Independent Adjuster, or Solicitor licenses. While all Virgin Island insurance licenses expire annually, the new requirements add an insurance CE requirement that mandates license holders complete 24 hours of insurance CE every two years. However, for the 2024-2025 renewal year, licensees only need to complete 12 hours of continuing education (3 hours of ethics and 9 hours of general insurance CE) by the end of 2024 prior to submitting their renewal.   "WebCE is excited to be one of the first continuing education providers for insurance professionals in the U.S. Virgin Islands," says Lynn Knauf, WebCE Curriculum & Content Development Director for Insurance CE. "We are committed to staying on top of new requirements around the nation to serve professionals with quality educational experiences that help grow their careers."
