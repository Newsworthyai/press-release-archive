# Itchko Ezratti's GL Homes Sponsors Event to Benefit Legal Aid Society in Palm Beach

BOYNTON BEACH, FL, June 28, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pickleball pros from GL Homes Valencia Grand community extended a warm welcome to developmentally disabled clients of the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County for a pickleball lesson at their Boynton Beach facility. This event was made possible through the dedication of Valencia Grand Sports Director Nico Osorio, Pickleball Pro Nahom Endrias, and several GL Homes employees, who all volunteered their time to make this event a success.  The participants, ranging in age from 26 to 32, are part of the Guardian Advocacy Project (GAP). Many of these individuals aged out of the foster care system and, without the support of the Legal Aid Society, would be facing homelessness. The Legal Aid Society, a steadfast nonprofit, serves as the health surrogate and legal guardian for these adults, providing essential support and advocacy.  "Leading the event and hosting the Legal Aid Society's clients for a pickleball session was a real honor. Seeing their enthusiasm just emphasized the importance of community. It was a great day, full of joy and genuine connections." - Nico Osorio, Valencia Grand Sports Director.
