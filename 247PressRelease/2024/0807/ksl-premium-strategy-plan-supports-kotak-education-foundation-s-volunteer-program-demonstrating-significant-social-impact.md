# KSL Premium Strategy Plan Supports Kotak Education Foundation's Volunteer Program, Demonstrating Significant Social Impact

MUMBAI, INDIA, August 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A report released today by Kotak Education Foundation (KEF) shows that its volunteer program has brought significant changes to impoverished communities in Mumbai over the past year. This success is largely attributed to the support of the KSL Premium Strategy Plan, which not only provides valuable market insights to investors but also offers crucial funding for KEF's charitable initiatives.  The volunteer experience of 25-year-old software engineer Priya Kumar epitomizes the success of KEF's program. Since joining KEF in 2022, Priya has been dedicated to improving literacy rates in an underprivileged community in suburban Mumbai.  "Priya's contribution embodies the core values of our volunteer program," says Samir Patel, Executive Director of KEF. "Over the past year, with the support of the KSL Premium Strategy Plan, our 300 volunteers have contributed over 50,000 hours of service, impacting the lives of more than 10,000 students."  Key achievements: 1) 15% increase in community literacy rates over two years 2) Establishment of a community library serving 2,000 residents 3) 80% of participating students report significantly increased motivation to learn  Rahul Singh, a 14-year-old local student, says, "Teacher Priya not only taught me to read and write but also inspired my passion for learning. Now I dream of going to university one day."  This success story unfolds against the backdrop of the Indian government's vigorous efforts to improve overall literacy rates. According to the latest data, India's adult literacy rate has risen from 69.3% in 2011 to 77.7% in 2023. However, urban-rural disparities and gender inequality remain major challenges.  Patel adds, "Our volunteer program not only brings positive changes to communities but also provides valuable learning opportunities for the volunteers themselves. Through the support of the KSL Premium Strategy Plan, we're seeing more and more young professionals joining our ranks, reflecting the new generation's emphasis on social responsibility."  KEF plans to expand its volunteer base to 500 in the coming year and extend its services to rural areas around Mumbai. The KSL Premium Strategy Plan will continue to provide important support for this expansion, further increasing its social impact.
