# Dermatologist Christie Matter named a 2024 Castle Connolly Top Doctor

PROSPER, TX, August 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christie E. Matter, MD, has been recognized as a 2024 Castle Connolly Top Doctor — the first time she has received the prestigious Top Doctor honor. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are selected annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors in their regions for their specialties.  Dr. Matter is a dermatologist with Lockhart Matter Dermatology & Aesthetic Center in Plano and Lockhart Matter Dermatology, Mohs and Surgery Center in Plano, the practice she co-founded in 2021 with Susanne Lockhart, MD, also a Castle Connolly Top Doctor.  In September 2024, the practice will open its second location in Plano, which will include a Mohs, facial reconstruction, and cosmetic surgery center. Dr. Aahtman Shah will join the practice and provide Mohs surgery and cosmetic surgery procedures including blepharoplasties, face, neck, and brow lifts, and hair transplants.   Dr. Matter is certified by the American Board of Dermatology. She diagnoses and treats a diverse variety of skin conditions in people of all ages.   "I love treating families — from newborn babies to grandparents — it is so rewarding to be able to help in all the stages of life," she says.  She treats all types of premalignant and malignant skin conditions including actinic keratoses, atypical moles, basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma. She also treats bacterial, viral, and fungal infections such as athlete's foot, shingles, tinea, impetigo, and warts; growth and pigmentation issues such as moles, birthmarks, and melasma. She enjoys treating hair loss in women and men and her office offers platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatments for hair loss as well as several systemic treatments for thinning hair. She is a specialist in treating acne, folliculitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).   She performs skin cancer screenings and works to prevent and educate people about skin cancer.  A skilled diagnostician who is dedicated to the long-term wellness of her patients, Dr. Matter knows that skin diseases aren't just "skin deep" and that having skin conditions from acne to eczema to cancer can cause emotional distress as well as physical stress. She works with patients providing the most up-to-date treatments and minimizes anxiety through patient education which gives patients a feeling of control over their skin conditions. She likes to tell her patients, "I worry about your skin so you don't have to."   "Everyone can benefit from seeing a dermatologist, but people over the age of 50 especially need to be seen for skin exams," Dr. Matter says. "The cumulative effect of sun exposure over time leads to the development of skin cancers. Since sunscreens weren't as available to this age group when they were young, the amount of damage can be worse than in younger age groups. Older people can also be on medications to treat other health conditions that can cause sensitivity to the sun, skin rashes, or dryness which needs to be monitored and treated."  Dr. Matter earned her medical degree at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, finishing number three in her class. She completed three years of dermatology residency training: one year at Duke University Hospital and two years at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, serving as chief resident her final year.  She also holds a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of North Texas.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  "I am honored to have been nominated as a Connolly Top Doctor. Being selected by your peers for an honor such as this is one of the most rewarding recognitions. It means that your peers trust you as much as your patients do," Dr. Matter says.  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications. Nominations are open to all board-certified MDs, DOs, and DPMs. The Castle Connolly team chooses honorees based on nominee criteria that includes their medical education, training, hospital appointments, and disciplinary histories.  Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected as a Castle Connolly Top Doctor.
