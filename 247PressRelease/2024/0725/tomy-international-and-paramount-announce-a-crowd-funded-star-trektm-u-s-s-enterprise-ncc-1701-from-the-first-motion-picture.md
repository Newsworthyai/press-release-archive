# TOMY INTERNATIONAL AND PARAMOUNT ANNOUNCE A CROWD-FUNDED STAR TREK™ U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701 
FROM THE FIRST MOTION PICTURE

OAKBROOK, IL, July 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TOMY announced a large-scale crowd-funded Star Trek U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 will be available for pre-order starting August 1, 2024, through September 12, 2024. Based on the starship from the first motion picture, this offering for Star Trek fans, creates a unique opportunity to own the definitive version of the iconic starship. The crowd-funded project, culminating in the creation of the highly detailed 1:350 scale premium die-cast U.S.S. Enterprise, is the second collaboration for the partners.  "This TOMY Plus crowd-funded U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 will be the centerpiece of any avid Star Trek fan's collection," said Bill Walters, Senior Vice President at TOMY International. "Coinciding with the launch of pre-sale, and eager to showcase the offering to the devoted fanbase, we will be attending the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention – and I can't wait!"  TOMY International Inc. continues to work with noted Star Trek experts, such as Gary Kerr, to ensure this replica is as accurate as possible to the original motion picture studio model. "As far as I'm concerned, this is the most accurate model of the Motion Picture Enterprise that has yet been produced, as its design incorporates reference materials not available previously," said Kerr. "TOMY, to their credit, has listened to the critiques and advice of our team of out and proud nerds. Getting the shape of the ship correct is one thing, but the icing on top of the Refit cake is the use of the same type of color-changing interference paints that were used on the studio model. Modelers who want a replica of the Motion Picture ship, but who are unwilling to invest countless hours and yards of masking tape in painting their model, can now purchase a pre-painted replica of the ship. Trek fans, you're gonna need a bigger shelf!"   Exciting features include: •	1:350 scale, 34.29" x 16.00" x 11.15" in dimension •	Iridescent paint pattern to mimic the original motion picture studio model •	Diecast saucer, main body, and neck of Enterprise •	Viewable detailed interior of hangar deck and officers' lounge to match the first motion picture •	Three different light modes (start, warp and impulse/cruise mode) light up an array of features including the Nav Deflector, Impulse Drive, Nacelles, Phaser Banks, and Photon Torpedo Launchers •	Viewable detailed interior of Arboretum to match the first motion picture •	SURAK Shuttlecraft with Warp Sled- 5.6" long and display stand (not attached) •	Enterprise display base with Type-C USB power port (no cable included); no batteries required •	Premium collector packaging  The TOMY Star Trek™: The Motion Picture U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 will weigh 20lbs and be priced at $699 USD (continental United States only and before shipping) and production will begin in the fall after the goal of 5,000 pieces is met.
