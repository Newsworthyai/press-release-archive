# Jason Chalik Makes The National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List

PLANTATION, FL, March 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jason Chalik, founding partner of Chalik & Chalik Injury Lawyers, was awarded a spot on the National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List. The National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List is an invitation-only organization that offers membership to the top-ranking trial lawyers from each state. Lawyers invited to join the organization must meet strict qualifications, and invitations are limited to attorneys practicing civil plaintiff and criminal defense law.   Jason Chalik's Dedication to His Clients and Community Earn Him a Spot on the National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List   Attorney Jason Chalik is well-deserving of his spot on the National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List. Not only is he experienced in personal injury law, but he also truly cares about the clients he represents. He fights for justice for victims of all kinds of personal injury accidents, including car accidents, pedestrian accidents, and commercial vehicle accidents.   Jason, and his wife and business partner Debi Chalik, founded Chalik & Chalik Injury Lawyers in 2003. They've helped their clients recover multi-million-dollar settlements because they are passionate about helping injured victims secure the settlements they need. Jason says, "Debi and I take everything personally. To us, it's not just a job. We don't stop thinking about our cases when we go home at night. I think that makes us better."  Jason applies his passion and dedication to helping others outside of his law firm, too. He is a member of the board of directors for Debbie's Dream Foundation, which is a national organization that supports stomach cancer awareness and research. He is also a supporter of ChildNet, a South Florida-based charity that supports children who have been abused, neglected, and abandoned.   Years of Experience Prepared Jason Chalik to Operate His Own Law Firm With His Wife and Business Partner, Debi Chalik  Attorney Jason Chalik has been passionate about studying law since he was young. While attending American University, he was fascinated with the legal system, courtrooms, and politics. He studied political science and justice before moving on to the University of Florida to attend law school.   After graduating and passing the bar exam, Jason worked for personal injury attorneys Rosen & Monaldi in Plantation, Florida. He later became a managing partner at the firm, which became Rosen & Chalik. While fighting cases at Rosen & Chalik, Jason worked with his now-wife, Debi Chalik.  When attorney Rosen retired, Jason and Debi took over the firm, and Chalik & Chalik Injury Lawyers was founded. Jason's years of guiding clients to successful case outcomes make him the ideal addition to the National Trial Lawyers Top 100 List.
