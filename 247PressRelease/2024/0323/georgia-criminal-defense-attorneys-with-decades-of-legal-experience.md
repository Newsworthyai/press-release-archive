# Georgia Criminal Defense Attorneys With Decades of Legal Experience

MARIETTA, GA, March 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Frye Law Group is a Marietta, Georgia-based criminal defense law firm with over 30 years of experience. They practice fighting capital cases like murder and rape, as well as DUI and other science-backed cases.  "When you're charged with a crime, it can feel like your life has turned upside down. You don't know what to say or who to trust. Law enforcement and prosecutors will try to tell you that you're a criminal. They want a confession – and they don't care whether you're guilty or not. Your reputation could be destroyed, your career ruined, and your future taken away. And that's where we come in. At the Frye Law Group, nothing is more important than getting results on behalf of our clients. Our 30 years of combined experience and specific training make us well-equipped to fight capital cases like murder and rape, and our extensive knowledge of field and lab testing procedures allows us to present science-backed cases to a jury with knowledge and credibility. Above all, we never lose our dedication to our clients and our respect for the process that may currently be upending their lives", said the spokesperson for Frye Law Group.  Frye Law Group represents those in Cobb County and the Atlanta metropolitan area who have been charged with a crime, including drug offenses, sex offenses, juvenile offenses, and DUI. Frye Law Group was founded in 2008 by the attorney Kim Keheley Frye, a former prosecutor and lifelong advocate for justice.  After graduating from North Cobb High School, Kim Frye studied Criminal Justice at the University of Georgia and went on to get her J.D. from Georgia State University College of Law.  Soon after graduating, she began as an Assistant District Attorney for the Blue Ridge Judicial Circuit, and later, she worked as an Assistant Solicitor General for the Cobb County Solicitor General's Office. Her experience as a prosecutor inspired her to open her own law firm – but this time, as a criminal defense lawyer.  She has seen enough cases to know that sometimes the government gets it wrong. Clients typically come to Kim in crisis, and she takes the time to learn each client's story thoroughly and helps them understand the system they've been thrust into and what's at stake in their case.  Kim has served as both President and Vice President of the Cobb Bar Association Criminal Defense Section and as a Board Member of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense. She has also presented at both national and international conferences regarding DUIs and professionalism. Furthermore, she has been selected to Super Lawyers 2018 - 2024.  Frye Law Group, LLC is located at 170 Anderson St. SE, Marietta, GA 30060. You can contact them via phone at (770) 919-9525 or to schedule an appointment.
