# Ari Stiegler says that Prism is a win-win for companies

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Entrepreneur Ari Stiegler announced his endorsement of Prism, a revolutionary financial mechanism designed to serve businesses and their employees through equity-based loans. According to Stiegler, Prism's innovative approach enables shareholders to access up to $100 million in cash while retaining their pre-IPO shares.  Key Points of Prism's Financial Services: - Prism can provide substantial loans, offering individuals up to $100 million in liquidity. - It creates liquidity options for founders, employees, and investors. - Shareholders in private U.S. tech companies hold an estimated $2 trillion in equity value, which could be unlocked with these loans. - Unlike private lenders, Prism ensures no equity fees or personal guarantees and allows shareholders flexible repayment schedules.  Prism emerges as a strategic solution when companies choose to stay private longer, influencing how they manage liquidity events for shareholders. Ari Stiegler notes that providing employee liquidity enhances recruiting efforts, improves employee satisfaction, and heightens retention rates. Prism is an alternative solution to the need to sell shares outrightâ€”a strategy that provides immediate liquidity and doesn't impact future appreciation of shares.  Prism's value proposition includes removing the need for reliance on a personal credit score. The qualification process reviews equity, granting significant borrowing capabilities without personal guarantees. This feature positions Prism above other private lenders, presenting a more advantageous financial product for those looking to leverage their vested shares in their company's equity without incurring additional costs or losing share control.  Quotes from Ari Stiegler: "Prism stands out as a uniquely beneficial service that aligns the interests of employers and employees by focusing on the value of equity rather than personal creditworthiness. The absence of equity fees and personal recourse further solidifies its position as a market leader."  "With the vast wealth tied up in shareholder equity within private U.S. tech companies, Prism offers a pathway to unlock these funds responsibly while safeguarding long-term interests."  Prism provides companies and employees with a mutually beneficial outcome: immediate access to liquidity without compromising ownership or control, no changes to the cap table, and a streamlined procedure that eliminates the intricacies associated with conventional lending arrangements.
