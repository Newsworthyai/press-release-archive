# Luxury Wedding Photographer Turns $76,000 Lawsuit to Charity Benefit Amid Federal Lawsuit Drama

NEW YORK, NY, December 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a case that has captivated the wedding and legal worlds after going viral, a New Jersey surgeon sued a luxury wedding photographer over a $76,000 dispute—and then refused an offer to have the entire amount donated to charity. Dr. Amit Patel, a New Jersey vascular surgeon, who took photographer Clane Gessel to court after a destination wedding in Turkey, shocked observers by rejecting the philanthropic proposal and insisting the money go to his own pocket. The court ultimately dismissed Patel's claims, leaving Patel with nothing.  "This wasn't just about the money—it was a chance to do something good in the world," said Gessel. "I'm still stunned that the offer wasn't accepted."  From Glamorous Weddings to Courtroom Drama  The case revolved around Gessel's agreement to photograph Patel's daughter's luxury wedding in Turkey, which required extensive travel and logistical planning. Patel accused Gessel of failing to deliver on the promised services for his daughter, Anisha Patel and her fiancé, Arjun Mehta, seeking a $76,000 payout. However the court dismissed the claims, affirming that Gessel met his contractual obligations.  The controversy deepened when Gessel proposed a resolution: donating the full $76,000 to charity as a way to turn a contentious situation into something positive. Patel rejected the offer, a move that many have criticized as prioritizing the personal greed of the wealthy over generosity.  A Philanthropic Response  Despite the lawsuit's dismissal, Gessel decided to turn the ordeal into a force for good. He announced the launch of the Lens of Love Campaign in early 2025, a charitable initiative offering free photography services to families facing adversity, including illness, financial struggles, and other hardships. Inspired by a history of philanthropic work and the failed attempt to resolve the dispute charitably, Gessel is using the campaign to ensure that something meaningful comes from the experience.  "This lawsuit was a huge headache, but I used it as the motivation to make a difference," said Gessel. "If I couldn't turn this case into a win for charity, I can still use my skills to help others in need."  A Reflection on Values  The lawsuit has sparked conversations about priorities and ethics in high-profile disputes. While the legal case has concluded, Gessel believes the broader story raises questions about generosity, greed, and the impact of personal choices.  "This was never just about a financial disagreement," Gessel said. "It was about standing for something bigger than yourself. I made my choice, and I'll stand by it."
