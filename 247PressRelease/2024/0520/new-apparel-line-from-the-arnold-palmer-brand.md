# New Apparel Line from the Arnold Palmer Brand

ORLANDO, FL, May 20, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Arnold Palmer Group today announced AD Palmer, a new line of golf and lifestyle fashions created with Full Turn Custom Apparel. The new line is made with custom fabrics and features modern silhouettes and design touches inspired by its iconic namesake's legendary personal style. Comprised of a range of shirts, sweaters, and pull-overs, and featuring a signature blazer, the collection is made in Italy of merino wool, silk, cashmere and other fine materials. It will be available at select golf clubs and retail locations across the United States and the UK beginning in May of this year.   "From my dad's humble beginnings, how he presented himself was of paramount importance to him, a fact reflected in his consistently neat, clean personal look," said Amy Palmer Saunders. "I believe the AD Palmer collection, from our partner Full Turn, reflects my father's own approach to style and to life, with quality craftsmanship and straightforward design. I know that he would be humbled by the commitment of the designers, artisans and many others who spend so much time attending to every detail, ensuring that his name and legacy are so fittingly honored."  Known for winning seven majors (including four Masters) and having an immeasurable impact on the game of golf, Palmer also was lauded for his effortless sense of style. Both on course and off, many of his signature pieces bore his initials—ADP, for Arnold Daniel Palmer. He regularly appeared in the pages of such publications as Esquire, LOOK and LIFE, and in 2007 was honored by GQ as one of its "50 Most Stylish Men of the Past 50 Years." A friend to Presidents, world leaders and celebrities, and beloved by "Arnie's Army"—his legion of fans around the globe—the iconic golfer, philanthropist and aviator lived by a code of conduct learned from his father, Deacon, which included the maxim: "You don't need to tell anybody how good you are. You show them how good you are."  The new AD Palmer collection complements that approach to life, with an artisan's attention to detail and elevated but unpretentious stylings, presented in a range of colors and patterns suitable for modern-day champions. All garments are produced in Italy with Italian fabrics, retail price points range from $175 to $575, and the line is being brought to market via invitation only. There will be no direct-to-consumer online sales, allowing each retail partner to enjoy a sense of exclusivity.  "We feel extremely honored to be given the chance to create and manufacture an apparel collection inspired by the legendary Arnold Palmer," expressed Mark Killeen, CEO of Full Turn. "The moment is opportune to introduce this collection, highlighting natural fibers, to both the specialty and golf markets."
