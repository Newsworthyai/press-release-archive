# From Awareness to Action: Learning.com's Commitment to Supporting Healthy Relationships with Technology for Kids

PORTLAND, OR, May 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the world observes Mental Health Awareness Month this May, Learning.com, a leading provider of digital literacy solutions, is taking proactive steps to address a pressing issue: the need for young learners to develop healthy relationships with technology. Recognizing that banning technology isn't the solution, Learning.com is engaging educators and parents in the conversation and providing free tools and resources during the month of May aimed at supporting the creation of positive digital experiences for children. Through an informative webinar with experts in the field on May 21, Learning.com will foster discussions that aim to help students build healthy relationships with technology.  "As parents, educators and humans, it goes beyond mere awareness; it's about taking action. We have an obligation to teach our kids how to live safely in the world of technology," said Learning.com CEO Lisa O'Masta. "We believe that by providing educators and parents with the necessary resources and guidance, we can equip children with the skills they need to navigate their digital world safely and confidently."  For O'Masta, the issue is personal. In an emotional video, she shared her story of experiencing a parent's worst nightmare – her teenager attempted to take his own life following a series of common and problematic online interactions. Similar scenarios have played out for families across the country. In fact, the issue is so pervasive that in 2023 the Surgeon General issued a mental health advisory on the dangers of social media for young people.  Yet students must learn to safely and effectively navigate and leverage the vast digital world in order to be college- and career-ready. As a leading provider of digital literacy curriculum, Learning.com is hosting a webinar on "Helping Kids Create a Healthy Relationship with Technology," on May 21, 2024, at 4 p.m. PDT. The panel will feature the following experts:  - Dino Ambrosi, Digital wellness speaker and founder of Project Reboot - Diana Graber, Author & founder of Cyberwise - Merve Lapus, VP of Education Outreach and Engagement, Common Sense Education - Cary Perales, Director of Instructional Technology, Corpus Christi Independent School District - Lisa O'Masta, CEO of Learning.com as moderator.  Registration is free and both parents and educators are encouraged to attend.  Additionally, Learning.com is releasing some of its popular educational resources for teachers and parents to use throughout Mental Health Awareness Month. The following video lessons and downloadable activities can be found at learning.com/mental-health-awareness-month:  - Grades K-2. In the video "Pearl's Private Password" students follow Rocki and Pearl as they learn about usernames and passwords, and gain an understanding of the basics of internet privacy and safety.
