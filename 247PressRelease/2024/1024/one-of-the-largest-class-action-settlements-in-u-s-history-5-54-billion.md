# One of the Largest Class Action Settlements in U.S. History – $5.54 Billion

NEW YORK, NY, October 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- U.S. businesses that accepted Visa and Mastercard payments from January 1, 2004, to January 25, 2019, may now get some relief from the high cost of past transactions through a $5.54 billion settlement. This historic class-action lawsuit addresses Visa and Mastercard's violation of antitrust laws, which imposed inflated processing fees on merchants.  This settlement concluded that Visa, Mastercard, and their member banks unfairly conspired to fix high swipe fees. These fees significantly increased merchants' cost of doing business by covering card processing expenses and enforcing anti-competitive rules that restricted alternative payment methods.  Why This Matters for Business Owners Merchants can now recoup up to 1-1.5% of their total gross processing volume from the settlement period, providing significant financial relief for businesses burdened by years of excessive fees. However, the actual recovery amount will depend on several factors, including the total valid claims submitted.  CardSettlement provides expert assistance throughout the claims process, ensuring that businesses receive the support and transparency they need to maximize recovery with no upfront costs.

Case number 05-md-1720 (E.D.N.Y.), is known as In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation.
