# ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF ORSON WELLES "WAR OF THE WORLDS" A NEW BOOK REVEALS THE REAL TERROR OF THE HALLOWEEN BROADCAST IN 1938

CHICAGO, IL, October 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The revisionism lately of Orson Welles War of the Worlds 1938 broadcast is that it did affect many beyond l the East Coast and most people did not believe Martians had invaded and were exterminating the human race with heat ray guns and poisonous gas. William Hazelgroves new book Dead Air The Night Orson Welles Terrified America (Rowman and Littlefield) poiints to a different America thrown into mass panic from the broadcast produced and directed by the twenty-three-year-old Welles.   On a warm Halloween Eve, October 30, 1938, during a broadcast of H G. Wells' War of the Worlds, Orson Welles held his hands up for radio silence in the CBS studio in New York City while millions of people ran out into the night screaming, grabbed shotguns, drove off in cars, and hid in basements, attics, or anywhere they could find to get away from Martians intent on exterminating the human race. As Welles held up his hands to his fellow actors, musicians, and sound technicians, he turned six seconds of radio silence—dead air—into absolute horror, changing the way the world would view media forever, and making himself one of the most famous men in America.  With the eighty sixth anniversary of the broadcast just around the corner, this new interpretation of Orson Welles opera of panic throws a different light on what has become a point of contention for historians and pop culture aficionado's. Did people really believe that Martians were exterminating the human race and did mass panic engulf the country? Willliam Hazelgrove makes a convincing case people did believe the broadcast and the ensuing terror and panic was a real time example of what would happen if aliens ever did land on earth.
