# CAHEC Publishes Second Annual ESG Report

RALEIGH, NC, October 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- We are pleased to announce the publication of our second annual ESG (Environmental, Social, & Governance) report. Our 2023-2024 ESG Impact Report provides content and context towards our accomplishments and goals in being a sustainable, resilient, and purposeful organization. Specifically, this year's report provides a detailed analysis of the voluntary ESG frameworks that CAHEC has chosen to report on, our accomplishments within these frameworks (July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024), and our future initiatives.  Some report highlights include:  •	CAHEC's alignment choices of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) standards for the 2023-2024 reporting year. •	CAHEC's commitment of $785,000 in annual community investments, which includes $60,000 in nutrition assistance and $20,000 in secondary education scholarships. •	CAHEC's collaboration with graduate students from the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) initiative at the NC State University (NCSU) Poole College of Management on a practicum focused on CAHEC's strategic priority of strengthening the impact of cost-effective environmental efforts at our affordable housing communities.  President & CEO of CAHEC, Dana Boole, shared that "An organization's annual report on ESG activities should be more than an illustration of their progress. Rather, its overarching essence should be the character, values, and perseverance behind those who drive and execute a story. The ability to identify opportunities, further strategies, and maximize impact – all in conjunction with one's vision - is paramount. CAHEC's commitment to ESG is anchored by our overarching values and drive towards being the premier community investment organization in the South."
