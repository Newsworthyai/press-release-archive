# Empowering Growth: Burhani Engineers Connects 27 Villages to Reliable Electricity

NAIROBI, KENYA, October 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Burhani Engineers Ltd., one of the leading electrical engineering companies in Kenya, is proud to announce the unveiling of the 20 MVA substation marking a significant milestone for the Morogoro region of Tanzania. It aims to provide much-needed access to stable electricity for the districts of Malinyi, Ulanga and Kilombero. The inauguration was a momentous event attended by Dr. Doto Mashaka Biteko, Tanzania's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Energy and Christine Grau, the Ambassador to the European Union. Constructed by the Government of Tanzania through the Rural Energy Agency (REA), with funding from the European Union community, the substation is set to transform the region by ensuring reliable power supply to thousands of residents and businesses.  The newly operational substation stands as a beacon of hope for a brighter future in Morogoro, supporting both the local economy and the development of essential services. With its objective to provide stable power, the substation promises to foster economic growth and improve the quality of life for residents, businesses, and institutions in the surrounding areas.  Burhani Engineers: At the Forefront of Power Distribution  As part of this ambitious initiative, Burhani Engineers played a crucial role in the supply, commissioning and installation of the distribution lines that will deliver electricity from the substation to surrounding communities. The Burhani Engineers team's involvement ensured that the project was completed efficiently, connecting power to 27 villages and bringing electricity to approximately 2,000 customers.  This distribution work was essential in ensuring that electricity reaches key institutions such as schools, posho mills, dispensaries, hospitals, churches and mosques. As a result, communities across the region are now benefiting from improved services, enhanced security and greater opportunities for economic growth. Burhani Engineers' work in connecting power lines has paved the way for these institutions to operate more effectively, providing critical support to the local population.  Powering Local Businesses and Enhancing Economic Independence  The introduction of reliable electricity has had a transformative effect on local businesses, particularly in agriculture, which plays a vital role in the economy of the Morogoro region. For instance, local rice millers have long struggled to process rice efficiently due to a lack of stable power. Previously, they were forced to transport rice to other locations to complete the milling process, significantly increasing costs and limiting their ability to compete in the market.  With the availability of stable power, local rice millers can now process rice within their communities, reducing production costs and boosting profitability. This development has led to a drop in the price of rice, making it more affordable for local consumers and contributing to the economic sustainability of the region. Additionally, businesses across sectors are now better able to operate independently, secure in the knowledge that they have access to a consistent power supply.  The improvements in local businesses are also accompanied by enhanced security throughout the region. The presence of electricity has helped increase safety measures in communities, making it easier for businesses and residents to conduct their activities without concern.  Recognition for Burhani Engineers' Expertise and Dedication  During the inauguration ceremony, a delegation from Burhani Engineers, including Mufaddal Sulemanji, Solomon Faraji and Duncan Rigii, were present to witness the official unveiling of the substation. Their involvement underscored the crucial role the company played in ensuring the project's success.  As a total solutions provider, Burhani Engineers' efforts were recognized by key stakeholders in the project, including the Operations Manager of the substation, who praised the company's dedication to delivering high-quality work. In his remarks, he expressed gratitude, stating, "Thank you for a great job. We have not had any issues since the handover; your team did a great job!"  This acknowledgment reflects the company's expertise and commitment to delivering sustainable, long-lasting solutions that meet the needs of local communities. The company's attention to detail and focus on timely delivery ensured that the substation became operational without any complications, providing residents and businesses with immediate access to electricity.
