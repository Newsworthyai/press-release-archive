# San Diego Gold Buyer Reminds Public of High Gold Prices

SAN DIEGO, CA, May 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Well-known San Diego gold buyer and estate jeweler Carl Blackburn is reminding San Diego residents that now is the time to get more cash for old gold jewelry. Gold prices have recently broke through the $2,400 mark and are approaching again the record high price of $2,431 an ounce.  "People who have been sitting back and waiting to sell gold jewelry, coins, and other gold gift assets, should know that it's a great time to convert that gold into cash," says Blackburn, who has been buying gold jewelry and other gold items in San Diego for over 15 years.  Back in the "gold rush" days of 2010, Blackburn became recognized as a trusted voice among gold buyers, appearing on KUSI-TV News to share his advice to gold sellers in San Diego.   He currently works from his La Jolla jewelry store, C. Blackburn Jewelers, where he helps customers sell their gold by offering free gold testing and premium prices for gold jewelry that can be resold on the estate jewelry market.  "It's important to note that all California gold buyers are not alike. Many gold refineries, pawn shops, and mall-store jewelers treat most jewelry like scrap gold, paying sellers only the melt down price for it," says Blackburn. "In addition, the scrap gold price they pay is usually around 50% of the trading price for gold that day, whereas I try to pay closer to 85%."  According to Blackburn, the process of selling gold jewelry at C. Blackburn Jewelers goes like this:  1. The gold jewelry is placed on a scale in front of the customer. Then, the gold weight is recorded. This step isn't done because the jewelry will necessarily be melted down, but gold weight is one of the factors that must be calculated when making a cash offer.  2. If there are diamonds and/or gemstones in the gold jewelry, the value of these are added to the cash offer. This extra cash assessment for gemstones is something that many other gold buyers don't offer, unless the gem is a large diamond center stone, like in an engagement ring.   3. If the gold jewelry is made by a luxury jeweler like Tiffany or Cartier, or if it is vintage or antique item that can be resold at C. Blackburn Jewelers' store, then an extra premium will paid on top.  4. A final and fair cash offer is made, which the seller may accept or decline. All in a completely relaxed and pressure free environment. If the offer is accepted, payment is made on the spot.  Blackburn explains that the reason most San Diego fine jewelers aren't able to pay as much as he does for gold jewelry is that they sell only modern, brand new jewelry. They don't sell estate jewelry and will ordinarily melt down entire pieces (gemstones and all), paying only for the gold.  When contacting a San Diego gold buyer for an in-person visit, Blackburn offers one last piece of advice. "When talking to a buyer on the phone or by email, be sure they make you feel comfortable, and answer all of your questions clearly. If you get a lot of vague answers, or feel like the buyer isn't being completely forthright with information, then best to move on to a gold buyer who you can trust."
