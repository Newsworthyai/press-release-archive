# How Reshoring Is Reshaping the Global Economy

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, August 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From shortages of medical supplies to disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, the pandemic laid bare vulnerabilities of global supply chains and accelerated the trend toward reshoring — relocating manufacturing and supply chain operations to domestic markets. Julian Harris, founder and CEO of RobobAI, a global fintech company leveraging AI technology to help organizations optimize supply chains, explains how global businesses are benefiting.  The pandemic compelled governments and businesses to reassess the benefits of localized production, a trend that is reshaping manufacturing production and supply chains in several ways, Harris says. Benefits include:  •	Resilience. Pandemic-induced disruptions exposed the fragility of extended supply chains, with delays and shortages rippling across industries. By reshoring critical manufacturing processes, countries can reduce their vulnerability to global shocks and ensure more reliable access to essential goods in the face of potential risks. •	Economic benefits. While offshoring may have initially promised lower labor costs, it often comes with hidden expenses such as transportation, tariffs, and intellectual property risks. By bringing production closer to home, companies can streamline logistics, reduce lead times, and maintain better quality control. Localized manufacturing also stimulates job creation and fosters innovation, contributing to long-term economic growth. •	Sustainability and environmental stewardship. Shorter supply chains generally translate into reduced carbon emissions associated with transportation, mitigating environmental impacts of manufacturing activities. Closer proximity to consumers also allows for more efficient use of resources and facilitates adoption of eco-friendly practices. •	Security. Western governments are increasingly wary of relying on foreign suppliers, particularly in strategic sectors such as defense, health care, and technology. The desire to safeguard sensitive technologies and intellectual property, coupled with concerns over supply chain dependencies on geopolitical rivals, has spurred efforts to repatriate key industries.  RobobAI (pronounced "robo buy") leverages AI technology to help global enterprises onshore supply chains by providing valuable insights that drive their procurement, risk, and sustainability goals for domestic production.
