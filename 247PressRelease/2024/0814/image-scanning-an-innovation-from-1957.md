# Image Scanning: An Innovation from 1957

VANCOUVER, BC, August 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MCS offers services and solutions for microfilm and document scanning, data capture, and moreâ€”they effortlessly generate many hundreds of thousands of high-quality document scans every month. Still, all this wasn't even possible until 1957. For more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/did-something-important-happen-in-1957/  At that time, a researcher named Russell Kirsch of Gaithersburg, Maryland invented a crude version of an image scanner. He and his team were able to capture a digital facsimile of a portrait of his 3-month-old son, Walden. The image was quite low resolution, but it was revolutionary nonetheless.  First Document Imaging Scanner at MCS in 1992  Over the seven decades that followed, massive advancements have been made in scanner design and features. MCS purchased its first document imaging scanner in 1992. It scanned at a rate of 20 odd pages per minute! By contrast, the team's 2024 production scanners are almost ten times faster!   In 1992, desktop computers weren't powerful enough to keep up with the processing demand scanners would place on them, so unique and expensive interface boards were required. Thirty years later, this is no longer the case.  Document Image Scanning Software  Scanning software has also changed dramatically over the past 32 years. Back in 1992, Micro Com's team was limited to commercial offerings, forcing them to fit within the boundaries/limitations of what was available. As capabilities increased, services became more flexible in terms of responding to client requests. In time, MCS created its own production software, allowing team members to produce high-quality results while remaining consistently price-competitive.  Over the past 32 years, in addition to offering the ability to scan virtually any type of record, clients today rely on MCS for various scanning and digitization needs: books, images, microfilm/fiche, large format, aperture cards, etc. MCS has consistently prided itself on keeping its hardware fleet up to date, spending over $100,000.00 on new scanning equipment in just the last twelve months.
