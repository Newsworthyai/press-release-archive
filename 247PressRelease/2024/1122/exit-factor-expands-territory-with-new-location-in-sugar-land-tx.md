# EXIT FACTOR EXPANDS TERRITORY WITH NEW LOCATION IN SUGAR LAND, TX

SUGAR LAND, TX, November 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exit Factor™, a business consulting franchise that specializes in exit planning for small to mid-sized companies, announced today the opening of its newest location in Sugar Land, TX. Owner, Neil Sawale, has 26 years of experience in corporate IT, half of which was spent selling technology solutions to Fortune500 companies and focusing on implementation and business development, will be the owner and operator of Exit Factor Sugar Land.  The Exit Factor program is a proven process with tailored exit plans that safeguard the long-term value of a business now and in the future, no matter the size. Designed to help owners take control of their business by maximizing profit, efficiency, and value from day one, even if a sale isn't uppermost on the owner's mind.   "Sugar Land runs on small businesses, the majority being service businesses, but there are other big industries like Oil and Gas, Tech, and Healthcare," said Sawale, franchise owner. "Every one of them can use our help to increase business value and boost their profitability. Exit Factor's proven business model and easy to implement strategies can impact growing businesses in the area and uplift the local economy as a result."   The company was founded by best-selling author, speaker, and small-business advocate Jessica Fialkovich. Her passion for helping business owners maximize their company's value, grew from her experience as a business broker and owner of a Transworld Business Advisors® franchise. For businesses that were not quite ready to sell, or had potential to increase their value prior to listing, Fialkovich developed a program, teaching strategies on ways to build value, profitability, and salability.   "We're very proud of the success Exit Factor has had in helping businesses plan for profitability to ensure business owners maximize their company's value when it's time to sell," Jessica Fialkovich said. "We look forward to bringing Neil on board to help even more business owners."  Participants in Exit Factor's program also earn back an average of $2,700 in exit value for every hour they spend in the program. Within the first year, clients have seen a 25% increase in profit with a 56.7% increase in the value of the business and for those that have decided to sell, they've done so at a 100% success rate. As Neil explains, "If you grow your business without fixing your problems, you grow your problems instead. Don't just grow, grow with less problems, more valuation."  About Exit Factor   Exit Factor™ offers a proven method that helps small to mid-size business owners maximize their company's value. It's among the United Franchise Group™ (UFG) family of affiliated brands and consultants, representing the very best in their industries.
