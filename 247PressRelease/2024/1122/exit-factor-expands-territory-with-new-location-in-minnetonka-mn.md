MINNETONKA, MN, November 22, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exit Factor™, a business consulting franchise that specializes in exit planning for small to mid-sized companies, announced today the opening of its newest location in Minnetonka, MN. Owner, John Dale, a CPA with 30 years of experience, will be the owner and operator of Exit Factor of Minnetonka.  The Exit Factor program is a proven process with tailored exit plans that safeguard the long-term value of a business now and in the future, no matter the size. Designed to help owners take control of their business by maximizing profit, efficiency, and value from day one, even if a sale isn't uppermost on the owner's mind.   "I wanted to start another business in a different industry, but that could tap into my 30+ years of business and accounting experience," said John, franchise owner. "I wanted to continue to work with Main Street and lower middle market business owners and provide value while helping business owners achieve their goals. I hope to strengthen the community by working with business owners to grow their businesses, both in profitability and value."  The company was founded by best-selling author, speaker, and small-business advocate Jessica Fialkovich. Her passion for helping business owners maximize their company's value, grew from her experience as a business broker and owner of a Transworld Business Advisors® franchise. For businesses that were not quite ready to sell, or had potential to increase their value prior to listing, Fialkovich developed a program, teaching strategies on ways to build value, profitability, and salability.   "We're very proud of the success Exit Factor has had in helping businesses plan for profitability to ensure business owners maximize their company's value when it's time to sell," Jessica Fialkovich said. "We look forward to bringing John on board to help even more business owners."  Participants in Exit Factor's program also earn back an average of $2,700 in exit value for every hour they spend in the program. Within the first year, clients have seen a 25% increase in profit with a 56.7% increase in the value of the business and for those that have decided to sell, they've done so at a 100% success rate.
