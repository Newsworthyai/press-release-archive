# Gifts For Book Lovers - Bestselling Historical Fiction Novel, Aaron's War, By Richard McMaster Weaves WWII, Coming Of Age, Moral Issues, Antisemitism, And PTSD Into A Masterpiece Of A Novel

WILMINGTON, NC, December 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Books are timeless. They are one of only a few gifts that can be enjoyed for years. Unlike many other gifts that may lose their appeal over time, a good book can be read and re-read, providing hours of enjoyment and enrichment. And giving a book as a gift shows that you have put thought and care into selecting something that the recipient will enjoy and appreciate.  Aaron's War is such a book. USA TODAY Best-Selling Author Holly S. Roberts says Aaron's War is "A coming of age story that grips your soul and takes you on a thought-provoking journey.  In Aaron's War, we can begin to see that issues such as antisemitism, PTSD, and substance abuse are not really just modern-day issues; they have been with us for a very long time. These challenges are explored through the eyes of a young protagonist grappling with the harsh realities of World War II. This gripping coming-of-age story follows Aaron Vanko, an Iowa farm boy who faces the ultimate test of humanity: the willingness to kill in the name of duty.  As Aaron prepares for deployment to Europe, he makes a shocking discovery that shatters his sense of identity: he is Jewish. This revelation adds a new layer of complexity to his journey, as he must now wrestle with his allegiance to his country and his personal beliefs while battling the enemy forces that threaten his very existence.  But Aaron's War is more than just a historical narrative. It sheds light on the enduring challenges that have persisted across generations, making its exploration of these issues all the more relevant and compelling. From the ethical dilemmas that soldiers face on the battlefield to the personal struggles that veterans confront upon their return home, this story offers a powerful and poignant examination of the human condition.  Aaron's War will make an excellent gift for veterans, service members, historical fiction fans, and the broader general readership.  Richard McMaster is making the ebook available at no charge December 9 through December 11 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-McMaster/author/B01LDIJ2QU.  Readers and reviewers have praised Aaron's War. Tom Porter, author of All I Need To Know About Business I Learned From A Duck stated, "An engaging, informative and thought-provoking tale of survival, love and faith. Make room for Richard McMaster on your list of up-and-coming authors." Lynn M. Safris said, "The descriptions and details given throughout this author's writing draw the reader into each page, making Aaron's journey feel like their own. I believe this book would appeal to a wide audience of readers. I truly enjoyed reading Aaron's War and I highly recommend this book."  Richard McMaster is also the author of A Love Divided By Time, described as "one part The Notebook, one part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter, and find peace by joining her in the ever after.  In McMaster's latest book, Voyage Of Life, the life journey of Sean Buchanan is detailed through metaphoric depictions of the four stages of life in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings, childhood, youth, manhood, and Old Age. The painting's depictions are a metaphor for his lifeâ€”the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood become turbulent in youth, and early in manhood the shores turn rocky when he faces one obstacle after another. Secrets that live in darkness can take a lifetime to see the light of day and the secret that has hovered over him since Youth is revealed late in his life.

All of his books are available at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-McMaster/author/B01LDIJ2QU.
