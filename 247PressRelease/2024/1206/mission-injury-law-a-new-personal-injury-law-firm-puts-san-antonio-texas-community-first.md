# Mission Injury Law: A New Personal Injury Law Firm Puts San Antonio, Texas Community First

SAN ANTONIO, TX, December 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This December, Mission Injury Law is stepping up to ensure San Antonio's roads are safer during the festive season by offering free Uber rides through its "Sober Ride" program. With two major events—the Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert on December 27th and the Valero Alamo Bowl on December 28th—drawing thousands of attendees, the firm is committed to promoting a message of holiday safety and responsible celebration.  "Drunk driving is a devastating issue in Texas, and as advocates for victims of traffic accidents, we wanted to do something proactive to help our community this holiday season," said Will Clark, Founder & Lead Attorney of Mission Injury Law. "By providing free and easy access to sober rides, we're aiming to reduce drunk driving on San Antonio roads and keep everyone safe."  Making a Difference: Preventing Drunk Driving During High-Risk Events  The "Sober Ride" program offers complimentary Uber rides during San Antonio's most anticipated year-end events, where alcohol consumption is likely. Attendees can access unique Uber ride codes, which will be shared via the firm's social media platforms ahead of the events.  Event Details:  Trans-Siberian Orchestra Concert  December 27, 2024, at Frost Bank Center  Known for its dazzling performances, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's holiday show is a favorite for music lovers who want to celebrate the season in style. Attendees planning to enjoy a drink or two can count on Mission Injury Law to help them get home safely.  Valero Alamo Bowl  December 28, 2024, at the Alamodome  One of college football's most electrifying games, the Alamo Bowl is a highlight on San Antonio's event calendar, drawing fans from across the country. To ensure the celebration doesn't end in tragedy, the "Sober Ride" program will provide free, convenient transportation for attendees who need it.  Addressing the Drunk Driving Crisis  Drunk driving continues to be a critical issue in Texas. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), nearly 11,000 lives were lost in the U.S. due to alcohol-related crashes in 2022—30% of all traffic fatalities. In Texas, alcohol-impaired driving accounts for nearly 25% of traffic deaths, with San Antonio ranking among the top cities for DUI incidents.  By offering free Uber rides during these prominent December events, Mission Injury Law hopes to reduce the risks of alcohol-related accidents while raising awareness about the importance of sober driving.  "Our mission is twofold," Will Clark added. "We want to offer a practical solution for staying safe while also drawing attention to the lasting impact of drunk driving on families and communities."  Tips for a Safe Holiday Season  Mission Injury Law encourages everyone to make safety a priority during the holiday season. Here are some tips for staying safe:  • Plan Ahead: Arrange for a ride-share service, taxi, or designated driver if you plan to drink. • Take Advantage of Free Rides: Use Mission Injury Law's complimentary Uber rides during December events. • Stay the Night: Consider staying overnight if a gathering is far from home. • Be a Responsible Host: If hosting a party, offer guests transportation options and promote sober driving. • Intervene if Necessary: Don't let someone drive under the influence—help them find a safe way home.
