# A Global Joint Statement Condemns Cancellation of International Religious Event in South Korea

PERTH, AUSTRALIA, December 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An administrative decision by a South Korean government agency sparked international controversy, raising concerns about religious freedom. On November 27, religious leaders and opinion leaders delivered a joint protest statement to the Government of the Republic of Korea condemning the cancellation of the venue rental on October 29th as an act of biased religious oppression through public power. Signed by 402 organizations, 758 religious representatives, and 977 individuals across the globe, totalling 1,735 signatories, the statement emphasized the psychological and financial damage caused to the international participants and highlighted the need for accountability.  On October 30 the "Religious Leaders Forum and Graduation Ceremony," a joint initiative by two prominent religious organizations, was set to take place in Paju, South Korea. The event was expected to draw over 30,000 participants from 78 countries, including 1,000 religious leaders representing Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism.  However, the Gyeonggi Tourism Organization (GTO), a public entity under Gyeonggi Province, abruptly cancelled the venue rental at 11pm on the morning of the event, when preparations were already underway. This decision, made without prior notice, has resulted in significant financial damage to the international event and its organizers. As The first clause of Article 20 of the South Korean Constitution states: "All citizens shall enjoy freedom of religion.", they argue that the cancellation constitutes an unconstitutional act of discrimination against a specific religion, violating religious freedom, human rights, and due process of law and an act that divides the people and divides the country into two.  The Joint Protest Statement demands accountability for this situation and calls for an official apology from the Gyeonggi Provincial Government and the Gyeonggi Tourism Organization to both domestic and international religious organizations and the global community. It also requires the government to take appropriate disciplinary actions against the officials responsible for handling this matter and to strengthen fair and transparent venue reservation procedures and preliminary consultation systems.  Over 88 global leaders including international law experts, religious leaders, education experts, heads of organizations, journalists from around the world sent official documents and protest letters to the Republic of Korea upon hearing the news of the cancellation of the event, expressing shock and disappointment at this administrative action and demanding prompt and appropriate measures. In particular, international law experts from around the world, including those with experience as prime ministers, vice ministers of justice, chief justices of the Supreme Court, presidents of the Constitutional Court, lawyers, and professors of international law, pointed out that the cancellation of the event on this day was an act that violated the Constitution, and religious leaders expressed concern that it was a biased decision and an anti-peaceful act that infringed on religious freedom.  Since November 15, Religious leaders and members of Shincheonji Church of Jesus have held rallies outside the Gyeonggi Provincial Office and Gyeonggi Tourism Organization, condemning the biased cancellation urging the government to address the issue and take measures to prevent recurrence.  Timeline of Events Leading to the Cancellation •	July 22: Notification of approval for the rental from 29th to 31st October by GTO. •	October 2: Full payment of the rental fee. •	October 16: A working-level meeting held to discuss the event's size, arrangements, safety plans, and special effects.
