# Haitian Diaspora Political Action Committee Files Class Action Lawsuit Against The American Red Cross for Mismanagement of Haiti Earthquake Relief Funds

WASHINGTON, DC, December 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Haitian Diaspora Political Action Committee (HDPAC), along with individual plaintiffs and on behalf of millions of donors and beneficiaries, have filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuit alleges that the American Red Cross, the International Red Cross, and related entities, including their leadership, mismanaged and misappropriated over $500 million in funds raised for Haiti's 2010 earthquake recovery efforts, and from 2010 to 2024, the American Red Cross continued to raise money on behalf of Haiti under false pretenses. The plaintiffs assert that these funds were diverted for unrelated projects and administrative expenses, contrary to the promises made to donors and the public.  The complaint claims that despite raising significant funds for Haiti's recovery, the defendants failed to deliver on commitments to rebuild critical infrastructure, such as homes, schools, and hospitals. The lawsuit alleges that the funds were instead used to cover existing organizational deficits and other non-Haiti-related initiatives, with limited or no tangible impact on the affected communities.  Key Allegations:  • Mismanagement of Donor Contributions: The complaint asserts that the majority of the $500 million raised for Haiti's earthquake recovery did not benefit the intended recipients or projects.  • Deceptive Fundraising Practices: The lawsuit alleges that the defendants misrepresented the intended use of the funds by appealing to donors through emotionally charged campaigns that promised direct assistance to Haitians.  • Failure to Account for Funds: According to the plaintiffs, the Red Cross and affiliated entities have not provided a transparent accounting of how the funds were spent.  The plaintiffs are seeking over $750 million dollars in compensatory damages, $250 million in punitive damages, and a full accounting of the funds raised for Haiti. The complaint also requests injunctive relief to ensure that future fundraising campaigns by the defendants are conducted with transparency and accountability.   The lawsuit emphasizes the importance of holding large international organizations accountable for fulfilling their commitments to vulnerable communities and ensuring that donor trust is not abused.
