For more information about Lunge Systems and its transformative technologies, visit  www.lunge.ai or www.lungesystems.com/enterprise.  Lunge Systems has developed and commercialized a path-breaking technology using "Quantification of Time" to optimally manage multiple priorities. Lunge Systems' Priority Management Platform enables organizations to define their preferences (importance and urgency) over multiple target areas, specify the goals and quantitative measures that track the progress.   We have built a database of "benchmark actionable wisdom" using billions of data points on cause-and effect extracted from wide-range of reputable information sources. This database is leveraged by "Lunge Pathways recommendation engine" guiding users "what-to-do-when-how-and-why". This wisdom is delivered directly to users' calendars.   The third component of Lunge Systems technology is "evidence-driven AI". Using the actual data on users' actions and outcomes, our algorithms are always learning and updating the enormous network of causal relationships (terabytes of data) in real-time. The updated evidence is fed back into our AI models to continuously improve the validity and the actual impact of our recommendation engine.
