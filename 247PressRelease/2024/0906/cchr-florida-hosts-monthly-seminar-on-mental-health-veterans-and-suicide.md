# CCHR Florida Hosts Monthly Seminar on Mental Health, Veterans and Suicide

CLEARWATER, FL, September 06, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The first Saturday of every month at 2pm, the Florida chapter of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) hosts a seminar covering what veterans face today and the often misdirected and sometimes dangerous solutions that are offered up as help.  Held in the Florida headquarters for CCHR located at 109 N. Fort Harrison Ave in Clearwater, the monthly event is complimentary, open to the general public and reservations are recommended.   "Veterans as a whole," says Diane Stein, president of CCHR in Florida, "can have special needs due to unique experiences and exposure to traumatic events. Many of them also face an uncertain return to civilian life. This sometimes leads to drug abuse, pain or loneliness after discharge from the military. It is estimated that one in ten veterans suffers from some sort of substance abuse which is higher than the general public."  According to an article published by the USO, "in 2021, research found that 30,177 active-duty personnel and veterans who served in the military after 9/11 have died by suicide - compared to the 7,057 service members killed in combat in those same 20 years."  How could it be that more than four times more veterans and soldiers have killed themselves, than soldiers that were killed in action? Is there a hidden influence that could have contributed to this terrible reality?   "Psychiatric treatment is the hidden influence," says Stein. "For years psychiatrists have been infiltrating the military with their various diagnoses and psychotropic drugs."  While a direct correlation cannot be made to account for all the suicides, it can be said that the normal treatment using psychiatric drugs has not the veterans and soldiers who are suffering.  "There are solutions that don't involve unproven and dangerous psychotropic drugs," states Stein. "But these alternative treatments don't generally have an abundance of advertising dollars backing them like the pharmaceutical industry. The psychotropic drug industry is one of the most lucrative in the world. For example, the global antipsychotic drugs market is projected to grow from $15.50 billion in 2022 to $24.74 billion by 2029. Advertising dollars for psychotropic drugs tend to drown out the voices of non-drug alternative treatments."  For more information or to reserve a seat at the next seminar, please call 800-782-2878.

The Florida chapter of CCHR is an award-winning nonprofit in the area of mental health human rights and government relations. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
