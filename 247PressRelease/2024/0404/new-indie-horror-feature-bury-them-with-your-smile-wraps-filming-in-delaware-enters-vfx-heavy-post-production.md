# New Indie horror feature "Bury Them With Your Smile" Wraps Filming in Delaware, Enters VFX heavy Post-Production

NEW YORK, NY, April 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A chilling new thriller, "Bury Them With Your Smile," is poised to explore the dark underbelly of wealth and privilege. The film follows Renu, a young immigrant who finds herself in a desperate fight for survival after a seemingly ordinary house-sitting job for a wealthy family takes a terrifying turn.  After weeks of filming at the historic Sunnybrae Mansion in Milford, Delaware, this innovative project, helmed by visionary filmmaker Gokul Pann and creative producer Micah Demby, has officially entered the VFX-heavy phase of post-production.   Pann's deep love for horror films, coupled with his cultural upbringing sparked the idea for the film. "In my culture, we are taught to respect and follow the rules of our superiors, even if we are not being treated well. I wanted to explore that fine line between kindness and compliance through the film."   The NYC-based production crew brought their A-game to Milford, Delaware, where they meticulously captured the unnerving atmosphere of the Sunnybrae Mansion. Under Pann's leadership, the team navigated weeks of intense filming across multiple locations, ensuring a smooth and successful production. Micah Demby echoed this sentiment, highlighting Pann's instrumental role in capturing the mansion's unnerving essence.  This next stage marks a crucial transformation as the post-production team brings the Lovecraftian creature to life. They will add layers of sound design and visual effects to complement the chilling performances delivered by the talented cast. Featuring rising star Ananya Lunkad alongside veterans Frank Muni, Leilani Rosine, and Maura Moraeu.  Stay updated on the project by following Bury them with your smile on Instagram and Facebook.
