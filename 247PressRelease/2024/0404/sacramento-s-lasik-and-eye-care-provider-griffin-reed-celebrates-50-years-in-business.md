SACRAMENTO, CA, April 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Griffin started his private practice in 1974 and was joined by Dr. Reed in 1986. In 1993, Griffin & Reed Eye Care was one of the first providers to perform laser refractive eye surgery, commonly known as LASIK, or PRK surgery. As the practice grew, the founders were joined by Dr. Maboudi in 1999 and by Dr. Kim in 2005.  To this day, Griffin & Reed Eye Care continues its commitment to providing the highest standard of care for patients seeking laser vision correction surgery, general eye care, and optical services.

"We are honored to continue providing Northern California's patients with the high level of care that was inspired by the company's founder 50 years ago," say Drs. Kim and Maboudi of Griffin & Reed.  Griffin & Reed's main location has been at 651 Fulton Ave, Sacramento since 1983 and a second location at 5 Medical Plaza Dr, Roseville was added in 2007.
