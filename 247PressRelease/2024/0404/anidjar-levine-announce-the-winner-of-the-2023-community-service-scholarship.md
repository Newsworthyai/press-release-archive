# Anidjar & Levine Announce the Winner of the 2023 Community Service Scholarship

FORT MYERS, FL, April 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After combing through applications from so many qualified applicants, we are proud to announce the winner of the 2023 Anidjar & Levine Community Service Scholarship, Ms. Elysa Smith.  After graduating Florida State University with a 3.6 GPA and a Bachelor of Science degree, Ms. Smith began her law school track at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Law. She hopes to specialize in sports and entertainment fields of law.  What it Means to Serve the Community  Elysa Smith is no stranger to helping others. She says her mother is her biggest inspiration, and "instilled in me the importance of giving back to the community, especially in education." Taking a page from her mother's book, Elysa has worked with multiple off- and on-campus organizations to promote education, charity, and inclusion.  For over two years, Ms. Smith has served as Membership Chair of the Black Female Future Attorneys. BFFA's mission to empower minority women to pursue their career while having a sisterhood of like-minded women resonated deeply with Ms. Smith, and she was responsible for helping recruit new members and that BFFA served the needs of all its members.  Not only is Elysa passionate about helping her peers, but she is a firm believer in serving the youth. She spent two years in various leadership roles at Jewels Incorporated at FSU, which is an organization that is an all-girls mentoring program that helps young girls with education, training, and social activism. She has even mentored, tutored, and coached dance classes for children of all ages, showcasing the importance of educating the mind, body, and heart.  Elysa believes in the power of service and the importance of compassion, and that these have helped her become a stronger leader and more empathetic person, exemplified in this thoughtful quite from her essay, "[s]howing empathy and compassion to someone goes a very long way, whether you see the fruits of your harvest or not."  Leadership, Service and Communication Create the Leaders of Tomorrow    Elysa was inspired to apply for our scholarship, as it allowed her to "highlight [her] passion for community service and how serving others allows [her] to be a good leader." In addition to her undergraduate studies, Ms. Smith participated in many college organizations that helped her stretch her leadership muscles. Her work with her sorority, the BFFA, and other organizations helped make her a stronger communicator, an even better listener, and a team player who can help motivate others around her.  As a leader, Elysa was able to hear from people with different experiences, ideas, and skills and turn around and implement them in her professional and extracurricular endeavors. Ms. Smith strives to make a difference wherever her legal studies take her, and she knows her community service work has helped her get to where she is, and it will continue to guide her path forward.
