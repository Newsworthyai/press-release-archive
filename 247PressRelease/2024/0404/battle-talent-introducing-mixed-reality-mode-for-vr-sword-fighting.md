SHENZHEN, CHINA, April 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Battle Talent, a VR sword fighting simulation game developed by Cydream, has recently unveiled its highly anticipated mixed reality (MR) mode in the latest update.   If you're not familiar with Battle Talent, it has garnered rave reviews since its demo release as a VR sword fighting game.

Game Producer Fonzie expressed, "Imagine being able to place your favorite weapons on your coffee table and setting up flame traps on your kitchen floor to deal with goblins. It's going to be so much fun." Additionally, they further optimized the artistic representation of the MR mode to make it even more realistic.
