# Topo Finance and Compose[d] Launch The Individual Cash Calculator to Help Individuals Leverage the Climate Power of their Personal Banking

NEW YORK, NY, July 18, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Topo Finance and Compose[d] are excited to release The Individual Cash Calculator. With this tool, which builds on Topo's pioneering research about the climate impact of corporate cash, individuals can measure both the emissions that their banking enables and the climate benefits of moving their money to greener banks. By doing so, the tool helps illuminate the fact that where individuals bank is one of the most important consumer climate decisions individuals make.  The power of banking as a climate action is rooted in how banks lend and invest money. When a customer deposits money in a bank, that money does not just sit there accruing interest. Rather, banks lend it out across the economy to everything from energy projects to mortgages.   As a result, every dollar in the bank has an associated carbon footprint, and that footprint can vary dramatically depending on a bank's lending practices. In fact, Wall Street banks, on average, generate 400% more emissions for every dollar they lend compared to greener banks in the U.S.   "Around the world, individuals are becoming increasingly adept at applying a climate lens to how we spend our money," said Topo Finance's Founder and Executive Director Paul Moinester. "However, what The Individual Cash Calculator illuminates is that applying this same climate lens to where we deposit our money can be as impactful as how we spend it, which is why everyone needs to harness their banking as a powerful climate lever."  "Exercising agency over how our banks lend and invest our money is perhaps the single most effective consumer action individuals can take to effect systemic impact," said Jason Parkin, founder, president, and chief creative officer at Compose[d]. "That's why we were excited to partner with Topo Finance and build a tool that enables individuals to understand the climate impact of their banking and embrace this accessible, low-cost, and powerful climate action."   We have long known that personal banking is an overlooked and promising climate lever. However, the research Topo Finance conducted that underpins this tool illuminates that this intervention is far more powerful than we previously believed:   Moving your money from a carbon-intensive bank to a greener bank could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions it generates by an average of 80%.   If you bank with a U.S. carbon-intensive bank, you may be indirectly lending up to 20–30% of your money to the industries most responsible for fueling the climate crisis, such as energy production, utilities, mining, and large-scale manufacturing.  If you move $5,000 from a carbon-intensive bank to a greener bank, the annual indicative emissions reduction that switch would generate would be greater than adopting a vegan diet.   Topo Finance and Compose[d], in partnership with BankFWD, built The Individual Cash Calculator.
