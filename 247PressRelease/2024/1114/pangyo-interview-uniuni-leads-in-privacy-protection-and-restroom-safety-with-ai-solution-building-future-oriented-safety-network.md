# [Pangyo Interview] UniUni Leads in Privacy Protection and Restroom Safety with AI Solution, Building Future-Oriented Safety Network

SEONGNAM, KOREA, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- UniUni (CEO Sooyeon Han) is developing an innovative AI-based solution that enhances safety and comfort in spaces where privacy is paramount. UniUni's unique technology analyzes non-identifiable data with AI, enabling real-time detection of unusual situations and safety management in privacy-sensitive areas such as restrooms, hospitals, and facilities for people with disabilitiesâ€”all without using cameras.  Recently, UniUni launched Savvy For Accessible, a new product tailored for accessible restrooms. This solution detects emergencies in restrooms for people with disabilities and automatically checks availability, assisting users at risk of falls with enhanced safety.  Based on AI technology that integrates depth and temperature data, UniUni's solution is installed nationwide in over 500 locations, proving its effectiveness. Unlike competing solutions that rely on specific sensors, UniUni excels at accurately analyzing behavioral patterns, rapidly expanding its market share with this unique approach.  UniUni has signed NDAs to expand internationally and is preparing proof of concept (PoC) with companies in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. It aims to conduct PoCs in one or two countries by the end of the year. To strengthen technology protection and enter Europe, the U.S., and Japan, UniUni has secured seven patents and filed around 20 more.  With funding from government grants and three rounds of investment, including seed funding, UniUni continues its R&D and market expansion. The company aims to make its solution more affordable for broader distribution and advance towards a data-driven, leading-edge AI.  Based in Pangyo Techno Valley's Startup Campus, UniUni is leveraging its network and modern facilities to grow rapidly.  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi-do's representative innovation cluster, Pangyo Techno Valley was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).  Furthermore, the Techno Valley Innovation Division of the Gyeonggi-do Business & Science Accelerator (GBSA) holds monthly events such as the Pangyo Evening Meet-Up, Pan-Pan Day, and the Pangyo Startup Investment Exchange "In-Best Pangyo" to maximize the value of Pangyo Techno Valley. They also support the Pangyo Overseas Promotion Program to publicize information about Pangyo's companies, products, and services to domestic and foreign investors and the media, thereby facilitating foreign investment.
