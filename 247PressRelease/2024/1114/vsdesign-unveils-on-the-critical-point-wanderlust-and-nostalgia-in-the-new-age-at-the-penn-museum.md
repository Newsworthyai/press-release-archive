# VSDesign Unveils "On the Critical Point: Wanderlust and Nostalgia in the New Age" at the Penn Museum

PHILADELPHIA, PA, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A thought-provoking exhibition, "On the Critical Point: Wanderlust and Nostalgia in the New Age," opened at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum), offering audiences a unique perspective on humanity's evolving relationship with technology, identity, and existence. This immersive experience ran from November 3 to November 30 with the combination of the onsite venue at Penn Museum Chinese Rotunda, and an online immersive gallery. The exhibition featured 48 works by 57 artists from 8 countries, chosen from over 335 submissions, and explored how wanderlust and nostalgia interact with a world increasingly shaped by digital landscapes.  Organized by VSDesign in collaboration with ALT Alliance and DesignPhiladelphia, the exhibition brought together established and emerging voices, creating a compelling dialogue between themes of past and future. Adding to the exhibition's depth, VSDesign organized a series of interactive events, including voices of mastery, an opening ceremony, a roundtable discussion, and educational workshops to engage the public further.  "Art is a universal language that connects so many people together," said Khine Arthur, CEO of the Asian American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Philadelphia, a key sponsor of the exhibition. "It is so heartwarming to see such talent gathered at the Penn Museum." The exhibition attracted a distinguished audience. Among the attendees were Zhenxiang Huang, Senior Advisor at ESI and former Senior Advisor at The World Bank; Na Wei, Founding Principal of WEI Architects and Associate Professor at Temple University; and Zhanyuan Chen, former Commissioner of the Mayor's Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs. Their presence emphasized the exhibition's significance within both local and global communities, bringing together voices from architecture, academia, and international development to engage with the thought-provoking themes explored in the artworks.  The roundtable discussion delved into several key themes, including the significance of wanderlust and nostalgia, contrasting art market dynamics in China and the United States, and the journey of Chinese artists in the global art landscape. Panelists include Sheryl Oring, Chair of the Department of Art and Art History at Wayne State University; Dominic Terlizzi, Head of School at PI Art Center; Chenlin Cai, Former Commissioner at Pennsylvania Governor's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs; and Amazon Senior Visual Designer, Tong Wang.
