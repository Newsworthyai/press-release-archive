# POE THEATRE HOSTS STAGED READING OF "A CHRISTMAS CAROL FOR EDGAR ALLAN POE" DECEMBER 21 - 22

BALTIMORE, MD, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What if "A Christmas Carol" was written about America's greatest writer of horror and suspense? That's the premise of "A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe." The brand-new script will be presented as a staged reading on December 21 and 22, 2024 at the Fells Point Corner Theatre (251 S Ann St, Baltimore, MD 21231).  Tickets are available through SimpleTix, or at this URL: https://tinyurl.com/43nmh8rk.  "We're hopeful to see a lot of friendly faces in the audience on December 21 and 22," said Poe Theatre Artistic Director Alex Zavistovich. "This reading will be a workshop for a full production of the show in 2025, so audience critical reaction is appreciated. Ticket sales will go towards offsetting the cost of the full production."  "A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe" is based on a story idea from The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre, and written by Zac Pensol (both past winners of the International Edgar Allan Poe Festival Saturday Visiter Award for Adaptations of E.A. Poe's Life or Works).  The script for this production uses the structure of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" to tell the story of Poe's life through the time leading up to the death at 27 of the writer's wife, Virginia Clemm Poe. (Poe was first introduced to Virginia Clemm in Baltimore).  The reading's creative team is being led by Poe Theatre Artistic Director Alex Zavistovich, and directed by Mark Kamie. Zavistovich and Kamie last collaborated on a theatrical production of "Nightfall with Edgar Allan Poe" in Washington, DC, which earned a Helen Hayes Awards Recommendation, and a nomination for Outstanding Choreography, among other accolades.   Original composition and sound design will be provided by James D. Watson, a long-time collaborator on The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre's "Poe Theatre on the Air" radio shows. Poe Theatre on the Air is currently available on Baltimore's NPR affiliate WYPR, Audible, Amazon Music and other platforms.  In December 2025, The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre will present the debut production of "A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe "at Baltimore's historic Zion Lutheran Church. The church has played host to numerous other well-known local theatre groups, including the Baltimore Rock Opera Society and Iron Crow Theatre.
