# Stunning Multi-Million Dollar Falmouth Maine Home Goes Short Term Rental

PORTLAND, ME, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a move that has left both real estate insiders and some local residents astonished, the owners of a multi-million-dollar luxury home at 53 Waites Landing Road has made the property available for short-term rentals and Airbnb. Located in Falmouth Foreside, one of Maine's most affluent and exclusive zip codes, this rare short term rental listing opens the doors to a lifestyle typically reserved for the area's elite homeowners and those seeking 5 star hotel accomodations.  The high-end home, sprawling close to 4,000 square feet of meticulously designed living space, is a masterpiece of luxury and comfort. Boasting four spacious bedrooms, three-and-a-half baths, two full living rooms, and a private in-law apartment, the home caters to families, executives, or anyone seeking an opulent escape. The property sits on three acres of secluded woodlands, offering unparalleled privacy just a quarter mile from the ocean. Amenities include high-end furnishings, multiple entertainment spaces, and proximity to Portland Maine's vibrant cultural and culinary attractions—a mere 10-minute drive away.  The decision to make this home available for short-term rental stays in Greater Portland, Maine is an unexpected development in a neighborhood where exclusivity is the norm and such properties rarely open to the rental market. "It's highly unusual to see a property of this caliber and in this location listed for short-term rentals," said Bobby Queen of ReMax Realty One. "This is a home that embodies Maine's luxury real estate market—secluded, spacious, and in a location that's second to none. It's surprising and exciting to see it become accessible to travelers."  Essentially, travelers to Greater Portland, Maine can now experience ultra-luxury accommodations on par if not better than The Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental but with 5X more living space and price that wont break the pocket book.  "There are no Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, or Four Seasons hotels in Southern Maine—or anywhere in the state, for that matter. But imagine the allure for families, traveling executives, or anyone who appreciates the finer things, staying in a 4,000-square-foot, ultra high-end home that offers all the amenities of a luxury hotel, yet with far more space," said owner Mark McClure. "53 Waites Landing gives guests the best of both worlds. It's minutes from downtown Portland, the ocean, and top-tier restaurants, yet provides a tranquil, three-acre wooded retreat where you can fall asleep in complete peace. This is a one-of-a-kind luxury experience for Southern Maine", stated McClure who owns the property along with his wife Paula Wallem, who designed the entire home.  For those seeking to experience life in one of Maine's most desirable neighborhoods, minutes to downtown Portland, ¼ mile to the ocean and a home bathed in high-end luxury, 53 Waites Landing Road offers that rare opportunity. Forget about booking a hotel for you and your family, you can now have access to a multi-million dollar, secluded, luxury home for up to 10 people.
