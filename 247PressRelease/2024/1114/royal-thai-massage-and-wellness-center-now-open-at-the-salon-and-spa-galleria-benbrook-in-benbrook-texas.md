# Royal Thai Massage and Wellness Center Now Open at the Salon and Spa Galleria Benbrook in Benbrook, Texas

BENBROOK, TX, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Orawan Singhan proudly announces the opening of Royal Thai Massage and Wellness Center, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Benbrook in Benbrook, Texas. A licensed massage therapist, Orawan is known for providing pain relief through different types of massage, including Swedish, deep-tissue, traditional Thai, and Thai combination massage treatments.   Orawan decided to make a career of massage therapy on the advice of a friend who knew she was passionate about fixing people's issues. She enrolled in the massage therapy program at ELM Health Institute in Fort Worth, and quickly became encouraged by seeing firsthand how helpful massage can be for someone in pain.  "My grandfather in Thailand was experiencing issues, and I was able to work on him and relieve some of his pain," Orawan said. "That was a turning point for me," she added.  Orawan specializes in traditional Thai massage. Specifically calibrated for athletes and anyone looking to enhance performance, the massage helps improve mobility.  "During the treatment, I employ a specialized blend of back-walking techniques and yoga-inspired stretches," Orawan said. "This is designed to help promote a heightened sense of fluidity in movements."  Another of Orawan's specialties is Swedish massage, which helps restore balance and harmony to the mind and body. In a Swedish massage, clients will experience ultimate relaxation and unwind through soothing long strokes and gentle kneading techniques.
