# Mid Cities Psychiatry Awarded Behavioral Health Care and Human Services Accreditation by The Joint Commission

DALLAS, TX, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Gold Seal sparkles as a symbol of quality that showcases a health care organization's drive to dish out safe and quality patient care.  Mid Cities Psychiatry tackled this onsite review on September 5th and 6th. During the visit, a crew of Joint Commission reviewers inspected the facility to check out how well they stuck to Behavioral Health Care and Human Services standards.   They poked into several areas including emergency management, environment of care, infection prevention and control, leadership, medication management, and rights and responsibilities of Mid Cities Psychiatry's patients.  The Joint Commission cooks up its standards by huddling with health care experts, providers, measurement experts, and patients. They mine scientific literature and expert know-how to help health care organizations size up, weigh, and boost their standards of care. The surveyors also prowled around making observations and chatting with staff.  "As a healthcare accreditor, The Joint Commission works with healthcare organizations across care settings to inspire safer and higher quality of care that is more equitable and compassionate," says Ken Grubbs, DNP, MBA, RN, executive vice president of Accreditation and Certification Operations and chief nursing officer, The Joint Commission.
