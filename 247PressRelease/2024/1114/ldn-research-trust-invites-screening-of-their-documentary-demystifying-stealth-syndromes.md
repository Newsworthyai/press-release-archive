# LDN Research Trust Invites Screening of Their Documentary Demystifying Stealth Syndromes

CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM, November 14, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Welcome to "Stealth Syndromes"  This film demystifies three interlinked syndromes that are common and treatable, but often needlessly devastating, due to lack of recognition. It explains underlying root causes, why most doctors miss it, effective treatments, and the ironic price paid by physicians who treat these complex conditions.  The Triad Of Conditions  The film will explain the following interconnected chronic conditions:  Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) Mast cells are primitive immune cells located all over the body, which can release different inflammatory chemicals into surrounding tissues when they detect a threat. They are famously involved with allergic responses and anaphylaxis (their best known chemicals being histamines), but they can also have numerous other effects, depending which chemicals are released and where. In MCAS, the mast cells are 'trigger-happy', inappropriately releasing chemicals in response to all sorts of triggers, ranging from foods, mold, infections, odors, temperature changes, mechanical pressure, vibration or even just stress. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the affected mast cells and types of chemicals released.  Dysautonomia Think of all the things your body does for you automatically: digestion, temperature control, circulation, and much more. When those things don't function properly, that's dysautonomia. The most common form of dysautonomia in The Triad is POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), which is difficulty being upright, because the body isn't doing a good job automatically adjusting to gravity when the body changes positions. In a nutshell, the body 'can't stand standing' because not enough circulation reaches the brain, leading to dizziness, racing heart, weakness, brain fog and many other symptoms. POTS patients commonly have other assorted manifestations of dysautonomia too, such as problems with digestion. MCAS has several different mechanisms by which it may cause or exacerbate POTS and dysautonomia.  Hypermobility Syndromes Hypermobility syndromes range from symptomatic joint hypermobility to genetic connective tissue disorders. In one such syndrome, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS), patients have faulty connective tissue — the body's "scaffolding" — making it overly weak, fragile and/or stretchy. This can result in unstable joints, droopy intestines, floppy blood vessels, poor wound healing and many other symptoms secondary to these structural problems. People with hypermobility often make great gymnasts or dancers due to their joint flexibility, however life with hypermobile joints typically gets painful over time due to accumulated injury. Several chemicals released by mast cells are shown to contribute to connective tissue problems. Sagging veins, in turn, may contribute to POTS and weak mast cell membranes may contribute to inappropriate release of mast cell chemicals.  In Summary See how this is all interconnected and what a complex-but-fascinating situation we have here?! There is much more to it, and we hope you'll consider supporting our film so we can educate the world that these patients are not imagining things. They have real issues that have real effective treatments. Awareness and treatment can bring an end to so much suffering.  The LDN Research Trust is excited to announce a global initiative to host in-person screening events of the documentary Understanding Stealth Syndromes in collaboration with clinics, LDN providers, and pharmacies.  We aim to raise awareness and connect individuals suffering from undiagnosed conditions with knowledgeable local providers and pharmacies. Many of the treatment protocols involve compounded medicines.  Event Details: -	**Date:** 27th February 2025 -	**Time:** Flexible; you can choose a time that suits your location throughout 24 hours in UK time.  How to Host an Event: You can organize a screening event in your area for any number of attendees.  Pricing: -	**License Fee:** $100 per license, accommodating 1 to 50 attendees. Multiple licenses can be purchased as needed. -	**Additional Screenings:** Further sessions can be scheduled after February 27th.  Admission: You determine the admission price. Some hosts may charge a small fee, while others might offer a free event with refreshments based on personal preference.  Viewing the Film: The film will be available on our Vimeo Channel. You can screen it using a projector or a large TV.  Support: We recommend checking all equipment at least 2 hours beforehand to ensure a smooth event. A downloadable instruction guide will be provided to assist with the setup.  Marketing and PR: All events will be listed on our events page and marked as "Sold Out" once capacity is reached. We are partnering with an external PR company and will collaborate with each host to create a tailored marketing strategy. Efforts will be made to invite media representatives to cover the events.
