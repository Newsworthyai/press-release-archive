LONDON, ENGLAND, June 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acclaimed artist Jeff Robb has broken new ground in the world of contemporary art with the unveiling of the first-ever three-dimensional portrait of legendary hip-hop artist and producer Dr. Dre. The pioneering work, a result of an intensive day-long shoot at the prestigious Milk Studios in Los Angeles, is the first of its kind taken of the star.  Utilizing his signature techniques and innovative approach, Robb has created a portrait that not only captures Dr. Dre's physical likeness but also encapsulates the profound impact of his legacy. The lenticular photographic 'holographic' like portrait offers a unique, immersive experience, allowing viewers to engage with the subject in a way that traditional 2D art cannot match.  Lenticular photography, the medium employed by Robb, has a history dating back to the 1940s. The technique involves creating images that change or move when viewed from different angles, using specialized lenticular lenses to produce a three-dimensional effect.   "Working with Dr. Dre has been an incredible honour," said Robb. "His influence on music and culture is unparalleled, and I wanted to create something that truly reflects his impact. The 3D portrait not only showcases his physical presence but also captures the depth of his legacy."  The portrait of Dr. Dre marks another milestone in Robb's career, further cementing his reputation as a leading innovator in the field of contemporary art.  Jeff Robb is a London-based artist renowned for his pioneering work in lenticular photography and three-dimensional imaging. With a career spanning over three decades, Robb consistently tries to push the boundaries of contemporary art by merging cutting-edge technology with traditional artistic techniques.   Robb's artwork has been featured in prestigious galleries and museums around the world, cementing his status as a leading figure in the contemporary art scene. His diverse portfolio encompasses a wide range of subjects, from thought-provoking abstract compositions to captivating intimate portraits, of which he undertakes a limited number of private commissions per year.
