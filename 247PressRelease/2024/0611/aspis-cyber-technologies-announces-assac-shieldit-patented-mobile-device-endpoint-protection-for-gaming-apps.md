# ASPIS Cyber Technologies Announces ASSAC ShieldiT Patented Mobile Device Endpoint Protection for Gaming Apps

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL, June 11, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ASPIS Cyber Technologies, is proud to announce the implementation of ShieldiT, a patented mobile device endpoint protection system specifically designed for gaming apps. ShieldiT offers ultra-secure protection for Bring Your Own (BYO) devices or can be seamlessly embedded within gaming apps themselves. This groundbreaking technology mitigates cyber threats for mobile game apps, providing users with unparalleled security and peace of mind.  Mobile gaming apps have increasingly become targets for pirate and hacker attacks. The sophistication of these attacks, including the use of malware, phishing, and hacking technology, has risen significantly, posing serious risks to users' data and privacy.  ShieldiT, the flagship ultra secure cyber security technology, stands out as the only solution with a unified, managed anti-hacking, and anti-tapping capability for BYOD smartphones â€” recognized as the most vulnerable points in today's organizational IT networks. Already deployed by governmental authorities worldwide, the system has proven its efficacy in preventing cyberattacks and offers the highest protection suitable for gaming as well.  Shimon Zigdon, CEO of ASPIS Cyber Technologies and ASSAC Networks, emphasized the critical need for robust cybersecurity solutions in the gaming industry: "We provide ultra-secure military-grade protection. We know online game cyber-attacks have increased by 167% in the last year. Phishing pages used to target children by cybercriminals mostly mimic global titles like Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite, and Apex Legends games. In addition, cybercriminals target parents' devices by creating fake game sites evoking children's interest to follow phishing pages and download malicious files. This is why a new level of cybersecurity is required and this is where ShieldiT comes in."
