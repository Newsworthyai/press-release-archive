MOUNT KISCO, NY, July 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mount Kisco Child Care Center (MKCCC), a non-profit dedicated to providing equitable access to high-quality child care and early education to a diverse group of children, is thrilled to unveil the lineup of culinary partners for its 20th Annual "Feed Me Fresh: An Edible Evening" fundraiser at Ivanna Farms in Mount Kisco on Saturday, September 21st, 2024.  MKCCC has been serving working families in Westchester for over 50 years, currently caring for 145 children ranging from three months to eleven years old through full-day care, before- and after-school programs, and summer camp. The premier fundraising event draws inspiration from Feed Me Fresh, an innovative MKCCC curriculum that educates children about health and nutrition through gardening and cooking. The program couples hands-on farming units with cooking classes, based on seasonal offerings from playground gardens, to create well-rounded, developmentally appropriate activities and projects for each age group.  The event underscores this seed-to-table educational program by showcasing delicious, fresh foods from top local restaurants that generously donate their time and talents in support of the Center. "This year's event will feature an exceptional lineup of local restaurants," says Dawn Meyerski, Executive Director of MKCCC. "By coming together to support our mission, these pillars of our community help us move closer to ensuring that every child in our community has access to high-quality, childcare and nutritious meals," continued Meyerski.   This year's attendees will be treated to an array of samplings from A & S Marketplace, Ben & Jerry's, Captain Lawrence Brewing Company, Crabtree's Kittle House, Exit 4 Food Hall, Ladle of Love, Little Drunken Chef, Lexington Square Caf√©, Mentor's Mediterranean Steakhouse, Mimi's Coffee House, Monarca, and Mt. Kisco Seafood. In addition, Chefs Tommy Calandrucci of Stone Fire and Maarten Steenman of La Tulipe Desserts in Mount Kisco will be teaming up to prepare an incredible three-course plated meal during the program.   In addition, the event is generously sponsored by a number of community businesses and supporters, including Bedford & New Canaan Magazine, The Benefit Shop Foundation, Sakurako & Alain Biem, Leslie Cecil & Creighton Michael, C Clean, Tom Coleman and Sarah Fashena, Eric Hadar, Robin & Matt Jacobs, Jason King, Barbara Klein, Nicole & Stuart Kovensky, Christie Noelle & Scott Krase, Landscape Concepts, Last Mile NYC, Elizabeth Marwell, The Marwell Family, Tanis & Jim Moore, M&T Charitable, Northern Westchester Moms, Fran Osborne, Anne & Pat Papaelias, Mike Sanders, Douglas Polaner Selections, Kelly & Michael Slomsky, Beverley & Sabin Streeter, Keira & Tim Treanor, and Jim Wood. All proceeds from the evening will directly support MKCCC's Scholarship Fund, which is dedicated to assisting families in our community who would otherwise find high-quality child care unaffordable.  "The dedication of the participating restaurants and the generosity of our sponsors are what make this event truly special. Their commitment to our community and our mission is invaluable, and we couldn't do it without their unwavering support and dedication to Mount Kisco Child Care Center," concludes Meyerski.
