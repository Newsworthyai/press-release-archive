# Global Vision Technologies, Achieves TX-Ramp Level 2 Certification for FAMCare Human Services Software

ST. LOUIS, MO, July 31, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Global Vision Technologies (GVT) is proud to announce it has met the criteria to achieve TX-RAMP Level 2 Certification. What is TX-RAMP? The Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program (TX-RAMP) program was launched after passage of Texas Senate Bill 475. It requires the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) to establish "a standardized approach for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud computing services that process the data of a state agency," including institutions of higher education and public colleges.  The FAMCare platform, GVT's proprietary case management solution, has several built-in security controls to help keep data secure and private. "Data security is always a top priority for GVT and this achievement, along with GVT's SOC II TYPE 2 certification and our long standing HIPAA compliance is a demonstration of our commitment to information protection," said George Ritacco, VP, Client Services.   GVT works with agencies who manage data for several critical populations such as juvenile justice, child welfare, long term elderly care, and patient healthcare information. GVT's FAMCare software solution is built on their propriety development platform, Visions Server, which serves as the foundation for all of their products. The Visions Server is an innovative platform that allows for rapid form and workflow development, while helping to mitigate risk that can occur when programming systems from the ground up.  FAMCare is also SOC II Type 2 certified and HIPAA compliant.  GVT is the creator of innovative software solutions for health and human services agencies.
