# CCI France Malaysia Gala Night 2024

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA, November 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Malaysian French Chamber of Commerce & Industry / CCI France Malaysia (CCIFM) hosted its Gala Night on 4th November 2024 at Hilton Kuala Lumpur, honouring the Franco-Malaysian business community's contributions to the thriving bilateral trade between the two nations. France solidified its position as Malaysia's third-largest trading partner within the European Union (EU), with bilateral trade reaching €5.28 billion or MYR26 billion in 2023. In this vibrant context, Malaysia is set to officially assume the Chair of ASEAN on 1 January 2025, and CCIFM wishes its success in this leadership role.   The French economic footprint in Malaysia continues to expand, with 600 French entities established, including around 300 subsidiaries and 300 entrepreneurs. Collectively, they contribute to the local economy by employing approximately 30,000 people.  Over 400 guests were welcomed by Datuk Zainal Amanshah and Mr Richard Fostier, Honorary Chairman and President of CCIFM, respectively, alongside H.E. Axel Cruau, Ambassador of France to Malaysia. The night was further graced by the presence of Guest of Honour, YB Liew Chin Tong, Deputy Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) Malaysia.

With a rich history of vibrant trade relations, France and Malaysia continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of their economic partnership. The Gala Night offered a platform to reflect on their longstanding ties, celebrate current successes, and envision the future of bilateral trade relations. The Chamber is confident that Malaysia remains a strategic and competitive destination for French businesses, acting as a key regional hub for their growth and expansion throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

Selected member companies were honoured with the prestigious CCIFM Excellence Award, which recognizes individuals, companies, and organizations that have demonstrated outstanding excellence and innovation in their respective fields. These contributions have significantly advanced the growth and success of Franco-Malaysian business relations, fostering greater collaboration and prosperity.
