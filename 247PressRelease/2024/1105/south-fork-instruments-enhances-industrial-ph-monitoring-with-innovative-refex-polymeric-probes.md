# South Fork Instruments Enhances Industrial pH Monitoring with Innovative REFEX Polymeric Probes

AUBURN, CA, November 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- South Fork Instruments is introducing the latest advancement in pH monitoring technology—REFEX Polymeric pH Probes—designed to excel in partial vacuum environments across a variety of industries, from pharmaceuticals to semiconductor manufacturing. These probes leverage revolutionary polymeric reference junction technology to provide unmatched stability and accuracy, overcoming the traditional challenges faced by pH sensors under vacuum conditions. Understanding the Challenges of Partial Vacuum Environments  Partial vacuum environments, where the pressure is lower than atmospheric, pose unique challenges for pH monitoring. These conditions are prevalent in many critical industrial processes such as vacuum distillation and fermentation. Conventional pH probes often struggle due to electrolyte leaching and outgassing issues, leading to inaccurate readings and reduced sensor lifespan.  The REFEX Solution: Polymeric Reference Junction Technology REFEX has redefined pH measurement standards with its innovative polymeric reference junction technology, which offers several advantages:  Enhanced Durability: By eliminating liquid-liquid contact between the reference cell electrolyte and the process, REFEX probes prevent the common issue of electrolyte loss under low pressure. Resistance to Fouling: Unlike traditional probes that suffer from fouling and blockages, REFEX's non-porous polymeric reference junction ensures long-term consistent performance. Outgassing Resistant Design: The solid-state design of REFEX probes allows for continuous contact with the process fluid, unaffected by gas bubbles, ensuring reliable pH readings in vacuum environments.  Compatible with Existing pH Analyzers and Transmitters: REFEX sensors are available with the same size as many common probes and connect directly to all of the top brands of pH analyzers and transmitters, making upgrade a breeze.  Operational Excellence with REFEX Probes REFEX probes are engineered for reliability in the toughest conditions. Their design allows for easy integration into existing systems and requires minimal maintenance, significantly lowering the total cost of ownership. The probes are particularly suitable for harsh environments where standard pH sensors fail, providing stable and accurate readings essential for process quality and efficiency.  A Word from South Fork's Technical Director, John Daly "REFEX Polymeric pH Probes ensure that our clients can achieve accurate, stable pH measurements in environments where other sensors falter," stated John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments. "Investing in REFEX technology is about enhancing overall process control and reliability for a wide range of challenging industrial applications. REFEX are so sure of the advantage their probes provide, they will give new users a 90-day money-back guarantee!"
