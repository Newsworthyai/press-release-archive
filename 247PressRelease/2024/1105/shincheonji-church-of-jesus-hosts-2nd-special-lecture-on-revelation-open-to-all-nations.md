NEW YORK, NY, November 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, successfully concluded its 2nd Special Lecture on Revelation Open to All Nations. The event was held at Shincheonji Cheongju Church in South Korea and was created to eliminate conflict and create peace by increasing mutual understanding through the examination of scriptures from different religions.  Approximately 1,000 religious leaders from 57 countries attended the second special lecture. Compared to the first lecture, the scale of the latest event was more than 10 times larger. Everyone who attended came to Korea at their own expense intending to realize peace.  Participants attended the 115th graduation ceremony of the Zion Christian Mission Center on October 30th and learned about the fulfillment of the Book of Revelation on October 31st. Leaders from different religions also gave speeches summarizing content from the Book of Revelation.   "I realized the greatness of the Book of Revelation while I was learning about it," said a monk and Buddhist leader who gave a speech on Revelation 1:1-8. "I think the Book of Revelation is great because I can see a new world through it, and because of that world, I have gained insight into the new world."   Following the religious leaders' speeches, Shincheonji Church Chairman Man-Hee Lee delivered a special lecture on the Book of Revelation.   "Heaven and God are one. To become one, we must have conversations and introduce ourselves," Chairman Lee said. "Anyone in the world who wants to compare scriptures can come to Shincheonji Church of Jesus and compare them. We are opening our doors wide and want to become one."  After Chairman Lee's lecture, all attendees indicated that they wanted to continue engaging in scripture exchange to create world peace by cooperating with Shincheonji Church of Jesus.  "We believe that the foundation for international religious harmony is being built as religious leaders from around the world serve as a catalyst for the exchange of scriptures and the realization of peace," said a Shincheonji Church of Jesus official.
