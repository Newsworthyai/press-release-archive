# Coach, speaker, and author Jay Paterno releases new book, "BLITZED! The All-Out Pressure of College Football's New Era"

STATE COLLEGE, PA, November 05, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As a coach, speaker, and author, Jay Paterno has spent decades immersed in the high-stakes world of college football. With the release of his new novel, "BLITZED! The All-Out Pressure of College Football's New Era," the son of legendary coach Joe Paterno provides insight into both the game's inner workings and the pressures that come with it.  Paterno offers a gripping inside look at the demands facing today's coaches, players, and programs. Drawing from real-life scenarios, "BLITZED!" explores the challenges brought by seismic shifts like big money; transfer policies; Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights; and the toll it all takes on mental health. This novel paints a vivid portrait of college football's high-pressure environment, where survival depends on adapting to a system that seems to change by the minute. ________________________________________  "I don't get paid for sticking to sanctimonious principles. The wolves chasing me every day don't feed on principle; they only eat wins."  College football's amateur model is crumbling, and no one feels the pressure more than Ohio State Coach Ed Hart. "BLITZED!" takes readers inside the relentless chaos Hart faces, from dealing with sky-high expectations to navigating a sport where the rules constantly shift — and are often ignored. Jay Paterno's latest book is the first to explore the seismic challenges in today's college football, exposing the cutthroat world of big money, transfer portals, NIL (Name, Image, Likeness), race, academic integrity, and mental health.  Paterno's gripping narrative shows the strain of trying to survive — and thrive — under the unrelenting pressure to win at all costs. "BLITZED!" combines real-world scenarios and a fictional thrill ride to give fans a seat on the sidelines of college football's modern era. ________________________________________  Praise for "BLITZED!":  •	"Awesome insight into that life." – Urban Meyer, Fox Sports •	"One of the best sports novels I've ever read." – Paul Finebaum, ESPN •	"As engaging as an overtime thriller... fiction imitates life to a T." – Dennis Dodd, CBS Sports •	"Fans will love the insight, characters, and game action." – Dan Wetzel, Yahoo Sports ________________________________________  "BLITZED!" is available for purchase now at $26.99.
