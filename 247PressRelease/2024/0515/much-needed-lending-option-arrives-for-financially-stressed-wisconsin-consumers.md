# Much-Needed Lending Option Arrives for Financially Stressed Wisconsin Consumers

DES PLAINES, IL, May 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The statistics paint a pretty vivid picture," states Nicole Horton, senior director of online services for online lender GoCredit.loans. "Millions of American families are constantly on the brink of extreme financial stress. And all it takes is a single unexpected expense to push them over the edge.  "But families in Wisconsin now have a lending option that can improve their financial situation," she continues. "GoCredit.loans has commenced operations in Wisconsin, and our innovative short term installment loan will help our customers move down the path toward greater financial stability."  An increasing number of families face financial stress  Many American families lack the savings needed to manage short-term emergencies. According to a rolling representative online survey of U.S. adults by market research firm YouGov, 27 percent of Americans had some savings below $1,000 (as of May 2023), while 12 percent said they had no savings at all.  Those grim numbers correspond with the results of a December 2023 study by consumer financial services company Bankrate, which found that fewer than half of Americans—44 percent—can afford to pay a $1,000 emergency expense from their savings. That figure is up from 43 percent one year ago.  A 2024 Bankrate study found that when faced with an unexpected $1,000 expense, most respondents wouldn't turn to cash savings because they lack such funds. More than one-third would borrow the money, by tapping their credit cards, borrowing from friends or family, or taking out a personal loan.  A lack of attractive lending options  "There aren't many appealing lending solutions for financially stressed consumers," Nicole reports. "Traditional options are likely not available to them, and it would be difficult for many of these folks to secure a short-term loan from a bank or credit union.  "And many alternative lenders offer expensive, high-interest loans that would put these families in even worse financial shape," she continues. "They may find themselves trapped in a cycle of recurring debt that's hard to escape.  "But unexpected expenses like medical bills, car repairs or other unpredictable events are part of life," says Nicole.  "And now that GoCredit.loans is open for business," she adds, "Wisconsin families finally have a lending option that helps them with their immediate needs while helping them build a more secure financial future."  Get Cash + Build Your Credit!SM  "In sharp contrast to the many lending solutions that take unfair advantage of financially stressed consumers," Nicole states, "the GoCredit.loans short term installment loan is actually designed to put our customers in a better financial situation."
