When it comes to outdoor fencing for small animals, specific needs often necessitate a tailored approach to the design and installation of fences.  QS Fencing, a leader in metal fencing solutions in Vancouver for both residential and commercial properties, provides essential tips for securing outdoor spaces to accommodate the smallest family members.  Adapting Chain-link Fences for the Safety of Small Pets  Creating a safe environment for toy breeds, bunnies, and ferrets involves several considerations to prevent escapes and ensure protection from threats.  •	Choosing the Right Mesh Size and Fence Height: The standard mesh size of chainlink fences may provide ample space for small pets to slip through. Selecting a fence with a smaller mesh size, ideally 1 inch or smaller, is crucial to prevent escapes. The fence's height should also be considered, with a minimum recommendation of 4 feet to deter pets from climbing over, though this may vary based on the pet's agility.  •	Implementing Digging Barriers: Many small pets, especially bunnies and ferrets, have a natural digging instinct. In this case, a digging barrier is essential. Extending the chain link fabric or an additional wire mesh below the ground level and bending it outward can effectively discourage digging and provide a more secure boundary.  •	Ensuring Enclosure and Gate Security: Pets that are determined climbers or those vulnerable to predatory birds may benefit from a top enclosure. This measure adds another layer of security, keeping pets safely within designated spaces. Gate security is also important; consider a firmly closing gate with a pet-proof latch to minimize the risk of escape.  Common Fencing Mistakes for Small Pets While the safety of small pets is paramount, certain broader mistakes should be avoided to ensure the effectiveness and longevity of a chain link fence.  •	Not Compromising on Material Quality: Opting for high-quality, durable materials for your chain link fence is essential. Lower-quality options might be less expensive initially but can lead to future problems and potential hazards for your pets.  •	Conducting Regular Fence Maintenance: Inspections are vital to maintaining the integrity and safety of a fence. Look for signs of wear, damage, or potential escape routes, especially around the base of the fence and the gate area.
