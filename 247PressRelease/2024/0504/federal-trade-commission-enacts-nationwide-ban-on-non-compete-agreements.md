# Federal Trade Commission Enacts Nationwide Ban on Non-Compete Agreements

MEMPHIS, TN, May 04, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken a historic step to enhance competitive practices and promote worker mobility by issuing a final rule that bans non-compete clauses across the United States. Announced on April 23, 2024, this rule is set to liberate workers from the constraints of non-compete agreements that have long been criticized for hindering competition and limiting employment opportunities.  The new FTC rule prohibits employers from entering into or attempting to enforce new non-compete agreements with any workers, including senior executives. It also renders current non-compete clauses unenforceable for the vast majority of workers, freeing nearly 30 million Americans from these restrictions. However, the rule maintains certain provisions for a small fraction of workers classified as senior executives, who represent less than 0.75% of the workforce. Employers are required to notify workers that existing non-compete agreements will no longer be enforced against them.  The anticipated impact of the ban is significant. The FTC estimates that worker earnings could increase by $400-$488 billion over the next decade, with the average worker's earnings potentially rising by an additional $524 per year. The ban is also expected to result in a 2.7% annual increase in new firm formation, equating to over 8,500 additional new businesses each year. Innovation is likely to advance, with an estimated 17,000-29,000 more patents filed annually for the next ten years. Additionally, the rule could lead to a reduction in healthcare spending by $74-$194 billion over the same period.  The FTC's final rule reflects a growing consensus that non-compete agreements are detrimental to economic growth and the well-being of American workers. By removing these barriers, the FTC is establishing a new standard for fair competition and worker mobility.
