FORT WORTH, TX, July 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Master Barber Sacrenette Moore, aka Sac, the owner of Sac's Barber Lounge at Salon & Spa Galleria Hulen in Fort Worth cordially invites her many loyal clients to a customer appreciation event that will be held on Sunday.  "We're going to have some fun and say thank you to those who patronize Sac's Barber Lounge," said Moore.   Moore has been cutting professionally for 17 years. She first learned how to use clippers from a roommate in college who did hair. After college, the aspiring barber attended The Healthy Hair Academy. She sharpened her scissors and skills with nine years as an instructor at Texas Barber College and even did outreach in Dallas, taking her students to give haircuts to the homeless.   "I helped mentor a lot of barbers into the profession and became confident that I could fix a haircut no matter what mistakes a student made," says Sac.  She worked at a barbershop in Fort Worth before opening Sac's Barber Lounge five years ago.   Providing a variety of expert services, Sac's Barber Lounge is the perfect place to get any kind of haircut, beard trim, or straight-razor hot shave with high-end customer service performed while you sit in an old school barber chair.
