BOSTON, MA, June 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- iuvo has been named as one of the world's top-performing managed service providers in the prestigious 2024 Channel Futures MSP 501 rankings for the 6th year in a row. The Channel Futures MSP 501 list, a technology industry benchmark, ranks companies based on their growth, profitability and innovation.  For the past 17 years, managed service providers around the globe have submitted applications for inclusion on this prestigious and definitive listing. It is a milestone achievement for any managed services organization to be included on the list. The Channel Futures MSP 501 survey uses a quantitative methodology to rank companies based on their annual revenue, profitability measured by EBITDA, and recurring revenue. The methodology has been developed by a Who's-Who in the managed services industry.  MSPs that qualify for the list must also pass a rigorous review conducted by the Channel Futures research team and editors. Channel Futures ranks applicants using a unique methodology that weighs financial performance according to long-term health and viability, commitment to recurring revenue and operational efficiency.  Channel Futures is pleased to name iuvo to the 2024 MSP 501.  "To echo Dave Raffo, MSP editor, this has been a challenging market in a fiercely competitive industry, so emerging on top is a testament to not only our commitment to our customers, but also shows how gritty we have been. We have had to work hard to keep our value and services high while many of our competitors are driving down their prices and value," said iuvo's President & CEO, Bryon Beilman. "Our entire company of iuvonauts are very proud to be recognized."  When asked about the key strategies or innovations he believes contributed to iuvo's inclusion in the MSP 501 list Bryon stated, "We have a philosophy of relentlessly focusing on the needs of our customers. We released a few new productized services over the last year based on us listening to the needs of our customers and creating something novel that would make their business better, more secure, resilient, and compliant. Our focus on automation through a DevOps approach of managing our customers infrastructure using a code-based approach allows us to provide enterprise class features at a midmarket price."   He went on to say, "Just like the MSP 501 showcases the top 1% of the world (as there are reportedly 150,000 MSPs globally), we have found that we are solidly in the top 5% of MSPS that we encounter based on capabilities, customer service and value. Our NPS score of 80 is well over double the MSP average and our IT Consultants have an average of 24 years of experience so our customers get great customer service with unparalleled technical acumen. I feel lucky to have been included in this award, because we often defy the perception of what an MSP can deliver. One of our customers recently told me that iuvo is by far the best IT support company that they have experienced in their career. That type of feedback helps us get up every morning willing to do even better."  This year's list is one of the most competitive in the survey's history. Winners will be recognized on the Channel Futures website and honored during a special ceremony at MSP Summit, Sept 16-19, 2024 in Atlanta, GA.  The MSP 501 represents the best in the technology services industry delivering outstanding vendor and platform neutral advice and value to small, midsized and enterprise customers. This year, the MSP 501 generated aggregate revenue of nearly $25 billion with average growth or recurring revenue of 19%. These are truly the best of the best. Many of their services and technology offerings focus on customer needs in the areas of AI, cloud, security, collaboration, networking, help desk and remote monitoring and management.  The Channel Futures MSP 501 is responsible for keeping their global customers safe, connected and efficient.  "The 2024 Channel Futures MSP 501 winners survived a challenging market and emerged as the highest performing and most innovative IT providers in the industry today," said Dave Raffo, MSP editor and MSP 501 project manager. "The most impressive thing about the MSP 501 winners is they deliver for their customers every day. These are the most innovative, driven, and successful MSPs in a fiercely competitive industry."
