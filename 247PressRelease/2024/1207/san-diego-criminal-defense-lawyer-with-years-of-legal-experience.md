Her prior experience as a former prosecutor gives her team a unique advantage when it comes to spotting and attacking the prosecution's weak points in the courtroom.   "Right now, as you're reading this, the prosecution could very well be setting up their plan of attack. Every second you're not taking action is another second the other side has to plot and formulate a strategy to try and get you convicted. Rather than waiting until your first court date, like most defense attorneys, the fight for your freedom starts from our very first consultation with you. At the Law Offices of Anna R. Yum, we pride ourselves on being proactive, not reactive. We pride ourselves in formulating an aggressive defense, winning strategies, and investigation on your behalf. The longer you delay hiring a criminal defense attorney, the more time you're giving the government to plan their attack. Our firm will fight to give you the best defense possible, but ultimately, you are the maker or breaker of your own freedom", said the spokesperson for the Law Offices of Anna R. Yum.  Anna Yum is licensed to practice in state and federal court in both the Southern and Central Districts of California. She is also licensed to practice law in the state of Illinois.  After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in communication studies and international studies from Northwestern University, ranked 9th in the country, Ms. Yum attended the University of San Diego School of Law and was awarded her Juris Doctor.   While in law school, she was inducted into the Order of Barristers, which recognizes the best eight oral advocates of her graduating class. In addition, Ms. Yum obtained a prestigious judicial externship with Senior Federal Court Judge Robert M. Takasugi in the Central District of California.  Prior to opening her law practice in 2008, Ms. Yum gained invaluable experience as a prosecutor at the Riverside County District Attorney's Office.
