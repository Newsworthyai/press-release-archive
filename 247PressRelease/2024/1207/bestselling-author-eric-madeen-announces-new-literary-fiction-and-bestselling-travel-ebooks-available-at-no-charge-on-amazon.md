# Bestselling Author Eric Madeen Announces New Literary Fiction And Bestselling Travel Ebooks Available At No Charge On Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, December 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Eric Madeen has announced that two of his highly praised books, 'Water Drumming In The Soul' and 'Asian Trail Mix' will be available at no charge in ebook format during December, 2024.  'Water Drumming In The Soul' is a fiery tale set in steamy equatorial Africa, where Peace Corps volunteer David Fields is on mission: to build a medical dispensary in a village where spells are cast on enemies and fear of a geek-shaman reigns. David seldom has his bearings – cultural or geographical – and must fight a cocktail of tropical maladies as well as social taboos as he throws himself into work. Until... he meets Assam. Captivated by her water drumming, her playing the stream as a drum, David is drawn to her early on and becomes the hunter captured by the game. And what a rollicking game of love it is - with a tension or excitement between them that never dissipates, … until the haunting end.  'Asian Trail Mix: True Tales from Borneo to Japan' is a smorgasbord of travel essays which scale down the sprawl of Asia by focusing on the unique and revelatory in sharp, crisp prose. Readers will get to see up close and personal the razzmatazz of novice monks at play in northern Laos, the hustle of pedicab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City, and rainforests blazed on gutsy treks across Borneo and Thailand's Elephant Island. Served up nice and spicy, Asian Trail Mix is slathered across 12 rocking-it essays plus a tall tale at its glorious ending, making for a baker's dozen of sumptuousness. Snack on it!  'Water Drumming In The Soul' will be available in ebook form at no charge December 9 through December 10. 'Asian Trail Mix' will be available in ebook form at no charge December 9 through December 11, 2024. More information about both books is available at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Eric-Madeen/author/B08VGRNJVW?, or from his website at https://EricMadeen.com.  Readers and reviewers have expressed high praise for 'Water Drumming In The Soul'. Zaheer Baber; Professor of Sociology; University of Toronto, said, "Madeen's storytelling prowess shines through and resonates with authenticity. The characters, particularly Assam, are beautifully developed, challenging traditional stereotypes as in presenting a more nuanced and genuine portrayal of African culture."  Elizabeth Montano, author of The Eternal Dawn Trilogy, called it " a novel so beautifully and realistically written I found it on par with works by whom we consider masters … Hemingway definitely comes to mind."  One Amazon reviewer said, "Water Drumming in the Soul not only tells a passionate love story, but it also delves into thought-provoking themes like culture, identity, and the power of human connection. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that'll have you laughing, crying, and everything in between. This isn't your typical love story! This novel is well-written and full of unexpected twists that keep you flipping those pages. Plus, the characters are so well-developed that you'll feel like you've known them forever. So, if you're ready for a wild and adventurous ride, grab a copy of this modern-day classic ASAP!"  In a review for 'Asian Trail Mix', one reader said, "The writing is lush and emotive. It contains images and turns of phrase that will stay with you." Another said, "'Mr. Madeen has a knack for taking one into the depths of a country and introducing the reader to fascinating customs and interesting characters. Five stars!"  Eric Madeen writes cross-genre, and is the author of a number of books:  Tokyo-ing! - This is an apt word for this trio of tales chiming with anyone even slightly interested in Asia's most dynamic metropolis and its glazing of layers – be they cultural or taking-wing exuberant. Madeen does deep dives in three fascinating directions and voices, including the persona in first-person female. Then doesn't let readers come up for air because they don't want to -- until the delicious end.  Tennis Clubbed, Snubbed and Rubbity-Dub Dubbed - In historically rich Yokohama, where Captain Perry and his Black Ships cracked open Japan, the wicked shiver of the tennis snub in the postmodern present pits David Adams against K: a puffed-up xenophobic tyrant who rules over the courts of a club that has as its anthem, ironically, the promotion of international friendship.
