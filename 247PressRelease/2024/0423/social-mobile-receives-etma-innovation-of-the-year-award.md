MIAMI, FL, April 23, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Enterprise Technology Management Association (ETMA) members voted at their recent conference in Puerto Rico, and selected Social Mobile as its Innovation of the Year Award winner. The selection criteria included four factors: the degree of innovation, market response from clients, delivery of the offering, and how the value proposition is being fulfilled and validated in the marketplace.  Social Mobile was recognized for its Rhino Mobility Platforms, which enterprises can use to custom-build any device in all form factors, including smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT devices. The platform is fully certified for global markets, guaranteed for 3+ years of product availability, and secured and managed by Android Enterprise.

"Our new Rhino Mobility Platforms allows businesses to deploy custom devices faster, saving time and resources while unlocking new revenue streams."
