# Smart Splurges and Savvy Saves on Chain Link Fences in Vancouver

VANCOUVER, BC, July 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When installing a chain link fence, balancing quality and cost are critical to achieving security and financial sensibility. Whether looking to enclose a residential yard or a commercial property in Vancouver, making informed decisions on where to splurge and save can significantly impact a fence's long-term value and functionality. For more, go to https://qsfencing.ca/blog/balancing-your-budget-smart-splurges-and-savvy-saves-on-chain-link-fences/  As fence installation professionals in Vancouver, the team at QS Fencing have assembled some strategic tips on how to build an affordable, functional fencing system.  Where to Splurge on Chain Link Fences  1.	High-Quality Materials: Top-grade materials are essential for longevity and durability. Opt for galvanized or vinyl-coated steel, which can withstand Vancouver's variable weather conditions, from rainy winters to sunny summers. These materials resist rust and corrosion better than basic alternatives, reducing the need for frequent repairs or replacements.  2.	Professional Installation: Employing experienced professionals to install a chain link fence ensures a job is done right the first time. Expert installers like QS Fencing understand the intricacies of proper installation and ensure compliance with local building codes, which can save in terms of costly legal issues or redoing work in the future.   3.	Customization for Security Needs: If security is a concern, investing in customizations like taller heights, smaller mesh sizes, or added security features such as barbed wire can be worthwhile. These enhancements deter intruders and protect against wildlife, ensuring a property is well-secured.  Cutting Costs Without Cutting Corners  1.	Choosing Standard Gauges and Sizes: When maximum security is unnecessary, opting for standard gauges and mesh sizes can yield substantial savings. These specifications are adequate for residential properties where the primary need is boundary definition or minor security.  2.	Plan for Phased Installation: If budget constraints do not allow for a complete installation, consider phasing the project. Start by fencing critical areas and gradually extend as finances allow. This approach helps spread the cost over time while providing some security and functionality.  3.	Minimize Gate Numbers: Each gate adds significant cost to the fence installation. Limiting the number of gates in a design can reduce overall expenses. Plan entry points strategically to serve as need while avoiding duplicity.
