BOSTON, MA, August 01, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- iuvo, a leading provider of professional IT consulting and managed services, has announced the launch of iuvo Secure AI Host. iuvo Secure AI host is a product that empowers life science companies, data-intensive industries, and any organization that wants to tightly control AI, to utilize advanced AI capabilities securely on-premises or in a private cloud environment. With this product, businesses can now leverage the full potential of AI while maintaining the highest standards of data security and compliance. With the increasing use of AI models like ChatGPT, data privacy and security concerns have surged.

Revolutionizing AI for Biotech and Life Sciences   Biotech and life sciences companies are at the forefront of scientific advancement. They rely heavily on extensive data analysis in order to drive their research and development. However, they face significant challenges when it comes to managing their data, especially when the data contains sensitive information. iuvo Secure AI Host offers a solution with powerful AI capabilities like ChatGPT but with enhanced security that keeps data on-premises or in a privately managed cloud for secure and compliant management.   Integrating data sources with popular AI models and the ability to leverage large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques on confidential data pose additional challenges. iuvo Secure AI Host integrates with a wide range of data sources and enhances both the utility and accessibility of AI across the business.
