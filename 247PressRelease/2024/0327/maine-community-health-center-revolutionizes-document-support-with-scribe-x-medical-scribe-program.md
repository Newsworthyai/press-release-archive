# Maine Community Health Center Revolutionizes Document Support with Scribeâ€“X Medical Scribe Program

NEWPORT, ME, March 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Scribe-X, the nation's premier medical scribe staffing company, proudly announces its partnership with Hometown Health, a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Newport, Maine. The collaboration marks a significant milestone in Hometown Health's efforts to address concerns around its providers' well-being and pressing provider burnout.  Scribe-X's tailored medical scribe programs strategically address burnout and low job satisfaction by assigning documentation responsibilities to highly trained U.S.-based medical scribes. This method reduces provider documentation time and after-business-hours charting, leading to improved physician job satisfaction and a reduction in burnout.  For Dr. Michael MacDonald, Medical Director of Hometown Health, medical scribe support has been life-changing. "For me personally, it has been huge from a work-life balance perspective," he said. "We were never focused on seeing more patients. This is a provider retention and even a recruiting strategy. I walk out of here, and my charts are done."  The benefits of working with Scribe-X extend beyond its providers. Hometown Health's support staff also sees improved efficiency. "My referral coordinator loves [the scribe program] too," Dr. MacDonald said. "I am finishing notes the same day, which lets the referral department start working on their portion a day early. This also helps improve the quality of patient care."  Scribe-X's flexibility and intense commitment to customer support were showcased when Hometown Health implemented changes to its coding process right before the scribe program's launch. Scribe-X swiftly responded, ensuring their scribes were trained on the new coding process. This proactive initiative effectively supported the new workflow, minimizing confusion and ensuring consistent adherence to the updated process.  Expanding the medical scribe program will be a crucial focus for Hometown Health to reinforce its commitment to physician recruitment and retention strategy.
