# Next Generation Trust Company Provides Guidance and Information for Financial Advisors About Self-Directed Retirement Plans

ROSELAND, NJ, March 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Next Generation, a full-service administrator and custodian of self-directed retirement plans, has created a new website page and support material for independent financial planners and other trusted advisors whose clients are interested in investing in alternative assets through their retirement plans. The web page provides an overview of self-directed IRAs and the many types of alternative assets these plans allow under the website's Information & Education tab.   "With growing awareness of these plans, many financial advisors who are getting inquiries from their clients now have guidance for those seeking more information about this strategy," said Jaime Raskulinecz, founder and CEO of Next Generation. "We developed this page and accompanying materials to help financial advisors broaden their clients' investment horizons, which adds to the value to their client-advisor relationship."  Unlike typical brokerage accounts which limit investments to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, self-directed IRAs, HSAs, and ESAs enable investors to diversify their portfolios by including a broad array of alternative assets within their plans. These include real estate, precious metals, private equity funding, royalties, and many more. The new website page offers talking points for advisors to share with their clients as to the many options and benefits of self-direction as a retirement wealth-building strategy.   "Many people are already investing in these asset classes outside of their existing IRA and may not realize they can build tax-advantaged retirement wealth by including them within a self-directed IRA," said Raskulinecz.   Next Generation reviews all transactions before executing investment instructions on behalf of their clients, who make their own investment decisions based on assets they already know and understand. The company's sister firm, Next Generation Trust Company, holds the assets for its clients.  Maintaining income and relationships for independent advisors Recognizing the relationship between financial advisors and their clients, Next Generation's advisory structure enables independent, fee-based professionals to direct their clients' investments as per their existing advisory agreement and earn more fees on any assets Next Generation holds for their clients. The advisors may bill and get paid their fees directly from clients' accounts.  "Aside from helping their clients develop a more diverse retirement portfolio, financial professionals may be thinking about opening a self-directed retirement plan for themselves. We invite them and their clients to register for a complimentary educational session to deepen their understanding and get answers to their questions about self-direction," said Raskulinecz.
