Haltom City is minutes from both the DFW Airport and Downtown Fort Worth with direct access to major highways including I-820 and SH-121. Due to an outdated and restrictive use matrix that discourages new business and deters growth, several areas of Haltom City have seen a decline in small businesses which provided goods and services and were a significant source of jobs, including the once-thriving automotive industry. However, Haltom City can reverse this trend and should prioritize development of inner-city land and vacant buildings, particularly in the major corridors close to the city's center. The city is financially healthy with a capable manager and staff who would like to see diverse business development occur and need the support of the City Council to make it happen.  About Make Haltom City Thrive Again The Make Haltom City Thrive Again has as its goal bringing the small businesses back to Haltom City, particularly the main corridors in the older parts of South and Central Haltom City. The campaign has proposed a concept plan with a variety of low-cost and no-cost actions the city could take to bring businesses back to older buildings in Haltom City.
