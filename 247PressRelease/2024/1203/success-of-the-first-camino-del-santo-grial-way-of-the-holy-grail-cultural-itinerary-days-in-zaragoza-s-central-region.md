VALENCIA, SPAIN, December 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In November 2024, Zaragoza's Central Region hosted the inaugural 'Jornadas del Camino del Santo Grial', an event dedicated to the Holy Chalice, the Holy Grail, and its historical route, known as the 'Camino del Santo Grial'(Way of the Holy Grail). This initiative, driven by Zaragoza's Central Region, the Cultural Association of the Camino del Santo Grial, and research experts, gathered municipal officials, council members, and attendees interested in the cultural and historical richness of this route, currently undergoing certification as a European Cultural Itinerary for 2024-2025.  Spanning several weekends from November 16-17 and 22-24, the event featured a variety of activities across different municipalities in the region. These included guided tours and lectures that delved into the spiritual and cultural legacy of the Holy Grail whilst exploring the historical significance of the towns along the route. Notable participants included Dr. Ana Mafé García, a world-renowned expert in the proto-history of the Holy Grail, and Dr. Jean-Philippe Sendat, a member of the International Scientific Committee on Holy Grail Studies.  Exploring the Oral Tradition of the Holy Chalice and Zuera's Role in the 'Camino del Santo Grial' (Way of the Holy Grail) Among the highlights was a lecture by Dr. Ana Mafé titled 'The Oral Tradition Surrounding the Holy Chalice'. Dr. Mafé, a pre-eminent researcher and president of the 'International Association of the Way of the Holy Grail', presented a compelling exploration of how oral narratives have preserved the historical and spiritual legacy of the Holy Chalice, currently housed in Valencia Cathedral. Her insights emphasized how oral traditions have maintained a vital connection between local communities and this universal Christian symbol.  Zuera, one of the central municipalities along the 'Camino del Santo Grial', was spotlighted for its significant contributions to the route's historical and spiritual narrative. With landmarks like the Gothic-Mudéjar 'Church of San Pedro Apóstol' and its strategic location along the Camino Real and the Gállego River, Zuera's heritage reinforces its pivotal role in the route. Mayor José Manuel Salazar Salas and Councilman Francisco Nasarre emphasized the importance of preserving Zuera's cultural assets, including the Ermita de Nuestra Señora del Salz, as integral to the Camino del Santo Grial.  Villanueva de Gállego: A Cultural and Historical Hub on the 'Camino del Santo Grial' Villanueva de Gállego contributed a unique scientific and historical-artistic perspective to the event. Dr. Ana Mafé's lecture 'What is the Holy Grail?' utilized the art history methodology of iconology to investigate the authenticity and cultural value of the Holy Chalice. This innovative approach underscored the Grail's significance as a universal cultural asset. Villanueva de Gállego's artistic heritage, particularly linked to 19th-century painter Francisco Pradilla, reinforced its importance within the itinerary. Mayor Gerardo Lope Aranda and Councilwoman Susana González highlighted the municipality's dedication to integrating its local cultural wealth into this European narrative.  María de Huerva and the Tradition of Saint Lawrence Dr. Ana Mafé also presented a lecture on the 'Laurentine Tradition', tracing the journey of the Holy Chalice from Rome to the Iberian Peninsula, with Saint Lawrence as a key figure. Her findings highlighted the municipality of María de Huerva as a strategic point of convergence for historical and spiritual routes. Mayor Joaquín Calleja and Francisco Nasarre, the event's organizer, stressed María de Huerva's role in the 'Camino del Santo Grial' (Way of the Holy Grail), both as a historical waypoint and a modern cultural destination.  Indiana Jones and the Medieval Legacy: Reviving the Grail's Story in Cadrete A lecture titled 'The Search for the Holy Grail in the 21st Century' explored how popular culture icons like Indiana Jones have rekindled global interest in the Grail, bridging medieval literature with contemporary media. Cadrete, with its impressive 10th-century castle, was a focal point for this narrative. Mayor José Bellido Munieza emphasized the municipality's commitment to preserving its historical assets and their integration into the Grail's broader cultural itinerary.  Cuarte de Huerva and the Sacred Geometry of the Holy Chalice In Cuarte de Huerva, Dr. Jean-Phillipe Sendat captivated audiences with his lecture 'The Holy Chalice vs. The Holy Grail', which examined the sacred geometry associated with the Grail's spiritual symbolism. Cuarte de Huerva's medieval heritage and its connections to the Kingdom of Aragón were highlighted as pivotal to the Grail's route. Mayor Elena Lacalle Oreja and Deputy Mayor Julio Conde Alcón underscored the importance of this heritage in enhancing the town's cultural identity and significance within the itinerary.  Archaeological and Cultural Connections in Botorrita Botorrita's rich archaeological heritage, particularly the Contrebia Belaisca site, added depth to the event. Dr. Ana Mafé's historical overview traced the Chalice's journey to Spain in 258 CE, suggesting Botorrita as a potential strategic stop along the route. Mayor José María Castillo Vicente emphasized the archaeological site's value in enriching the Camino del Santo Grial's narrative and its role in promoting cultural tourism.
