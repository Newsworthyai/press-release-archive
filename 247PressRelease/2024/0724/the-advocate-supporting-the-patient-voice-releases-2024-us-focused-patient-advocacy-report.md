The Advocate: Supporting the Patient Voice's goal is to understand the relationship between advocates & the pharmaceutical industry. It's their mission to ensure that patients remain at the center of all healthcare decisions - may it be in their doctor's office, within the walls of the Payer of PBM or up on Capitol Hill. We understand that the pharmaceutical community aligns with their mission in their goals to ensure patients get access to the products they & their physicians have decided. It seeks to serve as a beacon for the pharmaceutical community to always find their way back to the patient by elevating the voice of their loudest supporters – the advocacy organizations. The Advocate does this through a syndicated market research offering for the pharmaceutical community to gain insights into the needs of the patients they serve & the patient advocate organizations they fight side by side with on numerous issues.   The research and expertise of The Advocate allows them to guide today's pharmaceutical advocacy teams, aid in the development & implementation of patient centricity programs within pharmaceutical companies & consult on the use of the patient voice throughout the products lifecycle.
