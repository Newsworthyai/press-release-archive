# Custom Health's Unique Addiction Deterrence Solution: Solving the Opioid Crisis

WASHINGTON, DC, July 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- American Medical Technology Coalition Launches Opioid Addiction Deterrence Task Force  The American Medical Technology Coalition (the "AMTC" or the "Coalition") is proud to announce the launch of its Opioid Addiction Deterrence Task Force (the "OADTF" or the "Task Force"), a groundbreaking initiative aimed at combating the opioid crisis through innovative medical technologies and strategic partnerships. This Task Force is a crucial step in addressing one of the most pressing public health issues facing the nation today.  Prescription opioids are a major contributor to the U.S. opioid epidemic. In 2023, around 150 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed in the U.S., enough for 46.7% of Americans to receive one. Negative health outcomes associated with opioids are especially likely when used under conditions of polypharmacy, a state of treatment which may be described as the use of multiple drugs prescribed by one or more physicians and filled by one or more pharmacies to treat one or more health conditions or diseases. Overprescribing, polypharmacy, and abuse potential are just a few examples of why close clinical monitoring is necessary to properly manage pain while reducing the risk of opioid addiction and dependence.  The OADTF will bring together leading experts, healthcare professionals, and technology innovators to develop and implement advanced solutions designed to prevent opioid addiction and support recovery. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and collaborative efforts, the Task Force aims to create a comprehensive approach to opioid deterrence, focusing on prevention, treatment, and policy advocacy.  "We are excited to launch the Task Force to tackle the opioid crisis head-on," said Shane Bishop, CEO of Custom Health and Executive Director of the AMTC. "Our goal is to harness the power of medical technology to deter addiction through safe, accountable use of prescription medication and rapid access to support systems for those affected by opioid use disorder. This initiative reflects our commitment to addressing critical healthcare challenges through innovation and collaboration."  "Persona's tech stack, featuring the world's most advanced data transformation engine, creates valuable datasets that drive improved health outcomes. This structured, standardized data forms the foundation for high-value operations like machine learning and AI, enhancing our ability to address the most pressing healthcare issues." - Nick Egahos, CEO, Persona Informatics.  "We're honored to join the OADTF as a core technology partner. Healent, a leader in AI-driven clinical intelligence for pain management, is committed to reducing opioid impacts. The task force's vision aligns with our mission." – Mike Palackdharry, CEO, Healent.  "I look forward to this first of its kind collaboration between clinicians, lawmakers, and medical technology to improve the lives of chronic pain patients managed with opioids. I can't wait to see the progress that we can make with our combined resources." Dr. Kyle Young, CEO, Commonwealth Pain & Spine.  The OADTF will focus on several key areas:  •	Innovative Deterrence Technologies: Developing and promoting the use of advanced technologies to prevent opioid misuse and abuse.  •	Enhanced Treatment Solutions: Implementing cutting-edge treatments and support systems to aid in recovery and reduce relapse rates.  •	Policy Advocacy: Working with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies that support effective opioid addiction deterrence and treatment strategies.  •	Education and Awareness: Raising awareness about the risks of opioid addiction and educating healthcare providers and the public on best practices for prevention and treatment.  The OADTF will launch congressional and federal briefings this summer. Briefings will focus on accelerated opioid addiction deterrence strategies rooted in cutting-edge research, technology, and a solutions-based approach.
