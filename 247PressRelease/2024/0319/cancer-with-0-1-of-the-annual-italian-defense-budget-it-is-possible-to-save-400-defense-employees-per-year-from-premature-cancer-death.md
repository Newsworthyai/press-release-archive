# Cancer: With 0.1% of the annual Italian defense budget, it is possible to save 400 defense employees per year from premature cancer death

ROME, ITALY, March 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Saving millions of human lives from premature cancer death every year: this is the challenge of the Italo-American scientist Dario Crosetto.  To this goal, his calculations and scientific evidence, which no one has refuted in two decades, support the request that—for just 0.1% of the Italian defense budget—he can construct two 3-D Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS) devices, proving experimentally that they could prevent 400 Italian defense employees from premature cancer death per year.   If the project is later scaled up, the potential exists to save the lives of more than 90,000 Italians and $10 billion per year, and to save 5 million lives per year worldwide (https://bit.ly/3vfyKGm).   The Crosetto Foundation is pleased to report the dialogue in progress between the Italian government and scientist Dario Crosetto, a resident of the USA for 33 years and the inventor of 3D-CBS. This innovative technology can detect tumors over the entire body at a very early, curable stage with a 2-minute test, which requires very little radiation and costs just €200.  Experimental Evidence  The 3D-CBS technology with a long detector was invented by Crosetto in 2000. Following the invention, the researcher received 59 quotes from qualified companies confirming the feasibility of building the 3D-CBS components.  Crosetto received research grants from the US Department of Energy and the US Department of Defense totaling over $1 million to demonstrate the feasibility of his invention, which he did in a unique peer-reviewed 45-page article with a single author, approved within a month by one of the foremost prestigious scientific journals (goo.gl/bqhD4R).  Crosetto subsequently demonstrated the functionality of his invention in electronic hardware circuits built at his own expense; however, he did not receive funding to build a complete 3D-CBS device to demonstrate that it can save many lives.  With a team of 16 people, Crosetto could assemble the first two 3D-CBS prototypes in 18–24 months at a total cost of €20 million. This would allow the gathering of experimental evidence for his claims, namely to prevent the premature cancer death of at least 400 lives within the Italian defense community every year.  Based on the experimental results obtained, the project could be expanded to build 500 3D-CBS devices over a decade, with components costing less than €2 million. In this way, potentially over 90,000 Italian lives could be saved every year, and the Italian healthcare system could save €10 billion (https://bit.ly/3vfyKGm).  How is the potential number of lives saved calculated?  The calculation to establish the number of lives saved from premature cancer among Italian defense employees has been carried out as follows.  The Italian defense community comprises approximately 300,000 employees (280,000 in the military and 20,000 in offices). The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) reports 180,000 cancer deaths in Italy every year. Dividing 180,000 by the Italian population of 58,800,000 and multiplying by 100,000 yields 306 cancer deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in Italy every year. Therefore, among 300,000 defense employees, a conservative estimate is 800 cancer deaths per year, considering the young average age of defense employees; this young population has a lower mortality rate compared with those aged over 75 years of age.  Since the 3D-CBS detects tumors with only 100 cancer cells while CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds can only detect tumors with over 1,000,000 cancerous cells; this difference allows for early diagnosis capable of saving the lives of at least 50% of those with tumors of the breast, prostate, colon, etc. This is a conservative estimate, considering that experimental results have shown a survival rate of over 90% when these types of cancer are detected early https://bit.ly/2Br5zE9).  Allocating to Crosetto 0.1% of the annual €19.54 billion Italian defense budget to build two 3D-CBS devices and offering priority screening to the 300,000 defense employees has the potential to halve the expected 800 annual cancer deaths. (A priority screening as recognition of and gratitude for the service the employees of the defense provide to us all, even giving their lives to protect our rights).  Following a biopsy showing a basal cell carcinoma on his back on 1 December 2023, Crosetto underwent a test using a less efficient and more expensive Chinese version of his 3D-CBS to verify the absence of other tumors throughout his entire body.   As a result, Crosetto is in possession of a CD with 1.63 GB of data recorded simultaneously from every organ in his body, and his tumor was successfully removed.  In a subsequent examination (which may take place in a year, six months, or three months, at the discretion of the doctor), the comparison of the new data with the previous data provides valuable information about any anomalies in biological processes throughout the body, helping to prevent the onset of diseases, including cancer.   This early detection of minimal abnormal biological processes, which are precursor to a disease, will position Crosetto within the 98% survival statistics according to experimental data, and almost certainly higher than 50%.  Increased safety and other advantages of 3D-CBS  The original 3D-CBS device with a long detector is more efficient and less expensive than similar models built 19 years later, thanks to Crosetto's inventions, as described in the book: of the year 2000 "400+ times improved PET efficiency for lower-dose radiation, lower-cost cancer screening" (goo.gl/ggGGwF), in a peer-reviewed article (goo.gl/bqhD4R), in a 2-page article (https://bit.ly/46GWu40) and poster (https://bit.ly/49k7GF9) approved in 2023, and in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMnHRuWo4o).   Crosetto's innovative 3D-CBS technology accurately captures more photons in a shorter time at a lower cost compared to any alternative approaches (goo.gl/zP76Tc). Furthermore, it uses thicker, economical BGO crystal detectors that stop more photons in the same way that a thicker bulletproof vest would stop more bullets.  This marks a leap forward in early cancer detection, with the 3D-CBS technology's capability to detect tumors no larger than 100 cancerous cells at very low radiation and low examination cost, making it more advantageous compared to CT scans, MRIs, and mammograms, which can only detect tumors larger than 1 mm and containing over 1 million cancer cells.  In 2019, nineteen years after Crosetto's invention, a Chinese version of the 3D-CBS was build. However, this version is significantly less efficient, requiring ten times the radiation dose, and the test costs up to 50 times more.  Even with the far higher levels of radiation required by the Chinese device used for Crosetto's personal examination on 1 December 2023, the radiation levels were undetectable by airport security just two hours after he underwent the test.   The differences between 3D-CBS and other technologies currently available (including the Chinese version and more than 10,000 traditional PET devices) in terms of lower radiation and lower examination cost for acquiring sufficient signals (over 200 million) for a diagnosis are:  •	3D-CBS: 1 minute, 0.5 mCi radiation; $200 per exam (approximately $10 copay with insurance) •	Chinese version: 3 minutes, 5 mCi radiation; $4,500 to $10,000 per exam ($343 copay with insurance) •	PET: 20 minutes, 15–20 mCi radiation; $6,000 per exam (does not detect tumors at an early stage)  Being able to quantify minimal differences and anomalies of biological processes in each organ notifies doctors and patients as soon as cancer cells reach a stage where the immune system cannot correct the situation on its own. The method also uses a safe, low-radiation, sugar-based tracer as opposed to, for example, the contrast liquids used in MRI exams— such as gadolinium—which are associated with greater risks.  Building ROADMAPS:  With the aim of passing on his invention to new generations and addressing other urgent problems, Crosetto has also started an educational initiative (https://bit.ly/40JCBqw) that offers internships to ERASMUS students interested in building roadmaps for projects with a disruptive impact on the most pressing societal needs. Roadmaps proposed for 20 or 30 years must present a verifiable plan, such as the table published at https://bit.ly/3ova8Tz, the ultimate goal of which is to save over 100 million lives and €27 trillion in the next 30 years.   Current dialogues with scientific institutions  •	On 20 September 2023, Crosetto's 3D-CBS invention was included on the agenda of a council of an academy of sciences associated with a major religious organization. While not refuting the researcher's calculations and scientific evidence demonstrating it can save millions of lives from premature cancer death every year (see https://bit.ly/3qii6Dv), its president surprisingly declared that they could not host a cancer conference until 2025. However, he did not provide references to the issues that will be discussed by the academy of science during the next two years, which will have the potential to reduce suffering and premature death of more than 9 million people, as the 3D-CBS. This prestigious academy, boasting 86 Nobel Prizes, includes the Director-General of CERN and the former director of the US NIH, now a scientific advisor to the US President. In the last decade, Crosetto has communicated with both entities about the terms of his invention but inexplicably has not yet received funding to allow him to obtain experimental results.  •	On July 4, 2023, a few months after Crosetto delivered a letter to a high-level government representative (see letter https://bit.ly/3pfXKKt), a meeting was organized by the Ministry of Defence in Rome between the inventor of the 3D-CBS and the highest scientific authority in the defense sector. In a report dated November 29, 2023, written by the Ministry of Defence's scientific expert, the calculations, logical reasoning, and benefits of Crosetto's invention remain unchallenged. However, the report emphasized four times that determining which technology saves or does not save the lives of over 400 defense employees annually was not the goal. Another incongruent aspect in the report was that the Ministry of Defence's scientific expert stated the opposite of what was said at the July 4, 2023, meeting in Rome— that there is no evidence that early diagnosis saves lives. However, during the meeting on July 4, 2023, he approved the scientific evidence. Crosetto has asked for explanations regarding these and other non-scientific retractions that seem to oppose experimentation and saving lives. To date, no response has been received.  Political delays cost lives  Receiving these responses would allow everyone to understand who is obstructing the experimentation that is potentially capable of saving human lives. On December 19, 2023, the staff of the Italian government's representation asked Crosetto to wait to release the Ministry of Defence's scientific expert's report with the researcher's comments, promising to address the issue at the beginning of 2024.  Crosetto accepted the request. But, out of professional, scientific, and moral duty toward the 400 defense employees and the 90,000 Italians who die prematurely from cancer each year and could be saved through effective, safe, and low-cost early diagnosis, he suggested a deadline of January 26, 2024, to for the publication of the Ministry of Defence's scientific expert report with his comments/questions, highlighting the obstacles.  Having received no response, Dario Crosetto has planned a trip on April 25, 2024, from Dallas, Texas, to Civitella, Italy, to the site of the Nazi-fascist mass killing for the 79th anniversary of the liberation of Italy. The aim is to meet again with President Mattarella and submit to him a new letter highlighting the daily mass killing of 250 Italians from cancer. These lives could be saved by approving the experimentation of the 3D-CBS, a technology that no one has scientifically refuted to date after two decades.  "The collaboration of everyone, especially the media, is necessary to disseminate and create awareness of the existence of this life-saving invention," says Crosetto.   It is the responsibility of everyone, in fact, to act in our own interest and that of future generations, in order to halve premature cancer deaths and costs.  "Broadcasting this news creates awareness of the importance of addressing logical deductions and counterarguments in a public discussion in a scientific and transparent way.   It is desirable that logical reasoning and common sense in this discussion, with the Ministry of Defence's scientific expert and with any person of goodwill in the healthcare field, will lead us to approve the funding to build at least two 3D-CBS devices to be able to demonstrate in a concrete way that the lives of thousands of people can be saved annually, starting with those in the defense sector."  Consequences of inaction  "The decision to block the experiment carries an immense responsibility, as this choice effectively means not saving 400 Italian defense employees, 90,000 Italians, and 5 million people worldwide from premature cancer death every year.", says Crosetto.   News media can help move this forward by publishing any counterarguments by leading experts.  Call to Action  Leading experts in the field responsible for allotting some of the $2 trillion per year in research and development funding should provide details of comparative projects to the 3D-CBS technology, enabling a transparent decision to be made to fund the inventor for the construction of two such devices.
