# La Jolla Jeweler Designer Creates Vintage Style Rings

SAN DIEGO, CA, March 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Carl Blackburn of C. Blackburn Jewelers in La Jolla has seen increased interest in vintage style engagement rings, cocktail rings, and eternity bands. "Classic designs never really go out of style," says Blackburn, "but over the past 6 months I've seen more jewelry shoppers looking for retro and art deco ring designs."  Carl Blackburn has been designing vintage-inspired jewelry for almost 30 years, having created his first fine jewelry collection in 1995, while living in Bali. In the early/mid 2000s, he was among a group of American jewelry designers, like Neil Lane and Penny Preville, who were responsible for igniting renewed interest in vintage ring designs. Carl's fine jewelry from that period was eventually rebranded as the best-selling Beverley K. Collection.  Today, Carl Blackburn is no longer creating fine jewelry for the mass market, but focusing his skills on creating custom engagement rings and fine jewelry for clients in San Diego. As a Graduate of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) Jewelry Design Program, Carl is deeply familiar with all types of fine jewelry design, but he still is passionate about vintage-inspired jewelry, and loves to see customers visiting his La Jolla jewelry store with that fine jewelry in mind.  Signature elements of Carl Blackburn's custom rings include Old World details like fine filigree, milgraining, and hand-engraving. He loves working with rose gold to add a vintage touch. And he sometimes sets his engagement rings with diamond cuts popular a century ago, such as Old European Cut and Old Mine Cut diamonds.   When creating eternity bands for anniversary rings, Carl especially likes to work with French cut diamonds, which were first introduced in the 15th century and then reinvented in the early 20th century â€” as these diamonds add a unique sophistication and style to the eternity ring.  C. Blackburn Jewelers makes the purchase of a custom diamond ring affordable to customers on a tight budget by providing the option of a lab-grown diamond, which can save buyers up to 90% compared to the price of an earth-mined diamond.   Physically identical to natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds shouldn't be confused with diamond simulants like cubic zirconia, which don't have the same qualities of a genuine diamond that's earth mined or lab grown  Carl Blackburn also sets his custom rings with precious and semi-precious gemstones. The La Jolla jewelry designer says that during the past year many couples have been interested in setting custom engagement rings with colored gemstones, such as sapphires, aquamarine, and morganite.  C. Blackburn Jewelers is located in the beautiful neighborhood of La Jolla By the Sea in San Diego County. They are open 7 days a week by appointment. Customers can schedule a meeting with Carl Blackburn by calling 858-251-3006.
