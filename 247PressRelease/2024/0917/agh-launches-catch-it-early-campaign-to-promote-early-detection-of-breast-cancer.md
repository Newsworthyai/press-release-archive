# AGH Launches 'Catch It Early' Campaign to Promote Early Detection of Breast Cancer

ARTESIA, NM, September 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Artesia General Hospital is proud to announce the launch of its new 'Catch It Early' campaign, a community-focused initiative aimed at increasing awareness of the importance of early detection in the fight against breast cancer. Running from September through October, the campaign coincides with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, underscoring the hospital's commitment to promoting health and well-being within the community.   Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women in the United States, but when detected early, it can be treated more effectively. The 'Catch It Early' campaign encourages women, especially those over the age of 40 or with a family history of breast cancer, to schedule routine mammograms and other screenings as part of a proactive health strategy.  "Early detection saves lives," said Roy Thomas, Director of Radiology at Artesia General Hospital. "With this campaign, we hope to inspire more women in our community to take charge of their health and get screened regularly. Mammograms are a simple but powerful tool that can catch breast cancer in its earliest stages, often before symptoms appear."   The hospital's state-of-the-art imaging services ensure high-quality care and accurate results, giving patients peace of mind. The campaign also features educational outreach, social media efforts, and collaboration with local businesses and organizations to spread the message about breast cancer prevention and the significance of early screenings.  Artesia General Hospital is the leading not-for-profit healthcare provider dedicated to serving our community with compassionate care. AGH is proud to be recognized by Becker's Hospital Review as a top recommended hospital in New Mexico based on feedback from patients in a 3rd party survey. With a mission to deliver high-quality care, the hospital is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of the region through a wide range of services and programs.
