# The Penguin Set to Dominate HBO's Sunday Nights Following September 19th Premiere

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 17, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Starring Colin Farrell as the notorious Oz Cobb, aka "The Penguin," the series will kick off a major weekend of premieres, airing across multiple days, including a Sunday evening slot on September 22nd. After the premiere, new episodes will drop every Sunday night at 9 pm ET/PT starting September 29th, making HBO the new go-to for your weekly dose of Gotham's dark underworld.  The series stars Farrell alongside a powerhouse cast, including Cristin Milioti (Sofia Falcone), Rhenzy Feliz (Victor Aguilar), and Shohreh Aghdashloo (Nadia Maroni), among others. Lauren LeFranc serves as showrunner and executive producer alongside Matt Reeves, Dylan Clark, and Farrell himself. The show promises to explore the gritty aftermath of The Batman while bridging the gap to the upcoming sequel.  Behind the scenes, HBO Chief Executive Officer Casey Bloys and his team have been instrumental in greenlighting and shaping The Batman universe's ambitious expansion across film and television. Under Bloys' leadership, HBO has doubled down on serialized storytelling that digs deeper into fan-favorite characters and iconic villains. LeFranc hinted in a recent interview that The Penguin is more than just a standalone show; it's a direct lead-in to the next Batman film, expected in 2026.  "We're living in Oz's world," LeFranc told EW, offering fans a glimpse into what lies ahead. "We are the bridge between the two films. We're going almost directly into the second film Matt has planned," she added. This deep connection between the series and the larger Batman narrative aligns perfectly with the vision that Reeves and Clark had during the development of The Batman. Many elements initially conceived for a Gotham PD project have found their way into The Penguin, thanks to the creative synergy between the teams.   Amid the excitement for The Penguin, some observers criticized certain tweets promoting the series, describing them as poorly worded and potentially harassing toward segments of the fanbase. In response to the backlash, the studio quickly apologized, emphasizing the importance of maintaining respectful and inclusive engagement with all viewers. The Penguin is more than just another superhero series; it's a strategic piece of HBO's broader content lineup, driven by Casey Bloys' commitment to expanding premium, high-quality programming. With HBO's reputation for creating some of the most talked-about television in recent years, expectations are high for this new chapter in Gotham's criminal saga.  As the series rolls out weekly, fans can expect more than underworld power plays. The show also sets the stage for future explorations within Gotham City. "There's another television exploration we're going to do," Dylan Clark teased, hinting at additional expansions of The Batman universe that are already developing under Warner Bros. Television.  With its star-studded cast, tightly-woven plot, and support from industry heavyweights like Casey Bloys, The Penguin is poised to keep viewers glued to HBO's Sunday night lineup well into the fall.
