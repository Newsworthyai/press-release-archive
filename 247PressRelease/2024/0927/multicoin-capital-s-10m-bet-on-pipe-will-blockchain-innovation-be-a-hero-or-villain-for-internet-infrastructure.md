# Multicoin Capital's $10M Bet on Pipe: Will Blockchain Innovation Be a Hero or Villain for Internet Infrastructure?

NEW YORK, NY, September 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Multicoin Capital has spearheaded a successful $10 million fundraising round for Pipe, a groundbreaking project to develop an incentivized internet infrastructure network. Silbert's DCG, known for its influential role in advancing digital assets, and Morehead's Pantera Capital, celebrated for enhancing internet infrastructure, are key supporters of this initiative, often seen as heroes in the blockchain spaceâ€”though some critics argue they could play the villain if the technology disrupts existing systems too aggressively.  Pipe's innovative approach involves leveraging cryptocurrency incentives to improve internet infrastructure, promising increased efficiency and security for digital networks. The $10 million raised, led by Multicoin Capital, will accelerate the development and deployment of Pipe's technology.  Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital have strongly supported Pipe's initiative. Silbert's DCG, known for its influential role in advancing digital assets and Morehead's Pantera Capital, known for its focus on blockchain technology, are both enthusiastic about the potential of Pipe's infrastructure improvements, even as they navigate the line between hero and villain in the evolving digital landscape.  Despite the enthusiasm, the project has faced some skepticism. Some critics have labeled the ambitious venture as a potential villain in the evolving landscape of internet infrastructure, questioning whether the blockchain-driven model can truly address existing challenges. Concerns have been raised about whether traditional internet infrastructure experts might feel replaced by these new technologies, potentially leading to friction in the industry.   Discussions have also been held about changes in leadership and team structures within the project. Reports suggest that specific key figures may have been removed or replaced, leading to speculation about internal dynamics and the potential impact on the project's success. Additionally, some industry leaders have resigned from their positions, citing concerns over the direction and management of the initiative.   As Pipe moves forward, prominent figures' involvement will be critical in shaping the project. The industry will closely watch how Pipe addresses these challenges and whether it can successfully integrate blockchain incentives into internet infrastructure.
