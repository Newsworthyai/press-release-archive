# ANOTHER CHOICE FOR SCHENECTADY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES: URBAN COLLEGIATE ACADEMY CHARTER SCHOOL

SCHENECTADY, NY, September 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Several incidents have left Schenectady High School's students and families uneasy since the beginning of the school year. Despite deep investment in security personnel, school police, restorative practice specialists, and mental health professionals, the Schenectady City School District has failed to keep Schenectady children safe. There is no excuse for the district's continued safety and security failures. Students and families should not experience uncertainty, anxiety, and trauma about safety at school. Schenectady once prided itself on being a trauma-informed school district but has failed to be responsive to the traumatic experiences endured by students who have to confront real threats to their safety.  Schenectady families deserve an accessible K-12 public charter school system. The founding team of Urban Collegiate Academy Charter School continues to work through the application process to offer Schenectady students and families a viable secondary public school choice by September 2026.  Your support is crucial. We need the public, especially those with fourth or fifth-grade students, to express their support by completing surveys and interest forms. Your input will shape the future of education in Schenectady.
