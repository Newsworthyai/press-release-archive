# Sober Living America Celebrates 30th Anniversary Empowering Lives Through Recovery

ATLANTA, GA, September 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sober Living America (SLA) is proud to announce its 30th anniversary, marking three decades of unwavering commitment to providing life-changing services to individuals battling addiction. Since its inception in 1994, Sober Living America has grown to house 2,000 individuals daily across 47 locations nationwide, becoming one of the leading sober living organizations in the United States.  About Sober Living America Founded in 1994 by Jim DeVarennes, Sober Living America was born out of a singular vision: "Let no person be turned away due to lack of money." Witnessing the heartbreaking reality of individuals being denied help because of financial constraints, Jim DeVarennes left a successful insurance career to establish Peachford House. His mission was clear â€“ to connect people with a 12-Step and Christ-focused treatment curriculum. Reflecting on the journey, Jim DeVarennes states, "Our mission has always been to provide a safe and supportive environment for those in recovery, irrespective of their financial situation. Seeing lives transformed and families restored over the past 30 years has been the greatest reward."  Initially starting as a modest 5-bed facility in Atlanta, SLA rapidly expanded to 60 beds, becoming one of the largest facilities in Georgia. Recognizing the multifaceted challenges faced by individuals in recovery, Sober Living America launched a comprehensive jobs program that includes support from career advocates, transportation services and life skills training to enhance job readiness and placement assistance. The organization also developed a 12-Step and Christ-focused treatment curriculum to help individuals break the chains of addiction.
