WASHINGTON, DC, November 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cohen & Cohen, a leading personal injury law firm with over 25 years of experience, is pleased to announce that applications are now open for the 2025 Auto Accident Survivor & Friends Scholarship. This $1,000 scholarship is designed to support students who have been directly affected by auto accidents, either as survivors or as friends and family members who have stood by accident victims during their recovery.  The scholarship is open to students currently enrolled in accredited undergraduate, graduate, or professional programs. This includes community college students, high school seniors, and those who possess a GED and have been accepted to or are enrolled in an accredited institution. Applicants must demonstrate how surviving an auto accident, or supporting someone who did, has inspired them to pursue their academic goals. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75 is required.  We understand the profound impact an auto accident can have on one's life and aspirations, and our goal is to alleviate some of the financial burdens for those who have shown remarkable resilience.  In 2024, the scholarship was awarded to Kellsey Miller, who exemplified courage and determination in overcoming the challenges posed by an auto accident. "Congratulations to our 2024 scholarship winner, Kellsey Miller!" added Mr. Cohen.  Applicants are required to submit an essay of up to 1,000 words describing their, or a friend's, experience with an auto accident and how it has influenced their education and career goals.
