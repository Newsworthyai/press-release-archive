Martin  Barbara Y. Martin was born on June 25, 1929 in New Britain, Connecticut. Her extraordinary journey into metaphysics began at an early age when her mystical clairvoyant talents opened, giving her many visions and spiritual encounters. These experiences set her on a lifelong path of exploration and mastery of the metaphysical arts. See this five-minute video about Martin's life.  Dubbed the "Mozart of Metaphysics" for her many spiritual gifts and remarkable ability to see and interpret auras with unprecedented clarity, Martin dedicated her life to helping others understand and harness their spiritual potential. Her groundbreaking work on the human aura and the spiritual sciences garnered her international acclaim and respect.  Born with the gift of seeing the aura in all its subtleties, as well as interacting with and being taught by celestial beings, Martin's abilities often got her into trouble with her family and friends. She learned to keep quiet about what she saw and experienced. However, her abilities, insights, and lessons only heightened throughout her teenage and adult years, along with the call to make metaphysics her profession. Martin met her first spiritual teacher, Dorothy La Moss, at age eleven. La Moss led a famous theater stock company in the midwest, yet quietly she was a hermetic scientist. Clairvoyant herself, La Moss was the first to teach young Martin about her spiritual gifts and how to interpret the aura. Years later, Martin trained as a young adult with Dr. Inez Hurd, a well-known LA-based mystic clairvoyant who helped Martin sharpen her gifts and prepared her for the rigors of becoming a professional metaphysical teacher. Martin committed to her destiny fully and began lecturing, teaching classes, and providing consultations on the esoteric arts, thereby beginning the career of one of the world's great mystics.  In 2000, Martin teamed up with her long-time student and co-author Dimitri Moraitis to organize her many years of teaching into a comprehensive training center. Initially called The Center for Metaphysical Studies, it became Spiritual Arts Institute when incorporated as an educational 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2005. The school is both a metaphysical training center and a publishing house. During this time, Martin was training Moraitis as a spiritual teacher to continue and add to the spiritual work when her time as a teacher concluded. Their first book together was Martin's flagship book, considered a metaphysical magnum opus, "Change Your Aura, Change Your Life." That book launched a series of metaphysical titles on the mystical arts based on Martin's many years of clairvoyant experiences.  In 2016, Martin realized a long-held dream and opened the door to the Institute's new physical building in Encinitas, CA. Spiritual Arts Institute has become the premier metaphysical school for the aura, spiritual healing, and soul growth, serving as a beacon for those seeking to explore the metaphysical sciences. Read more about Martin at the school's website.  Martin and Moraitis co-authored several books that have been translated into multiple languages and continue to be foundational texts in metaphysical studies. These include the bestseller "Change Your Aura, Change Your Life," "Communing With the Divine," "Karma and Reincarnation," "The Healing Power of Your Aura," and "Heaven and Your Spiritual Evolution." A sought-after speaker, Martin's teachings provided practical guidance on spiritual development, aura cleansing, and energy healing, empowering individuals to lead more harmonious and fulfilling lives.  Martin has left behind a proud legacy of teaching thousands how to better their lives by working with the aura and spiritual energy.
