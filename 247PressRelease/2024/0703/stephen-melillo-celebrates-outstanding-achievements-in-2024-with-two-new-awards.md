# Stephen Melillo Celebrates Outstanding Achievements in 2024 with Two New Awards

SMITHFIELD, VA, July 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renowned composer Stephen Melillo has had an extraordinary year in 2024, earning his third Pulitzer Prize in Music nomination for "Holodomor." He also won "Best Cinematic Soundtrack" at the New Age Radio Music Awards and received the LIT Songwriting-Audio-Music-Book Narration & Score Award for "Excerpts from the Ahab & Death to Moby Dick Love Stories."  On June 27, Melillo's latest release, his 53rd album, STORMWORKS Chapter 89: Worlds Within the World, garnered two Silver-Outstanding Achievement Medals at the 2024 Global Music Awards for Composer and Creativity/Originality.  The Global Music Awards commended Melillo, stating, "The judging standards are high, and being honored means the craft and creativity of your entry is outstanding."  Melillo emphasized the significance of this recognition. "With a participant list of over 20,000 musicians and industry insiders, STORMWORKS Chapter 89—composed for high school and, in some cases, middle school musicians—competed against top-level symphonic orchestras, film/TV recordings, and various works from chamber ensembles to experimental. The complete 135-minute album being recognized in two categories represents a first, not only for STORMWORKS but for our 'band world.' An exciting new bridge has been made between music education and the professional music-making world," Melillo stated.  A fan writes, "the only thing missing in this release is the possibility to hear the creations yourself.  Look up Stormworks on your favorite DSPs for that treat."
