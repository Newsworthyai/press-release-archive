# 2023 Sam's Legacy Scholarship Winner Re-Imagines Ways to Reduce Drunk Driving

KINGSTON, NY, April 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The New York Injury & Malpractice Law Firm, P.C. proudly announces Jackson Aldaya as the distinguished recipient of the 2023 Sam's Legacy Scholarship award. Sponsoring the annual Sam Legacy Scholarship since 2020, John Fisher and his medical malpractice law firm invite college students to submit an essay describing their ideas for decreasing driving fatalities caused by alcohol, which claims 10,000 Americans each year.  "We are thrilled to congratulate Jackson Aldaya as the 2023 Sam's Legacy Scholarship recipient for his innovative solutions – including Virtual Reality (VR) – to reduce drunk driving and save lives," announced John Fisher, founder of The New York Injury & Malpractice Law Firm, P.C.   On October 6, 2020, one of those innocent lives lost to drunk driving was U.S. Naval Ensign Samuel Cleghorn. "Our family watched this young man grow up and to see his life cut short so senselessly inspired this scholarship as a remembering of Sam. We hope the innovative ideas generated by Mr. Aldaya will encourage others to find new and better ways to prevent the loss of more innocent lives."   According to recipient winner, Jackson Aldaya, "The fight against drunk driving requires a comprehensive and innovative approach addressing the issues from multiple angles."   A more robust technical take on education, including 'Virtual Reality (VR) simulation' is one of the cornerstones of Mr. Aldaya's new programs to reduce incidents of drunk driving, which continues to be the number one cause of traffic fatalities in the country. Among beefed-up enforcement and legislative initiatives, Mr. Aldaya recommends an expanded role for wearable (SCRAM Systems) passive alcohol detection systems that continuously monitor a driver's blood alcohol (BAC) levels.   Mr. Aldaya is a senior mechanical engineering student at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, with post-graduation plans to join the firm, RTX in McKinney, Texas, working on drone imagery technology.  "I want to thank Mr. Fisher and the New York Malpractice and Injury Law Firm for this scholarship. This award allows me to take time off from my second part-time job in food service to focus on my TA position at the university, where I enjoy mentoring and guiding young engineers."  Sam's Legacy Scholarship applications for 2024 are now open to any college-bound high school senior and current college student with a 3.0 GPA.
