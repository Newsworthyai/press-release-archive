PRINCETON, NJ, April 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- igolgi, inc., a leading innovator in audio/video processing, encoding, and transcoding solutions, and Bridge News LLC, the creator of the 24x7 NEWSnet and SPORTSnews highlights networks have gone live with a nationwide project to centralize Over the Air (OTA) terrestrial distribution. The two companies have been working closely together for over a year to design and install the unique video processing solutions for the needs of the Bridge News nationwide distribution networks.  Their 78 ATSC television stations feed the remote transmitter sites from the NOC in Farmington Hills, MI. The program bouquet for each station is created on igolgi encoding equipment, and includes PSIP, EAS, and Nielsen watermarking integration. The content is then distributed using Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) to feed the remote sites.  Future expansion includes Bridge News originating their OTT feeds to CDN distributors from the same NOC, also using igolgi transcoding and streaming server equipment.   "The all-IP infrastructure project moved at lightning speed – from concept to getting over 60 stations on air in record time - all fed out of our NOC," according to Scott Centers, President, Broadcast Operations at Bridge News, LLC. Centers continued, "igolgi has been a trusted partner to getting not only the baseline infrastructure in place but also the monitoring and other automation systems to deliver a reliable nationwide service in a very cost-effective manner. Igolgi, with their products and in-depth experience with video encoding and broadcast infrastructures that has helped us create a reliable distribution network."  "Bridge News, with over 78 OTA television stations, almost 90 affiliates, and two networks, is leading the way in creating highly efficient OTA distribution with their original news and sports content, and their use of leading edge – but proven – technology. We are delighted to be a trusted partner and play a pivotal role in getting their systems on air," said Dr. Kumar Ramaswamy, President, and co-founder of igolgi Inc.   "As their network continues to grow and evolve, we expect to bring more efficient and cost-effective solutions for broader distribution," he added.
