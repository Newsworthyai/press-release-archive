# Learn And Play® Montessori School Announces 'Early Bird' Fall Enrollments in Sunnyvale, Fremont, and Danville Locations Plus Others

FREMONT, CA, July 27, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Learn And Play® Montessori School, a top provider of early education services in the San Francisco Bay Area at https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/, is excited to announce the opening of fall enrollment. While enrollments can be placed at any time, the reality is that "early bird" parents are encouraged to explore the relevant campus for their child or children as space can be limited.  Kiran Grewal, Co-Founder of Learn And Play® Montessori, explained, as follows: "Savvy parents and guardians know that the foundation to success in education and in life starts early. Thus, they not only enroll their child in a best-in-class program for daycare or childcare, but start with preschool and continue to kindergarten. Late summer is the ideal time to plan a fall enrollment for one's child."  Here is background on the news. Learn And Play® Montessori School is renowned for creating a nurturing and stimulating environment where children can thrive. The curriculum is designed to foster independence, creativity, and critical thinking from a young age. The integration of STEM concepts ensures that children are not only prepared for future academic challenges but are also encouraged to explore and innovate.  For example, the Sunnyvale (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/sunnyvale/), Fremont Irvington (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/irvington-fremont/), and Danville (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/danville/) campuses are strategically located to serve families throughout the Bay Area. And these are just three locations among the seventeen listed on the website; interested persons are urged to visit the website to find a location near them, primarily in the East Bay and South Bay.  As for curriculum, the company places significant emphasis on its comprehensive programs: daycare, preschool, and kindergarten. Each of these programs integrates age-appropriate STEM methodologies and the Montessori method, ensuring a well-rounded and enriching educational experience. The daycare program, starting at 18 months, focuses on early childhood development, providing a safe and nurturing environment where children can explore and develop essential skills. The preschool program builds on this foundation, combining Montessori principles with hands-on STEM activities to foster curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. As children transition into kindergarten, the program continues to emphasize personalized learning, preparing them academically and socially for the challenges ahead. Booking a school tour at a campus near them is highly recommended. An in-person experience is the best way to determine if the daycare, preschool, or kindergarten program is a good fit for their child. During the tour, parents can explore the vibrant learning environment, meet the dedicated educators, and see firsthand how the Montessori plus STEM methodology is implemented.
