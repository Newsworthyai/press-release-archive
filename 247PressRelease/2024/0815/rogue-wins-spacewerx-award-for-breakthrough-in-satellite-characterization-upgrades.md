# Rogue wins SPACEWERX award for breakthrough in satellite-characterization upgrades

LACONIA, NH, August 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rogue Space Systems Corporation has been selected by SpaceWERX, the innovation arm of the U.S. Space Force and a unique division within AFWERX, for a SBIR Phase II award, valued over $1M. This project will further our efforts towards characterization of Resident-Space-Objects (RSOs) for identification, classification, and diagnosis through our Contactless LAser Satellite Stethoscope (CLASS).   To complement (or enhance) our on-orbit remote identification and characterization sensor suite, Rogue is developing a laser vibrometer for contactless in-situ audio and harmonics diagnostics. CLASS will use a laser beam to measure electronic vibrations of spacecraft, using acoustical signatures to identify the spacecraft and even detect anomalies.   Rogue's CLASS technology will enhance and complement other remote sensors in characterizing the operational state and life of spacecraft. This elevated situational awareness will play a key role in global space initiatives such as space traffic management and the enhancement of situational awareness, as well as open new opportunities to monitor and service satellites.  "The ability to remotely detect and characterize space objects with their unique "heartbeats" offers a wholly new opportunity to assist with diagnosis and repairs," notes Rogue's CEO Jon Beam.  "Characterizing an RSO using laser vibrometry increases in domain situational awareness including who is operating and how they are operating.before or after," said Rogue Chief Operating Officer Brook Leonard.  For Rogue, CLASS represents another step along our technology roadmap, getting us closer to building our fleet of Orbotsâ„¢ enabled by diverse client characterization. This will facilitate our in-space logistics services, made safer and more effective by our perceptual/autonomy system.   This award is another success story for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) initiatives. The Air Force Research Laboratory and AFWERX have partnered to streamline the SBIR/STTR process by accelerating the small business experience through faster proposal-to-award timelines. The DAF began offering the Open Topic SBIR/STTR program in 2018 which expanded the range of innovations the DAF funded. Rogue's progress is a testament to the effectiveness of this approach.
