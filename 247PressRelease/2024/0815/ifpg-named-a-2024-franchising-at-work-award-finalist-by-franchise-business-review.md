PARLIN, NJ, August 15, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The International Franchise Professionals Group (IFPG) was just named a finalist for the 2024 Franchising at Work Awards by Franchise Business Review. The awards recognize franchise companies with the highest employee satisfaction based on an independent survey.   IFPG is the largest and most respected franchise broker organization, known for its inclusive culture and commitment to responsible franchising. For the fourth consecutive year, IFPG has been honored with this prestigious award. "Being recognized as a top employer means the world to us. We consider our team family and essential to our success," said Don Daszkowski, CEO and founder of IFPG. "Many of our employees have been with us since the company's inception.

IFPG has consistently been recognized for excellence, earning the No. 1 ranking for franchise broker organizations on Entrepreneur magazine's Top Franchise Suppliers list for five consecutive years. "These awards are truly gratifying. They validate our efforts to always do the right thing for our clients and employees," said Daszkowski.  Franchise Business Review (FBR), a market research firm that specializes in benchmarking satisfaction within the franchising sector, conducts surveys of corporate franchise employees, franchise supplier employees, and franchise owners' employees across North America each year to determine their levels of engagement.   FBR's Franchising at Work Employee Engagement Benchmarking research provides aggregate data to help franchise companies understand how their culture and engagement compare to other companies in the franchise sector and improve hiring and retention practices. Participants were asked questions related to job satisfaction, engagement, skills and experience, management, brand leadership, and culture.  Franchise companies that participated in Franchise Business Review's employee engagement research were eligible for the Franchising at Work Awards. FBR analyzed data from over 11,000 franchise employees, representing 80% unit-level employees and 20% corporate employees to identify the finalists.   "The Franchising at Work Awards are the only awards that recognize the companies in the franchise sector that prioritize employee engagement and well-being, and are dedicated to building and maintaining a positive culture," said Michelle Rowan, president & COO of Franchise Business Review. "Recruiting and retaining quality employees is one of the most critical factors in the ultimate success of a business, and these companies have set themselves apart as top employers in franchising through their commitment to employee satisfaction, asking for feedback, and involving their teams in driving the success of their culture."   IFPG President Red Boswell shared his excitement. "I am proud to work for a company that values its employees. This is a tremendous honor. And we are truly blessed to have the most amazing team."
