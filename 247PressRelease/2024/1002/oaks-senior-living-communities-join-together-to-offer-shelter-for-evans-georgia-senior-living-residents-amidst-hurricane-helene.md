ALPHARETTA, GA, October 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the wake of Hurricane Helene, a category 4 storm with destructive impact stretching over 600 miles, Oaks Senior Living communities in Georgia and South Carolina showcased exceptional courage and care as they came together to ensure the safety of residents from Oaks at Evans Senior Living.   Due to the extreme weather conditions form Hurricane Helene, causing power outages across the southeast, OSL community Oaks at Evans were among those without power.

Prepared with the necessary staff/supplies and coordinating with local emergency services, Camelia Place of Woodstock and Oaks at Aiken gladly opened their doors to provide temporary housing for the Evans residents.   CEO, Bear Mahon, and CFO, Drew Williams, were some of the Oaks Senior Living staff present to assist the relocation of residents, exemplifying true leadership in a critical situation. Meanwhile, the Regional Team and the Community Leadership Team at Oaks at Evans worked tirelessly around the clock to ensure all residents' needs were met. Together, they coordinated the delivery of 30 cots and set up a safe, comfortable environment for all residents during the transition.   "We are extremely grateful for the community support and the dedication of our team members. This collaboration effort underscores our commitment to serving not only our residents, but also the broader communities in which we operate.", says Oaks Senior Living CFO Drew Williams.
