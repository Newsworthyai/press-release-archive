# Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric Offers HVAC Savings This Fall to North Jersey Customers

LITTLE FALLS, NJ, October 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric, Inc. has announced several discounts available to homeowners in northern New Jersey to save on their heating and air conditioning needs this fall—and improve their home's energy efficiency and indoor air comfort.   Routine maintenance discount From October 14-November 30, homeowners can save $50 per HVAC system on routine maintenance visits for their furnace or boiler. This annual fall maintenance ensures the heating system will work as expected this winter with a full heating system checkup performed by the company's certified HVAC technicians.   During the routine maintenance visit, the technician conducts a thorough check of the air filters, thermostat, fuel and electrical connections, system controls, the gas pressure, burner combustion and heat exchanger. All moving parts will be lubricated and if any problems are discovered, the technician will inform the homeowner and provide a price quote immediately for any replacement parts and repairs. Comfort Club maintenance plan members always get priority scheduling of maintenance visits and receive a discount on repairs.   Rebates and zero-interest financing Those who plan to replace their HVAC system may take advantage of several money-saving programs: •	Carrier Cool Cash – As an authorized Carrier factory dealer, Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric offers customers a $2200 rebate on high-efficiency Carrier Infinity® furnaces with Greenspeed® Intelligence. Additional rebates are available for other Infinity and Performance® series equipment, including heat pumps. The rebates are available until November 23 and equipment must be installed by December 28 to qualify. •	Zero percent financing for PSE&G customers– Qualified PSE&G customers can get generous 0% financing for up to seven (7) years, on HVAC installations valued at up to $25,000. The invoiced amount will appear on the PSE&G bill as a line item to be paid monthly over the financing period. This financing amount represents a $10,000 increase over last year's program. •	No-interest financing on a Generac generator – Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric installs and maintains high-quality Generac standby home generators. Homeowners who install a new generator can get 0% financing for 18 months with approved credit, plus a free whole-home surge protector with installation.

"Our sales team will review all the ways customers can upgrade their existing HVAC system or install a new system in their home, and help them apply for rebates and convenient no-interest financing," said Jack Lamb, general manager.
