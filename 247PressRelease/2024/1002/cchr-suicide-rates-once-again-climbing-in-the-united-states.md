# CCHR: Suicide Rates Once Again Climbing in the United States

CLEARWATER, FL, October 02, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Every year, September, is designated as National Suicide Prevention Month, and this past September was no different. But despite the increased awareness suicides in the United States are once again rising. As reported by U.S. News, "2022, the latest year for which statistics are available, the rate had climbed once more to 14.2 deaths per every 100,000 Americans, report researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."  As the country is faced with yet another increase in suicide related deaths, the Florida chapter of CCHR is calling upon lawmakers to investigate the effectiveness of the current suicide prevention methods.  Depression, often promoted as a warning sign of possible suicide, is the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorder in the nation. Promoted by the manufacturers of antidepressants that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, this theory was disproven and the researchers noted that "psychiatry bears some responsibility for dissemination of the theory and associated antidepressant use".  "The idea that depression is the result of a chemical imbalance was a lie," states Diane Stein, president of CCHR in Florida, "What CCHR has been saying for years, that there is no medical test which proves depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain, has been proven correct."   Unfortunately, due to the marketing of this false theory and promotion of this idea by psychiatry, an estimated 80% of the public believe that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.  The lie is fueled by advertising with pharmaceutical companies spending $6.58 billion on advertising in 2020 when that same year saw U.S. advertising spending drop by 13% overall.  "The suicide rate is once again climbing despite the enormous amount of money being spent to prevent this horrible tragedy," says Ms. Stein. "Our lawmakers need to take a serious look into the mental health industry and their utter failure to obtain results."

L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
