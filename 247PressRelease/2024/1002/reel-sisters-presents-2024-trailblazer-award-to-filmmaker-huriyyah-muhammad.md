REEL SISTERS TRAILBLAZER HONOREE 2024 BIO  HURIYYAH MUHAMMAD  Huriyyah Muhammad is an award-winning director, writer and producer whose projects have been invited to the Sundance Film Festival, Tribeca Film Institute, Outfest, Newfest, AFI, Austin Film Festival, New Voices in Black Cinema, American Black Film Festival and selected by The Criterion Collection.

Huriyyah's directing projects often explore those forces both seen and unseen that guide us in our lives. Her work invites audiences to take the journey with her as she tackles tough subjects - death, divorce, eviction - with humor and heart. Huriyyah's sci-fi digital series, KELOID, has become a cult favorite - winning at multiple festivals.   Her fantasy shorts, OUTGROWN and WONDERS, both toured extensively domestically and internationally, winning multiple Best Short and Best Cinematography Awards. Her Excellence in Storytelling Award, at SeriesFest 2024 for her intergenerational short NANI'S BIRYANI, was the first of its kind. Her most recent directorial project, CHOCOLATE WITH SPRINKLES, the 2024 HBO Short Film Competition winner starring Reno Wilson, is a heartwarming, life-affirming tale inspired by memories growing up in her family's Cleveland, Ohio donut bakery.   As busy as Huriyyah is as an artist, she believes strongly in community and put that belief into action by co-founding The Black TV & Film Collective, a 1400-member, non-profit arts organization supporting filmmakers of Black and African descent.
