# Far Greater Freedom than Android Auto! Transforming Car Navigation into a Laptop, AutoPro X, Launches on Indiegogo

NEW YORK, NY, May 29, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After the successful Kickstarter campaign of 'Autopro X', a dongle that transforms vehicle navigation into a laptop by Mayton Motion, the company is now launching a relay funding campaign on Indiegogo.  'Autopro X' is a smart wireless adapter that, unlike Android Auto, allows you to freely use all smartphone apps as if on a laptop. It raised $181,619 from 1,208 backers on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  With 'Autopro X', you can use any navigation app, OTT services, YouTube, do document work with a keyboard, play Xbox games with a game joystick, use social media, email, and even internet searchesâ€”all made possible by Samsung Dex software. Dex is a system developed by Samsung for Galaxy smartphones that transforms all smartphone apps into a laptop-like user experience when connected to a monitor.  Mayton Motion has developed a wireless dongle for vehicle navigation that is compatible with 'Autopro X', allowing you to simultaneously run multiple apps, adjust window sizes, and use voice AI Bixby and ChatGPT. Additionally, you can use your smartphone as a wireless mouse and choose whether to fill the screen with the navigation aspect ratio or maintain the original ratio. If you prefer to use Android Auto, you can simply select the Android Auto mode on 'Autopro X' for the same experience.  Receiving enthusiastic responses from those who spend a lot of time in their cars or frequently transport passengers, as well as from those who were unsatisfied with traditional navigation systems or Android Auto, the funding amount exceeded 3,000% within a month of the Kickstarter launch. In response to ongoing consumer demand, the company is now launching on Indiegogo.  'Autopro X' can be used in vehicles compatible with Samsung Galaxy phones and Android Auto. For more information and product purchase, visit the Indiegogo website starting from May 28th, 2024.  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/autopro-x-wireless-android-auto-adpater-to-pc/x/37595005
