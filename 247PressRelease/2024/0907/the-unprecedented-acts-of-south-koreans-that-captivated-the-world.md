# The Unprecedented Acts of South Koreans That Captivated the World

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The keychain featuring the South Korean flag, filled with the history of the Korean War, has sparked significant interest in South Korea. The Korean War, which began in 1950 with an invasion by North Korea, remains one of the most heartbreaking chapters in South Korean history. At that time, many countries came to South Korea's aid.  In August, a South Korean company, Infresh, made headlines by creating a flag keychain with a historical symbol registered as Korean cultural property to mark the 71st anniversary of the Korean War Armistice. The keychain features heartfelt messages from veterans, such as "17 years old, sacrificed for the motherland" and "Our deaths become the flowers of history," embossed in detail. At the same time, the company announced that proceeds from the product would be donated to war veterans around the world, which has resonated with many Koreans.  Although the actual flag has not been popular as a fashion design in South Korea, the keychain has become highly sought after, attracting people of all ages, from teens to those in their 70s. This has led to an unprecedented situation where people in South Korea and other countries are exchanging keychains as gifts.  The South Korean company behind the flag keychain, Infresh, has been sponsoring Korean War veterans for years. Their support extends to areas such as medical, logistical, and financial assistance for veterans from Ethiopia, the Philippines, and Thailand, which are among the poorest of the countries that participated in the war.  Overseas netizens have expressed admiration for the keychain's beauty and the respect shown by Koreans, with comments like, "After decades of history, only Korea can be so sincere," "The gratitude of Koreans is beyond imagination," and "It's amazing to see a company stand up for the country."  "It took the dedication of countless veterans to make South Korea what it is today," said a representative from Infresh. They emphasized their commitment to giving back to veterans around the world, stating, "We have been sponsoring projects, but the efforts of the veterans cannot be converted into a simple monetary value."  Infresh's actions in honoring their history have touched the hearts of people around the world, becoming a source of social inspiration.
