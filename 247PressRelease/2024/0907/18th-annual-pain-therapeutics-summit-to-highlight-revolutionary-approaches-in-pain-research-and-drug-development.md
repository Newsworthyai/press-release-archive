# 18th Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit to Highlight Revolutionary Approaches in Pain Research and Drug Development

BOSTON, MA, September 07, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 18th Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit, a premier event bringing together leading experts in pain research and therapeutics, will take place from October 28th, 2024 to October 29th, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. This year's conference promises to be a pivotal moment in the field, with a diverse agenda featuring cutting-edge research, innovative treatment strategies, and collaborative efforts aimed at addressing the global challenge of chronic pain.  One of the summit's highly anticipated sessions, "Partnering with Patients in Clinical Pain Research: What's the Benefit?" will explore the evolving role of patients as partners in clinical research. Historically viewed merely as "subjects," patients are now being recognized for the valuable insights their lived experiences bring to research design and execution. This paradigm shift is particularly significant in pain research, where patient engagement has lagged behind fields like cancer and HIV research.  In addition to this groundbreaking session, the summit will cover a wide range of topics, including:  •	Targeting the Brain Mesolimbic Pathway to Prevent Pain-induced Anhedonia and Facilitated Opioid Intake: Dr. Jose Moron-Concepcion of Washington University School of Medicine will discuss strategies to improve the efficacy and safety of KOR antagonists in pain management. •	Evaluating Drug Effects on Respiratory Drive: Dr. Lynn Webster or Dr. Vince Clinical Research will outline optimal methodologies for assessing CNS drug effects on respiratory function, aiming to improve drug safety in clinical practice. •	Developing Novel Analgesics in the Era of the Platform Trial: Dr. John Markman will present Lilly's innovative Chronic Pain Master Protocol, which systematically evaluates new analgesic mechanisms. •	Panel Session: Pain Biomarkers: Chaired by Dr. Ram Arudchandran of the NIH, this panel will explore advances in pain biomarker development and their potential to revolutionize pain treatment and patient care. •	Psilocybin and Nociplastic Pain: Dr. James Gilligan of TRYP Therapeutics will discuss the potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating fibromyalgia and other nociplastic pain conditions.  The summit will also feature poster sessions, networking opportunities, and discussions on emerging technologies and methodologies in pain research, including novel analgesic development, the use of psychedelics for pain management, and the application of wearables in pain characterization.  "We are excited to bring together such a distinguished group of professionals who are at the forefront of pain research and treatment," said John Waslif, Founder & Director of this event. "This year's summit will not only highlight the latest scientific advancements but also underscore the importance of patient-centered research approaches that have the potential to transform the field of pain therapeutics."
