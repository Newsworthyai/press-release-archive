# Highly Anticipated Ohio Supreme Court Ruling Raises Concerns for Injured Workers

TOLEDO, OH, December 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Ohio Supreme Court's recent ruling in State ex rel. AutoZone Stores, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. has sent ripples through the workers' compensation system, prompting serious concerns for injured workers. The November 26, 2024, decision upheld AutoZone's argument, limiting access to temporary total disability benefits for workers terminated from their jobs—even when medical conditions related to their workplace injuries prevent them from working.  The ruling reinforces the precedent that employers can contest claims for temporary or permanent disability benefits if they argue the loss of earnings stems from reasons unrelated to the workplace injury, such as termination or retirement. The decision also highlights the Ohio Revised Code 4123.56(F), which requires a "direct result" relationship between the injury and wage loss to qualify for benefits.  "This decision creates significant challenges for injured workers, who may now face greater hurdles in accessing the compensation they deserve," said Thomas Schaffer, founder and attorney at Schaffer & Associates, LPA.  The case stemmed from an AutoZone employee terminated while on light duty, who later sought temporary total disability benefits following surgery related to their workplace injury. Despite medical evidence supporting the claim, the Court sided with AutoZone, ruling that benefits could not be paid because the wage loss was attributed to the termination, not the injury.  "Employers are seizing every opportunity to reduce their obligations to injured employees. At Schaffer & Associates, we remain committed to protecting workers' rights and ensuring they receive the support they need during difficult times," added Schaffer.  The ruling's implications are profound. Injured workers now face an even higher burden of proof to demonstrate their employment status and medical impairments are directly connected to their workplace injuries.  For individuals currently pursuing or considering a workers' compensation claim, this ruling introduces additional challenges. Schaffer & Associates offers guidance and representation to navigate the complexities of Ohio's workers' compensation system. Injured workers must now provide even more compelling evidence that their inability to work is directly linked to their workplace injury rather than any other circumstances, such as termination or personal decisions.   The Ohio Supreme Court concluded: "Superseding the voluntary-abandonment decisions under the third sentence of R.C. 4123.56(F) does not eliminate the requirement of a causal relationship between the allowed injury and an actual loss of earnings. R.C. 4123.56(F) replaces the voluntary abandonment decisions with a "direct result" requirement, clarifying that the claimed loss of wages or inability to work must be directly caused by an "impairment arising from an injury" and not by "reasons unrelated to the allowed injury."  This heightened burden of proof may discourage valid claims or delay much-needed benefits, making it essential for injured workers to seek experienced legal guidance to navigate these complexities and protect their rights.
