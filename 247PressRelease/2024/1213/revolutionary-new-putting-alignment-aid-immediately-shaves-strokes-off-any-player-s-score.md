# Revolutionary New Putting Alignment Aid Immediately Shaves Strokes Off Any Player's Score

PALM SPRINGS, CA, December 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "What does the weekend warrior golfer struggling to break 100 have in common with the internationally recognized Tour professional?" asks Jeff Sargent, a 25-year PGA teaching professional.   "They both agonize over their putting game and wish they could make more one-putts," he continues. "That's why I'm excited to introduce the 1Putt—an innovative putting alignment aid that will instantly improve any golfer's game."  The 1Putt adjustable golf ball marker and putting alignment tool enables any golfer to make more putts on their very next round. It helps players at every level become better golfers without spending hundreds of dollars on lessons or practicing for weeks.  Making putting less complex  "Putting is a challenge for every golfer," Jeff states, "and it's not hard to see why. There are so many variables to consider: alignment, the break, the distance of the putt, the speed of the green.  "It all can be too much to focus on while standing over a putt," he continues, "and that can lead to a lack of confidence and a mishit that results in a three-putt or worse. But what if we could reduce the number of variables? What if we could give the golfer just one thing to focus on while standing over their putt?"  A game-changing breakthrough  The innovative solution Jeff created is an adjustable golf ball marker that can pivot left or right so golfers can easily align their ball down the intended target line.  Here's how to use the 1Putt: •	Step 1: Mark your ball from behind with your 1Putt •	Step 2: Read the green from all sides and determine the break •	Step 3: Crouching behind your ball, keep your intended target line in sight and pivot the 1Putt left or right to aim it down your target line •	Step 4: Place your ball, aligning the three lines on the ball with the three lines on your 1Putt •	Step 5: Remove the 1Putt and confidently make your putting stroke •	Step 6: Watch your ball disappear into the cup  "When you use the 1Putt to align your ball to your target line," states Jeff, "all you have to focus on is the speed of the putt. You'll find yourself draining putts from anywhere on the green.  "The 1Putt will deliver immediate results for golfers at all levels," he adds. "And it's available online for just $69.99—far less than the cost of lessons or an expensive new putter."  Give yourself an edge that's perfectly legal  The 1Putt is 100 percent USGA and R&A legal and conforming. It may be used during play as well as during practice.  "The 1Putt is the only golf accessory you can practice with that is USGA legal to use in competition," says Chipper Cecil, Director of Golf, Mission Hills Country Club (1981-2014) and PGA Life Member. "It will save you at least one shot every round of golf. Ask any tour player what one shot per round means and where they would finish in a tournament. Amateurs want to hit 300-yard drives. Professionals want to make more putts."  "No matter what level of golfer you are," concludes Jeff, "if you want to start making more putts immediately, the 1Putt belongs in your golf bag."
