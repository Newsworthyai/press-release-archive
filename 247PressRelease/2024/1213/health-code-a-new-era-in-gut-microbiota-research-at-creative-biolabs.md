# Health Code: A New Era in Gut Microbiota Research at Creative Biolabs

SHIRLEY, NY, December 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Within the human digestive system resides about 500 to 1000 species or varieties of bacteria that are relevant in performance of key physiological processes like improving intestinal barrier integrity and pathogen-associated immune responses.   Driven by extensive work on live biotherapeutic product (LBP) development, gut-focused research is being spearheaded by Creative Biolabs and new technologies are developing LBPs and changing the future of gut microbiota research.   "Understanding the human and gut microbiota interplay is the basis for focusing on a researched and developed innovative aspect," stated one of the microbiologists at Creative Biolabs. "We want to give researchers the tools to do the science they want to do."   A Comprehensive Array of Technologies One popular tradition employed by Creative Biolabs is the use of a combination of classical microbiological techniques and molecular theories. These new ideas give them an edge over their competition. These strategies not only serve as synergistic objectives, but also aid significantly in the identification of live biotherapeutic products aimed at the stomach's bacteria.   Key technologies include:  * Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE): The enhanced DGGE technique helps to understand certain features of gut microbiota communities, which are very critical, while providing evidence of how such communities are unstable.  * Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH): FISH employs fluorescence and high-resolution image systems to reveal gut microbes, whereby their structure and roles are elucidated.  * Real-Time PCR: This technology ascertains target gene expression in gut microbes by combining optimization of the primer design and PCR reaction conditions, thereby ensuring reliable quantitative data is generated concerning microbial activities.  * 16S rRNA Sequencing: This technology, when combined with available bioinformatics tools and algorithms, assists to determine the patterns and composition of gut microbes together with complicated interactions of the microbes with the host's health.  * Culturomics: The novel culture techniques that are employed in culturomics enable growth of gut microbes that could not be cultured before and hence allude to potential new probiotics and bio-therapeutic breakthroughs.   Comprehensive Research Support   Not only does the work of Creative Biolabs end with the well-equipped technologies, but in addition, they do sample preparation starting from human feces and intestinal contents to use other animals such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, cats, dogs, chickens, sheep, fish, rabbits, insects, horses, and pigs.  In addition, a wide variety of LBPs that uncover research gaps on gut microbiota can be developed on Creative Biolabs' integrated LBP development platform, which enables full research reports and data support services. Such integrated systems have been aimed to explain comprehensively the structure and operations of the gut microbiome with an aspiration of developing precision therapies against the gut for personalized medications.

About Creative Biolabs, one of the leaders in developing live biotherapeutics, aims to provide proper scientific support to researchers. Although the company's presence at Antibody Engineering and Therapeutics US 2024 will be the last event of the company in 2024, development of life sciences does appeal to creative biolabs.
