# Author Ryan Ivesdal Introduces the Release of His New Book "Pray Before Reading"

MAGNOLIA, TX, December 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Raised on a Buffalo ranch in rural North Dakota, Ryan Ivesdal now lives in Bismarck with his wife and four kids, but remains a country boy at heart. For 13 years, Ryan and his wife have attended their local church, where Ryan has developed a love for evangelizing, a passion for the lost, and the willingness to answer the call of God, as found in scripture. It is his calling and his life's mission to reach as many people as possible for Christ, glorifying God in the process.  Ryan's first book, "Pray Before Reading" is a biblical expedition that takes the reader on a journey through time and space, exploring the limitless imagination of God that is revealed to us in the Bible. This is an in-depth study of two different realities, two different realms of creationâ€”the spiritual realm and the physical realm, the heavens and the earth.   He explores how these realms coexist and operate, separate, yet vitally connected. This biblical journey touches on key questions at the center of the Christian life such as freewill and the doctrine of election, the sovereignty of God, predestination, and many others drawing on clear and consistent exposition of Scripture.   "Pray Before Reading" unveils the truth about deception, religion, Christianity, and it sheds light on some otherwise dark subjects. Readers will journey through various elements of biblical and church history and the history and origin of religion, and into the future of what's to come, from both the human perspective and the spiritual perspective as revealed seamlessly and simultaneously in the book of Revelation.   As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Ryan's book will educate, support and inspire. "Pray Before Reading" invites people to abide in Him and spread the good news of salvation to the ends of the earth!
