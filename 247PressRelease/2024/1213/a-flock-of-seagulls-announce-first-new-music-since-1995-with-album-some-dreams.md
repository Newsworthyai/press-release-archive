# 'A Flock Of Seagulls' Announce First New Music Since 1995 With Album 'Some Dreams'

LONDON, ENGLAND, December 13, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The band led by Mike Score continue to innovate and inspire. 'Some Dreams' features their signature synth sounds blended perfectly with driving guitars and high energy rhythms. With ten brand new songs Mike Score once again blaze a trail with well written, hooky, but serious pop music.  Lead single 'Some Dreams' of the same name was released in the Autumn setting the tone and with strong plaudits from fans and critics alike. Following up is arguably the strongest song on the album (and we reckon one of Mike Scores finest pieces of writing) the love forlorn 'Him'. The album features the big room synth anthems you would expect as well thoughtful works such as the moody 'Fool', the Japan like 'Time' and even the Beatles inspired 'Castles In The Sky'.  Mike Score and A Flock of Seagulls have just finished a North American tour and hit the road again for extensive dates from Spring onwards.  You can watch the music video for the first single here - www.youtube.com/@aFIockOfSeagulls youtu.be/WDlQkl-UMVs  History: A Flock Of Seagulls may well be known for their bizarrely teased haircuts as much as their hit single "I Ran". A Flock Of Seagulls were one of prime movers in the 80's new wave era. Growing out of the synth-heavy and ruthlessly stylish new romantic movement. Hairdresser Mike Score (lead vocals, keyboards) formed A Flock Of Seagulls with his brother Ali (drums) and fellow hairdresser Frank Maudsley (bass) in 1980, adding guitarist Paul Reynolds several months later. Their eponymous debut album appeared in the spring of 1982. "I Ran (So Far Away)" was released as the first single from the album, and MTV quickly picked up on its icily attractive video, which featured long shots of Mike Score and his distinctive, cascading hair. The single climbed into the American Top Ten, taking the album along with it. In the UK, "I Ran" didn't make the Top 40, but "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)" reached number ten later that year. Truly part of the fabric of the 80s their music and reference have featured in TV shows such as Friends, The Wedding Singer, La La Land and many more.
