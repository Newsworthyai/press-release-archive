# The Political Future of Iraq Under Trump: Insights from a Capitol Institute Seminar

WASHINGTON, DC, December 24, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Capitol Institute hosted a thought-provoking seminar on December 16, 2024, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., titled The Political Future of Iraq Under President-Elect Donald Trump's Administration. The event brought together experts and thought leaders to examine Iraq's challenges and opportunities in the context of a shifting global and regional political landscape.  The seminar, moderated by Maria Maalouf, a senior journalist and political analyst, provided a comprehensive analysis of Iraq's future under the incoming Trump administration. It explored critical topics, including the prospects for a sovereign and prosperous Iraq, strategies to stabilize the country, and the potential role of U.S.-Iraq relations in shaping the nation's trajectory.  The guest speaker, Professor AbdulNaser AlJanabi, is a prominent Iraqi politician, a former Iraqi Council of Representatives member, and the National Council of the Iraqi Opposition leader. AlJanabi delivered a detailed analysis of Iraq's current political and economic conditions, focusing on how the incoming administration might influence U.S.-Iraq relations. His speech touched upon themes of independence, justice, and the need for effective leadership to rebuild Iraq.  Iraq's history begins with the rule of Saddam Hussein, who served as Iraq's president from 1979 to 2003. Saddam was a leading figure in the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and held significant power during his regime. However, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 resulted in his removal from power. The instability that followed, including the rise of ISIS and a prolonged war to oust the group, left Iraq struggling for stability and security.  The speaker, AlJanabi, pointed out that Arab Sunnis represent 42% of Iraq's population, Kurdish Sunnis represent 13%, and Turkmen Sunnis represent 3%. This means that Sunnis in Iraq constitute 58% of the population, while Arab Shiites make up 38%, and our Christian brothers and other sects represent 4% of Iraq's population.  AlJanabi detailed the creation and mission of the National Council of Opposition, a coalition representing over 70 diverse groups, including nonprofits, civil society organizations, political factions, and associations. "A succession of all the Iraqi governments from the year 2003 up to the year 2014 are very corrupt," he said. "This is why we decided to convene the very first conference with the National Opposition of Iraq in Amman, Jordan, in 2014. It took us one year, in 2015, to establish the National Council of Opposition for Iraq."  He emphasized that the coalition aimed to form a unified front to address Iraq's challenges. "We believe the best solution for Iraq is to search and locate an Iraqi leadership that is sincere and committed to the welfare of Iraq, a diverse leader who represents all the Iraqis," he said.  AlJanabi said, "It's hard for people to enjoy stability and feel secure about the future." He also noted the continued impact of corruption and weak governance on the nation's progress.  Professor AlJanabi has called for the suspension of unjust execution sentences and the release of detainees through a general amnesty. There are 300,000 detainees, 20,000 detained women, and 35,000 individuals unjustly sentenced to death.  AlJanabi expressed optimism about building a stronger partnership with the incoming Trump administration. During a press conference at the seminar, he stated, "We aim to strike genuine deals and agreements between a patriotic, non-corrupt Iraqi government and the incoming American administration. We want in Iraq, a state under the rule of law and justice." He added, "Ninety percent of the Iraqi people fully recognize that the recent elections were corrupt and false."  AlJanabi emphasized the importance of Iraq's natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, and minerals, in driving economic development and reconstruction. "Our oil, our natural gas, our mineralsâ€”this is basically what could cause the development of Iraq," he noted. However, he also called for accountability from those who have misappropriated public funds, stressing that justice must be a cornerstone of Iraq's future.  Reconstruction and Stability Efforts:  The Iraqi politician extended an invitation to American corporations to contribute to Iraq's reconstruction and rebuilding. He proposed the establishment of a national salvation government to address Iraq's immediate and long-term challenges. Such a government, he argued, would not only protect Iraq's sovereignty but also promote regional stability and foster international cooperation.  "We are working to strike a long-term commitment and deal with the incoming President Trump administration," AlJanabi said. "We want accountability from people who have stolen the money that belongs to Iraqis and ruled all the Iraqis unjustly." He added that Iraq's stability requires partnerships that prioritize justice and development, noting, "We are calling for a national salvation government that can protect Iraq and also work with the international community for the stability of Iraq, the region, and the protection of dealing with Iraq."  In his speech before journalists, AlJanabi also called for preserving the unity of Iraq, its people, land, and sovereignty and for restoring its national independence to become a source of security, stability, and peace in the region. He advocated for drafting a new constitution for Iraq based on justice, citizenship, the preservation of resources, and the peaceful transfer of power, to be submitted for a referendum by the Iraqi people. Additionally, he called for establishing a national presidential system under which all Iraqis are equal in rights and duties and for allowing all Iraqis to engage in political activities.  The seminar underscored the complex challenges Iraq faces in achieving sovereignty, stability, and prosperity through a strategic vision and optimism for collaboration with the U.S. AlJanabi and the National Council of Opposition highlighted the pressing need for transparent governance, justice, and sustainable development.  The discussions marked a critical step in shaping the discourse on Iraq's political future under a new U.S. administration.
