LOS ANGELES, CA, October 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Guardians of Earth – Oona and the Luminous Beings (ISBN 978-2-89626-650-0, traditionally published by Ariane Books) by Oriane Livingston has been nominated for the Literary Titan Book Award. Both the book and the author have been earning critical acclaim for the creative storyline and mesmerizing writing. The Literary Titan Book Award is bestowed upon books that exemplify exceptional standards in the presentation of original content.  "I am greatly honored and humbled that The Guardians of Earth has been nominated for the Literary Titan Book Award," said Oriane Livingston. "This book is one that resonates as a clarion call to protect our Earth, and I am glad that its message of hope and beauty is being recognized by the literary world as is shown by this prestigious nomination."   The Guardians of Earth- Oona and the Luminous Beings is the first volume of a fantasy saga celebrating the beauty of the natural world. It is a love letter to Earth filled with epic adventures beyond imagination, bringing children and teenagers closer to the magic of Nature. The novel is more than just a fantasy story; it is a poetic message of hope for young readers and a call to action for the younger generation. At a time when our planet is in peril as never before, the book is both timely and critical. The author wrote the book to educate children on the need to protect the environment early in their lives. Livingston sees the next generation as the key to save the planet. The book invites children to become a true 'Guardian of Earth'.  It tells the story of Oona, an eleven-year-old girl who lives in a troubled household and feels very much alone. One night, her flower starts to speak to her, and she meets Eterna, a woman of extraordinary beauty who embodies the spirit of Earth. Eterna reveals to her that humans are slowly killing her, destroying trees, polluting oceans, and hunting animals to extinction. Oona learns that, along with Nawal and Aqiwo, her fellow Guardians, she must retrieve a sacred crystal to reconnect the filaments of light that once united humans' hearts with the Earth.  The Guardians of Earth- Oona and the Luminous Beings is one of the first (or one of the very few) times that Earth has ever been personified in a novel.
