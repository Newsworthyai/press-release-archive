# Gyeonggi Youth Gap Year: A 12-Week Journey of Ambition and Creativity

LOS ANGELES, CA October 12, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Gyeonggi Youth Gap Year project, a program that has ignited the passion of Korea's young innovators, will conclude on October 13th after a successful 12-week run. Organized by Gyeonggi Province, this large-scale initiative aimed to empower young people by offering them hands-on experiences in various fields and encouraging self-directed challenges.  The project opened its application process in April 2024, and after a rigorous interview period from June 10th to June 30th, 800 talented participants were selected. Since July 22nd and continuing until October 13th, these young innovators have been expressing their creativity in areas such as design, music, film, and IT. Throughout the program, they have actively showcased their talents locally and globally, embracing new challenges with enthusiasm.  One of the standout teams in the program is "Built-Up Neighborhood," a duo that reimagined the beauty of Gyeonggi Province through 3D graphics. Despite having no formal training in graphic design, the two team members took on the challenge of learning 3D graphic techniques to highlight the region's unique landscapes. Their passion and creativity culminated in a reimagined portrayal of familiar neighborhoods in Gyeonggi, which has garnered significant attention.  The team's notable achievements include their detailed 3D renderings of Bucheon, home to one of Korea's largest film festivals, and Suwon, a city known for its UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The team conducted thorough field research to capture the essence of these locations, translating their beauty into compelling visuals. Their depictions of Bucheon Art Bunker B39 and Bucheon Art Center have elevated Bucheon's image as a leading media city. Additionally, drawing inspiration from Bucheon's historical roots in "Boksagol Village," the team illustrated the city's blend of tradition and modernity through symbolic peach trees in full bloom.  In Suwon, the team recreated iconic landmarks such as Hwaseong Fortress's Hwahongmun Gate and Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion in stunning 3D detail. Their work captures the serene beauty and cultural richness of Suwon, bringing history to life through visual storytelling.  The Built-Up Neighborhood team shared, "We hope our work continues to raise awareness about the beauty of Gyeonggi Province and sparks greater public interest in 3D graphics." They also expressed their commitment to refining their craft, building on lessons learned during this project. Their work can be followed on their social media platforms (@9ong_deun, @calcu0922).  The Gyeonggi Youth Gap Year has provided participants with the opportunity to take on creative challenges and build meaningful connections within their communities. One participant reflected, "This experience allowed me to grow both personally and professionally, giving me the space to explore new opportunities during my career preparation."  The results of this year's Gap Year project will be featured on social media (@gong_deuniee) and in an online exhibition. Additionally, an offline exhibition will tour Gyeonggi Province starting in late October.
