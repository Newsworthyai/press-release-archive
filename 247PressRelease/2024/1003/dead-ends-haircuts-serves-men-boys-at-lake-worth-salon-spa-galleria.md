# "Dead Ends" Haircuts Serves Men & Boys at Lake Worth Salon & Spa Galleria

LAKE WORTH, TX, October 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With close to a decade of experience as a hairstylist, Jessica Kelly has long dedicated herself to ensuring that each client leaves "not only looking great but feeling great" as well. "My mission as a hairstylist is to have people feel like they're in a place of peace, in a calming environment. It's not just a haircut, it is an experience." With the opening of her new salon, Dead Ends, in the Lake Worth Salon & Spa Galleria on Boat Club Road, Jessica now has the ability to ensure just that.  When asked why she chose to become a hairstylist, Jessica said that she had been fascinated watching people cut hair since she was just a child. After attending the Toni & Guy Academy of Keller, she worked at a Great Clips salon for a few years, then moved to a Sport Clips and "unlocked a newfound passion for men's hair." She has been specializing in cuts for men and boys ever since.  Whether doing traditional haircuts, fades, beard detailing, scalp massage or other treatments, Jessica's goal is to provide outstanding service to each of her clients in a safe and welcoming space. She's known for her patience and soft touch, traits that are appreciated by clients with autism, sensory issues, or other special needs who all too often find the salon experience to be overwhelming. "I warmly welcome clients with special needs with understanding, patience, and care and would love the opportunity to have you in my chair. I also have an appreciation for our military and veterans, and as a thank you, I have discounted rates offered to you. I also acknowledge seniors (65+) at a discount as well."
