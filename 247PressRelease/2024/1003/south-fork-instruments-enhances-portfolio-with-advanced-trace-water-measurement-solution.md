# South Fork Instruments Enhances Portfolio with Advanced Trace Water Measurement Solution

AUBURN, CA, October 03, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- South Fork Instruments, a leading distributor of industrial measurement equipment, announces the addition of the Kemtrak NIR water analyzer to its product lineup. This advanced analyzer offers unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in trace water measurement for various industries, including fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and bioethanol production.  The Kemtrak NIR water analyzer utilizes Near Infra-Red (NIR) absorption technology to provide real-time, continuous measurement of water content in solvents. This innovative approach offers significant advantages over traditional methods such as Karl Fischer titration, including:  - Instantaneous, accurate measurements - No need for hazardous reagents or regular refilling - Continuous in-line use in chemical processes - Cost-effective and reliable operation  John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments, commented on the significance of this addition: "The Kemtrak NIR water analyzer redefines precision in trace water measurement. Its ability to provide real-time, continuous measurements without reagents addresses a critical need in industries where solvent purity is critical. This technology not only enhances product quality but also contributes to personnel safety, cost reduction, and improved process efficiency." The Kemtrak NIR water analyzer is available in two models:  1. NIR-H: Measures trace water (100 - 20,000 ppm) in the 1900 nm NIR region with a resolution of ±10 ppm 2. NIR-L: Measures water content (0.1 - 100%) in the 1440 nm region with a resolution of ±0.05%  Key features of the Kemtrak NIR water analyzer include:  - High-performance, long-life LED light technology for exceptional stability and consistency - Dual wavelength measurement to compensate for sample turbidity and window fouling - Factory calibration  - Optional validation accessory for performance verification without process interruption  The analyzer is particularly valuable for applications in:  - Chemical manufacturing, for precise water measurement in various industrial processes - Bioethanol production, where moisture levels critically affect fuel quality - Pharmaceutical manufacturing, ensuring solvent purity in API production  For more information about the Kemtrak NIR water analyzer or to request a consultation, please contact South Fork Instruments.
