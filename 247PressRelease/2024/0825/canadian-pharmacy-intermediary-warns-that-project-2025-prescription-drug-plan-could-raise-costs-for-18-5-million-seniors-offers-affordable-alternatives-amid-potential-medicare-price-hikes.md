# Canadian Pharmacy Intermediary Warns That Project 2025 Prescription Drug Plan Could Raise Costs for 18.5 Million Seniors, Offers Affordable Alternatives Amid Potential Medicare Price Hikes

VANCOUVER, BC, August 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SaveRxCanada.to, a trusted provider of affordable prescription medications, is voicing concern over the potential implications of Project 2025's proposed changes to Medicare's prescription drug plan. Recent analyses warn that these changes could increase drug costs for as many as 18.5 million seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries, leaving many struggling to afford their necessary medications. In response, SaveRxCanada.to reaffirms its commitment to helping those affected by rising healthcare expenses through access to safe, cost-effective medications from licensed Canadian and international pharmacies.  Understanding Project 2025 and Its Impact Project 2025, an initiative aimed at reforming Medicare, includes proposals that could limit access to lower-cost prescription drugs and reduce coverage options for millions of seniors. By introducing more restrictive formularies, negotiating deeper price cuts from manufacturers, and potentially shifting costs to consumers, experts estimate that up to 18.5 million people could see their out-of-pocket expenses rise. This is especially concerning for those managing chronic conditions who already face high prescription drug costs.  According to healthcare analysts, such changes could disproportionately impact low-income seniors and those who depend on multiple medications, forcing them to make difficult choices between their health and other basic needs.
