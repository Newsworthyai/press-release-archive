# Driving forward Drug Screening with CD BioSciences' C. elegans Pharyngeal Pumping Analysis Services

NEW YORK, NY, August 25, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CD BioSciences recently announced the release of its high-quality, cost-effective C. elegans pharyngeal pumping analysis services for drug screening. This innovative service leverages the power of the model organism C. elegans to provide reliable results for pharmaceutical companies seeking to accelerate their drug discovery process.  C. elegans is an excellent model organism for conducting toxicology studies and drug discovery due to its ability to score behaviors such as pharyngeal pumping visually. This behavior is controlled by environmental cues, activating sensory and neural signals to coordinate pharyngeal activity, making it a valuable biological test for screening chemical modulation.  With comprehensive expertise in C. elegans research, CD BioSciences can offer extensive experience in the pharyngeal pumping analysis of C. elegans. By monitoring and analyzing changes in pharyngeal pumping patterns, the company helps researchers quickly and effectively screen potential drug candidates for efficacy and toxicity. In addition to C. elegans pharyngeal pumping analysis, CD BioSciences can also achieve drug screening based on its Drosophila in vivo screening platform that integrates services such as model building, phenotypic data collection and screens, and pathway prediction coming with productive products including recombinant drosophila proteins, antibodies, media, and many more.  "We have flexible, rapid, and cost-effective drug screening analysis services and products to help our clients identify new potentially effective compounds and novel targets," said a spokesperson for CD BioSciences. "By leveraging our unique capabilities of C. elegans and Drosophila, we can provide valuable insights into the effects of potential drug candidates, helping our clients make informed decisions and accelerate the drug discovery process."  CD BioSciences' team of experts is dedicated to providing comprehensive drug screening services and related products, utilizing cutting-edge techniques to ensure accurate and reproducible results. With a track record of success in helping pharmaceutical companies optimize their drug discovery projects, CD BioSciences is poised to drive the industry forward with its innovative approach to drug screening.  About CD BioSciences CD BioSciences is a leading provider of research services in the life sciences industry.
