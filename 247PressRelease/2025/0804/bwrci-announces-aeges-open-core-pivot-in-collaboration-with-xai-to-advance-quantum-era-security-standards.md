# BWRCI Announces AEGES Open-Core Pivot in Collaboration with xAI to Advance Quantum-Era Security Standards

CHICAGO, IL, August 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BWRCI today announces that AEGES, AI-Enhanced Guardian for Economic Stability, is transitioning to an open-core model, revolutionizing quantum-resistant economic security with community-driven innovation. This pivot enhances the accessibility of AEGES's AI Behavior Evaluation Engine (ABEE), detailed in its preprint (v1, August 7, 2025), which introduces tamper-evident oversight for national infrastructure protection.  We are thrilled to collaborate with xAI, whose Grok 3 AI platform—accessible via grok.com and its iOS/Android apps—is providing developer access to prototype ABEE's real-time fraud detection capabilities. This partnership underscores AEGES's commitment to open-source extensibility, with a development call scheduled next week to explore further integrations. The open-core framework, complemented by the QSAFP repo for AI safety governance, positions AEGES for global standards adoption.  To accelerate adoption, AEGES and QSAFP Integration Kits are now live on GitHub, offering pre-built modules and sandbox-ready payloads that let developers create working demos in minutes—what used to take hours or days. These plug-and-play kits dramatically reduce setup time, enabling rapid prototyping of quantum-resilient oversight and AI risk evaluation tools across a variety of environments.  AEGES Integration Kit – GitHub: https://github.com/AEGES-OPEN-CORE/AEGES/tree/main/integration-kits  QSAFP Integration Kit – GitHub: https://github.com/QSAFP-Core/qsafp-open-core/QSAFP/tree/main/integration-kits  Global Developer Invitation (Inclusion + momentum-building + call to action)  With the open-core pivot, AEGES invites developers, researchers, and institutional stakeholders to join the mission: contribute to GitHub, extend the ABEE sandbox, or co-design governance plugins via the QSAFP framework. By building together, we can accelerate the transition to a globally trusted, tamper-evident AI safety infrastructure.  "To facilitate faster mass adoption of tokenization and fractionalization of digital assets, AEGES and QSAFP had to support by going open-core," said Max Davis, the designer of both systems.  About AEGES AEGES (AI Enhanced Guardian for Economic Stability) is a quantum-resistant security system designed to detect and deter digital fraud through tamper-evident tracing and immutable oversight. Its AI Behavior Evaluation Engine (ABEE) leverages real-time analysis to protect national and enterprise infrastructure.
