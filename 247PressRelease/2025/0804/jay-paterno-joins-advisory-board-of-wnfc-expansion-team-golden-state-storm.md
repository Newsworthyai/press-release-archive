"I've seen firsthand how football fosters leadership, community, and confidence. This isn't just about expanding access, it's about ensuring that women athletes have the same level of platform, investment, and respect as their male counterparts."  Paterno also emphasized the global relevance of the Storm's mission:  "With flag football making its Olympic debut in Los Angeles in 2028, the WNFC is uniquely positioned to serve as a pipeline for future Olympians while continuing to lead as the premier women's tackle football league in the world. The Golden State Storm is building something innovative and lasting, and I'm thrilled to support that vision."  The Storm joins a national movement powered by the WNFC, one of the fastest-growing sports leagues in America, with over 1,000 athletes and global brand sponsors such as adidas, Riddell, and Dove.
