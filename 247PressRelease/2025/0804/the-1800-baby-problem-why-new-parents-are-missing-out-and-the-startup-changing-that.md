# The $1,800 Baby Problem: Why New Parents Are Missing Out - and the startup Changing That

LONDON, ENGLAND, August 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "I had an emergency C-section. I could barely walk, I was overwhelmed, and we couldn't justify spending on the shoot. But I wanted classic style newborn pictures of my baby."  - Chloe Porter, first-time mum, Texas  The Problem:   Newborn photoshoots are seeing popularity surge across the USA. However, while 80% of new parents want professional pictures, recent polling has found that only 4% can afford them (1), with traditional spend, including prints, averaging $1,800 (2).   Newborn photoshoots are highly prized but inaccessible due to cost, post-partum recovery and a lack of parental time.  The Solution:  TinyTography, a London, UK based startup, offers an alternative for those who aren't able to access traditional photography. The team use AI tech to transform everyday home baby pictures into a beautiful studio style photoshoot.  With prices starting from just $7 a picture, the portraits complement home photos with gorgeous keepsake images. Parents can choose from a tasteful, broad range of style options, upload regular photos from home, and receive high-resolution digital portraits ready to print or share.   Parents have welcomed the low price tag - from $89 for an 8 photo pack - as well as the flexibility to do their photos when it suits mum and baby.   How TinyTography solves the problems for new parents:  - High quality, affordable digital photoshoots - With low prices from $7 a picture  - Done from home in five minutes - With no need to travel   - Wide style availability - The team have carefully curated the most popular styles for the discerning modern parent  - Available anytime No need for fitting in a booking, enabling parents to enjoy more precious moments of home time  Built by parents, for parents  "We are delighted to see so many people happy with their pictures," says CEO Daniel Borgenicht: "We built this for families like ours - people who want something special, but without all the cost or pressure."  Since launch, TinyTography has been embraced by a growing community of delighted families. Customers have been excited to share their pictures, leaving the company five-star reviews on Trustpilot.   More information about the challenges around access to newborn photography  65% of consumers cite cost and constrained budgets as the reason for holding off on photography (3).  Add in the challenges of postpartum recovery with limited paid time off and travelling to a photography studio to keep an appointment can be impractical or challenging.   This leads some parents to miss out altogether on beautifully capturing those early days.   The rising number of mothers having a Cesarean section delivery - up from to 32.4% in 2024 (4), from 7.6% in 1976. With approximately one in five of new mothers suffering post partum emotional difficulty and three quarters of private sector workers having no access to paid family leave (5), the challenge has never been starker - all in an environment where today's new parents are also navigating a modern parenting culture shaped by social media, where picture-perfect memories are expected.  Additionally, some babies just don't take well to the studio, with crying and feeds sometimes getting in the way of successful sessions.
