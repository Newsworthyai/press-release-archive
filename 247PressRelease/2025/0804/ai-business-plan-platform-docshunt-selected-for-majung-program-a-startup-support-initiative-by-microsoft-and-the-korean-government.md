# AI Business Plan Platform 'DocsHunt' Selected for 'Majung Program,' a Startup Support Initiative by Microsoft and the Korean Government

SEATTLE, WA, August 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sapere Aude Inc. (CEO Kim Sung-woo), the startup behind the AI business plan SaaS DocsHunt, announced today that it has been selected for the 2025 Majung Program.  The 2025 Global Enterprise Collaboration Program is an initiative by the Korean Ministry of SMEs and Startups that supports the global innovative growth of startups through partnerships with major global companies. The Majung Program is a sub-program conducted in collaboration with Microsoft Korea. Through this initiative, Microsoft Korea provides support for the technical advancement and business growth of B2B solution companies by leveraging its cloud infrastructure and AI/machine learning expertise.  Through this selection, Sapere Aude Inc. will receive up to approximately $150,000 USD in commercialization funding, along with Microsoft Azure credits, expert technical training, and support for global marketing and sales channels. This marks a significant milestone in advancing DocsHunt's technology and preparing for its entry into the North American market.  DocsHunt is a service that enables users to automatically generate and structure a complete business plan—including market analysis and financial projections—by either inputting ideas directly or uploading existing documents such as business plans and financial statements. Users can edit not only the text but also the AI-generated professional charts and diagrams directly within the web-based editor. Notably, the AI Copilot feature for each section enhances document quality by offering improvement suggestions, much like a professional consultant would.  A standout feature of the platform is its ability to instantly reformat the completed content to fit any custom Microsoft Word (.docx) template provided by the user. This functionality is expected to fundamentally solve the long-standing pain point of tedious document formatting for businesses.  "Founders and professionals spend an excessive amount of time on non-essential work like reformatting documents and rewriting repetitive content—rather than focusing on what truly matters: strategy and growth," said Kim Sung-woo, CEO of Sapere Aude Inc.  He continued, "DocsHunt's mission is to eliminate this chronic inefficiency through AI, empowering startups and growing companies to focus on their core priorities. The support we'll receive through the Majung Program will be a powerful launchpad for expanding our mission beyond Korea and into the North American market. Following our domestic launch in August, we intend to demonstrate DocsHunt's value to the global stage starting this September."  Selection for the Majung Program highlights DocsHunt's technical excellence and market potential, and serves as a strong signal of its anticipated growth in the document automation SaaS market.
