# Following Texas Disaster, Convex Insurance Urges U.S. Homeowners to Protect Their Homes with Affordable Flood Insurance

BOYNTON BEACH, FL, August 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the wake of devastating floods that displaced thousands across Texas, Convex Insurance is taking a proactive stance by encouraging U.S. homeowners to secure affordable flood insurance coverage before hurricane season reaches its peak. With climate-related events on the rise, the company warns that standard homeowners insurance policies typically do not cover flooding—leaving many families vulnerable to financial catastrophe.  "Texas is a sobering reminder of how quickly water can destroy everything," said Judith Figareau, Licensed Insurance Agent at Convex Insurance. "We're urging homeowners across the country, even those outside designated flood zones, to act now before it's too late. Floods don't discriminate, and neither should your coverage."  Who Should Consider Flood Insurance? - Residents near canals, lakes, or coastal zones - Homeowners in low-lying or high-rainfall regions - Condo associations, landlords, and rental property owners - Anyone whose current homeowners insurance excludes flood damage  How Can Convex Insurance LLC Help You with Flood Protection? - Competitive rates and flexible coverage options - Coverage available for homes, condos, and rental properties - 30-day waiting period enforced by FEMA—early action is critical - Fast claims processing and personalized local support - Multilingual assistance in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole  Top 10 U.S. States Most Affected by Flooding Flood risks are not limited to coastal areas. According to FEMA and historical data, the following U.S. states experience the most frequent and severe flooding:  1. Florida – Hurricanes, coastal surge, and flat terrain 2. Texas – Gulf Coast storms, flash floods, and major rivers 3. Louisiana – Below sea level, hurricanes, and levee vulnerability 4. Mississippi – River floods and heavy rains 5.
