# Legend of the Track: 2011 Honda Dallara IR-05 IndyCar Joins DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, August 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Racing history takes center stage at the DFW Car & Toy Museum with the arrival of the 2011 Honda Dallara IR-05, a blue and silver marvel that once tore down the track during the final season of the legendary Newman/Haas Racing team. This specific chassis is believed to have competed in the final Indy Japan 300 at Twin Ring Motegi, where driver James Hinchcliffe qualified fifth and completed the race in 15th position — a symbolic final bow for one of the most iconic teams in IndyCar history.  Now on display without its engine or running gear, this car offers enthusiasts a rare glimpse at an authentic piece of open-wheel racing history. The preserved shell stands as a high-performance sculpture, capturing the sleek lines and aerodynamic artistry that defined its generation.  "You don't have to hear the roar of the engine to feel the power of this car's legacy," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "This Honda Dallara IR-05 tells a story of speed, innovation, and the bittersweet end of a racing era. It's more than a car—it's a piece of motorsport soul."  Newman/Haas Racing, co-founded by actor Paul Newman and racing entrepreneur Carl Haas, left an indelible mark on IndyCar with decades of competitive excellence. This 2011 chassis represents their final season, making its presence in the museum a significant nod to the past and a thrilling highlight for visitors.  The DFW Car & Toy Museum continues to offer unforgettable encounters with rare vehicles, legendary collectibles, and one-of-a-kind artifacts that span automotive, pop culture, and design history.
