# Colorado Rural Health Center Celebrates Safety Net Clinic Week in Naturita

NATURITA, CO, August 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Colorado Rural Health Center (CRHC) celebrated the annual Safety Net Clinic Week (August 17-23, 2025) with a luncheon honoring Basin Clinic in Naturita, Colorado today. CRHC provided lunch for clinic staff, community members, and local leaders, who read a proclamation signed by Governor Jared Polis, which highlights the importance of Colorado's rural safety net clinics.   "Safety net clinics are essential points of access for healthcare services in rural communities across the state. In today's environment especially, the importance of quality care that is accessible to those who are uninsured, underinsured, or insured through public programs cannot be understated," said CRHC CEO Michelle Mills. "CRHC hosts Safety Net Clinic Week (SNCW) each year to educate policymakers, healthcare advocates, and community leaders on the necessity of keeping our safety net intact and thriving."  Even though supplemental federal funding is unavailable to them, safety net clinics provide essential healthcare services to rural and underserved populations. While safety net clinics are diverse in their business and practice models, they are comparable in their commitment to providing healthcare services to people in need. They continuously deliver valuable care to their communities despite limited funding to support general operations, workforce challenges, growing reporting and accountability requirements, and changing payment and delivery models.   This year, CRHC hosted a celebratory luncheon for a safety net clinic, local leadership, community members, funders, providers, and other healthcare partners in Naturita on August 20th. CRHC chose to honor Basin Clinic for their dedicated service to rural Montrose County, and in light of their recent recognition as a CRHC Top 10 Rural Healthcare Facility for Overall Performance. https://coruralhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CRHC-Top-facility-press-release-FINAL.pdf  "The efforts of Basin Clinic and other clinics like it often go unrecognized," said Mills. "Showcasing the important work done by our members is what the week was all about. Happy Safety Net Clinic Week!"  "The Basin Clinic is honored to have been chosen as the featured clinic for Safety Net Clinic Week. Our team has been working hard to meet our Mission to provide exceptional, compassionate healthcare. Like all clinics, we do the best we can with the limited resources and dedicated team members to provide healthcare to our communities. Thank you, Colorado Rural Health Center, for your work and dedication to advocate for our clinics," said Christina Pierce, Executive Director at Basin Clinic.  Basin Clinic is a perfect example of a truly necessary piece of the safety net in rural Colorado.  "Speaking as a patient, my life was saved because Basin is where it is. If I had had to be transported 25 miles away, to another town, I would never have survived. That is the case for many of our residents, and for quite a few, the trip to another town for medical care is not even possible," said Basin Clinic Board President Chris Daniels. "The care delivered by Basin's medical staff, and the professionalism from all those who work there in every capacity, is what makes Basin the clinic of choice. The entire team – from Executive Director to clinical staff to administrative personnel to custodial and maintenance – have one goal: to provide the best healthcare possible. That is why I am so proud of Basin Clinic."   Governor Polis also signed a declaration proclaiming August 17-23, 2025 as Safety Net Clinic Week in the state of Colorado. According to the proclamation, "rural primary care safety net clinics, including designated Rural Health Clinics, make exceptional contributions to the health and well-being of Coloradans."   "We express our gratitude to these clinics who dedicate their time, energy, and resources to serving their communities," the proclamation continued.
