# Creative Biogene's Expanded Antibody Purification Platform Provides Support for Biotechnology Innovation

NEW YORK, NY, August 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Creative Biogene's expanded antibody purification platform provides a streamlined purification workflow for producing high-yield, high-purity antibodies from scalable and customizable protocols. The platform, which refines antibody purification strategies from various expression sources, is available for companies and research institutions to aid in the growing need for consistent and efficient antibody preparations. Creative Biogene's expanded purification platform shows the company's commitment to empowering biotechnology research with high-quality, accessible technology.  The platform features a robust purification workflow, which incorporates capture, intermediate, and polishing steps. Protein A/G/L resins are utilized for Fc-binding antibodies, while ion exchange chromatography is available for charge-based purification and size exclusion chromatography for removing aggregates, ensuring final antibody purity of greater than 95%. The platform also features orthogonal and complementary processes, such as hydrophobic interaction chromatography, multimodal, and buffer exchange. Complementary quality control services include SDS-PAGE, SEC-HPLC, and endotoxin testing, with results delivered in a Certificate of Analysis report.  A comprehensive range of equipment supports the platform. Chromatography columns are compact and easy to operate, and process chromatography systems are available at laboratory and pilot scales, allowing customizable system design. Buffer dilution and conditioning systems enable precise formulation while reducing resource use. Filtration systems, including tangential flow, depth filtration, and single-use options, ensure fast turnaround between runs. Together, these assets provide a complete and flexible solution for antibody purification.  The platform is poised for use in a variety of biotechnology applications. Antibody materials can be used as part of antibody candidate development programs, assay optimization, or production of kit components, and as research reagents. "The evaluation of the platform clearly indicated that its main value comes from the well-balanced throughput and reproducibility," said Marcia Brady's Chief Expert. "The platform has been optimized to provide consistent results across various scales and antibody targets, allowing researchers to streamline their work."  Creative Biogene is also looking ahead to continue improving the system with more automation features and increased scalability. Through future integration and the continued refinement of purification protocols and scalable design, Creative Biogene will continue to provide comprehensive solutions for current and future research needs.
