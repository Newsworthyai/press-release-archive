# Translate, Summarize, Present: AI-Powered Tools That Make Strategy Effortless

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, August 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In today's fast-paced innovation landscape, speed and clarity are critical. That's why entrapeer has launched a powerful suite of new tools designed to help enterprise users translate research into action—literally. With the rollout of Research Summaries, Presentation Generator, and enhanced translation capabilities, the platform now makes it easier than ever to distill insights, align stakeholders, and collaborate across borders.  Traditionally, entrapeer users could translate curated content such as use cases and reports.

This expansion ensures globally distributed teams can collaborate in their native language without compromising clarity or accuracy.  For teams pressed for time, the new Research Summaries feature provides executive-ready overviews that capture the key takeaways from deep-dive reports. Whether validating a tech trend or comparing emerging startups, users no longer need to wade through dozens of pages to surface what's relevant. Reese, entrapeer's AI-powered research manager, distills what matters most based on user focus areas, delivering streamlined insights with strategic impact.  And when it's time to share those insights? Entrapeer now does the heavy lifting. With the new Presentation Generator, Reese can transform summaries into clean, audience-ready slide decks. Whether briefing leadership or aligning across business units, users can present compelling, customized findings in minutes—not hours.  Together, these new features reflect entrapeer's commitment to making innovation more accessible, actionable, and global.
