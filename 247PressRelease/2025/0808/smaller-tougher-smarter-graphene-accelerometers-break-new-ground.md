# Smaller, tougher, smarter: graphene accelerometers break new ground

KNOXVILLE, TN, August 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Researchers have developed a new type of nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) accelerometer using fully clamped, double-layer graphene membranes with attached silicon proof masses. By narrowing the trench width to just 1 μm, they significantly improved device yield, mechanical robustness, and operational lifespan, while maintaining high sensitivity. Their results show that both trench width and proof mass geometry critically impact sensor performance, offering clear design guidance for optimizing next-generation graphene-based sensors. This breakthrough opens the door for highly integrated, ultra-small accelerometers in applications ranging from wearable electronics to medical robotics and precision instrumentation.  Graphene's exceptional mechanical and electrical properties have made it a highly promising material for nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) devices. While suspended graphene structures have been explored in pressure sensors and resonators, their application in accelerometers remains limited. A key challenge has been integrating atomically thin graphene with a proof mass to form spring–mass sensing structures without sacrificing device yield or robustness. Previous designs using 2–4 μm wide trenches often faced fabrication and durability issues, constraining their practical utility. Based on these challenges, there is a pressing need to develop scalable, durable, and highly sensitive graphene-based accelerometers through structural optimization and microfabrication innovation.  A research team from the Beijing Institute of Technology and North University of China has unveiled a high-performance NEMS accelerometer based on double-layer graphene membranes with integrated SiO₂/Si proof masses. Published (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00969-5) in Microsystems & Nanoengineering on May 28, 2025, the study presents an innovative design that uses ultra-narrow 1 μm trenches to suspend graphene membranes. The team's results demonstrate improved mechanical robustness, electrical performance, and device yield, offering a scalable solution for miniaturized, high-sensitivity acceleration sensing.  The proposed NEMS accelerometer utilizes a fully clamped double-layer graphene membrane structure, suspended over 1 μm wide trenches with a SiO₂/Si proof mass attached. This design enhances the mechanical robustness by reducing grain boundary defects and improves the manufacturing yield to 90%, surpassing previous models with wider trenches. Three devices with varying trench widths and proof mass sizes were tested under accelerations up to 2 g at 160 Hz. The smaller proof mass yielded the higher responsivity, while wider trenches produced stronger signals but compromised stability.  Finite element analysis (FEA) and AFM indentation showed that the graphene structures could endure extreme forces (equivalent to 100,000 g) without failure. Long-term tests confirmed the electrical stability of the devices even after six months, supporting their use in durable and reliable applications. The fabrication process, fully compatible with semiconductor technologies, includes thermal oxidation, trench etching, double-layer graphene transfer, and sacrificial layer removal. Importantly, these findings demonstrate a critical trade-off between trench width, proof mass size, and overall sensor performance, paving the way for tailored graphene NEMS designs.  "Our study shows that optimizing graphene membrane structure and suspension geometry can lead to substantial improvements in sensor reliability and yield," said Prof. Xuge Fan, corresponding author of the study. "The one-micron trench width not only ensures structural integrity but also supports scalable manufacturing for real-world applications. These graphene-based accelerometers could be game-changers in next-generation wearable, biomedical, and aerospace systems where size, sensitivity, and durability are paramount."  These graphene NEMS accelerometers offer a promising platform for miniaturized sensing technologies in wearable devices, biomedical implants, and precision robotics. Their compact form factor, high sensitivity, and manufacturing compatibility make them ideal for integration into Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart medical systems. The scalable fabrication approach also enables mass production with high yield, reducing costs and enhancing accessibility. Future research will explore integrating these sensors with wireless communication systems, multi-axis detection, and smart signal processing to further expand their utility in high-performance and low-power sensing applications.
