# 2001 Isuzu VehiCROSS Roars Into DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, August 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to announce the addition of a truly distinctive and bold vehicle to its growing collection: the 2001 Isuzu VehiCROSS. Known for its futuristic styling and rugged off-road capabilities, the VehiCROSS is a cult favorite among automotive enthusiasts — and visitors can now get up close to one of these rare machines at the museum.  Powered by a 3.5-liter DOHC V6 engine producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, this 2001 VehiCROSS channels its power through a four-speed automatic transmission and an advanced Torque on Demand all-wheel-drive system with a dual-range transfer case. Originally engineered to conquer both urban streets and rugged trails, this SUV remains a testament to innovative Japanese automotive design of the early 2000s.  The vehicle, part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, is loaded with amenities: automatic climate control, cruise control, and a factory cassette stereo with an in-dash CD changer — perfect for transporting visitors back to the era when this SUV first turned heads. The unique instrumentation includes a 125-mph speedometer, tachometer, and a visual display for the Borg-Warner Torque on Demand system.  This particular example shows 157,000 miles on the odometer — a testament to the durability and adventure-ready spirit of the VehiCROSS.  "The Isuzu VehiCROSS is one of those rare vehicles that makes a statement the moment you see it," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "Its combination of aggressive styling, off-road prowess, and limited production numbers make it a perfect addition to our collection — and an absolute must-see for SUV fans and design lovers alike."  Produced in limited numbers, the Isuzu VehiCROSS has gained legendary status among collectors and off-road communities. Its unmistakable exterior, with muscular fender flares and cladding, contrasts with a surprisingly refined driving experience.  The DFW Car & Toy Museum invites visitors to explore this exciting addition, alongside more than 200 cars and thousands of toys and collectibles — making it one of the most unique free attractions in Texas.
