The expanded hardware selection includes stainless steel components designed for long-term outdoor use and resistance to weather conditions.  The SS Wrap Around Hinge line features bearings and removable clevis pins that allow gates to swing 180 degrees smoothly. These hinges wrap completely around gate posts and attach directly to gate frames for secure mounting. The stainless steel construction resists rust and corrosion, making these hinges suitable for driveways, yards, and commercial properties.  Bear Hold Chain Link Fence Stretchers provide professional-grade tools for installing and repairing chain link fencing without sagging or uneven tension. The five-piece sets grip chain link fabric securely, allowing installers to achieve uniform stretching across fence sections. These stretchers reduce installation time and improve finished fence appearance, particularly beneficial for single workers or small crews.  Drop rods secure double gates in place, preventing movement and providing additional security for driveways and commercial entrances. The residential drop rods feature stainless steel or mild steel construction in various lengths from 24 to 48 inches. Each drop rod includes mounting hangers and lockable guides that accommodate standard 5/16 inch padlocks for added security.  "Our commitment to high-quality U.S. manufacturing and excellent customer service drives our expanded fence hardware offerings," said a company representative. "These American-made products combine innovative design with durable materials, ensuring prompt shipping and reliable performance for every fencing project."  The expanded product line addresses common fencing challenges, including gate alignment issues, chain link tension problems, and double gate security concerns. Professional contractors can purchase these products wholesale directly from Modern Fence Technologies, while DIY customers can request them through authorized retailers.  Modern Fence Technologies manufactures all hinges, drop rods, and hardware components in the United States using American steel and stainless steel. The company applies powder coating in black or white finishes to many products for enhanced weather resistance.
