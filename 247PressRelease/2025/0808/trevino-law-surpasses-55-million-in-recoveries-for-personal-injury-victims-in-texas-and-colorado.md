# Treviño Law Surpasses $55 Million in Recoveries for Personal Injury Victims in Texas and Colorado

DENVER, CO, August 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Treviño Law announces a significant milestone, having secured over $55 million in settlements and verdicts for injured clients. Led by Jaime Treviño, the firm leverages insider knowledge from years defending insurance companies to now advocate fiercely for victims of negligence in cases ranging from 18-wheeler accidents to wrongful death claims. With offices in Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, Treviño Law continues its mission to level the playing field against corporations and ensure fair compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and suffering.  A Legacy of Advocacy and Results - With decades of experience in personal injury litigation, Treviño Law has achieved remarkable outcomes, including a $13 million settlement for a construction accident involving devastating head, neck, and back injuries from a 16-foot fall due to lack of safety equipment. Other notable results include an $8.5 million recovery for a family rear-ended by a delivery vehicle, uncovering negligent hiring and drug use by the driver; a $6.3 million settlement for a catastrophic trucking collision on Highway 290; and a $3 million resolution for a DWI victim initially offered only $75,000, exposing a drug ring and negligent entrustment. These successes highlight the firm's dedication to thorough investigations, countering insurance tactics, and maximizing compensation for clients facing life-altering injuries.  The firm specializes in complex cases such as traumatic brain injuries, commercial vehicle accidents, and medical malpractice.  From Defense to Dedicated Advocacy - Jaime Treviño's journey began with a pivotal case in Bastrop, Texas, where a defense victory left him questioning the pursuit of justice. This experience prompted a shift to representing the injured, using his understanding of corporate strategies to build strong cases. As a graduate of the University of Texas Law School, Jaime brings strategic insight and compassion to every client, ensuring their stories are heard against powerful opponents.  The firm stands out through its transition from defense work, allowing anticipation of opponent moves and aggressive pursuit of accountability.
