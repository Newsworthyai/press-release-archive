# John Crone Releases Second Edition of Tax-Free at Last

HUMBLE, TX, August 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renowned author and financial thought leader John Crone is proud to announce the release of the Second Edition of Tax-Free at Last, a provocative and timely exploration of the flaws within America's federal tax system and a compelling call for nationwide reform.  Far from being a guide to personal tax savings, Tax-Free at Last pulls back the curtain on the inefficiencies, complexities, and inequities baked into the current U.S. tax code. In this updated edition, Crone offers bold proposals for simplifying the system, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and ensuring a more equitable and solvent financial future for all Americans.  "The tax code as it stands is broken," Crone states. "It's costly, confusing, and unsustainable. This book challenges taxpayers to demand change not just for themselves, but for future generations."  Key Themes in Tax-Free at Last – Second Edition:  A Deep Dive into the Current Tax Code: Clear explanations of how convoluted and outdated tax laws are costing taxpayers and the government billions in time and money.  Reform Recommendations: Proposals to eliminate or greatly simplify large tax law sections, making the system more transparent and manageable.  Policy Solutions for Entitlement Programs: Insightful analysis of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid with formulas and investment strategies that could restore their long-term viability.  Economic Justice: Suggestions for tax provisions that would eliminate federal income taxes for more than 75% of Americans — 120 million returns eliminated out of 160 million filed in 2022, promoting fairness and accessibility.  A Call to Action: Encouragement for citizens to engage with their elected representatives and push for meaningful, generational reforms to the tax system. Crone emphasizes that tax fairness and government efficiency are not partisan goals. They are American priorities. The book is a critique and a toolkit for advocacy, offering data-driven arguments, ratios, and projections that illustrate a clear path toward federal financial sustainability.  Already gaining attention from policy thinkers and financial professionals, Tax-Free at Last – Second Edition is being hailed as a "must-read manifesto" for anyone frustrated by the status quo and eager to participate in meaningful reform.  "This is a movement, not a manual," Crone adds. "The real power lies with the people. Together, we can demand a tax system that works for everyone."  Tax-Free at Last – Second Edition is available online and in select bookstores nationwide.
