# Acclaimed Writer Xue Mo Speaks at the 2025 London Book Fair-Lighting the Inner Lamp to Break Bottlenecks in Publishing in the AI Era

NEW YORK, NY, March 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- At the just conclued 2025 London Book Fair, Acclaimed author Xue Mo addressed the seismic impact of artificial intelligence on publishing and human existence at Tech Theatre. The prolific writer, whose nearly 100 works have been translated into over 30 languages, argued that "mastering one's inner world" matters more than chasing technological trends. "We can't dispel the darkness," he stated, "but we can ignite our own inner lamp—that is the key to navigating change."  Eastern Wisdom in the Face of AI Anxiety During a seminar, Xue Mo used his novella Wolf Disaster at Pig's Belly Well and his philosophical work The Mind and the Heart to explore humanity's dilemmas in a tech-driven world. "As unemployment and existential dread rise, we must ask: what can AI never replace?" He answered: the sovereignty of the human heart. "We can't control global change, but how we perceive the world shapes what it becomes."  His view resonated with publishing professionals present at the event. Professor Chang Xiangqun, Editor-in-Chief of Global Century Press, cited the innovative bilingual layout of The Mind and the Heart as an example of how technology can empower traditional Chinese culture. By standardizing punctuation, name translations, and adding bilingual appendices, the book has made the intricate ideas of Eastern philosophy more accessible to international readers and has been included in research projects at institutions such as Cambridge. "Standardization and creativity are equally important," Chang emphasized.  Technology: Ally or Adversary? Mengdi Turbutt Cai, Publishing Director of Paths International Ltd., acknowledged AI's efficiency but pointed out that Wolf Disaster proves "cultural depth cannot be replicated by algorithms." "AI lacks the emotional spark of human storytelling," she noted. "It's our responsibility as publishers to protect this uniqueness."  Meanwhile, Paths' Marketing Director, Mohammed Urma, warned of growing monopolization and digital rights disputes. "Breaking into Western markets today is harder than it was 30 years ago," he observed. "Tech giants demanding digital rights to train AI may signal a new wave of digital colonialism."  Cultivating the Mind as the Path Forward In his closing remarks, Xue Mo compared the AI era to "the dissolution of centralized discourse power." He argued that "as technology unlocks infinite possibilities, humanity must cultivate a richer inner world to embrace diversity." Citing The Mind and the Heart's central idea—that the world is a projection of the mind—he urged publishers to "use change as a tool for growth" and "become torchbearers, not captives of fear."  Xue Mo's works, recognized for their universal themes and translations by leading sinologists, have become a model for Chinese literature's global reach. His novels, including Desert Rites and Curses of the Kingdom of Xixia, have gained traction in both academic and mainstream markets worldwide. The consensus among Chinese and British publishers suggests a clear direction: in a tech-driven world, the depth of human experience remains the most valuable and irreplaceable asset.
