# Shincheonji Church of Jesus: The Only Church in the World to Master the Book of Revelation

NEW YORK, NY, April 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There is a church where all members master the Book of Revelation: Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. Before joining the church, all members study the Bible through the Zion Christian Mission Center, known worldwide for hosting four graduation ceremonies with over 100,000 graduating students.   Shincheonji Church members take Bible exams every week centered around the prophecies of the four gospels and the Book of Revelation. Shincheonji Church explains that the exams help members to engrave the word of God upon their hearts and keep the new covenant established by Jesus.  The average score for members who took the Bible exams from January to April 2025 was 99, with a participation rate of 97%. A total of 99.9% of the exam takers had scores above 90.  Despite ongoing controversy regarding claims that label the church as a cult, former pastors who have joined Shincheonji Church unanimously testify that "Shincheonji Church of Jesus is a church that teaches and practices the words according to the Bible." Therefore, they are saying that we should not just criticize them, but evaluate Shincheonji Church of Jesus using the Bible as the standard.  "In Christianity, Shincheonji is called a cult, but when I actually came here, I realized that there is no church that practices the Bible as much as this one," said Pastor Kim. "Shincheonji makes people master the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, so the level of Bible knowledge of the congregation is higher than mine, the pastor. I am throwing away everything I knew before and starting my faith again."   Pastor Gwang-seon Choi said, "I taught the Bible as a pastor, but after coming to Shincheonji Church of Jesus, I realized how ignorant I was. The religious community should not only slander Shincheonji, but also give their congregations a chance to hear and judge for themselves." The pastor added, "It is dereliction of duty for the church to not teach the Bible properly. Christian leaders should listen to the words first so that everyone on earth can know God's final work."
