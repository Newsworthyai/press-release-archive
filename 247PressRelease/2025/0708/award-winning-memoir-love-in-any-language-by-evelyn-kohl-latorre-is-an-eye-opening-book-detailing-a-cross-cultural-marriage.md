# Award-Winning Memoir, Love In Any Language By Evelyn Kohl LaTorre, Is An Eye-Opening Book Detailing A Cross-Cultural Marriage

WILMINGTON, NC, July 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 'Love in Any Language, a Memoir of a Cross-Cultural Marriage', offers readers a refreshing counterpoint to the grim narratives dominating today's immigration headlines. In her book, LaTorre invites us to explore the vibrant, hopeful side of marrying someone from another country. She offers a compelling story of a journey that transcends borders and languages and crafts a story that presents the beauty that can emerge from the complexities of cross-cultural love and marriage.  Love is tested when Evelyn falls in love with Antonio, a handsome university student. At the end of her two-year Peace Corps commitment in Peru, Evelyn finds herself pregnant and the 23-year-olds marry in Cusco and move to Northern California. Evelyn expects her husband to support their family, and Antonio tries to take his place as head of the household. But he must first learn English, complete college, and find a job.  Parenthood, financial stress, the pull of both countries, and long visits from Antonio's mother threaten to destroy the bonds that brought them together. Readers will delight in witnessing Evelyn come into her own — as a woman, as a wife and as a mother — in this moving depiction of partnership and all the intricacies that encompass marriage and love.  "Today's increasingly multicultural world can benefit from reading this book to learn about the growth experienced from the mixing of cultures," LaTorre stated. "Love in Any Language presents a study of the challenges and joys of a cross-cultural marriage. The serendipity of life is fascinating."  'Love in Any Language' has received rave reviews from readers and reviewers alike. One Amazon reviewer said, "Every new couple heading to the altar should read this." Another stated, "This is a book I could not put down. Every page in LaTorre's candid and insightful memoir is full of surprises as she leads the reader through the ups and downs of her cross-cultural marriage on her journey through life with her Peruvian husband." Another said, " . . . this is really as good as it gets. Thank you Evelyn for your honesty and your ability to dig deep and tell a story that everyone should hear!"  LaTorre's first memoir, 'Between Inca Walls: A Peace Corps Memoir', follows Evelyn as she joins the Peace Corps and is sent to perform community development work in a small mountain town in the Andes of Perú. There, she and her roommate, Marie, search for meaningful projects and adjust to living with few amenities. Over the course of eighteen months, the two young women work in a hospital, start 4-H clubs, attend campesino meetings, and teach PE in a school with dirt floors. Evelyn is chosen queen of the local boys' high school and—despite her resolve to resist such temptations—falls in love with a university student.  Evelyn LaTorre will appear on The Authors Show® on July 10 with an interview about 'Love in Any Language'. Both of her memoirs are available at Amazon.
