# ARC Clean Technology achieves major milestone with completion of Canadian regulatory design review for ARC-100 advanced small modular reactor

SAINT JOHN, NB, July 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ARC Clean Technology (ARC) announced today that it has achieved a major milestone with the successful completion of Phase 2 of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Vendor Design Review (VDR) for its advanced small modular reactor, the ARC-100. In its report, the CNSC concluded that no fundamental barriers to licensing have been identified, marking a pivotal step toward the commercial deployment of the ARC-100.   The ARC-100 is a 100MWe sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor designed for both on-grid electricity production and industrial heat applications. Building upon proven technology, it provides clean, reliable power to support grid stability and industrial applications. The ARC-100 is the first advanced, sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor to complete a review of this type with the CNSC.  The Phase 2 VDR provides feedback to the vendor on matters related to CNSC regulatory requirements and expectations. As part of the multi-year review which began in 2022, ARC submitted hundreds of technical documents covering 19 focus areas defined by the CNSC and of importance to future licensing applications. The submissions included information related to safety systems, safety analyses, reactor and process system design, regulatory compliance, and quality assurance.  "This significant milestone reflects ARC's dedication and commitment to meeting Canada's rigorous nuclear regulatory standards," said Robert Braun, Chief Operating Officer for ARC. "The successful completion of this review by the CNSC, an internationally respected nuclear regulator, gives global credibility to our technology and sets us apart as a leader among advanced small modular reactor technologies."  The conclusion of the Phase 2 review also brings additional confidence and focus to licensing activities already in progress for a demonstration unit of the ARC-100 in New Brunswick, Canada. In 2023, New Brunswick Power (NB Power) submitted a license to prepare site application for an ARC-100 unit at their Point Lepreau nuclear site. The application marked the beginning of the licensing process, and is one of only two small modular reactor projects in Canada in progress with the CNSC.  "NB Power congratulates ARC Clean Technology on the completion of Phase 2 of the CNSC's Vendor Design Review," said Lori Clark, President and CEO of NB Power. "We've been pleased to provide technical support throughout this process and recognize this as a meaningful step in ARC's project development. We look forward to continued collaboration in exploring innovative energy solutions."  With the conclusion of this CNSC review, ARC is well-positioned to proceed with the next stages of licensing and deployment, contributing to Canada's leadership in clean energy and advanced nuclear technology.  About ARC Clean Technology ARC Clean Technology Inc. is a clean energy technology company developing the ARC-100, an advanced small modular reactor offering safe, reliable, and economical carbon-free power. Leveraging proven technology from the 30-year performance of its prototype, the ARC-100's modular design provides 100 megawatts of energy for electricity and industrial applications. A license to prepare site application for commercial demonstration of the ARC reactor in New Brunswick, Canada was submitted to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in 2023. ARC is also a participant in the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP), supporting accelerated SMR development. ARC Clean Technology has offices in New Brunswick, Canada and Washington, DC.
