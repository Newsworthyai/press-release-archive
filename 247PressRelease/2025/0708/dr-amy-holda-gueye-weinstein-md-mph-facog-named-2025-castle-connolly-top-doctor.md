COLUMBIA, MD, July 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Amy Holda Gueye-Weinstein, MD, MPH, FACOG, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and nationally recognized leader in integrative women's health, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor. This marks her first time receiving the prestigious distinction, which is awarded to only about 7 percent of licensed physicians in the United States each year.  Castle Connolly Top Doctors are nominated by their peers and selected through an extensive physician-led research process that evaluates expertise, outcomes, and patient care.  Dr. Gueye-Weinstein is the founder, medical director, and co-owner of Visionary Women's Health, an innovative practice she launched in 2020 to reimagine women's healthcare through a holistic and culturally informed lens. She offers a comprehensive range of gynecologic services — including routine well-woman care, fertility assessments, hormone balance, menstrual and pelvic pain evaluations, and early-pregnancy monitoring — with a focus on treating root causes and restoring wellness.  Her clinical expertise spans functional medicine, hormone and menopause therapy, gut health, and the nonsurgical management of complex conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and cervical dysplasia.  In reflecting on the honor, Dr. Gueye-Weinstein shared:  "I am deeply grateful to my peers for their trust and recognition. This nomination reaffirms my commitment to centering excellent, soul-connected patient care — especially for women who have long been overlooked by traditional medicine."  Dr. Gueye-Weinstein's signature model, the Therapeutic Delivery of Healthcare, combines modern gynecology with soul coaching, ancestral healing, functional medicine, and cultural awareness to support multidimensional wellness. Her practice also offers concierge care for patients seeking personalized, direct access to her services.  Certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (FACOG), Dr. Gueye-Weinstein is also trained in functional medicine as it applies to women's health by the Institute for Functional Medicine. She holds additional training in menopause and perimenopause care and hormone pellet therapy through nationally recognized certifying bodies.  She earned her medical degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine and completed her OB-GYN residency at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. She also holds a Master of Public Health (MPH) from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where she was named a prestigious Sommer Scholar.  Beyond clinical practice, Dr. Gueye-Weinstein is the founder and president of Holda's Access Life Foundation, a nonprofit advancing women's health equity in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Looking ahead, Dr. Gueye-Weinstein plans to expand her mission by opening a network of healing centers across the U.S. and internationally — creating safe, empowering spaces for women and families to heal and reclaim total wellness.
