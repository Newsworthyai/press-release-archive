# New Novel The World Is Angry Exposes a Society on the Brink Through a Killer's Eyes

HOUSTON, TX, April 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a time of fractured attention spans, performative social media lives, and rising public numbness, a chilling new novel dares to ask: What if murder became the purest form of communication? John Vines' debut, The World Is Angry, now available on Amazon, is a sharp and unsettling commentary on the emotional and ethical erosion of modern society, delivered through the voice of a killer who believes he's the only one truly awake.  Part psychological thriller, part existential manifesto, The World Is Angry centers on a series of ritualistic killings staged not just to shock, but to say something. Each murder is methodical, symbolic, and painfully public. Victims aren't chosen at random, they're chosen to represent the parts of society the killer believes have grown blind, shallow, and detached.  And the worst part? He might be right.  "This is a novel for people who feel like they're screaming into the void," says Vines. "It's about trying to find meaning in a world that's addicted to surface-level distractions and dying for authenticity."  At its core, the novel isn't just about catching a murderer. It's about waking up. Through deeply introspective narration, Vines holds up a mirror to the reader, forcing us to question what we see, what we ignore, and how desensitized we've become to suffering, especially when it's filtered through a screen.  With characters rooted in realism, a burned-out geologist, a history-haunted detective, and a woman trying to hold everything togetherâ€”The World Is Angry makes its case not through gore but through truth. It explores loneliness, ambition, love, addiction, memory, and the aching human desire to be understood.  Darkly poetic and intellectually daring, The World Is Angry is not just a thriller, it's a warning shot across the bow of modern apathy.  Now available exclusively on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F31WGSX3
