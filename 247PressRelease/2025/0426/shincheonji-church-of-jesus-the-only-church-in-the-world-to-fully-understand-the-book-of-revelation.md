# Shincheonji Church of Jesus: The only church in the world to fully understand the Book of Revelation

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, April 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Shincheonji church of Jesus members are set to fully understand the book of Relation.  The church would hold weekly Bible exams to help its members master the Book of Revelation.  From the moment of enrollment, members must attend the Zion Christian Mission Center, where they study elementary, middle and high school-level courses and pass a graduation exam (about 100 questions) before becoming members.  The church, which has conducted four consecutive graduation ceremonies with over 100,000 graduates, is famous worldwide.  Shincheonji Church of Jesus Chairman Lee Man-hee has been traveling across South Korea, preaching from the pulpit and frequently citing Revelation 22:18-19, saying that members should not add or subtract from the Book of Revelation, for those who do will not enter the kingdom of heaven.  The chairman emphasizes that the Book of Revelation must be recorded in one's thoughts and heart.  In line with this, the Shincheonji Church General Assembly Education Department, Chairman Lee Man-hee's intention to ensure all members qualify for entrance into heaven, is currently administering the sealing Confirmation Test to all Shincheonji members worldwide.  This test, which started online during the global difficulties caused by COVID-19, is now being conducted in person at the temples, with weekly exams to ensure that the members of Shincheonji become walking Bible.  A representative of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus stated that the only true way to understand the true meaning and reality of the Book of Revelation is through the testimony of witnesses who saw and heard the events as they unfolded when the prophecy of Revelation was fulfilled.  Today, the global Christian community has neither seen nor heard the reality of the Book of Revelation, which is why both pastors and congregants have added to or subtracted from it.  Among all the Christians worldwide, except for the members of Shincheonji, there is not a single person who has not altered the Book of Revelation.  Revelation 22:18-19 clearly states that anyone who adds to or takes away from the Book of Revelation will not enter the kingdom of heaven.  Yet, pastors and their congregations are not concerned even after adding to or subtracting from the Book of Revelation.  How can this be called true faith?  He further added that Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is considered a cult by both other denominations has all its members mastering the Book of Revelation.  However, these other churches, including their pastors and congregations, have added to or subtracted from the Book of Revelation.  So, he urges everybody to judge who is truly orthodox and who is truly a heretic based on the Bible.  At Shincheonji Church of Jesus, all members take weekly Bible exams, which focus on the prophecies in the Four Gospels of the New Testament and the entire Book of Revelation.  Shincheonji Church explains that these exams are a form of training to record God's word in the heart and to keep the New Covenant Revelation.  According to the General Assembly Education Department of Shincheonji, the overall average score for the Sealing Confirmation Test taken by all members from January to April this year is 99, with a participation rate of 97%.  Furthermore, 99.9% of the test-takers scored above 90.  "This statistic demonstrates the congregation's dedication to the Word and their high level of faith awareness," said a representative of the Shincheonji church of Jesus.  He also stated that today, most Christians are neither aware of nor interested in the prophecies of the Four Gospels in the New Testament or the teachings of the Book of Revelation. Yet, they blindly label Shincheonji as a cult.  However, when asked to explain why Shincheonji is considered a cult based on the Bible, they cannot provide an answer.  This situation is similar to the one during Jesus's First Coming.  "If the teachings of Shincheonji Church of Jesus are wrong, please provide evidence from the Bible. It is not right to persecute Shincheonji just because members from other churches follow the truth and join Shincheonji. Did Jesus teach us in the New Testament to persecute our neighbors?" he posed.  Despite the ongoing controversy over Shincheonji being labeled a cult, former pastors who have joined the Shincheonji Church of Jesus unanimously testify that the church that teaches and practices the Word  They argue that instead of blindly condemning the church, it should be evaluated based on the Bible.  Pastor Kim, who came to recognise the teachings of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, said, "In Christianity, Shincheonji is considered a cult, but after coming here, I realized that there is no church that practices the Bible more faithfully than Shincheonji,"  Kim added, "Shincheonji helps its members master the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, so their knowledge of the Bible is even greater than mine as a pastor. I've left everything I knew before and am starting my faith a new,"  Pastor Choi Kwang-sun said, "I taught the Word as a pastor, but after coming to Shincheonji Church of Jesus, I realised how ignorant I was. The church community should not just defame Shincheonji but give members the opportunity to hear and make their own judgement,"  He added that it is a dereliction of duty for churches not to teach the Bible properly.  Christian leaders should listen to the Word so that all people on earth can know about God's final work.
