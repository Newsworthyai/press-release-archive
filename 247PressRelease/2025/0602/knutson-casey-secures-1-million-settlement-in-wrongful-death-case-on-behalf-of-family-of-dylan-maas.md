# Knutson+Casey Secures $1 Million Settlement in Wrongful Death Case on Behalf of Family of Dylan Maas

MANKATO, MN, June 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The law firm of Knutson+Casey has obtained a successful resolution of a $1,000,000 wrongful death settlement on behalf of the family of Dylan Robert Maas, who tragically lost his life in a semi truck accident.  Court file 83-CV-23-461 in the Fifth Judicial District Court, Watonwan County shows that the Court formally approved the allocation of settlement proceeds and disbursements, and the court-appointed trustee was authorized by the court to distribute the funds in accordance with Minnesota's wrongful death statutes. The court ordered that the $1 million settlement be distributed equally among his heirs.  According to the MN State Highway Patrol, on September 20, 2023 a fatal injury crash occurred on Minnesota Highway 30 in Watonwan County. The crash involved a 1998 Kenworth semi driven by Cody James Crowley and a 1995 Freightliner semi driven by Dylan Robert Maas. Crowley failed to yield the right of way and collided with the driver side of the Freightliner driven by Maas. Both Crowley and Maas sustained fatal injuries as a result of the crash.  "This case involved a tragic and preventable loss, when a Crowley drove his semi-truck past rumble strips, past a warning sign that said "Stop Ahead", and through a stop sign, striking our client's semi, and killing him," said Randy Knutson, lead attorney and founding partner of Knutson+Casey. "We are grateful the family has received some sense of justice and can now begin the process of healing. We were honored to advocate on their behalf."
