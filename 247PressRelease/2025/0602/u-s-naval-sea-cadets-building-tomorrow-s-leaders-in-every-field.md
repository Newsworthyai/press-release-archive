# U.S. Naval Sea Cadets: Building Tomorrow's Leaders in Every Field

WASHINGTON, DC, June 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps, the youth development arm of the Navy, celebrates the graduation of 473 cadets across the country this month. Sea Cadet units from Hawaii to New Hampshire will honor seniors as they graduate from high school, complete the Sea Cadet program, and move on to the next steps in their lives—including Naval Academy plebe Luke Villarreal, a graduate of inspirational Sea Cadet Submarine training, and Yale freshman Zakai Lian, who steered a tall ship in the Pacific Ocean during his summer training program.   "After high school about half of our Sea Cadets put on a military uniform," says Andy Lennon, Executive Director of the Sea Cadets. "Many others go on to forge successful careers in the fields of science and engineering, public service, the trades, and as entrepreneurs. Armed with the leadership skills and resilience our program instills, these young Americans are ready to take on life's big challenges."  More than 4,500 middle and high school students take part in Sea Cadet career training programs across the country each year in partnership with the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Merchant Marine, and industry leaders. In this year's class of graduates, Derek Opperman (Monroe, Michigan) received appointments to both West Point and Annapolis. He has chosen to become a Naval Academy midshipman. Jon Garfield (Cleveland, Ohio) says he's on the path to becoming a Naval aviator and aspires to become a congressman, thanks to his summer Sea Cadet shipboard seamanship training on the World War II Liberty ship, the S.S. John W. Brown  Cadet Chief Petty Officer Rowan Crilly (Columbus, Ohio) joined Sea Cadets during the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, his dedication and grit have transformed him from a kid who struggled to run an 11-minute mile into a three-sport varsity athlete, now heading to college on an ROTC scholarship. "What started as an extracurricular has become the foundation of who I am. The Sea Cadets gave me the confidence to aim higher—on the track, in the classroom, and in life," Crilly says.  Cadet Chief Petty Officer Ethel Leizer (Pasadena, California) earned her SCUBA certification, learned marksmanship, and sailed open waters with U.S. Coast Guard mentors in the Sea Cadets. "Each training pushed me out of my comfort zone and showed me what I was capable of physically, mentally, and as a teammate. The Sea Cadets helped me discover a clear path forward. After graduating, I'll be attending the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, something I've worked incredibly hard for, and a dream this program helped me chase," Leizer says.   Cadet Petty Officer Third Class Santiago Lobo (Windermere, Florida) discovered his career path while chopping onions in a busy galley during Sea Cadet Advanced Culinary Training. Initially shy and unsure, he found purpose behind the scenes, learning how food powers morale and mission success in the Navy. Today, he is pursuing a future in culinary arts with ambitions of running his own kitchen. "There were definitely challenges—early morning wakeups, tough physical training, balancing school and cadet life—but every obstacle helped me grow stronger. The Sea Cadet program is about more than just learning how to march and tie knots, it's about becoming the best version of yourself," Santiago says.  Cadet Chief Petty Officer Shivah Sundar (Alameda, California) began his journey as a timid 12-year-old who attended cadet training in photojournalism eventually leading 90 cadets as the battalion chief for the Pacific Southwest Training Contingent. Eight years later, he is graduating from high school with an associate's degree in molecular biology and biotechnology and plans to pursue medical school—bringing the leadership and technical skills he achieved as a Sea Cadet into the health science field. "I learned invaluable leadership skills—most importantly, how to take the initiative and care for my team. Sea Cadets shaped me into the leader I am today, and for that, I am forever grateful," Shivah says.  Now on the cusp of successful careers in medicine, the culinary arts, and military service, Sea Cadets like Rowan, Ethel, Santiago, and Shivah show that the program's impact extends far beyond the parade ground. As young adults face overwhelming challenges to discover their own path, these 2025 graduates show what happens when character, discipline, and mentorship combine to inspire the next generation of industry, military, and community leaders.  Participation in the Sea Cadets includes advanced career training opportunities across the country each year, including Seabee Naval Construction Training, Accelerated Training in Defense Manufacturing, Maritime Industrial Arts Training, and SeaPerch Underwater Robotics Training.
