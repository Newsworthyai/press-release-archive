# The Leadership Institute for Military Spouses by MSAN introduces two new programs in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame

SAN ANTONIO, TX, June 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In continuation of their joint mission to create stronger military families through education, empowerment, and support, Military Spouse Advocacy Network (MSAN) and its recently launched Leadership Institute for Military Spouses (LIMS) are dedicated to providing free and meaningful training to military spouses. Now, the University of Notre Dame joins the LIMS family with two exciting new programs â€” one focused on ethical leadership skills in support of professional development and the other on building skills to promote resilience and mental health.  Courses were developed and will be presented by faculty of the William J. Shaw Center for Children and Families, the Veldman Family Psychology Clinic and the Notre Dame Deloitte Center for Ethical Leadership, who are partnering with Notre Dame Learning's Office of Digital Learning on the design of effective online content.  "I am incredibly proud to welcome Notre Dame to the MSAN family," said Verenice Castillo, MSAN president and CEO. "Their commitment to our military community, particularly through their new Leadership in Ethics and Mental Health Wellness program for military spouses, will empower these dedicated individuals to continue making a profound difference in their lives and communities. Together, we are building an army of strong community leaders, mentors, and advocates."  "For generations, Notre Dame has valued its commitment to and support of the men and women who serve in the armed forces, and we are honored to expand our relationship through this program," University President Rev. Robert A. Dowd, C.S.C., said. "This new partnership allows us to share our scholarship and research to support service members and their families who sacrifice so much for our country."  These two programs are exclusively offered to alumni of the LIMS flagship Leadership Development Program, which has graduated hundreds of participants since its inception in 2020. Alumni will participate in cohorts of 50 students after applying for and being selected for each program.  The Leadership in Ethics course reflects the mission of MSAN and LIMS in equipping rising leaders with the skills they need to impact their communities. Topics will include conflict management, voicing values at work, and honesty and empathy in decision-making. In covering these skills, the aim is for military spouses to become leaders who foster resilient and flourishing communities.  The mental health course series aims to support military spouses in dispelling mental health myths, identifying mental health risks that are more common in military communities, and developing skills to promote wellness for themselves, their families, friends and peers. In doing so, military spouses will build skills to practice and model self-care, support emotional resilience and act in times of stress.  The MSAN-Notre Dame partnership is a multidisciplinary campus project. It involves faculty and staff from 10 organizations who are developing the partnership and the logistics of creating and delivering the not-for-credit courses. The project is being spearheaded and resourced by Notre Dame Research with the support of the Office of Military & Veterans Affairs, the College of Arts and Letters, the Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame Learning's Office of Digital Learning, the Office of Public Affairs and Communications, the William J. Shaw Center for Children and Families, the Notre Dame Deloitte Center for Ethical Leadership, the Veldman Family Psychology Clinic and the Mental Health Initiative.  About Leadership Institute for Military Spouses by MSAN The Leadership Institute for Military Spouses (LIMS) empowers and equips military spouses to become influential community leaders and change-makers.
