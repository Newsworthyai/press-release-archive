The deal gets even sweeter with a dessert add-on of Rice Pudding or Baklava for just $5 more. This offer is for dine-in only at participating locations.  Greek Feast invites groups to gather and enjoy a family combo tray in two size options: one that feeds 4-5 people and another that feeds 8-10 people. The Greek Feast for 4-5 people includes a choice of Chicken Souvlaki or Chicken Gyro (can be mixed) as well as Beef/Lamb Gyro Meat, Dolmades, and Falafel over Rice Pilaf. It also includes a choice of two (2) dips (Hummus, Tzatziki, Melitzanosalata, and Tirokafteri) and Pita Bread – all starting at $49.95. The Greek Feast for 8-10 people includes the same but with larger portions to feed more people and all four (4) dips, starting at $99.95.
