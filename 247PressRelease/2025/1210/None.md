GREENWICH, CT, December 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the pivotal transition from Thanksgiving to the year-end close, strategic capital access emerges as the linchpin for business resilience and aggressive growth planning. Charles Principato, President of First Greenwich Capital Funding, positions innovative, non-dilutive funding solutions as critical tools for companies aiming to convert seasonal strength into year-round momentum.  This commitment to strengthening the community extends beyond his professional expertise, as demonstrated by his recent support for The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County. In the spirit of the season, Principato generously donated 100 hams and turkeys to the organization this Thanksgiving, aiding its mission to provide nutritious food to those in need.  "We're incredibly grateful for Charles's generous in-kind donation," said Duncan Lawson, Executive Director of The Food Bank. "His support is vital to our mission. Thank you again for your generosity and commitment to fighting hunger in our community."
