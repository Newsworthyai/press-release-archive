# Hypersequent Upgrades QA Sphere TMS With Faster Workflows, AI Test Authoring and Deeper Jira Integration

DUBAI, UAE, December 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hypersequent DMCC, the Dubai-based company on a mission to make the world's software more reliable, today announced a new update for QA Sphere, its modern test management system. As development teams ship features faster and rely heavily on Jira, QA teams often struggle with outdated workflows, growing test repositories, and AI tools that lack real project context. The new release addresses these challenges with improvements that speed up daily work, strengthen Jira alignment, and make AI-assisted test creation more practical.  QA Sphere is used by QA and engineering teams to manage test cases, plan and execute test cycles, and organize quality work across multiple projects. The latest update continues Hypersequent's focus on clarity, speed, and reliability.  The release introduces a wide-screen optimized interface with a three-panel layout for folders, test cases, and previews, allowing users to work more efficiently on large monitors. Bulk Test Case Creation with AI is now easier to access from the main Create button, with a keyboard shortcut for frequent users. Teams can also paste Jira links directly into the Functional Requirements field when using Bulk Write with AI; QA Sphere automatically retrieves issue text when Jira is connected, ensuring generated tests reflect real requirements.  Sharing test cases becomes simpler with a new Copy Links option that exports selected cases as clean Markdown or rich-text lists for use in Jira, Confluence, Slack, or email. Existing test cases can now be converted into parameterized templates with one click, helping teams standardize recurring flows. The import experience has also been refined, with clearer dialog design and guidance for teams with complex migration needs.  For teams working closely with Jira, the update adds improved linking when creating requirements. Users can search Jira issues by title or ID, select the correct one, and have the title added automatically. In test runs, the Create Jira Issue dialog now supports faster search, sorting for Epics and Parent issues, and direct input of issue keys.  To improve clarity around templates and shared steps, QA Sphere now warns users when a template without variables will not appear in test runs, while still allowing them to proceed. Shared steps can be edited directly from within a test case, with options to open in a new tab or refresh in place. Additional refinements across the app improve validation, duplicate handling, and consistency.  "Most test management tools either try to do everything or get in your way," said Andrian Budantsov, founder of Hypersequent and driving force behind QA Sphere. "This release doubles down on what QA teams actually need: clarity, speed, and AI that genuinely reduces manual work instead of becoming just another checkbox." All enhancements are available today for all QA Sphere users, including trial accounts. More information is available at qasphere.com.
