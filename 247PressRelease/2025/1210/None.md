Attendees will begin with a deep dive into how to evaluate business goals and identify the KPIs that matter most. The webinar will explain how to connect metrics with the sales cycle and how these insights inform smarter investment decisions across core marketing channels.  Participants will then explore website design, branding, and usability assessment techniques. This includes understanding whether the website experience builds trust, supports conversions, and aligns with brand expectations. The segment will highlight how to identify high-impact improvements without unnecessary redesigns or complexity.  A comprehensive review of content, SEO, and AI Search performance will follow. The presentation will outline how to determine whether content communicates expertise, how search engines and AI systems interpret the brand, and where opportunities may be missed to rank, be recommended, or capture demand. As AI continues reshaping how people search and interact with information, these insights are increasingly critical.  The webinar concludes with a structured evaluation framework for social media and email marketing. Attendees will learn how to assess engagement quality, audience alignment, campaign consistency, and email performance to determine which channels deserve increased focus, which require refinement, and which may no longer support business goals.
