FORT WORTH, TX, July 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A fusion of Italian craftsmanship and American luxury, the 1992 Cadillac Allante is a rare and remarkable classic now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. Part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection, this stunning red Allante represents Cadillac's bold attempt to rival European grand tourers with a sleek, Pininfarina-designed body and innovative technology.  An Exclusive Collaboration with Pininfarina The Cadillac Allante was unlike any other American luxury car of its time. With bodies hand-crafted by the legendary Pininfarina design house in Italy and then flown to Detroit for final assembly, the Allante set new standards for elegance and exclusivity. Its refined styling and premium interior made it a standout in the early '90s luxury market.  Performance and Innovation Under the hood, this Allante features a transversely mounted 4.5-liter LW2 V8 engine, delivering a smooth 200 horsepower and an impressive 270 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels via a four-speed automatic transaxle, ensuring a refined yet responsive driving experience. Inside, the car boasts power-adjustable Keiper-Recaro bolstered seats, an advanced Delco Symphony sound system with an in-dash CD player, and an onboard computerâ€”all cutting-edge features for its time. A Pininfarina badge sits proudly at the base of the center stack, a constant reminder of the car's distinguished origins.  A Modern Digital Cockpit Enhancing the futuristic appeal of the Allante, the leather-wrapped steering wheel sits ahead of a fully digital LCD instrument cluster, featuring a 6,000-rpm tachometer and a 150-mph speedometer. The odometer displays just over 46,000 miles, reflecting its well-preserved condition.
