# Kaged Launches Pre-Workout MAX: A High-Performance, Health-Conscious Innovation

COSTA MESA, CA, May 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Kaged, a leader in clean, high-performance sports nutrition, is proud to announce the national launch of its newest innovation, Pre-Workout MAX, available this August at The Vitamin Shoppe. This latest addition to the Kaged lineup reflects the brand's commitment to continuous innovation, to help people fuel the extra rep, last mile, and final pound lost.  Pre-Workout MAX is a comprehensive, health-forward pre-workout supplement designed for serious athletes and everyday lifters alike. It delivers clinically studied, performance-boosting ingredients in fully transparent doses. It leverages cutting-edge ingredients to maximize absorption and results.  "Kaged was founded with a commitment to innovation and we're always looking for ways to deliver on that promise," said Michael McClane, CEO of Kaged. "With Pre-Workout MAX, we took everything customers love about our pre-workouts and pushed it further with these latest ingredient breakthroughs."  What Makes Pre-Workout MAX Different?  Pre-Workout MAX innovates with two key ingredients. The first is MAXCatalyst™, a patented black pepper extract shown to significantly enhance the absorption of key ingredients, including caffeine, creatine, and L-citrulline.* It means customers will get clean energy with fewer jitters, more pumps, and sharper mental focus.  This pre-workout is first to market with TriBsyn™, a high-absorption, tingle-free form of beta-alanine. Head of Product Development Brian Rand said he was astounded by the research coming out on TriBsyn™. "We know CarnoSyn® beta-alanine is a tried-and-true ingredient, but many customers don't want the tingles. I was impressed with the research on TriBsyn™, which showed a 4x increase in absorption over conventional beta-alanine. Because of that, we can use a lower dose and still provide the performance benefits."  "TriBsyn™ has emerged as a breakthrough supplement—balancing efficacy, efficiency, and consumer comfort," said Ken Wolf, President and COO of Natural Alternatives International. "We are excited to see TriBsyn™ included in the Kaged Pre-Workout MAX formula to provide scientifically proven benefits related to muscle vitality and working capacity."  Like all Kaged pre-workouts, MAX is naturally flavored and colored, banned-substance tested (Informed Sport certified), and tastes great.  Retail-Ready for High Demand  Launching nationwide at The Vitamin Shoppe, Pre-Workout MAX offers retail partners a unique opportunity to meet growing demand for clean, clinically backed pre-workouts. Initially launching with two great-tasting flavors, Blue Raspberry and Watermelon, and a fresh label update, MAX is positioned to succeed in the fast-growing active lifestyle segment.  Kaged will support the launch with national marketing, influencer campaigns, and educational initiatives to help drive awareness and sell-through at the retail level.  The Evolution Continues  With Pre-Workout MAX, Kaged continues to push the limits of what's possible in sports nutrition, blending premium ingredient sourcing with scientific rigor and a commitment to Never Stop Evolving.
