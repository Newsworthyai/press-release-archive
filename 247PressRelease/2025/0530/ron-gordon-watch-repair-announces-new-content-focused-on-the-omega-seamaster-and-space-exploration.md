# Ron Gordon Watch Repair Announces New Content Focused on The OMEGA Seamaster and Space Exploration

NEW YORK, NY, May 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ron Gordon Watch Repair, a top-rated OMEGA repair and service shop in Midtown Manhattan, is proud to announce a new blog post exploring the storied connection between Omega's Speedmaster and the early era of American space exploration. The post, titled "Keeping Time with the Cosmos: Vintage Speedmasters and the Value of Watch Repair," reflects on the enduring legacy of the Speedmaster and the importance of maintaining vintage timepieces—especially those with a place in horological and cultural history.  "Reading WatchTime's latest article about NASA's rigorous testing and ultimate selection of the Omega Speedmaster reminded me why I love this work," explained Ron Gordon, proprietor of Ron Gordon Watch Repair. "When a watch passes NASA's tests and lands on the Moon, that's not just good branding—it's proof of design excellence. And those very same models still pass through my shop today, right here in New York. And, yes, the moon landings were many years ago, but space is coming back as a popular topic.  In the newly published blog post (available at https://www.rongordonwatches.com/2025/05/cosmos/), Ron Gordon shares his insights into what made the Omega Speedmaster the only watch to survive NASA's eleven punishing qualification tests in 1965—including extreme temperature swings, vacuum exposure, high G-force acceleration, and more. The Speedmaster was approved not only by engineers but also by astronauts themselves. As Gordon writes, the exact models qualified for flight were available in retail stores—making the Speedmaster an authentic piece of space history anyone could own.
