SINGLE-FAMILY HOME PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TEAM MAKES INVESTOR-OWNED PROPERTY A DREAM  Here is the background on this release.

Despite high rental demand, a rental property investor managing several single family homes near Richardson, Plano, or Allen might find the management tasks overwhelming. If the investor can't get the home ready in time, it could be a missed opportunity on a great long-term renter.
