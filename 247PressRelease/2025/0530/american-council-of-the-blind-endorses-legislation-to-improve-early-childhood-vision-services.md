# American Council of the Blind Endorses Legislation to Improve Early Childhood Vision Services

ALEXANDRIA, VA, May 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The American Council of the Blind (ACB) announces its support for two critical pieces of legislation aimed at strengthening early detection and intervention for children with vision impairments: H.R. 3541, the See the Board Act, and H.R. 2527, the Early Detection of Vision Impairments (EDVI) Act. These bipartisan efforts represent vital steps toward ensuring that all children have access to timely, appropriate vision screenings and services.  ACB's mission is to increase the independence, security, equality of opportunity, and quality of life for all people who are blind or have low vision. These bills directly align with that mission by recognizing the life-changing power of early intervention. When children receive comprehensive vision screenings at a young age and are connected to the support they need, they are better equipped to succeed in school, navigate the world with confidence, and develop on equal footing with their peers.  "Too often, vision impairments in young children go undetected until they've already affected a child's learning, development, and self-esteem," said ACB Executive Director Scott Thornhill. "The See the Board Act and the EDVI Act are about changing that reality by giving families, educators, and providers the tools they need to act early in a child's life."  These bills would expand access to vision screenings, improve coordination between providers, and help ensure that families have access to timely services. Together, they represent a national investment in the future of our children, especially those with vision impairments.   ACB calls on our members to contact their Congressmembers to co-sponsor and push this bill forward. Members can call the Congressional switchboard at 202-225-3121. The two bill numbers are H.R. 2527 and 3541.
