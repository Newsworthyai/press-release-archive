# Emotional Intelligence, Not IQ, Drives Career Success in Gifted Individuals, New Insights Show

SAN FRANCISICO, CA, May 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  Gifted Minds, Real Struggles  Many gifted people experience social and emotional difficulties that limit their success. According to the Studybay survey, 72% of students believe that gifted learners are not given enough intellectual challenges during their time in school but differentiated instruction and project-based activities can help. These steps make sure gifted students stay engaged and grow, just like everyone else.   A 2020 meta-analysis found that gifted students scored moderately higher in EQ than their non-gifted peers. It also showed that gifted girls scored higher in emotional intelligence than gifted boys.   Some studies from the article Why Do Geniuses Perform Worse? points out that having a high IQ does not always lead to success. Many gifted people struggle in real-life situations because they lack emotional and social skills. Being "smart" is not the same as being good with people.  EQ: The True Predictor of Success  Multiple studies support the claim that emotional intelligence matters more than IQ in the workplace. According to a Harvard Business Review article based on research by Dr. Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence—emotional intelligence accounts for the difference between high and low performers in leadership roles. IQ may get someone into the job—but EQ determines how far they go.   Another major study published in 2024 found that employees with high emotional intelligence had better job satisfaction, lower stress and stronger peer relationships—all are key to long-term success.   Key To Career Success Today Emotional intelligence means understanding your own feelings—and the feelings of others. It is about knowing what you feel (self-awareness), staying calm under pressure (self-regulation), staying focused (motivation) and caring about others (empathy)—and bonding well with people (social skills).  These are not just nice-to-have traits. They are essential in today's workplaces—where teamwork and clear communication are everything. But they matter just as much in our schools, too.   A survey by Studybay reveals that 65% of people believe teachers are not fully prepared to recognize or support gifted students, especially in classrooms with a mix of learning levels.  With better tools and training, educators can spot emotional needs early and help every student grow, both in knowledge and confidence.   EQ Is The Skill Of The Future  According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report, emotional intelligence is among the top 10 job skills employers look for. As automation and AI handle more technical tasks—human-centric skills like empathy and communication are becoming even more essential.  Even top business schools now teach emotional intelligence as part of leadership training. Whether it is managing conflict or staying calm under pressure, emotional intelligence is what turns knowledge into success.
