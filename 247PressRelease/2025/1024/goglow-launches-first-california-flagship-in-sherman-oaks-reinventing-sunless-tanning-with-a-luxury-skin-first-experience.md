# goGlow Launches First California Flagship in Sherman Oaks — Reinventing Sunless Tanning with a Luxury, Skin-First Experience

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- goGlow, the award-winning sunless tanning and skincare franchise, is proud to announce the grand opening of its first California location in Sherman Oaks — bringing its signature clean, custom airbrush tanning experience to Southern California. This marks a major milestone in goGlow's rapid national expansion, and positions Sherman Oaks as the epicenter of next-level, health-conscious glow.  Since its founding, goGlow has disrupted the category of spray tanning with a philosophy that blends skincare science, luxury service, and transparency. Unlike traditional spray tan salons, goGlow treats each client's skin as the foundational canvas — offering odorless, non-sticky, non-orange, plant-based formulations, customized color consultation, pH balancing sprays, and moisture-locking finishes.   "At goGlow, we believe a beautiful tan should start with healthy skin," said Melanie Richards, Founder & CEO. "We've engineered a premium sunless experience where clients don't just 'get a tan' — they receive education, skincare care, and a glow that looks natural, luminous, and lasting. We're thrilled to bring this elevated, first-of-its-kind concept to California."  What Makes goGlow Sherman Oaks Different  Premium, Clean Formulas — Proprietary, vegan, cruelty-free, paraben- and sulfate-free solutions that prioritize skin health.   Custom Color Consultation — Each client works with a skin specialist to choose the ideal hue, minimizing guesswork and achieving a tailored result.   Rapid vs. Traditional Rinse Options — Depending on desired depth, clients may rinse after 3–5 hours (rapid) or wait 12–24 hours (traditional), offering flexibility.   Luxury Salon Ambience — Sleek, modern interiors designed to feel like a spa, not a tanning booth.  Membership / Recurring Revenue Model — Clients can choose VIP or Elite membership plans with perks such as discounted services and retail savings.   Educational Focus — goGlow specialists coach clients on how to prepare skin, maintain a tan, and prolong results — making each session part of a holistic glow strategy.   Grand Opening Event Highlights To celebrate the Sherman Oaks opening, goGlow will host an exclusive launch event on December 5, 2025, 12pm - 3pm at 4550 Van Nuys Blvd, Suite F, Sherman Oaks, CA 91403, open to media, influencers, and VIP guests.   Highlights include: • Ribbon-cutting with the franchise leadership and local dignitaries • Live demos and mini glow sessions • Gift bags featuring goGlow skincare products • Membership sign-up specials and introductory offers  Opportunities for media to tour the salon, interview founders, and experience the service first hand.  Why This Matters to Los Angeles  Los Angeles is a city obsessed with glow — from red carpets to beach days, locals demand radiant, healthy skin year-round. But traditional spray tanning often carries unwanted odors, streaking, orange tones, and aggressive chemicals. goGlow changes the narrative: it's not just about looking bronzed, but about glowing from skin that feels nourished, hydrated, and cared for.  By bringing the first California location to Sherman Oaks, goGlow is placing itself at the heart of L.A.'s beauty-forward, wellness-driven culture. The brand's arrival signals a new era for sunless tanning in SoCal — one where luxury, skin integrity, and science coexist.
