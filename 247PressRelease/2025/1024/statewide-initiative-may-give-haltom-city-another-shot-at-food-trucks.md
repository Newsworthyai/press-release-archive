# Statewide Initiative May Give Haltom City Another Shot at Food Trucks

HALTOM CITY, TX, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Food trucks are a popular attraction at many events, presenting a wide variety of diverse dining and beverage options for attendees. They frequently draw large crowds at fairs, festivals, and other fun occasions, but you'll have to look hard to find one in Haltom City.  That's because several years ago, council persons passed ordinances with regulations so complicated and demanding, they discourage participation by food truck owners. In fact, the number of food trucks applying for permits has steadily declined since Haltom City leaders enacted the new rules. One of the council persons even stated that the trucks competed with local restaurants, indicating her bias.   In Haltom City, the existing permit application is a four-page, single-spaced document laden with legalese that must be read, signed and notarized before a permit is granted. Permits cost $250 and are required to be renewed annually. Some of the items on the application are predictable, such as name, address, vehicle registration, license, and insurance information, while others border on outlandish.   One of the most burdensome demands on the application is the requirement of written permission from the owner of the property where the truck will be operating. This can be difficult or even impossible, especially in the case of property owners who aren't local. In most cases, the property owner of a large shopping center or strip mall has no incentive to provide written permission for a food truck to be present.  Back in 2021, when city leaders held a public hearing on the permitting regulations, Haltom United Business Alliance objected, saying the restrictive laws would present insurmountable roadblocks for food trucks wanting to do business in Haltom City. Additionally, anyone in Haltom City who wants to bring in food trucks for special events, such as weddings or festivals, is forced to either go to another city, or fulfill the burdensome requirements.  But a new state law, poised to take effect July 1, 2026, promises to minimize the red tape and simplify the permitting process for beleaguered food truck owners in Haltom City.   Texas House Bill 2844, dubbed the "Mobile Food Vendor Regulatory Consistency Act," passed on June 20, 2025 and was signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The new law streamlines the permitting process for food trucks by establishing a single statewide license, which eliminates the local rules and fees that stand in the way of food truck operation. This means that the Texas Department of State Health Services will issue a uniform license, allowing mobile vendors to operate throughout the state.  What does this mean for Haltom City? According to HUBA Communications Director Joe Palmer, the new state law gives Haltom City a chance to get food trucks back in business and operating within city limits once again.  "Mobile food vendors are valuable small businesses, and Haltom City leaders need to do everything in their power to encourage them," Palmer said. "Now that state lawmakers have passed legislation eliminating the burdensome permits and unnecessary fees, food truck owners can funnel their time, energy and money into improving and expanding their businesses. And that's a big win all around."  Palmer expressed concern over the possibility of Haltom City leaders continuing to stand in the way, in spite of the new legislation.  "To a certain extent, the law preserves a little bit of local control," Palmer said. "It still allows cities to continue enforcing rules on how, when and where food trucks are allowed to set up shop. We'll have to wait and see how Haltom City handles this, especially the part about requiring the property owner's permission to operate."  About Haltom City Haltom City is a diverse, majority working-class city located between Dallas and Fort Worth in Tarrant County, TX. Haltom City is minutes from both the DFW Airport and Downtown Fort Worth with direct access to major highways including I-820 and SH-121. Due to an outdated and restrictive use matrix that discourages new business and deters growth, several areas of Haltom City have seen a decline in small businesses that provided goods and services and were a significant source of jobs, including the once-thriving automotive industry. However, Haltom City can reverse this trend and should prioritize development of inner-city land and vacant buildings, particularly in the major corridors close to the city's center. The city is financially healthy, with a capable manager and staff who would like to see diverse business development occur, and need the support of the Haltom City Council to make it happen.  About Haltom United Business Alliance Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) wants to give members of Haltom City's business community an advocate and to keep those businesses informed about issues that affect them. They want to make sure Haltom City is business friendly and nurtures small business growth, including automotive businesses in the industrial districts, and bring more restaurants including breweries and eventually a major grocery store to the city. New businesses and growth in existing businesses will create a stronger tax base which will allow the city to pay its first responders wages that are competitive with surrounding cities while improving Haltom City's facilities and infrastructure. HUBA believes that the southern and central parts of the city need a revitalization plan, to prevent further degradation in those areas, and wants that to happen before the inner-city experiences increased crime and more blight. As retail and office uses are in decline, it's more critical than ever to attract new businesses. They believe that such a plan requires a strong relationship and support of the business community. Anyone who owns a business in Haltom City is eligible to join HUBA. Dues are $20 annually or $50 for a lifetime membership, and membership is 100% confidential. To join, contact Joe Palmer at (682) 310-0591 or by email at HUBAgrp@gmail.com. Visit the group's Facebook at Haltom United Business Alliance.
