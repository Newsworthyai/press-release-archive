# Poe-Ho-Ho! Scary Christmas! A Dickens/Poe Mashup Comes To Baltimore's Motor House Theatre

BALTIMORE, MD, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What if "A Christmas Carol" was written about America's greatest writer of horror and suspense?  That's the idea behind "A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe." This brand-new play was commissioned by The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre and written by Zac Pensol -- both past winners of The International Edgar Allan Poe Festival "Saturday Visiter" Award. The show opens on December 5 for 12 performances, closing December 21.  "A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe" will be performed at Baltimore's Motor House Theater (120 W North Ave, Baltimore, MD 21201), and is made possible in part by a grant from the Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts, Creative Baltimore Fund. Tickets are available on on www.poetheatre.org or https://ticketstripe.com/events/592107736357896  "This innovative new production is destined to be a Baltimore holiday tradition," said Poe Theatre Founder and Artistic Director Alex Zavistovich.   "It's exactly what it sounds like: A mashup of the life of Edgar Allan Poe and the structure of Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol.' The play tells Poe's story up to the last days of his beloved wife Virginia Clemm – and the lessons he learned about love and happiness one fateful December night."  " 'A Christmas Carol for Edgar Allan Poe' is a new spin on a timeless classic that's perfect for Baltimore," Zavistovich said.  The play features a cast of Baltimore-based actors including Jade Green, Oz Heiligman, Sarah Bella Joyce, Rocky Nunzio, Anthony Parker, Ian Blackwell Rogers, Mallory Shear, and Alex Zavistovich.  Behind-the-scenes technical talent includes Mark Kamie (Director), Adam R. Adkins (Assistant Director), Katherine Ross (Production Manager), Ronald Malone (Stage Manager), James Raymond (Set Design and Set Dressing), James D.
