# New Florida Law Poses Harsh Penalties For Speeders

CORAL SPRINGS, FL, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Our Broward County personal injury lawyer applauds the Florida legislature in making the Sunshine State's roads and highways safer. The new Florida law, effective July 1, 2025, delivers harsher penalties for drivers who speed excessively. Now, drivers who are traveling 50mph or more over the posted speed limit, or who are driving 100 mph or more, regardless of the posted speed limit, will face much tougher penalties.  First-time offenders will face up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine; second offenders may be sentenced to up to 90 days in jail and be assessed a $1,000 fine. If you break the new speeding law three times or more in a five-year period, your license will be suspended for up to a year. Third offenses also carry longer jail sentences and higher fines.  The new law is aimed at improving safety on Florida highways and reducing fatalities and grievous injuries that high-speed collisions produce. Additionally, the consequences of violating Florida's excessive speeding laws depend on the conditions and amount of traffic when the violation occurred, and may be at the officer's discretion.  From 2017 to 2023, 123 citations were given to drivers going 50mph or more over the posted speed limit. And, according to the Florida Highway Patrol, more than 16,000 serious traffic accidents were caused by excessive, dangerous speeding, resulting in over 170 fatalities and nearly 500 people severely injured.  Interestingly, the majority of speeding citations for drivers going 100 mph or more tend to be in the overnight hours, according to Lieutenant Indiana Miranda of the FHP. "We have a couple of midnight units that enforce just traffic and speed with their lasers, and I do get the notifications that they have stopped people going 50 over, or driving at 120," Miranda said.
