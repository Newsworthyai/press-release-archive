# Florida's 2023 Tort Reform Law Brought Sweeping Changes to Civil Suits

CORAL SPRINGS, FL, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Broward County, FL personal injury lawyers face steep challenges after the passage of HB 837 two years ago. On March 24, 2023, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed Florida House Bill 837, one of the most comprehensive tort reform bills in state history. Personal injury attorneys and plaintiffs alike can expect to see sweeping changes in numerous areas, from insurance bar faith to rules of evidence and defendant negligence.  One of the most significant changes passed into law by HB 837 is the change to Florida's statute of limitations for filing a negligence claim. Prior to the passage of HB 837, the statute of limitations to file a civil suit for damages was four years; now, it's just two. A statute of limitations is the legal deadline to initiate action, whether it's pressing criminal charges or filing a lawsuit. Once the statute of limitations expires, your right to sue is essentially forfeited. There are a few exceptions, such as tolling or if the plaintiff is a minor, but these are few and narrow.  Other changes of note in HB 837 include the change from a pure comparative negligence model to a modified comparative negligence model. This means that plaintiffs cannot recover damages if they contributed more than 50% of the fault for the incident. Previously, plaintiffs could recover damages even if they shouldered the majority of the blame for the injurious incident.  These changes highlight the importance of seeking legal counsel as soon as possible after getting hurt in an accident. While two years may seem like a long time, the less time you give your attorney to work within the statute of limitations, the less effective their representation may be.
