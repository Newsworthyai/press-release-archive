At its core, the book explores one man's lifelong search for truth—about the universe, about love, and about himself.  The story follows Christopher "Chris" Copper, a gifted boy from Cleveland whose fascination with the stars begins after a haunting childhood encounter with something unexplainable. As he grows, Chris endures profound loss, including the death of his beloved wife Emma, whose memory continues to guide him. His search for meaning leads him to NASA and into Project Threshold, a covert program investigating signals, wormholes, and hidden technologies that suggest humanity is not as alone as it believes.  From secret bases buried beneath the earth to encounters with forces beyond human comprehension, Chris's journey becomes both a scientific quest and a deeply personal reckoning.

"It's about grief, resilience, and our endless human drive to understand what lies beyond the horizon of our perception. The mysteries of the universe aren't always far away—they may be right in front of us."  Perfect for fans of Michael Crichton, Andy Weir, and Blake Crouch, Hidden in Plain Sight asks timeless questions: What lies beyond our world? How much is being kept from us? And what happens when science, faith, and love intersect?  About the Author  Irv Selman is a novelist with a passion for weaving science, history, and human drama into page-turning stories.
