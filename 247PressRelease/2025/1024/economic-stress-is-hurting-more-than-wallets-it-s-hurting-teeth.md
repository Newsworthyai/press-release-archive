# Economic Stress Is Hurting More Than Wallets- It's Hurting Teeth

CHICAGO, IL, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From rising grocery bills to housing costs, Americans are feeling the pinch of inflation, and dentists say it's showing up in an unexpected place: their teeth.  According to dental experts, economic stress is fueling a wave of oral health problems, including teeth grinding, jaw clenching, cracked molars, and receding gums. Many people are also skipping regular dental visits to save money, a decision that can lead to even bigger bills later.  "People are under more pressure than ever," says Dr. Catrise Austin, cosmetic dentist and spokesperson for Neer, a revolutionary zero-prep smile transformation. "We're seeing more patients with stress-related damage, not because they don't care about their teeth, but because life has become overwhelming and expensive. Unfortunately, dental neglect can take a toll on confidence, career opportunities, and overall health."  To help address these concerns, Neer offers a fast, pain-free, and cost-effective alternative to traditional veneers or braces. Unlike conventional procedures which require drilling, filing, anesthesia, or months of orthodontic treatment, Neers are wafer-thin, custom-fit smile enhancements that adhere to the natural tooth surface in just two visits. There's no pain, no drilling, and up to 70% less cost. Neer also offers night guards to protect smiles from tooth grinding caused by life's stressors.  "Your smile is one of the first things people notice," says Dr. Austin. "When you feel good about your smile, you're more likely to show up confidently whether that's in a job interview, on a date, or in front of a camera. A healthy, beautiful smile shouldn't be a luxury reserved for the wealthy."  With National Dental Hygiene Month underway, Dr. Austin is encouraging people to protect their oral health despite economic pressures through small, budget-friendly habits such as:  • Don't skip cleanings. Preventative care saves thousands later. • Use a night guard if you grind your teeth due to stress. • Practice daily oral hygiene and stress management techniques.  Explore accessible options like Neer for smile restoration or cosmetic upgrades.  Dr. Catrise Austin is available for interviews to discuss the link between economic stress and oral health, as well as accessible, pain-free solutions like Neer that are helping Americans restore confidence in their smiles.  About Neer Neer is redefining smile transformations with a no- drill, pain-free, two-visit system that enhances natural teeth with wafer-thin, custom veneers. Designed to look and feel authentic, Neer veneers deliver beautiful, healthy smiles in less than two weeks at a fraction of the cost of traditional veneers.
