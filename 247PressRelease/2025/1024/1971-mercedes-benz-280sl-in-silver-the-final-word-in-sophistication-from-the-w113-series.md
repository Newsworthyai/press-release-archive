# 1971 Mercedes-Benz 280SL in Silver: The Final Word in Sophistication from the W113 Series

FORT WORTH, TX, October 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to feature one of the most beloved and enduring icons of German automotive design: the 1971 Mercedes-Benz 280SL, now on display in classic silver as part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection. Representing the final production year of the famed W113 "Pagoda" series, this car stands as a masterclass in understated luxury and engineering finesse.  Designed by a legendary trio—Friedrich Geiger, Béla Barényi, and Paul Bracq—the W113 debuted at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show, quickly earning acclaim for its clean lines, signature concave hardtop, and perfect balance between sporty performance and grand touring comfort.  This 280SL is powered by the refined 2.8-liter M130 inline-six, featuring Bosch mechanical fuel injection, and sends power to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission. Braking is confident and smooth, thanks to power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, a feature ahead of its time in the early 1970s.  Inside, the SL's cabin reflects both luxury and thoughtful simplicity. Highlights include a wood-trimmed dash, analog clock, replacement carpeting, and a period-correct Frigiking air conditioning unit—a rare and desirable option. The floor-mounted gear shifter, Becker Europa AM/FM push-button radio, and two-spoke steering wheel with chrome horn ring complete the look, framing a cluster of VDO gauges including a 140-mph speedometer, tachometer, and indicators for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature.  "The 280SL is the perfect blend of art and engineering," says Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "This car doesn't scream for attention—it earns it quietly through its beauty, craftsmanship, and enduring relevance."  Often regarded as the ultimate evolution of the W113 chassis, the 1971 280SL marks the end of an era for Mercedes-Benz and stands today as a benchmark for vintage roadster design. Whether you're drawn to its mechanical sophistication or its sculpted silhouette, this silver star remains a symbol of timeless automotive luxury.
