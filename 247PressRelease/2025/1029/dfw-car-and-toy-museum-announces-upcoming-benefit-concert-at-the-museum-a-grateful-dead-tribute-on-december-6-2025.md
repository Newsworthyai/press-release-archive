FORT WORTH, TX, October 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car and Toy Museum in Fort Worth, Texas is hosting "Concert at the Museum: a Grateful Dead Tribute," a special night of musical memories, featuring the Texas Northbound Train tribute band. The event will be held from 6-9 p.m. Sat., Dec. 6 at the museum, located at 2550 McMillan Parkway in Fort Worth, Texas.  During the event, attendees will be able to enjoy a broad selection of food and beverages available from a variety of local food trucks. Admission to the concert is $10 per ticket, and the museum has announced a limit of just 700 tickets available for the event. Proceeds from this concert will go to The Women's Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping Tarrant County residents overcome violence, crisis, and poverty.  "We're thrilled to be lending a helping hand to The Women's Center," said Ron Sturgeon, founder and owner of the DFW Car and Toy Museum. "This group provides incredibly valuable services and programs for area men, women and children who are struggling to build better futures for themselves and their families."   Whether you're up for some "Dancing in the Street," "Truckin'," or simply "Playing in the Band," or you're reminiscing to the sounds of "Sugar Magnolia" and "Scarlet Begonias," this concert promises a fun-filled combination of nostalgia and Grateful Dead tunes.  Participants can enjoy the music while immersed in the museum's fabulous collection of vintage toys, motorcycles, and classic cars. The event also features a special appearance by the unique 1949 Studebaker Grateful Dead pickup. Affectionately dubbed, "The Dred" by Grateful Dead band members, this vehicle was used to haul the band's equipment in the 1960s. The truck is powered by an eight-cylinder engine and a four-speed manual transmission, and was frequently seen parked at the band's studio in Novato, California. Previously owned by Owsley Stanley, the Grateful Dead's original sound man, The Dred delivers a historic piece of Deadhead culture to those in attendance at the event.   For those who are too young to remember, the Grateful Dead was an American rock band that started in the San Francisco Bay area in 1965 by founding members Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Ron McKernan, Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann. Famous for its devoted fan base known as Deadheads, the Grateful Dead was one of the highest grossing American touring acts, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.  "This concert promises to be a truly fabulous combination of nostalgia, good food, and Grateful Dead tunes," Sturgeon said. "We're really looking forward to hosting this thrilling musical celebration, and we hope everyone will join us for the fun."  The DFW Car and Toy Museum offers lots of free parking for this event.
