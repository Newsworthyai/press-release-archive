# NW Legacy Law Supports Ronald McDonald House Of Oregon And SW Washington

VANCOUVER, WA, October 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The estate planning lawyers at NW Legacy Law are proud to support Ronald McDonald House Charities of Oregon & SW Washington, raising funds for families navigating difficult challenges. The NW Legacy Law legal team and their families participated in a fundraiser on Saturday, October 4, raising awareness of the local branch of the Ronald McDonald House charity and contributing to its local efforts to increase donations for chronically ill children and their families. The firm donated a significant amount of money to the local Ronald McDonald House, as well as time to help with the event.  Tania Gitch, the chairperson for the governing board of Ronald McDonald House in Oregon, coordinated the fundraiser. Ronald McDonald House is a national charity that provides a home away from home and a community of support for seriously ill or injured children and their families. Families with children being treated in local hospitals can stay at the Ronald McDonald House for free, rather than spending hundreds of dollars or more on hotel fees.  Working with the Ronald McDonald House reflects the NW Legacy Law firm's values of compassion and advocacy, as it helps people during some of the most emotionally trying times of their lives. As estate planning injury lawyers, the firm's legal team helps individuals and families plan for the future, including writing wills, advanced directives, and wise investments to avoid probate.  About the firm:  NW Legacy Law was founded by Thomas Hackett and one paralegal. In the ten years since, the firm has expanded to include four estate planning attorneys, along with a support team comprising paralegals, client intake specialists, and other talented staff members. Based out of Vancouver's historic Officers Row, the firm is conveniently located off Interstate 5. The firm is committed to helping families navigate legal problems that arise after the death of a loved one, and is currently accepting new estate planning and probate clients.
