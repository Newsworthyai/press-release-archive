# Eaton Fire Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Announce Hotline for People Concerned About SCE Refusing Settlements at (833) 200-7111

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Eaton fire lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have launched a new hotline for people who suffered property loss due to the Eaton fire which was likely caused by Southern California Edison. An attorney working for Edison has refused mediation meetings to resolve over 100 lawsuits. These lawsuits were filed against SCE because of the likelihood they caused the fire that killed 19 people and burnt down most of Altadena.  The Wagner Law Group, who is suing Southern California Edison on behalf of fire victims is alarmed the utility company's obvious strategy to delay the legal process for as long as possible. "Delaying the legal process like this is very unethical. What they are basically doing is trying to force people who don't have the resources for a lengthy legal battle to accept extremely small settlements and give up their right to pursue further legal action," says Butch Wagner of The Wagner Law Group.  A spokesperson for Southern California Edison said, "Southern California Edison will not be distracted from its focus of first serving those impacted." Eaton fire attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have experience suing utility companies who's improperly maintained infrastructure causes fire. "This particular situation that SCE is creating is unusually brutal, hiding behind a veil of claiming to help people while intentionally doing harm is completely unreasonable," says Wagner.  Eaton fire lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are aware of a draft being circulated by Southern California Edison that rates for its compensation plan would be based on square footage and extent of damage to affected homes. For example, owner/occupants of a destroyed 1,500-square-foot home could collect $900,000 in rebuilding compensation, plus $200,000 for working with the program and $100,000 per adult for noneconomic damages. Also under the draft plan, each death would bring $1.5 million for pain and suffering, plus $500,000 for each surviving spouse and eligible dependent. Another $5 million would be paid as a premium for going directly through the Edison fund.  "What Edison is doing is deplorable. They are attempting to pressure people into taking a low-ball settlement and leveraging them by refusing to participate in the legal process any more than they absolutely have to. Southern California Edison has set up a program and pressured people to take part while giving up their right to sue to save their corporation money," says Butch. Fire and explosion attorneys at The Wagner Law Group are encouraging anybody affected by the Eaton fire to call the SCE Settlement Hotline at (833) 200-7111.
