# Impressive Play™ launches a new AI soccer coaching stats app

COLUMBUS, OH, October 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Impressive Play™, LLC announces the release of its new AI soccer stats app – a patent pending approach that allows soccer teams to collect over 100 soccer stats per game, without the need to write, type or use video equipment.  "For continuous motion sports such as soccer, coaches haven't had an easy way to take up to 17 soccer stats, reliably. Up to 11 players move simultaneously and when coaches look down to write or type a stat, they often miss other key stats to capture. Soccer coaches, futsal coaches and recruiters can now keep their eyes on the field and capture stats efficiently and inexpensively, simply by using their voice, phone and mic'd earbuds. The AI will capture and collate the stat related comments coaches yell or dictate during an event and assign the data to the players listed in the roster," said Sam Sackett, Founder and CEO, Impressive Play, LLC.  According to The Sports & Fitness Industry Association surveys, there is a decline in American youth sport participation. Players and families often perceive coaching playing time decisions as mostly opinion based. Without reliable data to direct individual and team development, there are factors that can reduce player confidence, damage team morale, reduce player motivation and create a toxic team culture. The new Impressive Play app allows soccer and futsal coaches to make data driven decisions and share player specific data during one-on-one evaluations. The app enables coaches to identify areas for improvement and present real data to players, to help improve transparency, trust and team dynamics.  Participation in youth sports contributes to the mental and physical health of American youth. Coaches spend significant time with youth and need better tools to increase the likelihood each child has a positive experience. At Impressive Play we've taken the time and invested the resources to better understand and prioritize the needs of amateur sport coaches. Our mission is to develop affordable, time saving, sports technology tools that empower coaches to improve team performance, improve team dynamics and celebrate achievements.
