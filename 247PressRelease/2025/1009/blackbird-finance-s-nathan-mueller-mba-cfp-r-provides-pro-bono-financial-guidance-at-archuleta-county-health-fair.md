# BlackBird Finance's Nathan Mueller, MBA, CFPÂ®, Provides Pro Bono Financial Guidance at Archuleta County Health Fair

PAGOSA SPRINGS, CO, October 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mueller, the visionary founder of BlackBird Finance, dedicated his time to educating the four corners community about the crucial aspects of financial wellness at this year's health fair and expo. His sessions included budgeting, debt management, saving strategies, and long-term financial planning. His volunteer work had a profound impact, providing free personal finance guidance to local Pagosa Springs residents and contributing to the community's financial literacy.  "Money stress takes a real toll on people's health," said Mueller. "When people feel more in control of their finances, they sleep better, worry less, and make healthier choices overall. Good financial habits are correlated to good health habits."  Research increasingly supports the connection between our health and wealth. Studies consistently demonstrate that destructive financial behaviors are a significant contributor to chronic stress, anxiety, parents' debt can impact children, negative impacts on relationships and other health challenges, which in turn can then cost people more money due to the increased need for medical intervention. By empowering individuals and couples with financial literacy and confidence, Mueller and BlackBird Finance are actively contributing to the creation of healthier, more resilient communities.  BlackBird Finance, a beacon of support in the community, champions financial education as a public good. The firm's mission is not just about building wealth, but about empowering individuals to 'get good with their money' and thereby improve their quality of life.
