# Florida International University: "Psychiatry: An Industry of Death" Traveling Exhibit Educates Students on Mental Health Abuse

MIAMI, FL, October 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) brought the Psychiatry: An Industry of Death traveling exhibit to Florida International University (FIU) in Miami for a multi-day engagement focused on exposing mental health abuses and the dangers of psychiatric drugging, especially of children. Modeled after CCHR's permanent Los Angeles museum, the exhibit presents a historical and contemporary look at psychiatric practices through immersive audiovisual displays and survivor testimony.  Reaching tens of thousands across the world each year the exhibit is designed to raise awareness on human rights violations such as electroconvulsive therapy, coercive psychiatric practices and the dangerous drugging of children, while empowering individuals with knowledge of their rights in the mental health system. Attendees learn about legal protections and avenues for advocacy, aligning with CCHR Florida's broader educational initiatives on Florida's mental health laws and patient rights.  Hosted by the Florida chapter of CCHR, an award-winning nonprofit that exposes abuse in the mental health industry, the exhibit was toured by students, educators, community leaders, advocates and doctors. Stating that they have seen the abuses shown in the exhibit firsthand, many of these individuals pledged to work with CCHR to help prevent mental health abuses in Florida.  Speakers at the ribbon cutting for the event included Stephanie Anderson, philanthropist, NFL Player Advocate, and president of NFL Sisters in Service, Alfredo Amigozena, president of the Latin American Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Mari Carmen Rodriguez, founder of Iman's Light Foundation and Marta Vega, president of National Community Service.  To end her speech, Stephanie Anderson asked those in attendance to "look around this room and see everything psychiatry has taken from our families, taken the potential from our loved ones, and ignored it for the monetization of drugs or whatever they were pushing at that time. I want you to look around this room, betraying and drugging children, psychiatric crime and fraud, the educators that we've lost, and add NFL players to the list. Add them to the list because that's what's happening right now."  The Florida chapter of CCHR also has a permanent installation of this exhibit located in their center in downtown Clearwater. Unveiled in July of 2015, the Florida version of the Psychiatry: An Industry of Death museum presents the unvarnished history of psychiatry while also providing information on the state of psychiatry today. Consisting of 14 audiovisual displays revealing the cold, hard facts about psychiatric abuses, the museum uses interviews from more than 160 doctors, attorneys, educators and survivors to expose the multi-billion dollar fraud that is psychiatry.  Over 10,000 people have toured the Florida museum including students from nursing schools and technical colleges from across the state who come to the museum to go through the 2-hour self-guided tour as part of their clinical days finding the experience to be informative and eye opening. Coupling tours of the museum with seminars and workshops delivered by attorneys and healthcare professionals on the mental health law, known as the Baker Act, CCHR is working to educate lawmakers, doctors and all private citizens on mental health abuse and their rights under the law. The museum is open from 10:30am until 6pm Monday through Friday and from 2pm until 6pm on Saturday and Sunday. Events are held weekly and monthly. Both are free to the general public.

About CCHR: Initially established by the Church of Scientology and renowned psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz in 1969, CCHR's mission is to eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
