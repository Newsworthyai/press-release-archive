# By Listening To Your Own Intuitive Inner Voice You Can Create Your Own Blueprint For Healing Your Trauma Says Bestselling Author Dr. Kixx Goldman

WILMINGTON, NC, March 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Concerns about trauma have become prevalent in our society today. Trauma has become a popular "buzzword" we all use. It can take many forms. Traumatic events do not fit neatly into categories, nor can they be labeled. They encompass disturbing or sometimes violent experiences which can leave us frightened and anxious. There are "everyday traumas," like failing an exam or feeling criticized by a partner. These are all part of life.  We all wish to heal from our traumatic experiences and that healing can take many forms. Professional help is a choice for some. We can build supportive networks with family, friends or caring groups. We can practice self-care. Education is another path - through education, we can learn ways to make informed decisions, to reduce shame or self-blame.  Dr. Kixx Goldman, bestselling author of 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard - Stories Of Courage And Healing', believes intuition can help us on the journey to healing. Intuition can work in tandem with healing approaches in its power to connect us with our deepest emotions and values, enabling us to make choices that resonate with our personal goals and priorities. The ebook version of 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard' will be available at no charge March 17 through March 19, 2025 at Amazon.  In her bestselling ebook, Dr. Kixx takes readers on a journey that is an illuminating exploration into intuition, resilience, and emotional honesty. Through a collection of eight realistic but fictional stories, she begins to show us key strategies for navigating life's challenges with courage and authenticity. Every one of the stories serves as a compelling testament to the transformative power of honoring one's own inner voice. The key word here is "own". Every form of trauma is unique to the individual, and thus requires an individual approach. The author has a talent that allows her to help guide readers to discover their own paths, without resorting to preaching or promising.  From the struggles of devoted fathers and resilient teachers to the courageous defiance of therapists and survivors, the characters in "Speak from Your Heart" exemplify the resilience of the human spirit and will. Through these stories, readers are reminded of the inherent strength that lies within each of us, inspiring us to heal and reclaim our power. "Speak from Your Heart" is not just a book—it's a beacon of hope and healing, offering readers real insight for navigating life with grace and resilience.  The eight engaging fictional stories in this collection are personal, drawn from experiences in Dr. Kixx's life and the lives of her clients. The characters are tested by everyday traumas...  • A devoted father and his daughter find hope in rewriting their past. • With remarkable grit, a teacher escapes a surprise attack. • To heal his childhood wounds, a man must conquer his fears. • A therapist defies the establishment to protect her clients. • As she confronts the church, a therapist regains her standing. • A woman learns the risks of not speaking out. • By sharing her story and bonding with peers, a woman overcomes her trauma.  As the characters in these stories find the courage to triumph over their challenges, they heal and grow.  Inspired by real life people, characters show readers how to find the courage to transform difficult and traumatic life experiences, speak their truth and reclaim their power.  'Speak From Your Heart and Be Heard: Stories Of Courage And Healing' has received rave reviews from readers and reviewers. Leslie S. Greenberg, PhD, distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, Dept. of Psychology, York University said, " In each story, the characters' resilience is illustrated by how they transform difficult life stories into constructive final narratives. They find the courage to triumph over challenges to heal and they grow. The message of the book: speaking one's truth makes for desired change and healing."  In her review, Liz Moulden said, "The short stories from Speak from Your Heart and Be Heard have given me a second chance and a voice, the voice I never had. What's exciting about this book is each main character in these short stories experienced some kind of abuse/ trauma but each finds their inner voice. With help, they're able to heal. Anyone who has ever experienced abuse or trauma as I have will be able to see snapshots of themselves in these stories."
