# Legend Reborn: Alfa Romeo 2900B Mille Miglia Spider Recreation Joins  DFW Car & Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, March 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A breathtaking tribute to one of the most legendary pre-war sports cars ever built has found a home at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The Alfa Romeo 2900B Mille Miglia Spider Recreation—an exacting homage to the 1938 original—is now part of the museum's renowned collection. Visitors can experience this unparalleled piece of automotive artistry up close, with free admission and a dog-friendly atmosphere making it an unbeatable destination for enthusiasts and families alike.  For the 1938 racing season, Alfa Romeo crafted what many consider to be the pinnacle of pre-World War II sports cars. Built for the grueling Mille Miglia and 24 Hours of Le Mans, the original Alfa Romeo 2900B Mille Miglia Spider was a revolutionary race car featuring a highly tuned inline eight-cylinder engine with double overhead valves, twin superchargers, independent four-wheel suspension, and a transaxle. Only four of these extraordinary machines were ever produced, each surviving today as one of the most revered vintage automobiles in existence.  British classic-car enthusiast Stephen Muir, captivated by the 2900B's legacy, embarked on a mission to recreate this legendary machine when the opportunity to own an original proved impossible. Under the guidance of the Appenine Car Company, Muir commissioned Spydersport of Peterborough, UK to construct an authentic chassis featuring four-wheel disc brakes (inboard at the rear) and proper 19-inch wire wheels with drum brake covers for period-correct aesthetics. Over 18 painstaking months, the aluminum body was hand-formed, ensuring every detail honored the spirit of the 1938 masterpiece.  At the heart of this engineering marvel lies a Weslake-designed straight-eight engine, mirroring the original's unique configuration. Built using two Alfa Romeo Alfetta four-cylinder engines mated together, the power plant features four-cylinder crankshafts with a re-engineered throw pattern for a true eight-cylinder firing sequence. The result: a 3.9-liter masterpiece, topped with quad Weber 40DCOE carburetors, delivering both exhilarating performance and breathtaking authenticity.  Despite an ambitious vision for a limited production run, the Appenine Car Company never secured the necessary funding, making this particular car the only example in existence. A true testament to passion and engineering excellence, it gained widespread acclaim in enthusiast circles, including a feature in the June 1995 issue of Classic and Sports Car magazine.  Now, this extraordinary recreation takes its rightful place in The Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where visitors can immerse themselves in automotive history. Whether you're a racing aficionado, a classic car lover, or simply curious to see one of the finest recreations of a pre-war icon, this exhibit is a must-see.
