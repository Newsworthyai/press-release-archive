# DownTown Mystic Takes One More Chance

NEW YORK, NY, January 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music Inc. announces the worldwide release of the new Digital Single One More Chance by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. The single will be distributed to all the streaming services worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music on January 24. The single drops at Radio on January 14 with Brandon Day/Tinderbox Music handling promo. The One More Chance release follows the successful Better Day Digital 45 from October, setting up the highly anticipated release of The Wish album on April 11. DownTown Mystic's new AI video for the single, created by Joshua Elyashiv of the band SHIV, premiered New Year's Day on YouTube.  The One More Chance single contains 2 songs, including Read The Signs, which features longtime DownTown Mystic Ally Bruce Engler. Besides co-writing both songs with DTM's Robert Allen, Bruce's tasty lead guitar is featured on both tracks, as well as his vocal chops on Read The Signs. The single is a mini opus of sorts. Besides a musical interlude in the breakdown section, One More Chance also features the band recorded jamming live as the track fades out, making a unique musical statement. It's also one of the last sessions recorded by the late great Tommy Mastro on drums (lost in his prime to ALS), who shows off his muscular style, along with some great bass playing from P.J. Farley (Trixter, Fozzy). Read The Signs features DTM's longtime ace rhythm section of drummer Steve Holley (Paul McCartney, Ian Hunter) and bassist Paul Page (Dion, Ian Hunter).  The working relationship between DownTown Mystic Writer/Producer Robert Allen and Singer/Songwriter Bruce Engler goes back some 30 years. Robert co-produced and played on Bruce's 1st album, Go Back, which Sha-La Music released in 2012 and remastered as One More Chance (Feat. DownTown Mystic) in 2021. As with Better Day, DTM offers up another positive message with the new single. Robert Allen comments, "I want to put out positive vibes in the world with my music. It's why I make music. One More Chance is a song of hope and light."  2024 was a whirlwind year for DownTown Mystic, with 7 releases in totalâ€”3 singles, 2 EPs and 2 albums. 2025 is shaping up to be another busy one with momentum building at worldwide Radio and Non-com/College Radio in the US. Having established a wide-reaching global fan base, thanks to significant international radio airplay in over 50 countries, DownTown Mystic has also become one of the top sync-licensed artists creating music today with music in over 240 TV shows and films. The artist has songs sync-licensed in the upcoming films, Sovereign with Dennis Quaid, Nick Offerman & Jacob Tremblay and Everything's Going to Be Great starring Bryan Cranston & Allison Janney. Stay tuned!  "The music bristles with an energy and electricity that rarely subsides." American Songwriter  "Project leader Robert Allen seems to never lose his knack at writing, interjecting his sheer power of musicality over the entire recording with a powerful consistency." Jamsphere Magazine  "Allen has always had a knack for making his music sound vintage with a modern twist."
