# Labor Day Exposé: New Book "Harvesting Children" Uncovers Systemic Failures in U.S. Foster Care System

NASHVILLE, TN, September 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This Labor Day, as the nation reflects on the rights and welfare of its workers, a new book launches a critical investigation into a system tasked with protecting its most vulnerable citizens: the foster care system. Veteran reporter Peter White announces the release of his groundbreaking book, "Harvesting Children: The Dark Side of Foster Care," available for purchase globally on Amazon.  Out of the American South, where community and freedom are core values, a government system designed to help children is failing them. "Harvesting Children" reveals the harrowing true stories of families in crisis who were torn apart by the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (DCS). Through firsthand accounts, White documents the trauma experienced by parents, some who got their children back, and some who did not. The book goes beyond Tennessee, examining child welfare agencies across the United States, where 600,000 children are taken into custody annually, with 400,000 placed into foster care. It is a national crisis that affects both children and adults, exposing a pattern of systemic failure and, at times, outright corruption.  The narrative is powerfully framed by the story of Connie Reguli, a family law attorney who has battled DCS for three decades. After consistently defeating the agency in court, she was framed for a manufactured crime and stripped of her law license. White's reporting doesn't just highlight the problem; it gives a voice to the advocates, lawyers, and insiders fighting for change.  "This is the elephant in the room that everybody sees but nobody knows what to do about. Too many kids are put in foster care. This book explains how they got there and what needs to be done," says author Peter White.  More than an exposé, "Harvesting Children" is an invaluable resource. It features an addendum of writings from leading experts, advocates, and scholars, making it essential reading for sociology students, parents, social workers, judges, lawyers, and anyone concerned with child welfare.
