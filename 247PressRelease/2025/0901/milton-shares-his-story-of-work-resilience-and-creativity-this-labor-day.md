# Milton Shares His Story of Work Resilience, and Creativity This Labor Day

RALEIGH, NC, September 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the nation pauses on Labor Day to honor the dedication, resilience, and spirit of working people, North Carolina author and artist Milton is reflecting on his own journey one that blends public service, creativity, and parenthood into a life dedicated to both family and community.  Born on August 6, 1986, in Henderson, Vance County, and raised in Raleigh, Milton's path has been anything but ordinary. A single father raising four children, with two daughters at home, he embodies the balance of hard work and heart. "My children are my motivation," Milton says. "They remind me every day why perseverance matters."  Before stepping into the literary world, Milton served nearly a decade in the public sector, working with the U.S. Department of Commerce and contributing to the U.S. Census Bureau in both 2010 and 2020. Those experiences deepened his understanding of the diverse fabric of American life and the value of service.  Yet, alongside his professional career, Milton never lost touch with his creative spirit. A chess champion in his youth, he carried the lessons of strategy and patience into adulthood, applying them to his art and storytelling. Today, he is both a writer and an artist, drawing inspiration from sketching, playing pool, and watching inspirational films.  His writing is rooted in authenticity, blending his lived experiences as a parent, an artist, and a public servant. Through his work, Milton seeks to uplift others by showing that creativity, resilience, and love can overcome challenges.  This Labor Day, Milton's story stands as a reminder that the meaning of work goes beyond a paycheck. It is about commitment to family, to community, and to one's own passion. His journey reflects the true spirit of Labor Day: honoring not just labor itself, but the perseverance and creativity that sustain it. And for author Milton Wayne Hanks Jr. that commitment continues to be the driving force behind his art and his words.
