# Timeless Italian Style: 1987 Maserati Biturbo Spyder Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum continues to celebrate iconic automotive craftsmanship with the addition of a rare and elegant Italian convertible: the 1987 Maserati Biturbo Spyder i, now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  A collaboration between Maserati and famed coachbuilder Zagato of Milan, the Biturbo Spyder embodied Italian luxury and performance in a compact open-top package. This particular example is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.5-liter V6 paired with a five-speed manual transmission, delivering a factory-rated 188 horsepower and 208 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels—an exhilarating driving experience from an era of bold Maserati engineering.  Originally finished in Grigio Azzuro, the car was repainted in its current deep blue circa 2010 and is matched with a blue convertible soft top. Subtle Zagato badging and a distinctive front spoiler add to its coachbuilt allure, while 14-inch alloy wheels with Maserati center caps complete the look.  The interior is equally refined, with tan leather upholstery extending across the seats, dashboard, center console, sun visors, and door panels. Rich burl woodgrain trim accents the cabin, while modern updates include a Kenwood CD stereo and an air conditioning system converted to R134a refrigerant.  True to its spirited design, the Spyder features four-wheel disc brakes, a fully independent suspension, and a dogleg-pattern manual gearbox favored by driving purists. The 27,000-mile odometer reading adds to the car's desirability as a well-preserved collector's piece.  Of particular note, this vehicle was designed and assembled by Zagato—one of Italy's most respected coachbuilders known for handcrafting low-production, beautifully styled automobiles. Its inclusion in the DFW Car & Toy Museum highlights the artistry of European automotive design and the unique collaborations that shaped Maserati's legacy.  "Classic Maseratis are known for their daring design and innovation, and this Biturbo Spyder is no exception," said Ron Sturgeon, museum founder and collector. "It's a rare chance to experience one of the few Italian convertibles of the 1980s that combined style, speed, and Zagato's bespoke craftsmanship."  The car is presented with accompanying Maserati-related literature, a window sticker, service records, prior registration documents, spare parts, and a clean California title, offering visitors a complete picture of this beautifully maintained machine.
