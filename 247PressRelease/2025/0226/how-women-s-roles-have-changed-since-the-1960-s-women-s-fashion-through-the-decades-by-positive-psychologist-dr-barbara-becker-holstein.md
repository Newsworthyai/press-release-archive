# How Women's Roles Have Changed Since The 1960's: Women's Fashion Through The Decades By Positive Psychologist Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein

WILMINGTON, NC, February 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Women's roles have undergone a profound change since the 1960's. Women have made dramatic strides in the workplace, our culture, in education and in the political arena. Many barriers have fallen, while many have stayed in place or morphed into something we don't recognize. By examining the shifts in employment, education, and social norms, we can better understand the progress made and the road still ahead.  Bestselling author and visionary Positive Psychologist Barbara Becker Holstein has spent her entire career helping women of all ages build resilience and self-esteem. In an article on her site, titled, "Women's Fashion Through the Decades: Then vs. Now," she addressed some of those changes. In that article she wrote in part:  In the 1960s, women's clothing was often characterized by dresses, skirts, and high heels. The ideal female body image was the hourglass figure, and women's clothing often accentuated this shape. However, as women began to gain more freedom and independence, their attitudes about dressing started to change.  Today, the emphasis is on comfort and personal expression, and women are no longer confined to wearing traditionally feminine clothing. Many women choose to wear pants, sneakers, and other casual clothing, and there is a growing movement towards gender-neutral fashion.  And as we see today, most women do not try to conform to a single idealized body image. This has led to a wider range of fashion options for women, including plus-size clothing and clothing designed for women with different body shapes.  When I was a little girl, the major source of my clothing was via my cousin. If she grew that season then I would come to visit and see folded nicely on a chair the latest new clothes for me. Of course they were technically hand me downs but my aunt took such good care of my cousin's things that they were as close to new as possible. without a stain on them, even though worn by a little girl, starched when they had to be, and folded carefully.  I loved those hand me downs. One reason was that I thought my cousin, who was two years old than I, was beautiful, much prettier than I. She had straight almost black hair that shone in the right light and I had medium brown hair that wanted to be messy and curly but was only messy. I had had my tonsils out when I was two and my mom said the ether had taken away my beautiful soft curls and left me with basically a mess of hair, never quite right.  Let me mention at this point in my essay on clothing that already I'm talking about a different world than you and I live in now. For one thing, washing clothes was in and of itself difficult. When we lived in an apartment my mother had a washing machine. Oh no, it was nothing like you know now. It was a container into which water was taken from the sink in a hose hookup, as hot as possible and then one stirred that mess of laundry round and round until you were exhausted. Then you emptied the water and did more rounds of turning and turning the water that was now cold, as you had to rinse the clothes still full of soap. Finally in exhaustion you emptied the tub and now began the adventure of hanging out the wash.  Every apartment had access to a rope line. Some lines were hanging from one tree to another. Others were hanging from fire escapes, so you had to take your clothes pins and yourself and your wet laundry in a basket and stand on a metal fire escape where you wouldn' want to look down, as it was designed to run down stairs in a fire, made out of iron, and you could look down through all the openings.  That's the way it was when I was little, at our apartment. My aunt had a house and more money than us and so she had to stand in her back yard with a rope that went around tree trunks.
