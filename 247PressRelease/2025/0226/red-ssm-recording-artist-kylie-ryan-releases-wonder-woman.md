# Red/SSM Recording Artist, Kylie Ryan Releases "Wonder Woman"

NASHVILLE, TN, February 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Red/SSM recording artist Kylie Ryan is set to release her newest single "Wonder Woman" to all streaming platforms on Friday, February 28th following its country radio release last week. The music video is set to be released in early April. This 90's country-style track, inspired by Martina McBride and Shania Twain is a deeply personal track that captures the essence of her resilience. "Wonder Woman" is a heartfelt tribute to the everyday heroism of mothers, seen through the eyes of their children. With tender lyrics and a soaring melody, the song reflects her journey as a mother, capturing the awe and unconditional love that kids have for their moms.   Kylie wrote the song with Nashville songwriter, Dustin James, who also co-wrote her first radio single in the U.S., "Long Way Home". She "wanted a song to celebrate women of all types" but being a mom was such an integral part of who she is, it is from this perspective "Wonder Woman" was penned.  At its core, "Wonder Woman" is a love letter to Kylie's childrenâ€”a reminder that, even on the hardest days, moms are superheroes in the eyes of those who matter most. She says that the deep emotional connection she has to her role as a mom "gave her the ability to translate those experiences into a relatable and inspiring anthem." Blending vulnerability with strength, Kylie's performance showcases that even through the toughest days, you can be seen as the strongest woman to those who love you most. Her favorite lyrics are, "Oh, when she says mama, everything's alright." She describes those little moments are what's most important.  Sydney, Australian-born Kylie Ryan draws inspiration from a wide range of genres and her music gives listeners an AC/DC meets Carly Pearce feel with a country-rock flare. After having success on the Australian country music charts, she desired to expand her brand and take her music to the Music City: Nashville, Tennessee. She began writing with hit songwriters and working with established producer Dean Scallan on Music Row which led to the signing of her record deal a year later. Kylie signed a multi-year record deal with SSM Nashville/Red in 2023 and has hit the ground running ever since. Her debut single, "Long Way Home" accompanied by its music video was released shortly after. The follow-up single, "Back in the Saddle" released last summer had great success on the country charts.
