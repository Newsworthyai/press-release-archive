# How Microsoft Power Platform Transforms Business Workflows: Real-World Case Studies

WILMINGTON, DE, February 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Microsoft Power Platform, one of the most popular low-code application platforms, can potentially transform business workflows by significantly impacting various aspects of business including data analytics, low-code application development, process automation and the likes. However, to realize the full potential of the suite of applications, businesses often search for professional Power Platform consultants who will offer specialized solutions to leverage the unique potential of SharePoint.   Evolvous is a Power Platform consultant in Canada, fully certified by Microsoft. For more than a decade, Evolvous has been helping organizations evolve with purpose by making them more resilient and ready for the future. They have successfully delivered Power Platform consulting services to organizations from diverse sectors like manufacturing, construction, financial services, healthcare, retail and more, from countries like Canada, the United States, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Qatar, and Australia.   Here are some cases where Evolvous has helped organizations capitalize on the potential of Power Platform and solved their unique business challenges.   Helping SB Energy Improving Operations by Combining Power BI and Power Apps   Founded by the SoftBank Group, SB Energy SB Energy is a major renewable energy company in the United States. Backed by SoftBank Group Corp. and Ares Climate Infrastructure, the company has successfully commissioned 3 GW of solar energy projects, creating around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs and powering more than 330,000 homes.   The Challenge   On average, they received more than 50 approval requests every day, around half of them were Requests for Information (RFIs). The documents were to be reviewed by a small group of experts working within the Engineering team. The company was struggling to maintain efficiency within the process. They needed an integrated solution which would make it simpler for their team to submit requests for approval.   The Solution   After understanding the process, the team at Evolvous worked on building an application using Power Apps. The app allowed the employee to send approval requests directly to the concerned authorities. Upon receiving the requests, the managers can view the requests, check the documents and if they meet the set standards, approve them with the click of a button. A similar dashboard was also created for their RFI handling processes.   Power BI played a crucial role in the integrated solution as it served them with insights that helped to further optimize the process. All the submitted requests were tracked by Power BI. The Power BI dashboards gave them access to data like average time taken respond to requests, and total submissions. This gave them an idea of the requests that are pending and aided in better planning.   The Impact   After the deployment of the process, the team significantly improved their efficiency. Now, a single admin can effectively handle requests from more than 500 users and respond on time for every single request.   With insights from Power BI, the team at SB Energy can process requests by consuming significantly less time and costs.   Digitizing Dale Carnegie's Vendor Management using PowerApps & Power Automate   For more than 100 years, Dale Carnegie has supported communities to prosper by improving the personal and financial well-being of people and companies. To date, they have helped eight million-plus individuals with their training programs and online courses that offer people the knowledge, skills, and practices they need.   Their Challenges   Dale Carnegie used manual paper-based documentation for managing and tracking the vendors and their orders, which was difficult to maintain and affected their productivity. Tracking lacked visibility. For this reason, Dale Carnegie was looking for a solution that could consolidate all its data in one place and give them the flexibility to operate and manage everything in a single place.   The Solution   The team designed and implemented a custom application using Microsoft Power Apps and SharePoint Online as backend databases to track and manage the new and old vendors and their orders.   The application made it easy to add new purchase order requests and new vendors and itineraries such as vendor ID, dates, shipping details, or any additional attachment. There is also an option to add sub-items to any purchase order. It also had filter functionality along with permission settings for users, where admins had the authority to add or remove vendors and approve or reject orders.   The Impact   Dale Carnegie can now easily and efficiently manage the list of vendors, both old and new. It significantly reduced the manual effort for document collection and processing, preventing delays or errors.   How Guardian Fueling Technologies Saved Hours with Power Automate   With more than 3500 years of petroleum equipment experience and 500+ employees, Guardian Fueling Technologies is a world-class petroleum equipment distributor, fuel system construction contractor, and innovative service provider.   The Challenges   Guardian Fueling Technologies used a third-party website platform for all accounting needs, adding hundreds of new orders and payments monthly. The process is repetitive and time-consuming, requiring a dedicated employee to execute the process   The Solution   To help Guardian Fueling Technologies address these problems, Evolvous chose the robotic process automation (RPA) capability in Microsoft Power Automate. The team automated all manual processes using desktop flow to convert all lower-value tasks to automated ones.   The entire process also leveraged Azure VMs. Power Automate desktop flow will select an available virtual machine configured for this process, create the gateway, and log into the third-party platform.   The Impact   Adding RPA to this process alleviated that mundane, error-prone manual task that had no value-added. It also helped prevent the loss of data or tracking of version history. It also greatly improved processing time and data accuracy, which freed up time to work on more strategic projects and increased job satisfaction.   Like this, Evolvous has helped businesses from across the globe leverage Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate and other components of the Microsoft Power Platform suite. Through their innovative solutions and excellent client support, they are making it easier for organizations to transition from dated systems and inefficient processes to modern, enhanced, scalable and highly efficient workflows.
