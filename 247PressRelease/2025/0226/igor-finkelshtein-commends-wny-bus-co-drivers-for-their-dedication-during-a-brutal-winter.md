BUFFALO, NY, February 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As Western New York inches closer to spring, Igor Finkelshtein, President of WNY Bus Co., is taking a moment to recognize and thank the dedicated team of bus drivers, aides, and support staff who have worked tirelessly to ensure students get to and from school safely throughout one of the toughest winter seasons in recent years.  "Driving a school bus in Buffalo's winter isn't just a job – it's a commitment," said Igor Finkelshtein. "Our drivers have braved whiteout conditions, icy roads, and unpredictable weather while staying focused on what matters most: getting students to school safely. Their professionalism and resilience in these extreme conditions deserve recognition and appreciation from the entire community."  More Than Just Drivers – Winter Weather First Responders With snowstorms piling up and road conditions often treacherous, WNY Bus Co.'s drivers have played an essential role in keeping schools running.

To support them, WNY Bus Co. has implemented several key initiatives this winter, including: - Ongoing Driver Training: Drivers received continued instruction on winter-specific driving techniques, ensuring they were well-equipped to handle icy conditions and reduced visibility. - Comprehensive Vehicle Maintenance: Every bus is routinely inspected, ensuring proper tire traction, heating functionality, and emergency equipment readiness. - Emphasis on Teamwork: Dispatchers, mechanics, and administrators work closely with drivers to provide constant communication and assistance in real-time. - Proactive Communication: Parents and guardians were kept informed of delays and changing conditions through timely updates, helping to manage expectations during severe weather.  "Our drivers aren't just employees—they are professionals who take on the responsibility of transporting our community's children in conditions that would make most people stay home," Igor Finkelshtein added. "They deserve our gratitude and respect for the work they do every single day."  The End of Winter is Near – But the Commitment Remains While February marks the gradual transition toward milder weather, WNY Bus Co. knows that late-season storms and lingering ice can still create hazards. The company remains prepared, continuing to focus on driver safety, fleet maintenance, and clear communication with families.  "Winter may be winding down, but we're always prepared for whatever comes next," said Igor Finkelshtein. "The dedication of our team doesn't change with the seasons—they're committed to safety year-round. I want to personally thank every member of WNY Bus Co. for their hard work and resilience throughout these past few months."
