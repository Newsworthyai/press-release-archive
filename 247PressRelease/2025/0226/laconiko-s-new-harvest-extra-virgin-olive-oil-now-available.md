Three Tips for Choosing High-Quality Olive Oil When it comes to choosing olive oil, there are key factors to consider ensuring you are getting a high-quality product. Laconiko co-founder Diamantis Pierrakos offers these tips:  1. Look for Extra Virgin Olive Oil  Extra Virgin Olive Oil offers superior quality and taste. It is cold pressed, meaning it undergoes minimal processing, preserving the natural flavors and nutrients of the olives.   2. Pay Close Attention to the Harvest Date The harvest date on the bottle provides valuable information about the freshness of the olive oil. Olive oil is best consumed within one year of pressing to retain its optimal flavor and nutritional properties.   3. Go Dark or Go Home - Packaging Matters To protect olive oil from light exposure, it is crucial to choose the right packaging. Select bottles that are opaque and made of either dark glass or metal. Clear glass bottles allow light to penetrate, which can degrade the oil's quality.
