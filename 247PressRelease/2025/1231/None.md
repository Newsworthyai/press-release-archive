# Successful Update of Level Off™ Showcases Enhanced Formula with Loquat (Níspero) Leaf

ST. PETERSBURG, FL, December 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NCL (Natural Cure Labs) announced the successful re-launch of Level Off™, its pre-meal metabolic support supplement, featuring an enhanced formula that now includes Loquat (níspero) leaf extract. The upgrade reflects NCL's commitment to research-based ingredients, clean labels, and transparent testing - helping health-conscious consumers navigate everyday glucose habits with a practical, before-meals routine.   "Customers asked for formulas that are both cleaner and smarter," said Damon Sununtnasuk, Founder & CEO of NCL (Natural Cure Labs). "Level Off anti-spike formula now pairs loquat leaf with a high-value antioxidant blend and our no-fillers standard. We'll keep listening, improving, and investing in ingredients with credible research behind them."   Why Loquat Leaf - Emerging research: Loquat leaf has been studied in laboratory settings for its support of healthy blood sugar levels and metabolic balance. While more human research is needed, these findings make loquat a compelling addition for biohackers and anyone tracking post-meal glucose spikes as part of a wellness routine.‡  - Rooted in tradition: Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) also known as nispero, appears in Herbs of Commerce and in historical Asian medicine practices, where the plant has long been valued for wellness applications.  - Everyday utility: Level Off is designed for healthy adults to take before higher-carb meals, aligning with modern habits like CGM-guided eating, longevity-minded nutrition, and steady-energy goals.   What's New in Level Off - Loquat (níspero) leaf extract added to the formula.  - 317 mg antioxidant blend per serving, built from standardized botanical extracts.  - More value per bottle: 120 capsules / 60 servings (2 capsules prior to meals).  - Clean-label profile: No artificial colors, silica, magnesium stearate, rice flour, or synthetic fillers; vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free.  - Quality & verification: Made in GMP-certified U.S. facilities with third-party testing to help verify identity, purity, and potency.   Commitment to Research-Based Ingredients NCL (Natural Cure Labs) is expanding its product development pipeline around evidence-informed botanicals and clean formulations. The company will continue sharing educational content that clarifies ingredient sourcing, standardization, and testing, so shoppers can make informed choices about glucose, blood sugar, and broader metabolic wellness topics.   Keep an eye on this space: NCL is evaluating additional research-forward ingredients - including berberine and loquat (nispero) - for potential future launches.
