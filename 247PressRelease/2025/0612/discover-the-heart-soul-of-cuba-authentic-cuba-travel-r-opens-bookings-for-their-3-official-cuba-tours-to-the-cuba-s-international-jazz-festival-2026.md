From dawn until dusk, the sounds of music fill the air, with jazz reigning as one of the most cherished genres. Havana's jazz scene is a unique fusion of African, Spanish, Chinese, Mexican, and North American influences, creating a sophisticated rhythm that captivates listeners worldwide. The Havana Jazz Festival serves as a beacon for both local and international jazz enthusiasts.  The International Jazz Festival of Havana is one of the island's largest cultural events, featuring over 100 international acts, including renowned groups like Michael Fleiner's Latin Jazz Septet and the Chico O'Farrill Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, alongside Cuba's most celebrated artists. Festival venues such as the Mella Theatre, Sevilla Hotel, Karl Marx Theatre, and the National Theatre of Cuba provide attendees with the opportunity to enjoy world-class jazz performances in some of the country's most historic settings.  One of the festival's highlights is the spontaneous jam sessions, where artists from around the globe come together to create impromptu music. This unique collaboration among international musicians embodies the spirit of Cuban music and the camaraderie shared by jazz lovers.  Over the years, the International Jazz Festival of Havana has welcomed legendary jazz figures, and 2026 promises to be no exception. Past performers have included icons like Dizzy Gillespie, Luis Monge, and Max Roach, alongside celebrated Cuban musicians such as Chucho Valdes and Bobby Carcassés.  Cuba for US Travelers  US travelers are prohibited from lodging, paying for lodging, or making any reservation at any property that is owned or controlled by the Cuban government. The State Department has published Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List that details the names, addresses, or other identifying details, as relevant, of properties identified as meeting such criteria.  The Cuba Jazz tours operated by Authentic Cuba Travel® include accommodation at 5 and 4 star hotels and independently owned Casas Particulares that are excluded from the Prohibited Accommodations List to make sure that American travelers in general are not directly or indirectly dealing with any of these prohibited entities such as:  - The Grand Aston La Habana, launched in 2022 by Archipelago, the largest independent hotel management group in Southeast Asia.  - The Meliá Trinidad Península, launched in 2024 by Melia Hotels, one of the largest hotel chains in Spain.  Authentic Cuba Travel® takes care of all travel arrangements for the US travelers both in the United States of America and in Cuba, including VISA and flight arrangements via USA ports. The number of commercial flights from the United States to Cuba has surged, thanks to the Obama administration's efforts to restore direct flights. American Airlines, Southwest, Delta, and United now offer numerous non-stop daily flights to Havana from various US cities such as Miami, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, and others.  US citizens can travel to Cuba under a General License for Support for the Cuban People. This allows travelers genuinely interested in supporting the Cubans to visit legally, engaging with privately-owned businesses and independent organizations. Even during the stricter travel regulations of Trump administration in 2020, the Havana Jazz Festival saw a record number of American attendees and performers, highlighting the enduring connection between American jazz musicians and their Cuban counterparts.  The U.S. Embassy in Havana is operating as usual. The latest Cuba Travel Alert from the U.S. Department of State, issued on May 7, 2025, classifies Cuba as Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution, which is the same as to travel advisories for popular European destinations such as the UK, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. While power outages may occur, most tourist facilities are equipped with generators, ensuring a comfortable stay.  Among the standout American jazz performers were Grammy winners Ted Nash on saxophone and vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater. During a press conference in Havana, Ms. Bridgewater highlighted the significance of American musicians serving as cultural ambassadors for Cuba. She expressed, "My presence here signifies my support for Cuba and its incredible musicians. I stand with you." Furthermore, she referred to her participation in the festival as "a continuation of Dizzy Gillespie's legacy of love."  In recent years, American jazz artists and enthusiasts have actively participated in the festival thanks to the General License permissions.  Unlimited Discounts!
