# Author Michael Bennett claims that his new 250-page book, ***Disillusioned Malaise***, presents a clear choice between the Democratic status quo and resolute Republican leadership

MIAMI, FL, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to Michal Bennett, the "differences between Republican and Democratic leadership have never been more pronounced or pivotal." The current Democratic leadership differs significantly and sharply from the results-driven leadership of Republican Congressmen and Presidents in several areas, including the economy, border security, the Second Amendment, foreign policy, freedom of speech, and vital international relations, as America prepares for another season of crucial legislative decisions.  Economic Strength vs. Economic Strain  America's economy expanded at an unprecedented rate under Presidents Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and Trump. Record-low unemployment rates for all groups, including women workers, African Americans, and Hispanics, were made possible by tax cuts, deregulation, and pro-business policies.  Wages rose, and American confidence soared.  Disillusioned Malaise, on the other hand, shows how inflation, interest rates, and the national debt increased as a result of Democratic leadership under Presidents Roosevelt, Carter, Clinton, and Biden. This is emphasized throughout Mr. Bennett's Disillusioned Malaise.  During this time, struggling American families had to contend with growing housing, gas, and grocery expenses, and small businesses faced additional regulations.  Security and Sovereignty vs. Chaos and Confusion  By building more than 450 miles of border wall and enforcing stringent immigration laws, Republican President Trump has recently placed a higher priority on border security and national sovereignty to mitigate the hidden costs of permitting a whole nation of unskilled workers to enter and depress the nation.  Communities were safer and there were fewer illegal border crossings.  These trends emerged during the Democratic-led Biden administration. Drug and human trafficking, as well as record-breaking illegal crossings, have occurred along the southern border under the direction of Democratic Congressional leadership, placing a burden on law enforcement resources and undermining border towns across the country.  Peace Through Strength vs. Global Uncertainty  The goal of foreign policy under Reagan, Nixon, Bush, and Trump was to ensure that our military was rebuilt. Due to America's strong leadership, peace was brought to the Middle East with the recent Abraham Accords, which would not have been possible under the Obama and Biden administrations. China and other trading partners were forced to start over due to our firm stance against unfair trade practices. A strong America improves the world, as our country exemplifies as the President and Congress confront China's unfair trade practices, hold NATO allies accountable, and advance peace through strength.  His administration not only avoided new wars but also raised America's stature in the world.  Disillusioned Malaise is a prime example of the disastrous foreign policy ideals that Democratic leadership has brought about, including the withdrawal from Afghanistan, boycotting the Olympics, ineffective responses to Soviet and Chinese aggression, ineffective relations with oil-producing nations, which has led to an ambiguous relationship with Israel, our single best ally in the Middle East, and rising tensions between Russia and Iran on a global scale.  Freedom First vs. Government Overreach.  Free speech, the right to bear arms, religious freedom, the abolition of slavery, and the ban on unjust civil penalties against minorities are just a few of the admirable constitutional rights that our political right has defended, as Disillusioned Malaise demonstrates.  These conservative governments have always been careful to limit government power while protecting individual liberty.  More federal control, censorship, and the politicization of agencies such as the FBI, DOJ, and IRS have all been emphasized by Democratic policies. The American public is exposed to how government agencies are used to target political opponents and stifle dissent daily through our constantly changing media.  Disillusioned Malaise explores the how and why of these occurrences over decades.  Bottom Line: Choose Between Proven Results and Progressive Decline  Republican presidents are known for their bold, unrepentant, and successful right-wing leadership. Reactive, ideologically driven, and estranged from the average American, Democratic leadership is problematic.  Mr. Bennett stresses that you must vote and make your choices appropriately in Disillusioned Malaise and beyond (in subsequent volumes).  - America First or America Last? - Choosing to have secure borders or open chaos? - Economic prosperity or inflation and instability? - Freedom or federal overreach?  In its 250-page book Disillusioned Malaise, the author reaffirms the importance of American families, workers, and values in restoring American Republican leadership.
