# Jobsite Safety Expert: 'Subcontractors Are the Last to Know in a Jobsite Emergency'

ATLANTA, GA, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the high-risk setting of modern construction sites, time is critical -- especially when seconds can mean the difference between safety and disaster.   But while general contractors and site supervisors are often looped into emergency protocols, one critical group is consistently left out of the conversation: subcontractors. So says Cory Sherman, a jobsite safety expert and founder of Safety Systems Management, a manufacturer of wireless emergency notification systems for the construction industry.   "Despite making up the majority of the workforce on many jobsites, subcontractors are frequently the last to be notified during emergencies such as fires, gas leaks, structural failures, or severe weather events," he noted. "The fragmentation of the workforce on construction sites leads to dangerous communication breakdowns.   Subcontractors move between multiple sites, often don't attend daily site meetings, and rely heavily on verbal or informal communication. That's not good enough in a crisis."  The statistics bear out this disturbing truth. According to a recent industry survey, more than 60% of subcontractors report they have either never received emergency training specific to a site or were not included in direct communication channels for sitewide alerts. With record-setting heat waves, increasing wildfire risk, and continued concerns over jobsite violence, construction companies are under growing pressure to update emergency protocols—and include every worker, not just those on payroll.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to maintain safe working conditions, but enforcement around emergency communication can be inconsistent, especially on large or complex sites.  Wireless emergency notification systems have emerged as a viable solution, offering real-time alerts to every worker—regardless of their employer or trade—through wearable devices, mobile apps, or sitewide audio/visual systems. Unlike outdated and often ineffective methods such as air horns or manual callouts, these systems are fast, scalable, and inclusive by design.  "Too often, the people most at risk are the last to know," observed Sherman. "That's not just a safety issue, it's a moral one. If subcontractors are expected to deliver quality work under pressure, they deserve to be protected just like anyone else on the jobsite."  Industry leaders are beginning to recognize this gap. Several national general contractors have begun mandating that emergency communication systems extend to all site personnel, regardless of employment status. As jobsite safety standards evolve, so must the tools used to protect the workforce. In the case of emergencies, inclusion isn't a luxury; it's a lifeline.  "It shouldn't matter that your subcontractors are not full-time company employees," Sherman insisted. "They are an integral part of each project team. For that reason, they deserve access to the same safety protections and protocols as everyone else on the jobsite."  ABOUT SAFETY SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT Founded in 2016 by pioneering entrepreneur and safety management professional Cory Sherman, Safety Systems Management specializes in wireless emergency notification and communication systems that can alert employees during an emergency through all phases of the construction process.
