# ENDURANCE ICON REBECCA RUSCH LAUNCHES HIGHLY ANTICIPATED NEW PODCAST: "WHAT'S THE RUSCH"

KETCHUM, ID, February 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Endurance icon, Emmy award winner, author, speaker, and entrepreneur Rebecca Rusch announces the launch of "What's the Rusch," a groundbreaking podcast that explores the art of personal transformation through the lens of high achievement. The weekly series premieres February 19, 2025 on all major streaming platforms.  Drawing inspiration from Michelangelo's approach to sculpting—revealing the masterpiece by removing what doesn't belong—"What's the Rusch" delves into the profound journey of shedding the armor we wear and uncovering our authentic selves. Rebecca shifts the spotlight to a deeper truth: the most profound growth often comes not from what we achieve, but from what we let go of.  Each episode of "What's the Rusch" features intimate conversations with some of the world's most accomplished individuals across sports, science, health and wellness, mental health, leadership, and more.   "After a period of significant personal reflection, including a challenging recovery from a concussion and the recent loss of my mother, I realized the importance of slowing down and truly connecting with what matters most," says Rebecca Rusch. "I wanted to create a space for authentic conversations about the human experience – the struggles, the triumphs, and the profound lessons learned in moments of vulnerability."  The inaugural season features an exceptional lineup of guests who bridge the worlds of human performance, spirituality, and creative expression:  -Dr. Michael Gervais (High-Performance Psychologist, Author of "The First Rule of Mastery") on the psychology of peak performance  -Juliet and Kelly Starrett (Founders of The Ready State, NY Times Bestselling Authors) discussing physical intelligence and movement  -Haley Batten (Olympic Silver Medalist) and Kate Courtney (World Champion, Olympian) on redefining success in professional athletics  -Chris Burkard (Explorer, Photographer) and Cory Richards (Photographer, Filmmaker) exploring creativity and adventure  -Dr. Stacy Sims (Exercise Physiologist, Cofounder of STSims Consultants) on the science of human potential  -Kimmie Fasani (Professional Athlete, Cancer Survivor, Storyteller) discussing resilience, nature, and survival.   -Ret USAF Major Gen. Sharon Bannister (retired Air Force, Dentist) discussing grief, performance, and leadership at the highest level.   Each episode weaves together ancient wisdom, modern science, and personal revelation to explore essential questions: What identities have these high achievers outgrown? How have their vulnerabilities become their greatest strengths? What can we learn from their private battles to shed what no longer serves us?  "Blood Road" to Stillness from the Summit Rebecca rose to prominence beyond the endurance athlete world with the release of her Emmy-winning film, "Blood Road". The film chronicles her deeply personal 1,200-mile journey along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to locate the crash site that claimed her father's life during the Vietnam War—a journey that not only uncovered family history but also sparked profound introspection and inspired the creation of the Be Good Foundation.  Another pivotal moment came with a documentary she created in partnership with Feisty Media, which explores her recovery from a "mild" concussion that disrupted her life and athletic routine for years. This experience deepened her understanding of vulnerability, reshaped her perspective on perseverance, and became a key motivator for launching her latest podcast, What's the Rusch.  Through What's the Rusch, Rebecca partners with influential leaders across industries to explore the wisdom gained in moments of stillness—at the summit of their lives and in their quietest struggles. She invites listeners to look inward, examine the outward manifestations of our belief systems, embrace the courage to shed their armor, redefine their identity, and navigate their own extraordinary paths.  Rusch sees the show as more than a podcast; but as an invitation to embrace the courage to find stillness, shed your armor, redefine your identity, and navigate your own extraordinary and adventurous path.  "What's the Rusch" distinguishes itself by creating a unique space where performance meets philosophy, where achievement meets authenticity.  Listeners can subscribe to the show on all major podcast platforms.  Discover more here.   New episodes release weekly starting February 2025.
