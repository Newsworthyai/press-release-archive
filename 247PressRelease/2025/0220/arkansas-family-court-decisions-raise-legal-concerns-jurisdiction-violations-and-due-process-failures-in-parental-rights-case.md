# Arkansas Family Court Decisions Raise Legal Concerns: Jurisdiction Violations and Due Process Failures in Parental Rights Case

FAULKNER COUNTY, AR, February 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Recent developments in a family court case have raised significant legal questions regarding jurisdiction violations, due process failures, and financial miscalculations that have impacted an Oregonian father's ability to be involved in his child's life. Despite neither party residing in Arkansas, Faulkner County Circuit Court continued to make rulings on the case, which many legal experts believe should have been dismissed.  Jurisdiction & Due Process: Legal Inconsistencies in Family Court Rulings  Under Arkansas law, a case should be dismissed if neither party resides in the state. However, records indicate that: •	The defendant, who never resided in Arkansas, was never properly served or given the chance to defend himself. •	A 10-year no-contact order was issued against the father without him having the opportunity to appear in Arkansas court (Case No. 23DR-23-1229). •	Despite the plaintiff's relocation to Arizona in 2024, Faulkner County Court continued to issue rulings on the case, raising serious concerns about jurisdiction. These actions have sparked questions about whether the court adhered to legal processes, particularly regarding the speed and fairness of judicial decisions.  Legal & Financial Concerns in Child Support Orders  In addition to jurisdictional concerns, discrepancies in the court's financial calculations have raised further issues, including: •	A relocation grant provided by CPS was misrepresented in financial assessments. •	Reported mortgage expenses of $22,500 did not align with IRS records, suggesting a mismatch between financial filings and actual ownership. •	Discrepancies in income calculations, based on unverified figures, could have led to an inaccurate child support order. These discrepancies, along with the plaintiff's relocation without proper approval, have drawn attention to potential flaws in how family courts manage financial matters related to parental rights.  Attorney's Responsibility in Verifying Court Filings & Judicial Oversight  An attorney's primary duty is to ensure the accuracy of the documents submitted to the court. In this case, attorney Quincy W. McKinney, representing the plaintiff, filed legal documents that appear to lack essential verification, including financial statements and residency status. Legal ethics guidelines are clear: attorneys must verify the accuracy of the filings they submit. The failure to do so raises critical questions about how these documents were processed and reviewed.  Judge's Oversight & Decision-Making  Despite the apparent discrepancies and lack of verification, Judge H.G. Foster of the Faulkner County Circuit Court continued to approve filings and issue rulings. Given the significant issues with jurisdiction, financial miscalculations, and the failure to provide the defendant a fair opportunity to present a defense, Judge Foster's decisions raise concerns about whether adequate judicial oversight and due diligence were performed in this case.  The responsibilities of both the attorney and the judge are clear: to ensure fairness, verify the accuracy of documents, and uphold the rights of all parties involved. These roles are essential to maintaining the integrity of the legal process, and when these duties are not fulfilled, it undermines the trust in the system that is meant to protect parental rights and ensure justice.  A Call for Transparency & Legal Review  Legal advocates are calling for greater transparency and judicial oversight to ensure that parental rights cases are handled with the highest degree of fairness and due process. When legal errors occur, it is crucial to review and rectify them to uphold the integrity of the legal system.  "The legal system must protect all parents and children equally," said Joseph S., advocate for judicial transparency. "We urge further review to ensure justice is served in cases where procedural concerns have been raised."
