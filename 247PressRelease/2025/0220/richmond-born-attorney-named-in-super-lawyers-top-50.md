# Richmond-Born Attorney Named in Super Lawyers Top 50

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, February 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- At seven years old, taught by his parents that every life matters and has value, David W. Craig decided he'd spend his life championing the underdog.   For him, that meant becoming an attorney, representing severely injured victims of car and truck wrecks. With over 35 years of experience, David Craig has been named in the Top 50: Indiana Super Lawyers list for the third consecutive year. He's been a Super Lawyers Honoree since 2011.  David is one of the founders and the managing partner of Craig, Kelley & Faultless, a personal injury law firm headquartered in Indianapolis. He and two other attorneys founded the firm in 1999. Today, Craig, Kelley & Faultless has 10 attorneys â€” all of whom are 2025 Super Lawyers or Rising Stars Honorees.   David's philosophy is that people matter. They deserve justice, respect, and support in times of need. His father, a psychologist, and his mother instilled this value in him at a young age.   He was born Richmond, Indiana. His family moved to Plainfield when David was in second grade. That's where he met his wife, Dana. He graduated from Plainfield High School in 1978. David attended Indiana University in Indianapolis, where he received a bachelor's degree in business in 1982. His next stop was IU McKinney School of Law, where he graduated in 1985.   David was a young, idealistic attorney when he handled his first commercial motor vehicle case. His client had been severely injured by a dump truck, and David took the case to trial. He secured financial compensation for his client.   In the nearly 40 years since then, David has represented more than 1,000 trucking cases. He is one of only 75 attorneys in the U.S. who are board certified in Truck Accident Law by the National Board of Trial Advocacy.   He has been named in the Top 100 Indiana Trial Lawyers and Best Lawyers in America. He sits on the Board of Regents of the Academy of Truck Accident Attorneys, has received the National Thurgood Marshall "Fighting for Justice" Award, and is a member of the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum.   David has authored two books, Semitruck Wreck: A Guide for Victims and Their Families, and It's Never Been Easier to Hire the Wrong Attorney, which will be released later this year. He hosts the nation's fourth-ranked personal injury podcast, After the Crash, which educates listeners on every aspect of trucking cases.   He is a nationally recognized truck and commercial motor vehicle accident attorney and regularly speaks at seminars and conferences across the country. He enjoys educating other attorneys on the intricacies of semi, 18-wheeler and other commercial vehicle cases.  Two of David's children are attorneys at Craig, Kelley & Faultless. The firm represents the victims of semi-truck, dump-truck, and other commercial vehicle wrecks across the nation. It has attorneys licensed to practice in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa and Tennessee.   David's second son is a professional videographer who does the law firm's settlement videos as well as many of the videos used on the firm's website and social media pages. Dana, David's wife, runs the law firm and has been instrumental to the law firm's success.  David's work, and the work of his law firm, is rooted in compassion and hard work. He believes that human life is valuable, and that negligent companies should face repercussions when their recklessness injures or kills innocent people.   At seven years old, David accompanied his father to visit a man who lived under a bridge in Richmond. David's father worked for the Welfare Department. The man did not like to talk to or interact with others, but he would speak with David's father. David watched his father treat the man with respect and dignity, and he was able to help the man. At the end, the man, who had so little, handed David a baseball.   He never forgot that interaction. It compelled him to fight for the victims of that first dump-truck wreck more than 35 years ago. It compels him to keep fighting for the underdog.
