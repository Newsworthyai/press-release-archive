# Ecco Group USA Invests in TextChat to Future-Proof Contact Centers in the AI Era

MIAMI, FL, February 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ecco Group USA, a leading provider of outsourced customer contact solutions, has announced a strategic investment in TextChat, the AI-driven platform transforming contact center operations. TextChat's software enables outsourced contact centers to scale efficiently, reduce costs, and offer AI-powered solutions to their clients—while ensuring seamless transitions between AI and human agents.  Most contact center platforms still rely on SQL-based architecture, which struggles with real-time AI processing and multi-channel integration. TextChat's NoSQL-powered MetaChannel technology changes that by storing and processing unstructured data in real time, allowing AI to handle and track initial conversations while instantly handing off to agents when deeper engagement is needed. This ensures a fluid customer experience across all communication channels—without the inefficiencies of outdated systems.  AI That Reduces Costs by Allowing Fewer Agents to Do More  Tyson Chavarie, Chief Technology Officer at Ecco Group USA, emphasized the impact of TextChat's technology: "TextChat's NoSQL-based MetaChannel approach lets us unify customer interactions instantly across all communication channels, without the limitations of legacy platforms. AI agents handle routine inquiries while seamlessly escalating to human agents when needed—improving both efficiency and experience."  Randy Bare, Chief Strategy Officer at Ecco Group USA, added: "Most CCaaS platforms weren't built for AI-driven contact centers. TextChat changes that by allowing AI to work seamlessly with human agents across multiple channels, optimizing costs while ensuring superior service."  Redefining the Future of Contact Centers  Eric Kades, CEO of TextChat, reinforced the platform's mission: "AI won't replace contact centers - it will make them more efficient, scalable, and valuable by meeting customers on their preferred channels. TextChat empowers BPOs to seamlessly manage AI-driven conversations across channels, intelligently switching between them while analyzing unstructured data in real time and escalating to agents when needed - capabilities beyond traditional SQL-based platforms."
