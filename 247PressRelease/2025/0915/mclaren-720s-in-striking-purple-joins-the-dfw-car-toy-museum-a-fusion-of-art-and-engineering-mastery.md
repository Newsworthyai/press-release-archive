# McLaren 720S in Striking Purple Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum — A Fusion of Art and Engineering Mastery

FORT WORTH, TX, September 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to showcase one of the most innovative supercars of the modern era: the 2020 McLaren 720S, finished in a stunning shade of purple. Part of the renowned Ron Sturgeon Collection, this vehicle exemplifies McLaren's relentless pursuit of performance, beauty, and cutting-edge engineering.  The McLaren 720S is more than just a car — it is an experience designed to push the boundaries of what is possible in automotive design and performance. With a carbon-fiber Monocage II chassis replacing the traditional metal roof structure, the 720S achieves unparalleled strength and lightness, enhancing both its agility and its aerodynamic profile.  At its heart lies the M840T engine — a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 featuring twin-scroll turbochargers and 16 injectors — which delivers blistering acceleration and a dynamic driving experience that redefines expectations in the supercar segment.  Visually, the 720S strikes a perfect balance between sculptural beauty and raw power. Its sleek, aerodynamic lines represent the next evolution of McLaren's modern design philosophy while remaining true to the brand's commitment to functional simplicity.  "The McLaren 720S is a remarkable blend of technology and artistry," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a car that not only performs at the highest level but also stirs the soul with its design and presence. We are thrilled to offer visitors the opportunity to experience this masterpiece up close."
