# Breacher.ai Releases Agentic AI Educational Bots

ORLANDO, FL, September 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Breacher.ai, an innovator in AI-driven cybersecurity awareness, today announced the release of its Agentic AI Education & Simulation Bots. These are used to provide customized, realistic security training to help businesses protect themselves from modern deepfake threats.  Traditional security training falls short in the face of today's AI-powered attacks. Breacher.ai's new solution moves beyond canned training, deploying personalized deepfake bots that use companies' own executive voices and likenesses in fully interactive, high-fidelity simulations and educational content.  "Seeing is believing, especially when it's your own CEO's voice cloned in a potential attack scenario," said Jason Thatcher, Founder of Breacher.ai. "Initial tests and data point to a 50% reduction in user susceptibility to Deepfake after role playing with a bot."  Key Features: Instant Simulation with Executive Likeness: AI bots clone executive voices for use in highly authentic phishing, vishing, and social engineering scenarios. No IT Integration Required: Deploy simulations quickly and safely in demo or training environments, without lengthy onboarding or security risks. Behavioral Insights & Reporting: Organizations gain real data on how users respond to the most convincing AI threats, and identify gaps that wouldn't appear in standard awareness training. Customizable & Ethical: Every simulation is built with full executive consent and for a clear educational purpose. Educational Content: Role-playing scenarios and interactive sessions allow users to experience Agentic AI and Deepfakes all in one.   AI Enabled Threats: Recent Breacher.ai simulations show 78% of organizations initially struggle to withstand deepfake-based social engineering. After hands-on exposure using executive-based Agentic Bots, over half of users improve their resilience and decision-making under pressure.  "Our simulations make the risk real, and give security leaders and boards the data they need to invest, adapt, and win budget for modern defenses," added Jason. "It's no longer enough to spot a suspicious email; organizations must operationalize human-layer security against AI deepfake threats."  About Breacher.ai: Breacher.ai is a cybersecurity innovator focused on deepfake security awareness training and AI-driven attack simulation. With clients across banking, healthcare, insurance. Breacher.ai empowers businesses to test, train, and upgrade their people-first defense against emerging AI threats.
