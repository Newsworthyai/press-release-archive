# Scott Asner Shares Tips for Preventing Seasonal Pests as Fall Approaches

LEAWOOD, KS, September 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Scott Asner, KC real estate investor and Founding Principal of Eighteen Capital Group, today shared some practical advice to help property owners and renters prepare their homes and apartments before pest problems take hold.  With cooler weather on the horizon, many Kansas City residents are looking forward to crisp mornings, fall festivals, and colorful foliage. Unfortunately, the change of seasons also means that pests such as ants, spiders, and rodents begin searching for warm, sheltered environments indoors.   "As temperatures drop, pests naturally look for safe places to nest and store food," said Scott Asner. "Once they are inside, it can be difficult and costly to remove them. The best approach is to take preventive steps in advance."  Scott recommends a few key strategies that can make a big difference in keeping pests at bay:  1. Seal entry points thoroughly. Small cracks or gaps around windows, doors, and foundations are the most common ways pests get inside. Inspect your home's exterior carefully, paying special attention to areas where utility lines enter. Adding weatherstripping and caulking where needed provides both pest protection and energy efficiency benefits. 2. Keep food properly stored. Rodents and insects are drawn to easily accessible food. Store dry goods such as cereals and grains in airtight containers, and avoid leaving fruit or baked goods uncovered on counters. Wiping down surfaces promptly and taking out the trash regularly further reduces the attraction. 3. Reduce clutter inside and outside. Stacks of cardboard, paper, or firewood can become hiding places for pests. Keep firewood at least 20 feet away from your home, and avoid piling up boxes in basements or garages. A tidy environment makes it more difficult for pests to settle in. 4. Address moisture concerns. Many pests, including roaches and silverfish, thrive in damp environments. Fix leaky faucets, ensure gutters and downspouts are clear, and use dehumidifiers in basements or other moisture-prone areas to discourage pests. 5. Schedule seasonal maintenance. Regular inspections of HVAC systems, roofing, and insulation can uncover small issues before they become larger problems. Many pest control services also offer seasonal checkups to identify vulnerabilities.  "Proactive steps now will save both time and money later," Scott Asner explained. "I always encourage residents to view pest prevention as part of their overall home maintenance plan, just like changing air filters or checking smoke detectors."  In addition to protecting the home itself, Scott emphasizes that pest prevention contributes to healthier living conditions. Rodents and insects can carry allergens and bacteria that affect air quality and overall well-being, making preventive care even more important for families and individuals.  "I hope these tips will help Kansas City residents enjoy everything fall has to offer without the stress of unwanted pests," Asner said. "A little preparation today ensures that your home remains safe, comfortable, and welcoming throughout the season."
