# Applying Trial Logic to the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident

DES MOINES, IA, September 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Chris Johnston, J.D., lead attorney and Des Moines, IA personal injury lawyer with Law Group of Iowa, was a recent guest on the podcast Fade to Black, a show covering UFOlogy, the paranormal, ancient civilizations, history, and conspiracy theories, hosted by Jimmy Church. In this episode, Chris examines the 1947 Roswell incident from the perspective of a trial attorney. He examines evidence, testimony, and witness accounts, and explores the motives of the parties involved.  Chris, a seasoned trial lawyer with 25 years of civil litigation experience, puts the Roswell alien spacecraft report on trial, analyzing the incident as if it were a case to present to a jury. With an absence of physical evidence, witness accounts more than seven decades old, and conflicting press releases from U.S. government agencies, there's a lot to unravel to find the truth, or at least, a truth.  Will the initial announcement from Roswell Army Air Field hold up under scrutiny? Would, Johnston asks, a statement like this, made by the only nuclear-capable air base in the world be released without solid evidence to substantiate it? Chris applies the burden of proof required of civil litigants to the U.S. Army's position, examining the official explanation of 1947 and subsequent explanations released over the last 70 years.  The evidence before Chris and podcast host Jimmy Church includes statements from military officers, civilians, and medical personnel present when the "alien" flying disc was discovered outside of a secure, remote New Mexico military facility. He dissects the testimony of Major Jesse Marcel, the intelligence officer at Roswell, whose story never wavered: what he recovered from the crash site was not a weather balloon.  What's the verdict? We're not going to spoil it here, but what we can tell you is that you've never seen the Roswell alien landing put on trial like this before. By applying logic, critical thinking, and trial strategy to the witness accounts and official press releases, Chris and Jimmy present an enlightening analysis of one of the century's most persistent unsolved mysteries.   The episode aired on May 27, 2025, but you can catch up here and here.
