# Rockin' On Mystic Highway With DownTown Mystic

NEW YORK, NY, September 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music announces the worldwide release of the new Somebody's Always Doin' Something 2 Somebody single and the Mystic Highway EP by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. The single will be released to US Radio on October 7 and Streaming on October 10. The new video for Somebody's Always Doin' Something 2 Somebody is the 1st AI video created by Richard Levinsohn/Rick Lee Vinson Group for DTM. The new EP, Mystic Highway, will be released to all streaming services worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music on November 7 in time for the Holiday season.  Mystic Highway contains 6 songs, including the bonus track Somebody's Always Doin' Something 2 Somebody single, featuring keyboard wiz Jeff Levine (Joe Cocker, Hall & Oates) on Moog, piano & organ. The EP continues DownTown Mystic's pursuit of releasing high quality rock'n'roll in the 21st Century. DTM writer/producer Robert Allen comments, "One of the main features of the DownTown Mystic project are the musicians and the talents they bring to it." Robert continues, "The best piece of advice I ever got was if I wanted to have a great band, then I should be the worst player in it. Upon reflection, I realized that would be one rockin' band! lol" To that end, the EP has the elite rhythm section of drummer Steve Holley and bassist Paul Page, who hold down the groove on 5 of the 6 songs.  Guitars are the main feature of DownTown Mystic and Mystic Highway is no exception. Ace guitarists Lance Doss, Bruce Engler and Justin "JJ" Jordan bring their talents to the mix of straight-ahead rockers. Lance takes on the task of adding his southern edge to the classic RnR of History and Modern Ways. Long-time contributor Bruce Engler co-wrote and sings on Read The Signs, a RnR raga of mystical dimensions, which is also included on his One More Chance album featuring DTM. Justin adds delicate guitar lines and emotional mandolin on the big production piece Some Day. In fact, Justin and Lance along with Steve Holley and Paul Page have a cool RnR side project called The Sidney Green Street Band. Check these guys out!  Sync-Licensing, Streaming and Critical success brought more attention to DownTown Mystic in 2025. Along with significant international radio airplay forThe Wish album, DownTown Mystic continues to be a top sync-licensed artist with music in over 250 TV shows and films. 2025 was a big year with 3 songs sync-licensed in movie soundtracks—2 songs in Everything's Going to Be Great starring  Bryan Cranston & Allison Janney, and 1 in Sovereign with Dennis Quaid & Nick Offerman.   2026 promises to be another rocking year for DownTown Mystic, starting with the On E Street Remix project in January.
