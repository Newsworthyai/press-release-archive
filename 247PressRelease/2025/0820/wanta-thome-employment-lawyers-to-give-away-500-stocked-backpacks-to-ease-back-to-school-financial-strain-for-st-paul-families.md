# Wanta Thome Employment Lawyers to Give Away 500 Stocked Backpacks to Ease Back-to-School Financial Strain for St. Paul Families

ST. PAUL, MN, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To address the mounting financial pressure on local families during back-to-school season, Wanta Thome is launching Project Backpack, a new community initiative. On Friday, August 22, the employment law firm will give away 500 free backpacks filled with essential school supplies to K–12 students and their families at the West Minnehaha Rec Center in Saint Paul from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m.  The event is designed to alleviate the financial burdens families face as they prepare for the new school year. As part of a broader community-focused afternoon at the Rec Center, families will also have the opportunity to receive fresh produce and groceries from Feeding Frogtown, which will be holding its food distribution event at the same time and location.  As an employment law firm dedicated to restoring stability for workers, Wanta Thome recognizes that community support is crucial for success. Project Backpack is a direct extension of the firm's mission to help families in the community feel secure and supported.  "As a parent preparing for back-to-school myself, I know the back-to-school season is a mix of excitement and financial stress," said Shawn Wanta, Managing Member of Wanta Thome. "The cost of supplies adds up quickly, and that pressure is real for so many families. At Wanta Thome, our mission is to restore stability for people who have been wronged in the workplace, and that starts in our own community. Project Backpack is our way of ensuring every student has the tools to succeed from day one, so families can focus on what really matters—a great start to the school year."  Each backpack is stocked with grade-appropriate supplies, including notebooks, folders, pencils, and crayons. To ensure broad access, backpacks are limited to one per K-12 student. While supplies will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, families are encouraged to pre-register online to guarantee a backpack. Over 100 students have already been pre-registered for the event.
