# The Dairy Alliance Powers NC State Students at 10th Annual Moonlight Howl and Run

ATLANTA, GA, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, partners with North Carolina State University to spotlight the performance benefits of real dairy milk at the 10th annual Moonlight Howl and Run on August 21. The signature Wolfpack Welcome Week tradition draws thousands of students for an evening of high-energy activity, and this year's celebration puts dairy milk front and center as the ultimate fuel for student performance.   "The Moonlight Howl and Run gives us the perfect stage to connect with students in a fun, energetic setting and show them how real dairy supports an active lifestyle," said Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing for The Dairy Alliance. "By handing out real dairy milk as students cross the finish line, we help them recover, rehydrate, and recharge with milk's high-quality protein and natural electrolytes for whatever's next."   That recovery boost comes from dairy milk's unique nutrition profile. From powering muscle repair with high-quality protein to replenishing electrolytes after intense activity, real dairy milk offers a proven edge for athletes and active students alike.   "Real dairy milk delivers the optimal balance of carbs and protein for muscle recovery, making it a smart choice for students pushing their limits," said Laura Buxenbaum, Vice President of Health and Wellness for The Dairy Alliance. "We're excited to join NC State Moonlight Howl and Run in fueling Wolfpack pride while showing students that dairy milk is the ultimate performance powerhouse drink."   The first 2,300 participants checking in at Talley Student Union will receive free T-shirts and glow accessories, and The Dairy Alliance Team will be there handing out bracelets, straws, and performance-focused nutrition information. Post-run, NC State staff will be handing out NC States' very own Howling Cow chocolate milk to help participants refuel with real dairy.
