# Most Businesses Lose 98% of Website Visitors — Capturify.io Has Become the Go-To Tool to Turn That Lost Traffic Into Customers

AUSTIN, TX, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For most businesses, as many as 98% of website visitors leave without opting-in, inquiring about a service, making a purchase, or filling out a contact form. For many years now, technology known as identity resolution has been helping large enterprises identify these anonymous website visitors, using it to their advantage to achieve robust sales goals.   Now, an emerging platform is making this same technology available for small businesses with lower budgets. Turning their existing traffic into sales-ready leads without changing a single thing on their website, and helping them to achieve more sales from previously lost website visitors.  Capturify.io, a real-time identity resolution platform, is gaining traction among small and midsize business owners, franchises, and marketing agencies for its ability to identify anonymous website visitors, enrich that data with behavioral insights, and deliver high-intent leads businesses can follow up with immediately.  Unlike traditional lead capture tools, Capturify works in the background. No popups, no forms, and no extra marketing budget required.  "Most small business owners assume their analytics tools are showing them everything they need to know," says one agency partner. "But Capturify reveals the people behind the traffic. Making it a game-changing identity resolution tool for small business lead generation and retargeting."  Making Lead Capture Smarter, Faster, and Easier for Small Businesses  Historically reserved for enterprise sales teams, website visitor identification has become more accessible thanks to platforms like Capturify. Businesses using the platform can see who visited their website, what pages they viewed, how long they stayed, what actions they took — and of course, what their contact information entails — all without coding or configuration.  Capturify's lightweight tracking script installs in minutes, immediately unlocking visitor data enriched with contact details like name, email, location, and in many cases, company information. This allows small teams to follow up directly, push leads into automated email, SMS, or CRM flows, or integrate with ad platforms like Meta and Google for enhanced audience targeting with zero friction.  "It's proven to be one of the easiest ways to obtain qualified leads at the lowest acquisition cost," says a franchise marketer who recently adopted the tool. "We were able to reach out to people who were interested in our services and convert them without running another campaign and spending more ad dollars."  Growing Popularity Among Agencies, Franchises, and Local Service Businesses  Capturify.io is gaining adoption across digital marketing agencies, multi-location franchises, local home service businesses, and professional service businesses looking to unlock more value from their existing web traffic without increasing ad dollars.  Marketing agencies are using Capturify as a white-labeled lead intelligence solution, reselling it to clients and bundling it into higher-tier packages, and giving them a measurable edge in performance and retention.  "One of our clients captured 43 qualified leads in their first week using Capturify — all from website visitors they didn't know they were losing," said one agency founder.  Franchises and local service businesses are deploying Capturify across multiple locations to monitor traffic quality, retarget missed leads, and turn interest into booked appointments or sales — all while keeping overhead low.  Capturify.io is a real-time identity resolution and lead intelligence platform that helps small businesses capture more leads from their website traffic. By uncovering who is visiting a site and what they're doing, Capturify empowers companies to follow up with the right people — at the right time — without needing to increase their ad spend or change their existing tech stack.
