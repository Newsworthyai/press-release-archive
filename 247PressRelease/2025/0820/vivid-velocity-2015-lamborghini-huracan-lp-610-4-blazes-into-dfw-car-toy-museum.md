FORT WORTH, TX, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase the next generation of Lamborghini performance with the arrival of a stunning 2015 Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 Coupe, now part of the celebrated Ron Sturgeon Collection. Cloaked in an electrifying shade of green, this modern Italian masterpiece exemplifies the raw power and sophisticated technology that define Lamborghini's current era.  Under the sleek skin of the Huracán lies a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10, delivering an exhilarating 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a lightning-quick seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, the Huracán's power is sent to all four wheels, providing both thrilling acceleration and confidence-inspiring grip.  "The Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 captures the perfect balance of heritage and innovation," says Ron Sturgeon, Owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a car that delivers pure emotion and precision engineering—an absolute joy to experience up close."  Braking is equally impressive, with green Lamborghini-branded calipers clamping down on cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The car's dynamics are further enhanced with Lamborghini's advanced ANIMA driving modes, allowing the driver to tailor the car's behavior from track-ready aggression to refined cruising. A front axle-lift system ensures that this exotic machine can gracefully navigate driveways and speed bumps alike.  Inside, the Huracán offers a perfect blend of racing spirit and luxury. Heated and power-adjustable black leather seats with striking green inserts complement a meticulously finished dashboard, center console, and door panels. Lamborghini crests embossed on the headrests, Huracán-branded floor mats, and a full infotainment system with navigation round out the cabin's appointments.  The flat-bottom steering wheel integrates a drive-mode selector and frames a fully configurable 12.3" TFT screen, giving the driver an immersive digital experience. Paddle shifters offer full control of the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, bringing the driver closer to the Huracán's motorsport-inspired soul.  Now proudly on display alongside more than 200 rare vehicles and thousands of collectibles, the 2015 Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 invites visitors to witness the evolution of one of the world's most iconic supercar brands.
