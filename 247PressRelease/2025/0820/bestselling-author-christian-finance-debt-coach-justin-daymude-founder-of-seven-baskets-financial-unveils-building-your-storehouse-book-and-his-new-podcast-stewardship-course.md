# Bestselling Author &amp; Christian Finance &amp; Debt Coach Justin Daymude, Founder of Seven Baskets Financial, Unveils 'Building Your Storehouse' Book and his New Podcast &amp; Stewardship Course

MISSOULA, MT, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Justin Daymude, founder and co-owner of Seven Baskets Financial, recently appeared on the Mike Fallat Podcast to share his faith-driven financial philosophy. He established Seven Baskets Financial in 2023 "to help believers…break free from financial bondage, and walk in biblical financial wisdom." In 2025 Justin Daymude published Building Your Storehouse: Thriving in God's Economy, a guide designed "to equip believers with biblical financial principles, strategies, and the faith needed to steward God's provision effectively." According to the Seven Baskets website, the book reveals "God's financial blueprint for believers", reflecting the company's conviction that "everything belongs to the Lord" and that Christians should manage money "with faith and wisdom". These statements underscore Daymude's businesslike, faith-centered mission: helping families organize their finances by biblical design.  Daymude's message is rooted in scripture and personal testimony. He often recounts how he recovered financially after losing everything to debt and poor stewardship. His teaching highlights Deuteronomy 8:18 – "the Lord gives us the power to get wealth to fulfill His covenant" – and he explains that God expects believers to use their wealth to advance the Gospel. In practice, Daymude emphasizes practical steps like the firm's own "Debt-Free Life" program, which guides clients in escaping the burden of debt. By integrating faith with strategy, he shows how financial success can be reclaimed and used for God's purposes.  Looking ahead, Seven Baskets Financial will expand its offerings in 2025. One of the centerpiece projects is The Stewardship Course, an online training "covering biblical financial principles, debt management, asset building, and storehouse creation". In this course clients will chart their money flow (creating a personal "P&L" storehouse blueprint), refine spending habits to eliminate "unnecessary debt," and learn to "sow new seeds" into future wealth. In short, the program teaches how to build and preserve a financial "storehouse" in faith. According to Seven Baskets, this biblical stewardship education provides "practical and spiritual tools to manage [finances] responsibly" in every area of life.  Daymude is also launching The Seed & Harvest Podcast: Faith, Freedom and Finance, a new series of conversations at the intersection of faith and money. The podcast will feature guest interviews on topics like Christian stewardship, generosity, and entrepreneurship from a kingdom perspective. Episodes will highlight Daymude's stewardship philosophy and include his appearances on other shows discussing Building Your Storehouse. By weaving together faith and finances, the podcast aims to inspire listeners to sow in season and reap a harvest of spiritual and material blessings.
