# 23 Unions Unite to Organize Knott's Berry Farm Workers

BUENA PARK, CA, August 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Twenty-three trade unions, together with the Orange County Labor Federation, have launched the UniteKnotts Coalition — a historic effort to organize and represent every worker at Knott's Berry Farm.  Knott's Berry Farm, once a family-run attraction, is now part of an $8 billion corporate enterprise following the merger of Cedar Fair and Six Flags. While executives reap millions, many frontline employees — ride operators, food service workers, and cashiers — earn just $15–$18 per hour, barely enough to make ends meet.  "Knott's Berry Farm was built on community and hard work — but today, it's run by a corporate giant that puts profits before people," said Chris Griswold, President of Teamsters Joint Council 42. "That stops now. Workers deserve a seat at the table, safe staffing levels, and wages that let them support their families. UniteKnotts is how we make that future a reality."  The UniteKnotts Coalition brings together unions representing tens of thousands of workers across industries, ensuring every Knott's employee has access to fair wages, safe conditions, and strong representation.

Nearly 250,000 working Teamsters and retirees are affiliated with the JC 42 family.
