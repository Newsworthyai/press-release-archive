# A Reckoning with Reality: One Man's Mission to Heal the Earth—Before It's Too Late

DALLAS, TX, April 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A Call to Action: The Time to Act Is Now—Before the Earth's Future Is Decided for Us  The clock is ticking—and it is not merely the sound of time passing. It is the Earth's pulse, reverberating through ecosystems, communities, economies, and future generations. In a world hanging precariously between apathy and panic, one man stands at the forefront of a movement that dares to reject the extremes of despair and denial. David Munson Jr., founder of The Get Real Alliance and author of Get Real: A Positive Solution to Climate Change, has made it his life's work to challenge the prevailing narratives around climate change—and to provide a practical, scientifically backed blueprint for global restoration.  For Munson, climate restoration is not about fighting against civilization. It is about understanding and utilizing the tools we already have to bring balance back to the Earth—before it is too late. "We do not need to dismantle modern civilization to heal the Earth," Munson declares. "What we need is to transform how we manage the land that sustains it. Real change begins with real solutions—and it begins now."  The Get Real Alliance advocates for an innovative and regenerative approach to climate restoration. Through carbon-negative farming, responsible oil and gas management, and large-scale land reform that prioritizes ecological balance, the movement provides actionable strategies that promise both sustainability and immediate impact.  A Turning Point in the Fight for Our Planet  What began as a visionary effort sustained by private contributions has now reached a critical juncture. The Get Real Alliance stands at the threshold of something monumental. With new opportunities to present at international conventions, engage policymakers, and educate landowners and stakeholders, the Alliance's vision for a healed Earth is now within reach—but it requires urgent funding to scale.  "We are not just battling climate change—we are battling global inertia," Munson warns. "The systems that perpetuate harm are vast and entrenched. To succeed, we must unite, we must act, and we must act now."  The Ask Is Clear: Stand With Us. Fund the Future.  The movement's success hinges on the immediate backing of those who are willing to take decisive action. With the right financial support, The Get Real Alliance can accelerate its outreach, amplify its legislative impact, and equip communities and policymakers with the tools necessary to implement land-based carbon drawdown solutions. This is not about philanthropy—it is about planetary preservation.  How You Can Make a Difference  David Munson and the Get Real Alliance are calling on changemakers, innovators, and everyday citizens to invest in the future of our planet. This is an urgent mission that cannot afford to wait. Every donation, no matter how small, will directly contribute to scaling this movement—shifting the conversation from inaction to impact. Together, we can restore balance to the Earth and provide a thriving world for generations to come.  Supporters are encouraged to donate directly through Get Real Alliance or contact David Munson.  Innovation with Intention: Partnering for Scalable Change  The mission is further propelled through collaboration with FOI Group, LLC (Full of Ideas), a company dedicated to developing and commercializing planet-positive technologies. Through FOI's leadership, The Get Real Alliance is pioneering innovations in regenerative agriculture, soil restoration, and carbon-negative practices. Together, they are turning visionary ideas into tangible solutions that heal both the Earth and the people who rely on it.  FOI is in the process of launching FOI Equity Inc., a groundbreaking funding arm that invites investors to contribute directly to scalable innovations that have the power to change the world. This is a chance to be part of something far greater than a project—it is an opportunity to take a stand for humanity's future.  "All that is needed to make the world carbon negative while we still use oil and gas is to restore the earth to health," says David Munson.
