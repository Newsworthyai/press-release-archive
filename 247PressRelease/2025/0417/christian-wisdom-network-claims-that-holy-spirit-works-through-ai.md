# Christian Wisdom Network claims that Holy Spirit works through AI

DALLAS, TX, April 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Christian Wisdom Network, an NGO based in Dallas,Texas, Kyiv, Mumbai, and Singapore, has announced its Badge of Honor Award program for unique inspirations its members derive from Bible Verses, whose import is accentuated by newly created HD digital images keyed directly to each verse.  "There are 31,102 verses in the Bible," says CEO Amy Chang, "and we see each one as an invitation, or an open door if you will, to access the power of the Word of God. When someone expresses sincerely how a given verse touched them, inspired them, or rebuilt their Faith, we want to acknowledge them and preserve their words for generations unborn."  How it works: Christians apply to become members of the Christian Wisdom Network community, hosted on Whop.com. After acceptance, they are invited to choose their favorite Biblical verse and write a sentence or tell a story about how it touched them.   If their contribution is judged likely to inspire others, which happens most of the time, the Christian Wisdom Network Badge of Honor is conferred upon the believer. Their words, their name, and a unique work of original art created for the occasion by either human artists or AI (like the ones accompanying this article) appear on the CWN Hall of Fame website, social media, and in the group's academia.edu site, as well as future press releases.  "We put their testimonials in all these places," says Education Director Savannah Partridge, "because we know that years from now some believer, perhaps someone going through a difficult time, will happen upon that witnessing and be inspired by it."  To commemorate each Badge of Honor recipient, a donation is made in their name to four Christian charities: Convoy of Hope, World Vision, Compassion International, and Samaritan's Purse.  A selection of the most inspirational digital images is available on the organization's Etsy site.  The CWN Whop community allows members to join or start discussion groups, share Biblical insights, and post on the forum. Starting in June, if an Honoree's forum contribution receives at least 10 comments, shares, and likes, they will be invited to co-host a Zoom session to discuss their favorite verse.   Churches and other Christian organizations can partner with Christian Wisdom Network to create fundraisers.  Concludes Member Services Director J. Toomey, "Each verse of the Bible can be seen as an ambassador of sorts, a kind of key the Holy Spirit uses to unlock spiritual insights in us. We just want to open up that process, make it available to believers, and recognize them for their inspiration. It's our way of growing the Kingdom together."
