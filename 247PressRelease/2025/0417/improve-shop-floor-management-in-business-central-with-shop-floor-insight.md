EDMONTON, AB, April 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Insight Works, a leading developer of apps for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, announces the availability of Shop Floor Insight, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) designed for barcoded time capture and employee time management. By replacing manual processes with barcode scanning and real-time tracking, the Shop Floor Insight app helps manufacturers manage time, labor, and production more accurately and efficiently—directly within Business Central.   Tailored for production managers, shop floor supervisors, and payroll administrators, Shop Floor Insight brings a new level of visibility and control to manufacturing operations. The app's user-friendly interface and deep integration with Business Central help teams reduce errors, boost productivity, and make faster, more informed decisions.   Transforming Shop Floor Management in Business Central  Traditional shop floor tracking often depends on manual timecards, disconnected systems, and delayed reporting. Shop Floor Insight eliminates these inefficiencies by enabling users to:  - Track labor time using barcodes and mobile devices. - Monitor real-time job progress and machine utilization. - Capture scrap, rework, and inspection data during production. - Simplify timecard approval and payroll integration.  With seamless integration into Dynamics 365 Business Central, Shop Floor Insight ensures that all production and labor data is centralized, accurate, and easily accessible.  Key Features and Benefits of Shop Floor Insight  - Barcode Time Capture: Replace paper timecards with fast, accurate barcode scanning for jobs, production orders, and service orders. - Real-Time Productivity Insights: Gain live visibility into who's working, what they're producing, and where bottlenecks are slowing things down. - Quality and Rework Tracking: Record inspection data and rework reasons on the floor to reduce errors and improve product quality. - Integrated Time & Attendance: The app automates time tracking, shift scheduling, and overtime calculations—all with built-in payroll export. - Visual Scheduling Tools: Use drag-and-drop dispatch lists and shift-based work assignments to optimize labor usage. - Secure Access & Authentication: Enable facial recognition, badge scanning, and user roles for accurate and secure tracking.  Boosting Production and Workforce Efficiency  By integrating Shop Floor Insight with Business Central, manufacturers gain a complete, real-time view of shop floor activity without relying on disconnected tools. Automation reduces manual data entry, while detailed reporting supports more innovative planning and resource allocation.
