# Acme Concrete Raising & Repair Expands Concrete Leveling Services in Chicago Suburbs

CRYSTAL LAKE, IL, April 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acme Concrete Raising & Repair Inc., Chicagoland's first contractor exclusively specializing in polyurethane injection technology, has expanded its leveling and stabilization services for residential, commercial, industrial, and HOA properties throughout the Chicago suburbs.  The company's Smart Lift System® delivers industry-leading results by combining advanced injection equipment, high-performance polyurethane foam, and field-tested expertise. The process lifts, stabilizes, and restores concrete slabs with exceptional speed, precision, and durability—without the need for demolition or replacement. Projects are typically completed within hours, dramatically reducing disruption compared to traditional methods.  Acme raises and stabilizes sidewalks, steps, stoops, patios, pool decks, driveways, and interior floors in warehouses, retail spaces, homes, and other commercial buildings. Their deep-injection foam technology also strengthens subgrades beneath slabs, improving structural support and minimizing long-term risks.  "Many clients face ADA violations, tripping hazards, or structural concerns that impact safety and compliance," said Mike Fetherling, who co-founded Acme with his wife, Trish. "Because we specialize exclusively in polyurethane concrete raising, we deliver fast, clean, durable results that eliminate costly shutdowns, penalties, and liabilities."  Polyurethane concrete leveling effectively corrects height differences, improper pitch, and grade changes that violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Illinois Accessibility Code (IAC). Acme's solutions help properties meet inspection requirements and eliminate liability concerns, with minimal disruption to tenants or operations.  Core applications include: • Trip hazard removal on sidewalks, entryways, and public paths • Repairing settled stoops, steps, porches, and ADA ramps • Warehouse and commercial interior floor leveling • Leveling driveways, garage floors, patios, and pool decks  Unlike multi-service contractors, Acme focuses solely on polyurethane concrete raising and stabilization—ensuring unmatched quality, deeper expertise, and precision superior to outdated methods like mudjacking, inferior poly lift systems, or full replacement.  For a fast, no-obligation estimate for residential, commercial, or industrial concrete raising and stabilization, you can rely on Acme Concrete Raising & Repair Inc.
