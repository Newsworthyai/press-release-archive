# Growth Friday Introduces A Smarter Approach to AI SEO

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Growth Friday, the AI SEO agency trusted by professional service firms, has recently launched a bold rebrand and unveiled its Growth 360 marketing framework. This new approach reflects the agency's mission to help law practices, consultants, architects, and other advisors generate predictable growth by expanding beyond traditional SEO into the AI-powered search era.  For many firms, referrals and paid ads are no longer enough. Rankings shift with every algorithm update, while ad costs continue to climb. Growth Friday addresses these frustrations with its AI + GEO platform, a system designed to strengthen digital presence across Google, LinkedIn, YouTube, industry publications, and even AI-driven assistants like ChatGPT. By optimizing for both search engines and AI-powered platforms, the agency ensures firms remain discoverable wherever prospects are looking.  At the heart of this shift is the Growth 360 framework, which unites four pillars: AI SEO and search optimization, content marketing, paid media, and user experience. This holistic system covers everything from national and local SEO to LinkedIn thought leadership, PR, email marketing, and website conversion improvements. Unlike traditional SEO vendors who focus only on rankings, Growth Friday integrates every channel into a growth ecosystem that builds authority, credibility, and steady lead flow.  Early results highlight the impact. Clients leveraging Growth 360 have seen qualified leads triple in 90 days, reduced dependence on expensive PPC, and higher conversion rates thanks to enhanced visibility in AI-driven search results. For law firms, consultants, and other professional services, the outcome is not just traffic—it's a sustainable pipeline tied directly to revenue and reputation.
