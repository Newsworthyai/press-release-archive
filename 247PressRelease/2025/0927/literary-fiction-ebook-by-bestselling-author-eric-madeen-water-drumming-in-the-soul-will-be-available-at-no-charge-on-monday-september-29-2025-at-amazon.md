# Literary Fiction Ebook By Bestselling Author Eric Madeen, Water Drumming In The Soul, Will Be Available At No Charge On Monday, September 29, 2025 At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, September 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Literary fiction novels take many forms. Most feature deeply developed characters, whose journeys are filled with struggles, triumph, and the complexities of relationships. The overcrowded nature of the literary fiction genre can make it challenging to find something fresh and new: something that has not been seen before. There are but a few that offer unique and compelling story lines that stand out in this jam-packed genre. One such novel is 'Water Drumming In The Soul' by best-selling author Eric Madeen. It has been called a "modern-day classic" that redefines traditional narratives. The e-book version of Water Drumming In The Soul will be available for one day only, this Monday, September 29, at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Eric-Madeen/author/B08VGRNJVW?.  In steamy equatorial Africa, Peace Corps volunteer David Fields is on mission: to build a medical dispensary in a village where spells are cast on enemies and fear of a geek-shaman/medicine man reigns. David seldom has his bearings – cultural or geographical – and must fight a cocktail of tropical maladies as well as social taboos as he throws himself into work. Until... he meets Assam. Captivated by her water drumming, her playing the stream as a drum, David is drawn to her early on and becomes the hunter captured by the game. And what a rollicking game of love it is - with a tension or excitement between them that never dissipates, … until the haunting end.  Like wunderkind best-seller Paul Theroux who inspired him, Eric Madeen will always think of himself as a Peace Corps volunteer, one who, just after graduating from the University of Arizona, constructed in Francophone Gabon, Africa a primary school complex in an equatorial village surrounded by rainforest … where he got lost for three days while hunting monkeys for the cooking pot … and where notably he fell in love, giving his first novel, 'Water Drumming in the Soul' a vigorous fictional reality.  Readers and reviewers have expressed high praise for 'Water Drumming In The Soul'. Zaheer Baber; Professor of Sociology; University of Toronto, said, "Madeen's storytelling prowess shines through and resonates with authenticity. The characters, particularly Assam, are beautifully developed, challenging traditional stereotypes as in presenting a more nuanced and genuine portrayal of African culture."  One Amazon reviewer said, "Water Drumming in the Soul not only tells a passionate love story, but it also delves into thought-provoking themes like culture, identity, and the power of human connection. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that'll have you laughing, crying, and everything in between. This isn't your typical love story! This novel is well-written and full of unexpected twists that keep you flipping those pages. Plus, the characters are so well-developed that you'll feel like you've known them forever. So, if you're ready for a wild and adventurous ride, grab a copy of this modern-day classic ASAP!"  Elizabeth Montano, author of The Eternal Dawn Trilogy, called it " a novel so beautifully and realistically written I found it on par with works by whom we consider masters … Hemingway definitely comes to mind."  Eric Madeen writes cross-genre, and is the author of several books:  Tokyo-ing! - This is an apt word for this bestselling trio of tales chiming with anyone even slightly interested in Asia's most dynamic metropolis and its glazing of layers – be they cultural or taking-wing exuberant. Madeen does deep dives in three fascinating directions and voices, including the persona in first-person female. Then doesn't let readers come up for air because they don't want to -- until the delicious end.  Asian Trail Mix: True Tales From Borneo to Japan, a bestselling travelogue mixes it up on the Asian Trail in a voice that's by turns personal, passionate and ohhhh so very soulful. "So I get up at dawn and marvel at fog burning off into mist tumbling down like the finest mosquito netting of silk. The hills beyond the rivers' confluence, like shoulders of a woman undressing, the way the misty shroud lifts off feminine curves, higher and higher ... I tingle all over, feeling there on Borneo the dream tug of Joseph Conrad's fiction, notably his early Malaya Quartet therein Lord Jim." By turns literarily pathbreaking and intimate, this smorgasbord of travel essays scales down the sprawl of Asia by focusing on the unique and revelatory in gemmy prose. See up close and personal the razzmatazz of novice monks at play in northern Laos, the bonding with hustling pedicab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City, the rainforests blazed on gutsy treks across Borneo and Thailand's Elephant Island and novel things Japanese. Served up nice and spicy, Asian Trail Mix is slathered across 12 rocking-it essays plus a tall tale at its glorious ending, making for a baker's dozen of sumptuousness.  Tennis Clubbed, Snubbed and Rubbity-Dub Dubbed - In historically rich Yokohama, where Captain Perry and his Black Ships cracked open Japan, the wicked shiver of the tennis snub in the postmodern present pits David Adams against K: a puffed-up xenophobic tyrant who rules over the courts of a club that has as its anthem, ironically, the promotion of international friendship, modelled on the world's 2nd oldest tennis club on whose board Madeen had the privilege of serving.
