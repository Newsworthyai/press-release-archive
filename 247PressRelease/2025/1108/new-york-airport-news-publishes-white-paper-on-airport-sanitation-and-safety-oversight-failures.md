# New York Airport News Publishes White Paper on Airport Sanitation and Safety Oversight Failures

NEW YORK, NY, November 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- New York Airport News has published a white paper titled "Systemic Sanitation and Environmental Failures at U.S. Airports," revealing critical lapses in environmental and sanitation oversight across major American airports.  Prompted by the November 5 UPS cargo plane crash at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the report examines how poor cleaning practices, weak contractor accountability, and fragmented federal oversight may contribute to long-term material fatigue and safety risks in aviation infrastructure.  The paper highlights Aqueous Solutions, a Port Authority contractor at JFK Airport, as a case study in how monopolistic service arrangements and inadequate oversight can allow substandard practices to persist. It also outlines regulatory gaps among the FAA, OSHA, EPA, and local airport authorities that leave crucial safety and environmental issues unmonitored.  "Airports are only as safe as the systems that maintain them," said a New York Airport News spokesperson. "This report exposes how neglected sanitation and chemical-handling practices can become aviation hazards in plain sight."  The white paper calls for a joint FAA–OSHA–EPA task force to standardize airport environmental safety audits, greater transparency in contractor performance, and stricter regulation of aviation cleaning chemicals.
