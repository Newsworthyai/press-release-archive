# OFFICE EVOLUTION EXPANDING JACKSONVILLE–TOWN CENTER LOCATION

JACKSONVILLE, FL, November 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Office Evolution®, a leading provider of flexible workspace solutions for entrepreneurs, small businesses and enterprise companies, is expanding its Jacksonville–Town Center location, adding almost 3,000 square feet to bring more offices, amenities and technology to the space at 5011 Gate Parkway, Building 100, Suite 100. This is the second expansion in four years spearheaded by franchise owner Michael Wielgus, who owns two other Office Evolution locations on the First Coast.   "We're proud to unveil the exciting new spaces at our Town Center location, which we've carefully designed to meet the needs of today's businesses," said Wielgus. "We're responding to professionals' desire to work near where they live and limit their commute, offering a more cost-effective way to do business with turnkey, on demand solutions. More businesses are coming to Jacksonville and setting up small satellite offices with us, while others are using our meeting rooms to unite in-office and work-from-home employees. We have solutions for all of them."   Scheduled to welcome new and existing members in early 2026, the expansion brings the Town Center space from 10,562 to 13,549 square feet, adding 14 individual and team offices. When completed, the Town Center location will have 56 offices, three conference rooms, two private phone booths, a coworking lounge, two community kitchens, and a mail center. Technology features will include a private VLAN; a dedicated fiber internet circuit with commercial grade ethernet/WiFi; and an Atlas Sound Masking System for noise reduction and voice privacy. Members will have 24/7 secure access with an entry fob.   "We're also planning to continue offering special networking and social events," Wielgus added, "to build a community and help our members develop friendships, business referrals and partnerships."   Wielgus and his wife, Kelly, opened Town Center in April 2018 and expanded it for the first time in 2021 to accommodate high demand. In 2020 and 2023, respectively, they added two locations: Jacksonville–Bartram and Jacksonville–Brooklyn/Riverside. In all, the three sites support over 800 small businesses, solopreneurs and enterprise companies, representing over 1,300 members. Most members are in transportation/logistics, financial services, legal services, real estate, and information technology.   A resident of Jacksonville for more than 50 years, Wielgus is a Trustee Member of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce and a member of NAIOP, an association of commercial brokers and developers, and the Northeast Florida chapter of the Association for Corporate Growth. He and his wife have been married for over 20 years and have two grown children.
