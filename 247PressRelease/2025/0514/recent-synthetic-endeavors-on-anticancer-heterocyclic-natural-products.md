# Recent synthetic endeavors on anticancer heterocyclic natural products

KNOXVILLE, TN, May 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To find good drug candidates and comment on the current state of furan, quinoline, and indole and their analogs with anticancer bioactivities, a systematic review of synthetic advances was conducted. We found that much work remains to shorten the routes for adaptation for the potential industrial manufacturing of promising heterocyclic natural products.  A notable number of anticancer drugs consist of heterocycles, owing to their capability of interacting with the biotargets like nucleic acids, enzymes, and receptors. Nature has a massive repository of molecules consisting of heterocyclic rings with strong or potentially significant anticancer activity against a plethora of cancer cell lines and tumor micro-environments.  In a review published in the KeAi journal Current Pharmaceutical Analysis, a duo of researchers in India considered three families of natural products containing the heterocycle cores: furan, quinoline and indole, for their in-vitro and in-vivo anticancer activities. They also discussed how their synthesis was carried out.  "We encountered multiple promising anticancer drug candidates, particularly viridin, muricatetrocin B, jimenezin, pancrastatin, quinocarcin, and aleutiananmine, that possessed sub-micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentrations," shares co-author Tirth Chauhan. "This level of activity is required as blood concentrations of such drugs can reach into the low micromolar range."  A key takeaway from the review was that a large proportion of the aforementioned natural products still consists of multiple steps with low yield to be effectively used for trials and subsequent manufacturing.  "Furthermore, minimization of the use of heavy metal or noble metal catalysis is an evergreen goal to promote green chemistry," adds corresponding author Manan Shah.  Relatively new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), database-directed reaction planning, continuous-flow chemistry and electrochemistry can facilitae not only 'green' synthesis, but also convenience.  "Tweaking of ADME (absorption distribution metabolism excretion) may be explored with analogs produced from modular synthesis, to allow purely natural to a nature-like pharmaceutical product synthesis," says Shah.
