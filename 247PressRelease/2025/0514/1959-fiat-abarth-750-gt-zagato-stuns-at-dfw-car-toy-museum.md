# 1959 Fiat-Abarth 750 GT Zagato Stuns at DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An exquisite blend of Italian artistry and racing pedigree is now turning heads at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The 1959 Fiat-Abarth 750 GT Zagato, part of the elite Ron Sturgeon Collection, represents one of the most celebrated examples of mid-century motorsport engineering—crafted with performance, elegance, and innovation in mind.  Built on the Fiat 600 platform, development of the Abarth-engineered 750 GT began in 1955, with its production debut following in March 1956. At the heart of this vehicle's appeal is its hand-formed aluminum bodywork, sculpted by the iconic coachbuilder Zagato in Milan. The double-bubble roof—a signature Zagato design—enhances aerodynamics and driver headroom, while the twin rear intake scoops, aluminum bumperettes, and dual sail panel vents further distinguish the 750 GT as a lightweight contender with serious style.  Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission, with performance aided by a PBS finned oil sump—designed to improve cooling during spirited driving and competitive events. This car's racing heritage is no less impressive: the platform enjoyed significant success in both Europe and the U.S., including a class win in the legendary 1957 Mille Miglia.  "This car is the very essence of what made post-war European motorsports so exciting," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "The Zagato-bodied 750 GT is not only a triumph of engineering and design—it's a celebration of the ingenuity that turned small cars into big winners on the track."  With production concluding in 1960, the Fiat-Abarth 750 GT Zagato remains a rare and coveted gem among collectors and enthusiasts alike. Visitors to the DFW Car & Toy Museum can see this breathtaking racer up close, along with more than 200 vehicles and 3,000 toys and collectibles that celebrate the golden age of automotive innovation.
