CLUB CRUISE™ BREAKING NEWS: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES® ENDS OPEN SEATING — INTRODUCES ASSIGNED SEATS, BAGGAGE FEES & FARE CHANGES  Club Cruise™ Issues Passenger Advisory as Southwest Airlines' 2025 Policy Updates Reshape Travel Booking Expectations  LINCOLN, CA, May 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Club Cruise™, a trusted name in cruise and air travel since 1991, is alerting clients to major policy changes from Southwest Airlines®. Beginning May 28, 2025, travelers will experience new fare bundles, baggage policies, and for the first time in the airline's history—assigned seating. This significant shift ends the carrier's legacy "Bags Fly Free" and open boarding approach.  "Evolving is part of our ethos, and we have done so successfully time after time. There's so much to look forward to," said Bob Jordan, President & CEO of Southwest Airlines®. "We're excited, we're focused, and we're just so honored to have you join us on this transformational journey to an Even Better Southwest."  Southwest Airlines will replace its current fares with three new options: •	Choice Extra •	Choice Preferred •	Choice (These will replace Business Select, Anytime, and Wanna Get Away Plus.) Additionally, the Wanna Get Away fare will transition to a Basic Fare with fewer benefits, final boarding group placement, and no seat selection included.  Club Cruise™ Statement on Southwest Airlines 2025 Changes "Southwest evolving, well I know that well enough," recalls Jef Huber, CEO and Founder of Club Cruise™. "I actually remember being part of the original rollout of Southwest to the Sacramento airport back in 1991—during my Travel Bureau Old School days, I was the SMF Gate Host for Meet & Greet Team. That's a long legacy. Southwest helped boost agency cruise sales with 7,500+ guests on RT LA Mexico cruises making trips more accessible and affordable with $39pp flights and free bags. Now, they're merging back into the herd with seat fees and bundled fares. I understand the strategy, but travelers need to stay alert, as it's a big move away from the past."
