# ARC Clean Technology and Nucleon Energy Sign MOU to Explore Deployment of ARC-100 SMR in Alberta and Texas

CALGARY, AB, May 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ARC Clean Technology Inc. ("ARC") and Nucleon Energy Inc. ("Nucleon") are pleased to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to explore the potential deployment of the ARC-100, ARC's advanced small modular reactor (aSMR) at combined heat and power and electric-only generation sites under development by Nucleon in Alberta, Canada and Texas.  The agreement marks another significant step in the advancement of ARC's commercial deployment strategy in North America, and aligns with Nucleon's development of clean energy sites that can support the decarbonization of heavy industry and regional power grids. Under the MOU, ARC and Nucleon will collaborate to evaluate siting options for ARC-100 deployment, beginning with the inclusion of the ARC-100 in Nucleon's current development work for power generation sites and then progressing toward regulatory licensing in Canada and the United States.  "We are very pleased to be working with Nucleon, a dynamic developer of energy infrastructure projects in Canada and the U.S.," said Robert Braun, Chief Operating Officer of ARC Clean Technology. "This agreement advances our goal of identifying highly strategic partners and sites where the ARC-100's flexible, low-carbon energy solution can support industrial applications and reliable grid power."  The ARC-100 is a 100-megawatt Generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor designed for both electricity and industrial heat applications well-suited to power decarbonization initiatives in oil & gas, refining, chemicals, and manufacturing. The technology is being advanced in partnership with New Brunswick Power (NB Power) at their Point Lepreau site in New Brunswick, Canada. In 2023, NB Power submitted a License to Prepare Site application to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for a commercial demonstration of the ARC reactor, and the utility is also considering ARC technology as part of a plan for additional SMR capacity at the Lepreau site.  "This partnership reflects Nucleon's commitment to building clean, dispatchable energy systems that meet the dual needs of power reliability and emissions reduction," said Dustin Wilkes, President and CEO of Nucleon Energy. "SMRs are an important part of that future, and we are excited to begin this collaboration with ARC Clean Technology."  The MOU establishes a framework for both companies to move toward a long-term commercial partnership, with the potential deployment of multiple ARC-100 units across North America.
