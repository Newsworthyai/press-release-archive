# Notify to Connect with Senior Living Leaders at Argentum 2025

MINNETONKA, MN, May 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Notify, a leader in nurse call and communication solutions for senior living, will attend the 2025 Argentum Senior Living Executive Conference & Expo, taking place May 19–21 at the Tampa Convention Center in Tampa, FL.   Notify will be co-exhibiting with WearTech at Booth #1239, where both companies will showcase innovative, technology-driven solutions to help senior living communities modernize care delivery and communication.   As providers face increasing pressure to streamline operations, reduce staff burden, and modernize outdated systems, Notify will be on-site to share practical, scalable strategies that don't require ripping and replacing infrastructure.   Notify offers two core products aligned with the needs of today's operators:   Notify Overlay – A software-over-hardware platform that integrates with more than 25 nurse call systems to deliver standardized alerts, push-to-talk communication, and enterprise-level analytics—extending the life of existing systems.   Notify Communications App – A WiFi-based, hands-free push-to-talk solution that replaces radios with secure, zone-based communication on smartphones already in use. It offers a fast, cost-effective upgrade for communities needing better communication tools.   Greg Robertson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, and Erich Klett, Director of Strategic Partnerships, will be available throughout the conference to meet with operators and share insights from Notify's work with more than 600 senior living communities nationwide.   "Operators are looking for flexible ways to unify communication and improve response times—without replacing what already works," said Robertson. "We're here to help communities modernize at their own pace, with solutions that are easy to implement and built for real caregiving environments."   Pilot programs are available for both solutions, enabling operators to evaluate fit and impact with minimal disruption.
