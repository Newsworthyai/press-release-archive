# Clinical Psychologists Tony Iezzi, Ph.D., and Melanie P. Duckworth, Ph.D., Release Reenactments: Break the Behavior Patterns That Keep You Stuck in Trauma, Stress, and Everyday Life

PHILADELPHIA, PA, October 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Clinical psychologists Tony Iezzi, Ph.D., and Melanie P. Duckworth, Ph.D., announce the release of their new book, Reenactments: Break the Behavior Patterns That Keep You Stuck in Trauma, Stress, and Everyday Life. The book provides a clear, practical framework for recognizing and changing the brain–body–behavior patterns that keep people looping through the same reactions in both traumatic and everyday situations.   The authors define a "reenactment" as a person's specific pattern of brain, body, and behavioral responses to experiences, and explain why breaking these patterns requires new actions, not just new thoughts. Drawing on decades of clinical, research, and teaching experience, Iezzi and Duckworth introduces the Reenactment Decision Matrix, a two-axis, evidence-informed tool that helps readers evaluate awareness and action so they can choose different responses and build healthier habits. The book includes case scenarios and end-of-chapter tasks that guide readers to identify themes, increase awareness, and practice change in real life.
