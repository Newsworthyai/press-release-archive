# KeycapGuru Launches Portuguese-Layout Keycap Set for Logitech G915 &amp; G815 Keyboards

GUANGZHOU, CHINA, October 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KeycapGuru, a leading e-commerce brand specializing in premium keyboard keycaps, today announced the release of a dedicated Portuguese-language keycap set designed specifically for the Logitech G915 and G815 mechanical keyboards. This Logitech G915 / G815 replacement keycap set addresses a significant gap in the market, providing Portuguese-speaking users with a high-quality, readily available replacement option for their unique low-profile GL switches.  Crafted from durable ABS material and manufactured using a dual-shot injection molding process, these keycaps are built for longevity and performance. This construction also allows for vibrant, seamless backlighting, perfectly matching the original keycaps' translucent properties for a consistent RGB lighting experience. The fit and finish are engineered to be virtually indistinguishable from the original keycaps.  Compatibility is a key focus for KeycapGuru. The set is precision-designed to fit the proprietary Logitech GL linear, tactile, and clicky switches found on the G915 and G815 models.   Understanding diverse user needs, KeycapGuru offers both a full-size set and a Tenkeyless (TKL) version for users who prefer a more compact layout without the number pad.  This launch is a direct solution for the Portuguese gaming and typing community, who have historically faced challenges in finding localized keycaps for these popular Logitech models. Whether users need to replace a single worn-out keycap or desire a complete backup set, KeycapGuru provides a reliable and accessible solution.  KeycapGuru solidifies its position as a comprehensive source for Logitech G915 and G815 keycaps by offering an extensive range of language layouts. In addition to Portuguese, the brand provides sets in US English, UK English, German, French, Italian, Nordic languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish), Japanese, Thai, and Traditional Chinese, making it one of the few online retailers with such a diverse and inclusive catalog.
