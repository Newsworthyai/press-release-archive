# Dolman Law Group Leads the Fight Against Roblox's Attempts to Silence Whistleblowers and Expose Dangers to Children

CLEARWATER, FL, October 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dolman Law Group, led by founding partner and nationally recognized trial attorney Matthew Dolman, is taking a firm stand against Roblox Corporation's alleged efforts to silence whistleblowers exposing the platform's dangers to children. The Florida-based mass tort and personal injury law firm is representing families whose children were groomed, exploited, and, in some cases, physically harmed after being targeted by predators on the Roblox gaming platform.  Recent lawsuits filed by Dolman Law Group allege that Roblox has prioritized profit over child safety, creating a digital environment that enables predators to operate freely. According to the complaints, the company's lax moderation, inadequate safety controls, and misleading public claims have resulted in devastating consequences for countless young users.  "Roblox gives evil individuals another literal bargaining chip to play out their unthinkable fantasies with impressionable children," said Matthew Dolman, Founding Partner of Dolman Law Group. "This case against Roblox and Discord is a terrifying reminder of the world we live in, where capitalist greed far outweighs humanity. There have never been sufficient safety measures in place, and children are suffering unimaginably."  The controversy surrounding Roblox's treatment of whistleblowers has further intensified public scrutiny. One of the most notable examples is "Schlep," a digital safety advocate and whistleblower who independently investigated predators operating on the Roblox platform. Using public in-game data and reporting channels, Schlep uncovered and documented widespread grooming and exploitation involving minors. Rather than collaborating with him to improve child protection measures, Roblox allegedly retaliatedâ€”banning Schlep's account and issuing a cease-and-desist letter to silence his findings. This decision, critics say, underscores Roblox's pattern of protecting its image and profits instead of safeguarding its most vulnerable users.  Dolman Law Group has filed numerous lawsuits across the country, including in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alabama, and California, on behalf of families whose children were allegedly victimized after being contacted by predators posing as fellow players. The firm's investigations have revealed repeated instances in which Roblox ignored warnings and failed to act on clear evidence of exploitation within its community.  Dolman Law Group's legal actions aim not only to secure justice for affected families but also to force systemic reform within the gaming industry. "We will not stop fighting until Roblox and similar platforms are held accountable," said Dolman. "Parents deserve transparency and children deserve safety. This fight is about both."  As a multi-award-winning firm recognized by Best Lawyers, Super Lawyers, and The National Trial Lawyers Top 100, Dolman Law Group is known for its hands-on, client-centered approach and aggressive litigation strategy. The firm has secured over $400 million in compensation for victims of negligence, defective products, and corporate misconduct.
