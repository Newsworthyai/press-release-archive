# 1970 Mercedes-Benz 280SL "Strawberry" 5-Speed: A Tastefully Modified Classic Now on Display

FORT WORTH, TX, October 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to feature a unique twist on a Mercedes-Benz icon: a 1970 Mercedes-Benz 280SL, now proudly on display as part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection. With over $70,000 in restoration work and the addition of a performance-focused five-speed manual transmission, this SL merges classic elegance with an enthusiast's driving spirit.  Originally finished in Silver Metallic with an Anthracite Grey hardtop, this U.S.-market example now wears a rich metallic burgundy repaint—a shade affectionately dubbed "Strawberry" for its deep, unexpected flair. The color, paired with its sleek proportions and timeless W113 "Pagoda" design, makes this 280SL a standout among even the most pristine factory-correct examples.  Under the hood lies the 2.8-liter M130 inline-six, which was resealed during its multi-year refurbishment, ensuring smooth and reliable performance. The real transformation, however, lies in the gearbox: a Tremec five-speed manual transmission sourced from the specialists at Bud's Benz, bringing a new level of engagement and precision to this luxury roadster.  "This 280SL captures the best of both worlds—classic Mercedes design and modern drivability," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a car you admire standing still and absolutely love behind the wheel."  Other highlights include a fully refreshed braking system with new rotors, pads, and lines (2020), VDO instrumentation set into a body-colored dash fascia, and a period-correct Becker Europa stereo in the center console. The five-digit odometer currently shows 87,000 miles.  With disc brakes at all four corners, a rev-happy 7k-rpm tachometer, and the rare pairing of a manual gearbox in a car traditionally equipped with automatics, this 280SL stands out as both a collector's piece and a driver's delight.
