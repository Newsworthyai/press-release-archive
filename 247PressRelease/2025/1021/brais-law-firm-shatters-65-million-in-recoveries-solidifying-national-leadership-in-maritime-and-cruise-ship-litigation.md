# Brais Law Firm Shatters $65 Million in Recoveries, Solidifying National Leadership in Maritime and Cruise Ship Litigation

MIAMI, FL, October 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Brais Law Firm, a nationally recognized leader in maritime, cruise ship, and specialized personal injury law, today announced a significant milestone: the firm has recovered over $65 million in settlements and trial verdicts for clients since 2012. This remarkable track record is underpinned by the team's collective experience, which spans more than 70 years of combined litigation practice.  The firm's success is largely attributed to its specialized focus on complex admiralty and maritime cases, including those arising under the Jones Act, offshore oil rig accidents, and catastrophic cruise ship and boating injuries.  The firm's deep specialization is a key differentiator. Keith Brais, with his background as a former marine engineer and U.S. Coast Guard license holder, brings a technical understanding of vessel operations and safety that few other personal injury attorneys possess. This unique, real-world perspective allows the firm to dismantle corporate defenses and maximize recoveries for injured seamen, cruise ship passengers, and resort guests.  "Maritime law is unlike any other area of personal injury. Success demands a specific type of expertise, not only in the courtroom but in the operational realities of ships and offshore platforms," added Mr. Brais. "Our 70-plus years of combined experience means we're not just learning the law; we're shaping the outcomes that set precedents and improve safety standards across the industry."  The multi-million dollar recoveries highlight the firm's dedication to securing compensation for damages, including lost wages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering. Brais Law Firm continues to offer nationwide representation, ensuring that victims of serious maritime and water-related accidents have access to highly qualified counsel.
