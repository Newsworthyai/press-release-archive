# California Prison Sexual Assault Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Announce Victim Hotline (833) 200-7111

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dublin Prison Sexual Assault Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been helping victims of abuse and other serious injury matters for over 30 years. The U.S. government recently agreed to pay victims of sexual assault at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California. According to the agreement the government will pay $116,000,000 to 103 victims who filed suit.   Prison sex abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group state that the prison had a very bad reputation that was widely known. "Inmates and other people within the prison community were referring to this particular institution as The Rape Club," says Butch Wagner, Founder of The Wagner Law Group. The Justice Department has agreed to pay these settlements. The agreement requires the Bureau of Prisons to open some facilities to a court-appointed monitor and publicly acknowledge sex and physical abuse at FCI Dublin.  Personal Injury lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are pleased that the Bureau of Prisons acknowledged the settlements in a statement. The Bureau of Prisons said they, "strongly condemns all forms of sexually abusive behavior and takes seriously its duty to protect the individuals in our custody as well as maintain the safety of our employees and community."  These prison sex abuse settlements are the beginning of potential lawsuits according the Butch, "This initial settlement doesn't nearly reflect the number of inmates who were abused. We expect there are many more people who have been victimized by the FCI Dublin prison."   Injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group want to stress that any victim of sex abuse or sexual assault by a prison employee anywhere should call the Prison Abuse Injury Hotline. "We want to help anyone we can who has been victimized as a result of misconduct at any prison," says Butch.  Injury Attorneys at The Wagner Law Group want people to know that according to recent allegations there have been abuses at the Chowchilla Prison. According to reports the correctional staff at the Central California Women's Facility assaulted a group of imprisoned women with pepper spray and rubber bullets to retaliate after inmates filed sexual abuse claims. There is a recent federal lawsuit pursuing these claims.  Chowchilla prison abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are aware of thirteen women who are currently serving sentences in the Chowchilla prison that filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California earlier this month. They claim the leader of a correctional officer "prison gang" was the master mind of a violent assault against 159 women in one housing unit.  Victims of abuse as a result of being in custody withing the prison system are strongly encouraged to reach out to the Prison and Abuse Hotline to seek council on their potential options for receiving compensation for their injuries. "We are very responsive and try to help any person who has been a victim of abuse by the people who are in power within the prison system." Says Butch. "The Prison Abuse Hotline is (833) 200-7111."
