# The Pros and Cons of Masseter Botox®: Jaw Pain Relief vs. Potential Facial Changes

ATHENS, GA, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For patients who suffer from jaw tension, teeth grinding, or TMJ pain, Botox® injections in the masseter muscle can bring significant relief, and in some cases, ease chronic discomfort that has lasted for years.  "It is unbelievable how much masseter Botox® can help functionally with bruxism," said Dr. Chelsea Venditto, board-certified plastic surgeon and owner of Avenue Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery. "We see everything from patients with long-standing TMJ issues to those with more mild or moderate grinding who don't need injections at the normal schedule of every three months. Some can go six months or longer between treatments."  The procedure is now also popular for aesthetic purposes. In patients with masseter hypertrophy–meaning large, overdeveloped jaw muscles–Botox® can help soften a squared lower face into a more heart-shaped silhouette, which can help reduce the appearance of a heavier or more aged face.  Still, as with any cosmetic treatment, there are questions about long-term use. Some have raised concerns about whether repeated weakening of the masseter muscle could, over time, contribute to facial hollowing or sagging."The concern is that if the muscle flattens too much over time, the surrounding soft tissue could shift forward slightly and contribute to jowling," said Dr. Venditto. "But in my opinion, that would take years of ongoing injections. If it happened after just a few treatments, it would likely be a very subtle change."  Masseter Botox® involves injecting small amounts of botulinum toxin into the chewing muscle at the angle of the jaw. The treatment takes about 15 to 30 minutes, requires no downtime, and results develop gradually over two to four weeks.
