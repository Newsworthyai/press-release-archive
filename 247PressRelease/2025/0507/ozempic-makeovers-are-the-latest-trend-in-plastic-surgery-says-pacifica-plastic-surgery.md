# "Ozempic Makeovers" Are the Latest Trend in Plastic Surgery, Says Pacifica Plastic Surgery

SANTA BARBARA, CA, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The surge in popularity of GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic® and Wegovy® is giving rise to a new trend in cosmetic surgery: the "Ozempic makeover." Pacifica Plastic Surgery, led by board-certified Santa Barbara plastic surgeon Dr. Daniel Kolder, offers personalized body contouring procedures designed specifically for patients who have experienced significant weight loss, whether due to these medications, bariatric surgery or diet and exercise regimens.   "Many patients come to us thrilled with their weight loss results but are frustrated by excess skin that hides their progress," says Dr. Kolder. "A so-called 'Ozempic Makeover' can be a life-changing next step that allows them to feel fully confident in their results."  Similar to a "mommy makeover," an "Ozempic makeover" describes a customized combination of cosmetic surgery procedures that, in many cases, are able to be performed in a single surgery. These procedures are typically aimed at reducing excess skin and stubborn fat left behind after achieving significant weight loss. Popular procedures included in an "Ozempic makeover" include abdominoplasty, liposuction, breast lifts and arm lifts.   The best candidates for this type of combination after-weight-loss procedure should be at or near their target weight and have maintained a stable weight for a few months prior to plastic surgery. While body contouring procedures after weight loss have obvious cosmetic benefits, they may also significantly improve mobility, comfort and overall quality of life.   Anyone considering post-weight-loss plastic surgery, popularly referred to as an "Ozempic makeover," can contact Dr. Kolder and his team by calling 805-484-2855 to schedule a consultation.
