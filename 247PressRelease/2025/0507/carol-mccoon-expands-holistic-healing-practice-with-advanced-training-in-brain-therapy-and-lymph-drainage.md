# Carol McCoon Expands Holistic Healing Practice with Advanced Training in Brain Therapy and Lymph Drainage

EAST ROCHESTER, NY, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Carol McCoon, a dedicated practitioner of holistic healing, continues to expand her expertise with advanced training at the Chikly Health Institute, deepening her commitment to providing transformative care to her clients. With a focus on Brain Therapy and Lymph Drainage Therapy, Carol integrates innovative, hands-on techniques that promote relaxation, self-healing, and pain relief.  "My work is about listening to the body's innate wisdom and facilitating its natural ability to heal," says Carol. "Every individual has a unique path to wellness, and I'm here to support that journey with the most effective, evidence-based therapies available."  Advancing Expertise in Brain and Lymphatic Therapy  In February 2025, Carol successfully completed the second course in a series of Brain Therapy studies developed by Dr. Bruno Chikly, an esteemed pioneer in manual therapy techniques. In April 2025, she will further her education with the third course in Lymph Drainage Therapy, followed by an advanced Brain Therapy course in February 2026. These specialized programs are designed to help practitioners refine their skills in addressing neurological and lymphatic dysfunctions, enhancing their ability to provide targeted relief to clients.  "The more I learn, the more I see the profound connections between the brain, the body, and overall well-being," Carol explains. "These courses are reinforcing my ability to visualize inner brain structures, recognize areas of restriction, and gently guide the body toward optimal function."  A Unique and Personalized Approach to Healing  At the core of Carol's practice is an intuitive and scientific approach that merges cutting-edge therapy with traditional healing principles. Her ability to sense the subtle shifts within the brain and body allows her to identify areas of restriction and facilitate deep, restorative change. Clients frequently describe her sessions as both deeply relaxing and profoundly effective in reducing pain and enhancing mobility.  "I recently worked with a client experiencing persistent leg pain," Carol recalls. "By addressing restrictions in their pituitary gland, I was able to facilitate the release of three distinct areas in their leg, providing immediate relief. These results demonstrate the power of Brain Therapy and the body's incredible capacity for self-correction."  Expanding Access to Transformational Care  In addition to furthering her education, Carol has recently expanded her practice by securing a secondary office space to accommodate clients who have difficulty with stairs. The new location offers a flexible, pay-as-you-go model, ensuring accessibility for all who seek her services.  "I want to create an environment where healing is accessible and personalized," she says. "Having a second space allows me to meet clients where they are, both physically and in their healing journey."  Empowering Clients Through Education and Classes  Carol believes that true healing extends beyond individual sessions, which is why she offers a variety of classes designed to help clients take an active role in their own well-being. Her classes cover topics such as sound therapy, energy balancing, and self-care techniques, providing attendees with practical tools to enhance their health and relaxation at home.  "Education is a vital part of healing," says Carol. "I want my clients to leave not only feeling better but also empowered with the knowledge to sustain their well-being long-term."
