# Eastern Shore Cosmetic Surgery Now Offers Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy

FAIRHOPE, AL, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Eastern Shore Cosmetic Surgery is proud to announce the addition of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) to its growing lineup of wellness and aesthetic services. Designed for both women and men who are experiencing symptoms of hormone imbalances, this treatment offers a natural, personalized approach to health and wellness.   What makes BHRT unique from other types of hormone therapies or medications is its use of bioidentical hormones, which means that they exactly match the chemical structure of the hormones naturally found in the body. This can help to resolve a number of symptoms such as hot flashes, fatigue, mood swings, brain fog, acne, weight gain, low libido and many others without resulting in the unwanted side effects that are sometimes seen with the use of synthetic hormones.  "Many of our patients don't realize that their symptoms could be related to hormone imbalances," says Dr. James Koehler, cosmetic surgeon at Eastern Shore Cosmetic Surgery. "By offering bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, we're able to take a more comprehensive approach to health and wellness, addressing the root causes of these symptoms and helping our patients feel their very best."   The BHRT at Eastern Shore Cosmetic Surgery is managed by Mary Emma Pitman, a certified registered nurse practitioner with a wealth of experience in BHRT. Each treatment plan is customized based on each patient's individual hormone levels, lab results and specific symptoms. Because ongoing care and medication adjustments are needed with BHRT, this program is offered as a membership plan. Membership plans include customized wellness plans, one-on-one messaging with a skilled provider, follow-up labs, B12 injections and discounts on med spa services.

At Eastern Shore Cosmetic Surgery in Alabama, Dr. James Koehler and his talented staff provide today's most popular cosmetic surgery and nonsurgical options. Choose from breast enhancement procedures such as breast augmentation, body sculpting procedures including liposuction and tummy tucks, and facial procedures such as facelifts, nonsurgical services like BOTOX Cosmetic, and wellness treatments including bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.
