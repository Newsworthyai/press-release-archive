# From Spreadsheets to SEO Rankings: Australian Helps Accounting Firms 3–5x Their Enquiries with Google

SHERIDAN, WY, May 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ellie's marketing agency, Conversion Zoo, started offering done-for-you SEO strategies for accounting firms after getting requests and referrals from ex-colleagues.   She focused on optimizing her clients' Google Maps listings, revamping their websites for conversion, and creating content that attracts the right kinds of clients.   And the early results speak for themselves: clients are seeing 3-5x more inquiries through Google, often within just a few months.  To share the strategies behind her success, Ellie has also launched a podcast called Conversion Zoo, where she interviews other marketers and firm owners about what actually works when it comes to local SEO, digital marketing, AI, Google Maps rankings, and conversion copywriting.  Topics include local SEO, content writing, AI-powered tools, business strategy, entrepreneurship, and how to stand out in an industry where most websites look and sound the same. Most of Ellie's clients don't even having a call booking platform set up.  "I didn't leave accounting because I didn't like it — I left because I fell in love with SEO and marketing," says Ellie. "Helping accounting firms get more clients through Google is the most fun I've had in business."   Ellie understands the unique challenges that accounting firms face — from compliance to trust-building — and country-specific tax information. From this, she has developed a marketing approach that's effective, accurate, and easy to implement.  For accounting firms looking to grow sustainably — and finally get found online — SEO might be the most underrated channel out there.
