# American Time's EverAlert System Integrates with Raptor Technologies to Deliver Unified Campus Safety Communication

DASSEL, MN, October 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- American Time®, a leader in synchronized time and campus communication systems, today announced two-way integration between its EverAlert® system and Raptor® Technologies' Emergency Management System. This combined solution advances school safety by delivering rapid, consistent, and automated campus-wide communications—both for everyday use and in the most critical emergencies.   Support for The "I Love U Guys" Foundation's Standard Response Protocol (SRP) is built in, giving schools a nationally recognized framework with a clear, shared vocabulary for emergency response, while also ensuring compliance with mandates such as Alyssa's Law requiring silent panic alert systems directly linked to law enforcement.  This integration builds on the daily utility of EverAlert while harnessing Raptor's advanced emergency response workflows:  Everyday Familiarity, Emergency Readiness — EverAlert supports daily synchronized time scheduling, announcements, and audiovisual messaging across classrooms, hallways, and common areas. Because these devices are a trusted, everyday source of information, occupants instinctively turn to them during critical events for reliable emergency guidance.  Automated Response — Through Raptor Connect™, EverAlert ties directly into Raptor Technologies' automated emergency response sequences. When a crisis alert is activated—such as a lockdown or evacuation—EverAlert instantly carries out pre-configured messaging and instructions across designated zones, minimizing manual steps and accelerating coordinated response.  Synchronized Response Across All Devices — When an alert is activated with a simple push of a button, EverAlert displays and speakers broadcast the appropriate message, tone, and instructions campus-wide or to targeted zones, ensuring speed and clarity.  Compliance & Consistency — The integration supports state and federal safety mandates, such as Alyssa's Law.  Seamless Infrastructure Fit — Schools and districts already using Raptor or EverAlert can adopt the integration without rework of their existing system architecture.  "Standardization, speed and familiarity save lives," said Chris Noell, Chief Product Officer at Raptor Technologies. "By bringing together Raptor, SRP, and EverAlert, we are helping communicate instantly and consistently across every corner of a campus."  Tim Leung, VP of Engineering & Operations at American Time added, "EverAlert's strength lies in being both a daily operations tool and a crisis awareness system. Because students and staff already engage with EverAlert for schedules and announcements, they trust and understand its messaging when emergencies occur."  This integration is now available nationwide, giving districts a unified solution for everyday communication and emergency management that aligns with national safety protocols.
