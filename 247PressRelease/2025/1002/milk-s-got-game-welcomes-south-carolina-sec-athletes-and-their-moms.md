# Milk's Got Game Welcomes South Carolina SEC Athletes and Their Moms

ATLANTA, GA, October 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This season, Milk's Got Game continues to shine a spotlight on the people behind the players: their moms. The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, teams up with athletes TJ Moore and Nyck Harbor and their mothers, Alexandra Moore and Saundra Harbor, to show how real dairy milk fuels strength, recovery, and peak performance.   "Behind every great athlete stands a mom who makes sure they have what they need to succeed," said Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at The Dairy Alliance. "This campaign continues to celebrate the moms who fuel their athletes with love, guidance, and real dairy milk — the natural sports drink that helps athletes recover, stay strong, and perform at their best on and off the field."   The Milk's Got Game campaign highlights the nutrition behind players' performance. With help from their moms, TJ Moore and Nyck Harbor fuel their training routines with real dairy milk, which delivers 8 grams of high-quality protein in every serving to support strength, recovery, and energy. As the MVP of performance and everyday wellness, real dairy milk delivers the power athletes and fans alike need as a valuable part of active lifestyles.   "We are proud to join The Dairy Alliance and highlight how Milk's Got Game," said Emily Waggoner, a South Carolina dairy farmer. "From our farms to their families, real dairy milk delivers the nutrition and strength to fuel athletes on the field and at home."   "My mom made sure milk was always part of my daily routine," said wide receiver TJ Moore. "It kept me fueled for practice and gave me energy to push harder on the field. Even today, it helps me stay strong and recover faster."   Alexandra Moore added, "Supporting TJ means giving him what he needs to perform at his best every day. Real dairy has been part of that foundation from the beginning."   "Dairy milk gave me the edge growing up and continues to support me as I train and play," said wide receiver Nyck Harbor .  Saundra Harbor said, "From breakfast to after-practice recovery, real dairy milk has been a consistent part of Nyck's routine. It's simple, reliable, and it works."   Milk's Got Game® highlights the link between family, nutrition, and athletic excellence — showing that success starts at home and carries all the way to the college playing field.
