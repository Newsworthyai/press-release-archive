# Pixflux.AI Launches AI Image Editing Platform for Ecommerce Sellers and Creators

SHENZHEN, CHINA, October 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pixflux.AI today announced the public launch of its cloud-based image editing platform designed for online sellers and creators. The service centralizes core workflows for product photography — removing backgrounds, changing scenes, cleaning watermarks from owned assets, enhancing clarity, and removing stray objects—so users can produce marketplace-ready visuals with minimal effort. The release is available globally and aligns with the growing demand for fast, consistent visuals across ecommerce storefronts and social commerce.  At launch, Pixflux.AI includes five tools that address common catalog and listing needs: Background Remover, Change Background, Watermark Remover, Photo Enhancer, and Remove Object. The Background Remover isolates subjects for clean, consistent presentation and can be used as a first step in a rapid workflow. Change Background then places the item in on-brand scenes or neutral canvases for thumbnails, PDPs, and ads, supporting style consistency across collections.  For brand and rights compliance, Watermark Remover is designed for assets you own or are authorized to edit, helping teams replace legacy overlays when refreshing catalogs. Photo Enhancer improves detail and lighting to boost clarity on mobile and desktop views, while Remove Object cleans small distractions such as dust, scratches, or background props. Together, these tools are built to reduce manual retouching steps and shorten time-to-publish for merchants, agencies, and independent creators.  "Our vision is simple: make AI image editing as intuitive as upload–download, so every seller, creator, and developer can produce pro-grade results in one click." — Martin, CEO  To learn more about the platform and start producing consistent, marketplace-ready imagery, visit Pixflux.AI.
