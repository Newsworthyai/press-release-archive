# From Personal Loss to Sonic Brilliance: Shuying Li Releases Landmark Album with RMN Classical

LONDON, ENGLAND, October 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Internationally acclaimed composer Shuying Li breaks new ground with her latest album — a bold collection of wind ensemble works performed by some of America's most prestigious ensembles. Released on Friday, October 3, 2025, by UK label RMN Classical and produced by Rick Romano, the album will be available worldwide on all major streaming platforms.  Spanning nearly a decade of her career, the recording captures Li's journey from personal tragedy to creative triumph. The album opens with In This Breath (2025), performed by the Baylor Wind Ensemble under J. Eric Wilson, featuring Li herself at the piano. Written during a period of profound grief, the work is both an elegy and a rebirth. Wilson reflects:  "In the midst of unexpected tragedy, music can provide society respites of reflection to help process grief and loss. In similar fashion, Shuying Li's In This Breath is a deeply intimate and poignant response borne from personal circumstance. The work's transparent vulnerability is juxtaposed with impassioned declarations of love and loss. In This Breath is a moving and powerful tribute that both reveals and honors life's most precious blessings."  The album's sweep extends far beyond this opening. In Luminance (2023), performed by "The President's Own" United States Marine Band under Jason Fettig, Li transforms winds into radiant currents of color and energy. Fettig notes: "Li's music is both viscerally engaging and endlessly colorful… She writes beautifully for the special capabilities of winds, and her works will continue to be an essential part of our contemporary canon."  Starry Ocean (2024), brought to life by the Arizona State University Wind Ensemble under Jason Caslor, conjures shimmering sonic landscapes. Caslor calls it "a shining example of how she can create a soundscape that takes all involved on a wonderful journey."  With Kung Fu (2019), performed by the Illinois Wind Symphony under Kevin M. Geraldi, Li merges cultural tradition with universal ideals: "Her music has exceptional expressive depth, vibrant instrumental color, and detailed craft… Kung Fu captures the spirit and philosophy of her Chinese culture with an aspiration for a harmonious society."  The Eastman Wind Orchestra under Luke Camarillo delivers Slippery Slope, a dazzling debut work for winds. "Slippery Slope reaffirms that she is, without doubt, one of the most distinctive and compelling composers currently writing for winds," says Camarillo. The album concludes with The Last Hive Mind (2018), performed by the Foot in the Door Ensemble under Glen Adsit, a daring early work that foreshadows Li's mature voice.  A Composer's Journey  Reflecting on the release, Shuying Li shares:  "This album captures the unfiltered energy of live performance, infused with breath, adrenaline, and spirit. In This Breath was born from grief and marks my return to composing, while The Last Hive Mind reflects the beginnings of my creative voice. Together, these bookends chart both my journey and the endless possibilities ahead. I am deeply grateful to the conductors, ensembles, and the wind band community that continue to inspire and champion me. This album is a celebration of that journey—past, present, and still unfolding."
