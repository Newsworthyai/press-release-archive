# Tania "Lash Queen" Guarin Opens Shop at the Salon &amp; Spa Galleria in North Richland Hills

NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, TX, October 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tania Guarin, a/k/a Tania Lash Queen, is pleased to announce the opening of her new salon at the North Richland Hills Salon & Spa Galleria on Rufe Snow Drive. Ms. Guarin chose the location because she was looking for "a professional, cozy, and exclusive space to offer high-quality services while also inspiring and training other women to start their own lash businesses."  Tania is known for her warm, personal approach, her focus on safety, and her fully customized applications that are tailored to each individual client's eye shape and lifestyle. "I'm Columbian and passionate about beauty. For over 3 years, I've been dedicated to transforming my clients' looks through lash extensions, helping them feel more confident and beautiful." In fact, she is so certain of her ability to meet and exceed her clients' goals that she offers something especially unique for the beauty business – a satisfaction guarantee. Simply put, "If the client doesn't love the result, they don't pay."  Tania trained with professional lash educators in Dallas, then went on to expand her knowledge and expertise by garnering multiple certifications in advanced techniques, hygiene, safety, and business management. Services offered at her new salon include eyelash extensions (classic, hybrid, volume, mega volume, and premium volume), as well as lash lifts, lash removal, brow design (waxing or razor) and brow design with henna tint. She also offers professional eyelash extension courses and mentorships, for beginners and experienced lash artists alike who'd like to improve their skills and/or grow their own businesses.  Tania Lash Queen's salon is located in Suite #120 at the Salon and Spa Galleria on 7720 Rufe Snow Drive in North Richland Hills, TX. Appointments are available between the hours of 7:00am and 7:00pm from Monday through Sunday and can be made by contacting the salon at (682) 261-7472 (texts welcome) or by booking online. In celebration of her grand opening, Tania is offering new clients a free brow design with any lash extension set.  According to Tania, "My journey is the same as many women's: I dreamed of being independent, working from home, and building something of my own. Today, I'm living the dream and helping others achieve it – whether through my services or by teaching them how to start their own lash business."  With her choice of a professional suite at the Salon & Spa Galleria, she joins a group of like-minded individuals who are each able to offer specialized beauty and wellness services in their own private and luxurious salon setting.
