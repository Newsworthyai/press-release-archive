# A Vintage Vision in Motion: 1929 Ford Model A Speedster Boattail Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A dazzling throwback to the golden age of motoring, this 1929 Ford Model A Speedster Boattail has found a fitting home in the Ron Sturgeon Collection, where its artful styling and mechanical charm take center stage. Refurbished and rebodied under prior ownership, this custom speedster evokes the spirit of open-road adventure and hand-built elegance.  Powered by a 201ci inline-four engine paired with a three-speed manual transmission, the car has been upgraded with a Stromberg 94 carburetor, Ansen intake manifold, and mechanical drum brakes. The powertrain delivers vintage performance true to the era, while red 21″ wire-spoke wheels and a boattail rear offer eye-catching period flair.  Finished in a classic white and green paint scheme, the car features custom touches throughout—like a running board-mounted spotlight, burgundy bucket seats, a rear-mounted spare wheel, and twin white storage compartments. Suspension consists of solid axles and transverse leaf springs at both ends, staying faithful to the Model A's original engineering roots.  Inside, the driver is greeted by a four-spoke steering wheel, a dash wrapped in alligator-style upholstery, and a white-faced barrel speedometer flanked by coolant temperature and amperage gauges. A wood floorboard, lap belts, and a passenger-side grab handle complete the cockpit's vintage-racer vibe.  "This car is an incredible example of creativity meeting craftsmanship," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's the kind of piece that makes you smile before it even starts."  Equal parts nostalgia and custom artistry, the 1929 Ford Model A Speedster Boattail stands as a rolling tribute to early American ingenuity—with personality to match its polished performance.
