# Dr. Barbara Taber Serves Up Another "Take It Or Leave It" Appetizer with Exclusive Podcast Ahead of July's Landmark Podumentary

SUFFOLK, VA, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The acclaimed podumentary series Take It or Leave It: Dr. Barbara Taber Speaks is back with a sharp new teaser ahead of its highly anticipated next installment. In keeping with her tradition of offering substance over spectacle, Dr. Barbara Taber releases another standalone podcast to set the tone for what's coming in Lesson 13—slated for release in July.  This latest installment is an audio-only feature—no video, no music, no frills. It is titled "The Jen Kiggans Story and Other Assorted Rabbit Holes," and is drawn directly from unused material recorded during the production of the upcoming podumentary proper. It dives deep into several key issues that didn't make the final cut—but still demand attention. While the feature podumentary is still weeks away, this podcast gives audiences an early glimpse at the insights, critiques, and revelations that will soon take center stage.  "In every episode of the main show, there's content that doesn't make the cut," says Dr. Barbara Taber, the celebrated educator, author, and unapologetically direct host of the Take It Or Leave It series. "We felt these eight minutes were too important to miss, plus it'll give audiences everywhere something to think about in the run up to this consequential new episode."  Lesson 13, which is titled He's Baaaack!, is a consequential one indeed, marking the first show since Donald Trump's return to the presidency. With the news cycle now moving at breakneck speed, the stakes are higher than ever—and Dr. Taber is right back where she thrives most: in the trenches, dissecting the chaos with unflinching clarity and conviction.  Dr. Taber adds: "It feels like we're right back in 2020, and I mean that in the worst possible way. All the old tactics are back—and then some—so my job is to remain fair, balanced, and brutally honest, especially when few others will."  "The Jen Kiggans Story," being an audio-only presentation, is a quick and effective way to share some of that raw, unfiltered commentary that helps frame what's coming next. Think of it as a teaser—or maybe an appetizer—before the main course drops in July.  According to the show's producers, He's Baaaack! has been long in the making and is expected to be one of the most compelling and direct entries in the Take It or Leave It catalog. As always, Dr. Taber confronts the facts head-on, this time pulling no punches on the local, national, and political forces shaping our country's future.  Until then, listeners can tune in to "The Jen Kiggans Story and Other Assorted Rabbit Holes" to get a head start.  The new podcast episode is available now.  He's Baaaack! (Lesson 13) premieres this July.  For more information, visit Dr. Barbara Taber's official website.  Be sure to explore her debut book, available now on her author's page—new chapters coming soon!
