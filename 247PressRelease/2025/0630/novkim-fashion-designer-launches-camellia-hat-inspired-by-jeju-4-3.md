# Novkim: Fashion Designer Launches 'Camellia Hat' Inspired by Jeju 4.3

NEW YORK, NY, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Novkim, the high-end fashion label founded by Korean fashion designer Minbeom Kim, has introduced its latest creation, the Camellia Hat—a powerful symbol of remembrance for the victims of the Jeju 4.3 Incident and a heartfelt call for peace.  Kim, who studied fashion design at the world-renowned Istituto Marangoni in Milan, blends luxury fashion with cultural storytelling in this new piece. The Camellia Hat takes inspiration from the resilient camellia flower, which has become a symbol of both grief and hope in connection to Jeju's tragic past.  "As a designer trained in Italy's finest fashion tradition, I felt a strong responsibility to go beyond aesthetics and connect my work to the stories and spirit of my homeland," said Kim. "This hat reflects not only my technical expertise developed at Istituto Marangoni, but also my personal journey as a Korean deeply moved by the history of Jeju."  Founded in 2016, Novkim has earned recognition for its bold, unconventional style, appealing to a niche audience that values artistic vision over trends. But the Camellia Hat signals a broader mission: to make meaningful design accessible to more people, merging emotional storytelling with everyday wearability.  "This is more than just an accessory," Kim explains. "It's a messenger of peace, democracy, and remembrance—created with refined craftsmanship and rooted in real purpose."  The Camellia Hat not only showcases Kim's signature design language—shaped by his experience at Istituto Marangoni—but also serves as a heartfelt homage to Jeju's legacy, inviting wearers to reflect on history, resilience, and the hope for a peaceful future.
