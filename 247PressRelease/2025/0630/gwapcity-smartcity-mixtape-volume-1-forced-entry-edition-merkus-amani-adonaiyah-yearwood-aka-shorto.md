# GwapCity SmartCity Mixtape Volume 1 – Forced Entry Edition MERKUS AMANI &amp; ADONAIYAH YEARWOOD AKA SHORTO

NEW YORK, NY, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Gun & Prayer: Protecting Purpose in Sound  CANADA | USA | SOUTH AFRICA | JAMAICA | TRINIDAD & TOBAGO | ZIMBABWE — The GwapCity SmartCity Mixtape Volume 1 is complete. What began as a spark has become a full-fledged statement of resilience, purpose, and presence.  A Prophetic Soundscape: Gun & Prayer This volume is presented as a cassette-themed album — Side A opens with the voice of the Prime Minister of Trinidad & Tobago, urging citizens to remain alert and prepared. Side B begins with a solemn, anchoring prayer — a reminder that some battles are fought best on your knees.  The result is a raw, rooted project that reflects both the struggle and the sanctity of protecting one's calling.  Recording Hubs This mixtape was recorded across multiple continents, connecting grassroots studios to a global message: - Zimbabwe – Luveve, Gwabalanda (SyBix Entertainment Group & 787 Entertainment) - Trinidad & Tobago – 3IO Music Group - Los Angeles, USA – Big Mil Studio - St Mary, Jamaica – (Studio pending update) - South Africa – (Studio pending update)  Production Credits – A Tale of Two Hemispheres The sonic foundation of GwapCity SmartCity Mixtape Volume 1 was crafted entirely by Shorto (Adonaiyah Yearwood) of 3IO Music Group, Trinidad & Tobago. Every beat across the mixtape — regardless of region — originated from his visionary catalog of riddims.  But what makes this mixtape historic is how its final sound was shaped across hemispheres: - Mixing & Mastering (Americas & Caribbean): All songs recorded in Trinidad, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States were mixed and mastered by Shorto himself — ensuring a polished, unified sound rooted in Caribbean authenticity and technical excellence. - Mixing & Mastering (African Hemisphere): Songs recorded in Zimbabwe and South Africa were mixed and mastered by Street Keys, a 2025 high school graduate from Bulawayo. Despite his age, his production ear and technical execution signal the arrival of a major talent from the African continent.  This dual-engine production approach symbolizes the global bridge at the heart of the SmartCity vision: youth and veterans, continents and cultures, converging through shared purpose.

A symbolic landing moment: from the storm to solid ground.
