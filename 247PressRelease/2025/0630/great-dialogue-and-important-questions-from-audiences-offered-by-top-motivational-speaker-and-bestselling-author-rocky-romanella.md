# Great Dialogue And Important Questions From Audiences Offered By Top Motivational Speaker And Bestselling Author Rocky Romanella

WILMINGTON, NC, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As a top keynote speaker, Rocky Romanella spends a good deal of time speaking to groups of people, large and small, most of whom hope to take away actionable ideas regarding leadership. Balanced Leadership is an umbrella term that encompasses all the skills necessary to achieve excellence in all facets of one's life, both business and personal. In a recent newsletter, Romanella shared some important questions posed to him by audience members in his recent keynote addresses:  Tell me about your definition of SUCCESS and a Successful Leader.  I believe the definition of success can be summarized in a person who can add immediate value as a leader, trusted advisor, mentor, and visionary who has a process approach.  As an organization you have a strategic vision, as an individual you also need a strategic vision, but you also need the ability to execute tactically the strategy. In these leadership roles you must develop a strategy, build a business plan, and execute that plan.  You do this by providing clear communication and walking the talk. A successful leader will coach their teams to take better control of their day and balance multiple priorities, measuring and following up for continuous improvement, and accepting responsibility for their P&L. A successful leader must have the ability to assess quickly and effectively:  • who you are • what you stand for, and • what you will never compromise  More importantly, a leader's strategy and vision must match the organization's vision and strategy, and how it corresponds to what your people, your customers and investors believe to be your strategy and the company's strategy and vision. Companies need to deliver advanced technologies with operational excellence through their dedicated people who are the best, brightest, most informed, and best educated in their industry.  What are your thoughts on education both formal and informal?  I believe people learn most things through the environment they are in, the experiences they have, and the people they engage with. I do not believe I was born with something special that made me better than others or gave me a leg up.  I am of the opinion that our values and skills are actively developed and are influenced by both the positive and negative experiences in our lives and utilized or can remain dormant depending on our desires and motivation. Success is an individual thing and each of us has our own measure of success and desire for success.  For example, I had a simple education, Catholic grammar school, public High School, Catholic college that was a commuter college as I worked my way through school. This ability to get good grades and work during college helped me to learn how to multi-task. A lesson and experience I had to use throughout my career.  Most learning came from experiences throughout my life and key leaders who touched me in good and sometimes less then desirable ways that I had to work through.  Do you have any quotes you live by or think of often?  Yes, there are a few that have become 'Rockyisms'  • Never allow anyone to affect you more than you can affect yourself. • You are the architect of your own destiny. • The Speed of the Leader Determines the Pace of the Pack…. Set the pace • Sometimes we Lead, Sometimes we Follow and Sometimes we go where they need us to go.
