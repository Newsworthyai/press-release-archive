# ReVessel Bridges the Gap Between Biology and Data with AI-Driven Blood Models

CORAL GABLES, FL, June 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ReVessel, a pioneering health-tech company, has announced the development of the world's first digital twin of human blood—a real-time, AI-powered simulation platform that mirrors the hematologic and hemodynamic state of each individual. This groundbreaking technology transforms blood from a biological substance into a dynamic, encrypted data layer, enabling personalized modeling and clinical decision-making.  Unlike traditional static models, ReVessel's platform continuously integrates multi-omics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical indicators to provide customized simulations tailored to each patient's unique profile. By fusing these data streams, ReVessel empowers healthcare systems to move beyond one-size-fits-all transfusion and treatment decisions, offering a more nuanced, data-driven foundation for delivering care.  At the heart of ReVessel's platform lies its digital twin engine—an AI-powered model that replicates each individual's blood dynamics in real time. This simulation engine transforms biological complexity into interactive, predictive insight, enabling health systems to forecast how blood responds to different conditions, treatments, or stressors. By delivering simulation-powered insights in under 200 milliseconds directly at the point of care, ReVessel supports clinicians in making faster, more informed decisions.  Designed for interoperability, ReVessel supports standard clinical data formats such as EMR, FHIR, and OMOP, enabling integration via secure APIs without requiring infrastructure overhaul. This approach allows hospitals and health systems to gain immediate value from ReVessel's digital twin technology without costly overhauls.  ReVessel is currently in early-stage development and is not yet commercially available. The company is actively collaborating with clinical advisors, research institutions, and ecosystem partners to co-develop and validate its platform. As the technology roadmap progresses, ReVessel is seeking strategic investors and collaborators who share its vision for building the infrastructure behind personalized blood management.
