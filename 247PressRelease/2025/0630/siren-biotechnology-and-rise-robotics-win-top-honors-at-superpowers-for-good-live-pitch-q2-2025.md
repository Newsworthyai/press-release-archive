Dr. Nicole Paulk, Founder and CEO of Siren Biotechnology, captured the SuperCrowd Award, selected by popular vote from the global livestream audience. Hiten Sonpal, CEO of RISE Robotics, earned the Judges' Choice Award after impressing a panel of expert investors with his company's breakthrough solution for energy-efficient industrial motion systems.  "These two winners embody the very spirit of what Superpowers for Good is all about," said Devin Thorpe, founder of The Super Crowd, Inc. and host of the event. "Dr. Nicole Paulk's pioneering cancer therapies offer real hope for people facing some of the world's toughest diseases, while Hiten Sonpal's RISE Robotics is disrupting a century-old industry to make heavy equipment greener and more efficient. I couldn't be more proud to shine a spotlight on both of them."  About the Winners  Siren Biotechnology is developing a novel class of cancer treatments that promises more targeted, less toxic therapies. With a strong foundation in gene therapy and cutting-edge biotech research, the company is poised to become a standout player in a multi-billion-dollar sector.  "Nicole lit up the stage with a bold vision and deep credibility," Thorpe said. "The audience recognized her ability to translate breakthrough science into a business with profound social impact—and massive upside potential."  RISE Robotics, led by Hiten Sonpal, is revolutionizing motion systems for heavy machinery with a proprietary electromechanical actuator that replaces inefficient, leak-prone hydraulic systems. Their solution dramatically reduces energy consumption and emissions while cutting costs and increasing revenues for their customers.  "Hiten was grilled by some of the sharpest minds in impact crowdfund investing and emerged with flying colors," said Thorpe. "RISE Robotics checks all the boxes—sustainability, scalability and a clear path to profitability."
