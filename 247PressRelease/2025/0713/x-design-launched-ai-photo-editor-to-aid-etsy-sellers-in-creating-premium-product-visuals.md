# X-Design Launched AI Photo Editor to Aid Etsy Sellers in Creating Premium Product Visuals

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, July 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- X-Design recently launched its AI Photo Editor 1.0 version. This update introduces premium product image backgrounds designed to assist Etsy sellers. Non-professional sellers can create high-quality product listings in a single click. They no longer need to hire photographers and spend hefty sums on aesthetic setups. This update has created a new collection of visuals that are ideal for all the lifestyle-inspired products on the platform.

It captures the kind of honest, handcrafted feel that Etsy sellers and their customers truly care about.  The Hidden Struggles of Etsy Sellers: Product Photography Woes Product photography is not easy. It requires skill and advanced equipment to capture high-quality shots. Etsy sellers who are just starting their journey with this e-commerce giant often face tough competition from the sellers who have established themselves over the years.   Time Consuming and Expensive-Etsy sellers have multiple products in their stores. And one styling option may not suit all products. That's why sellers usually end up spending too much on styling the product backgrounds for product photography.  Lighting is Hard to Get Right-When clicking pictures under natural light, it is difficult to get the shots accurately. That is because natural lights keep fluctuating throughout the day.   Composition Without Skill Brings Poor Shots-Composition is a skill that is learned with practical photography experience. Beginners might not get it right in one go, and that is why people hire photographers.  Every Product Needs a Unique Setup-Products can have diverse designs. That's why sellers need unique setups for each product. Using the wrong setup is one of the main reasons for the dull visibility of your products on Etsy.
