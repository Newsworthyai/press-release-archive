# 49er Super Bowl Champion and Co-Founder Sam Kennedy of Flipinthebird Lure Co has created a 5" Monster Bird lure that has an even more realistic profile then the original

LAS VEGAS, NV, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Louder, larger, and loaded with strike-triggering realism, the new FlipinTheBird model doesn't just imitate life—it owns the surface.  "Anglers have been begging us for something bigger. So we built it," says Sam Kennedy Former Super Bowl Champion and Co founder of FlipinTheBird. "The 5-inch version throws more water, skips better and hits louder. It's the closest thing to a real bird with living rubber life like wings and tail.
