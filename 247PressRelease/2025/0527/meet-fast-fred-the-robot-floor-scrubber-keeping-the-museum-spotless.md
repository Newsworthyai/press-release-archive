# Meet "Fast Fred" – The Robot Floor Scrubber Keeping the Museum Spotless!

FORT WORTH, TX, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- At the DFW Car & Toy Museum, it's not just the vintage vehicles that draw attention—meet Fast Fred, the museum's fully autonomous robotic floor scrubber that's becoming a fan favorite of guests of all ages.  In a facility spanning over 150,000 square feet, keeping the galleries clean is no small feat. Museum founder Ron Sturgeon quickly realized that traditional mopping was going to be labor-intensive and costly. That's when he brought in the Tennant X4 ROVR, a robotic floor-cleaning powerhouse that vacuums, sweeps, and scrubs with incredible precision.  "We named him Fast Fred in honor of my late twin brother, who was a lifelong drag racer," says Sturgeon. "It might sound a little silly, but we even added his name and racing decals to the side—and a smiley face on the front. Now he's easily one of the top 10 most talked-about 'exhibits' in the museum!"  Fast Fred isn't just practical—he's got personality. The X4 runs in three-hour shifts daily, scheduled by Brian Sturgeon, who manages the museum's car galleries. "The system is easy to use," says Brian. "We just refill the water and recharge the batteries between sessions. Guests absolutely love it—people stop to watch it work, and they're always amused when it politely pauses, then navigates around them."  With his NHRA sticker and race-ready look, Fast Fred fits right in at a museum dedicated to cars, speed, and nostalgia. Whether you're here for the classics or the clean floors, you won't want to miss this charming little machine zipping through the aisles with purpose.  The machine's software was created by Brain Corp. BrainOS® is the software that powers the robot and allows full autonomy  Come visit Fast Fred and the rest of the incredible collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum—where even the cleaning crew is worth the trip!
