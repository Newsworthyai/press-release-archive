# '70s Playboy Bunny and "WHO'S WHO" Honoree Barbara Camp Writes Inspirational Book "Your Soul: Fixer-Upper or Tear-Down?"

NEW YORK, NY, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Baby Boomer, Catholic schoolgirl (can readily identify any plaid ever used in a parochial uniform), and '70s Playboy Bunny (another uniform—not plaid—blue satin), Barbara Camp insists that "God writes the best fiction, known as non-fiction." Your Soul: Fixer-Upper or Tear-Down? (The Bible Blueprint for Renovation and Rebuild!) features Camp's short stories that translate bulletproof, Biblical wisdom (both the Old and New Testaments) into everyman, everyday, modern metaphors.  Camp's self-described, personal, demolition derby is punctuated by big picture themes: cell phones (Tower of Babel); designer food (The Last Supper); feminism (Samson & Delilah); the Hudson River air strip (Jesus Walks on Water); DNA (The Creation of Adam); Christ's promise of provision (The Fish & Loaves of Bread), and many more.  "As we worship the created versus The Creator, our painstakingly shellacked exteriors house anorexic souls teeming with wildly dubious flim-flam. Popular thought continues to believe that the natural can cure the natural while habitually ignoring the supernatural!"  "The Bible is the best-selling book of all time and, as a primer, Fixer-Upper's ancient to modern metaphors serve as a compass for both right-brain and left-brain thinkers—be it atheist, skeptic, seeker or believer. Let not the herd mentality nor a cancel-happy culture hit "delete" on the ultimate VIP. If God is love, got God?"  ABOUT BARBARA CAMP: Her creative professions have included set designer & stylist, fashion makeup artist (Milan, London, Paris, New York), artist & illustrator, arts & design industry recruiter and writer. She lives in New York City.
