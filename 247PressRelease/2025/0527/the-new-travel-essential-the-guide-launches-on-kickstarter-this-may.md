# The New Travel Essential: THE GUIDE Launches on Kickstarter This May

SEATTLE, WA, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Traveling should be about adventure, not anxiety. That's why the launch of THE GUIDE, a revolutionary safety and convenience device, is set to transform the way we explore the world. THE GUIDE launched on Kickstarter this May with features like real-time location sharing, anti-theft protection, security monitoring, emergency voice features and more into a sleek, palm-sized accessory designed for modern travelers—all with exclusive early-bird discounts.  A Smarter Way to Stay Connected One of THE GUIDE's standout features is its effortless location-sharing capability. When you're traveling in a group in a new location, now you and your fellow travelers can stay up to date each other's location. With just a single button press, users can instantly share their whereabouts via THE GUIDE's app—ideal for keeping loved ones updated or logging your own personal travel path. For solo adventurers, the device offers an extra layer of security by allowing a designated contact to monitor your journey and receive alerts if anything goes awry.  Outsmart Thieves with Anti-Theft Tech Losing belongings to pickpockets is a traveler's nightmare, but THE GUIDE's anti-theft mode turns the tables. Simply attach the device to a bag, wallet, or phone and activate the motion sensor. If someone tries to snatch the item, THE GUIDE triggers a loud alarm and sends an immediate alert to the user's smartphone—giving thieves zero chance to slip away unnoticed.  Your Personal Security Guard for Hotels & Rentals Worried about unwanted guests in your Airbnb or hotel? THE GUIDE's security mode turns it into a portable sentry. When attached to a door or window, it detects forceful entry and responds with a blaring alarm, while simultaneously notifying the user and a trusted contact. Whether you're in a remote cabin or a bustling city, it's like having a security system in your pocket.  Automated Safety Check-Ins for Peace of Mind For those long train rides or late-night walks, THE GUIDE's safety check-in feature ensures someone always knows where you are. Just set your destination and estimated arrival time—once you arrive, THE GUIDE will let your contact know, and if you don't check in, THE GUIDE automatically shares your location with your pre-selected friend or family member. No more frantic "Did you make it?" texts—just seamless, smart safety.  Voice Assistance for Emergencies & Navigation Language barriers can be stressful, so THE GUIDE comes pre-loaded with essential travel phrases in 5 different languages like "Where is the nearest hospital?" or "How much does this cost?"—all accessible at the touch of a button. Voice commands are also delivered in an authoritative tone voiced by native speakers to scare off potential threats.  Designed for Discretion & Durability Despite its powerful features, THE GUIDE is small enough to fit in your palm and sports a subtle, stylish design inspired by a four-leaf clover. Lightweight yet rugged, it easily clips onto bags, belts, or keychains—making it the perfect blend of functionality and fashion.  Coming to Kickstarter with Exclusive Perks THE GUIDE launched on Kickstarter this May, offering backers limited-time discounts and early access. Whether you're a frequent flyer, a backpacker, or just someone who values safety, this device promises to be the ultimate travel companion.  THE GUIDE is a team of professionals who have experience either volunteering in developing countries or have partaken in solo backpacking trips in countries around the world. And we all know how important is to have reliable safety services during all of life's adventures.  We are currently developing a proprietary GEO AI service to help people travel more safely around the world. Our team of experts in safety, AI, and sociology, are hard at work planning and developing products and services to help travelers everywhere.
