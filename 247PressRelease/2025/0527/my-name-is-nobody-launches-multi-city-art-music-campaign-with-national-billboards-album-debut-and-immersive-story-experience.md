# MY NAME IS NOBODY LAUNCHES MULTI-CITY ART & MUSIC CAMPAIGN WITH NATIONAL BILLBOARDS, ALBUM DEBUT, AND IMMERSIVE STORY EXPERIENCE

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Artist Kenny McCormick IV, known for his work as Jimmy Flinders in the cult classic *Saturday's Warrior*, has launched a multi-city billboard campaign in support of his latest music and storytelling project. This marks the debut of *LDS/LSD: The Psychedelic Hymnal*, an album that reinterprets traditional Mormon hymns through a modern lens of healing, creativity, and personal freedom.  "This story doesn't belong on Broadway or just TV. It belongs in The Sphere. We're building something immersive, redemptive, and real—and we'd love to make it free." - Holly Carter, Relevé Entertainment.  THE SIGNAL CAMPAIGN The campaign spans 15 cities, with active billboards in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Boise, and near McCormick's hometown of Holland, Michigan. The messaging—displayed without artist names or product links—includes phrases like "JESUS LOVES NOBODY," "MY NAME IS NOBODY," and "NOBODY LOVES YOU." All signs point viewers to StartWithILoveYou.com, an immersive digital store and scavenger experience.  There are currently 8 real billboards live in Salt Lake City. To see coordinates and join the game, visit StartWithILoveYou.com. This isn't about press—it's about play. Think Pokémon meets street gospel. We're not selling merch. We're not charging for the music. Everything is free. The goal is participation.  The campaign is supported by:  - StartWithILoveYou.com – a story-based merch platform and interactive fan portal  - Relevé Entertainment – founded by Holly Carter, longtime producer and entertainment executive  - Christian Cannabis and Spiritual Plants which include the two new federally legal hemp lines Mormon Meds and Latter Day Leaf.   - Creating Fun – a creative agency and collective founded by Craig Gross  MUSIC & IMMERSIVE STORYTELLING McCormick and collaborator Craig Gross have collaborated on multiple albums including *LDS/LSD*, *Baphomet Zoo*, and *Freely and Lightly* by AI Babes. Their work blends music, immersive performance, and narrative design. Easter weekend 2025 marked the launch of *Resurrection Flower*—from Christian Cannabis—and a live performance of *LDS/LSD* at Urbana Lounge in Oakland.  Following Oakland, the team launched a stealth tour—performing intimate secret shows, underground sets, and unpublicized disrupting billboard in select cities. They've taken cues from bands like All-American Rejects who've brought music back to the fans in small, energizing settings. This is about building a community through discovery, not distribution.  THE VISION The ultimate vision is a full-scale immersive show hosted at The Sphere in Las Vegas, designed as a nontraditional theatrical experience combining music, light, and storytelling. The show is intended to be accessible, potentially free, and built in honor of Tony Hsieh's legacy of delivering happiness.
