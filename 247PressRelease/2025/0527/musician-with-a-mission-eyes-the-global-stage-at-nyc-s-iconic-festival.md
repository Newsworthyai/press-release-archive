# Musician with a Mission Eyes the Global Stage at NYC's Iconic Festival

TAMPA, FL, May 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Musician and songwriter Luciano Mendonca—whose music blends pop, alt, and electronic influences into genre-free anthems with heart—has been selected to compete in America's Next Top Hitmaker, which is powered by Colossal, in partnership with Rolling Stone, Global Citizen, SoundCloud, and Fender.  As part of this national talent search, public support plays a vital role in determining who advances — and who ultimately performs at the iconic Global Citizen Festival in Central Park. Every vote is a show of support not just for Luciano's music, but for the message behind it — one rooted in authenticity, emotion, and purpose.  Voting opens today at 1 PM EST / 10 AM PDT https://tophitmaker.org/2025/luciano-mendonca  Luciano isn't just chasing a career—he's on a mission. His music is a spiritual force, a healing energy created with one purpose: to uplift people, make them feel seen, and inspire change. Now he's competing for the chance of a lifetime: to perform live at Global Citizen Festival on September 27 in Central Park, NYC—an event with a mission to end poverty and create a better world for all.  "Music is my way to give back," Luciano says. "It's more than sound—it's energy, it's emotion, and it can truly heal. Performing at Global Citizen would be more than a stage—it would be a calling fulfilled."  WHY THIS MATTERS This isn't just a competition—it's a global call for connection through music. Supporting Luciano means uplifting an artist whose work echoes the values of Global Citizen: love, unity, and positive change.  After being temporarily displaced by Hurricane Helene, he poured that upheaval into his music—creating songs that speak to resilience, healing, and hope.  HOW TO SUPPORT THE MISSION 1.

It's a strong contender for his performance should he take the Global Citizen Festival stage.  With poetic lyrics like "You are my sunshine, you are my heart" and "The love that comes from the stars, to my heart, to your heart," the song evokes the dreamy ache of falling for someone from afar. Blending 80s-inspired vibes with a modern pop sheen, it offers a sound that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant—an ode to hope, connection, and the magic of unseen bonds.  "My Platonic Love" is out now—listen here: https://hypeddit.com/yondwk  The track follows Luciano's debut album Sign in the Stars, praised by outlets like Music Crowns, Obscure Sound, Backseat Mafia, and Return of Rock for its unique vision and emotional depth. Since then, he's been steadily building a vibrant pop catalog—releasing a series of singles starting this year, set to culminate in a full-length pop album by late 2025 or early 2026. He's also been exploring deeper electronic and thematic territory with tracks like "Rollo of Normandy," a mysterious, atmospheric piece inspired by ancient legend and inner awakening.  Looking ahead, Luciano plans to incorporate a special electronic set into his live shows—a 10–20 minute interlude where the band steps aside and he takes center stage, performing with a looper, multiple instruments, and a DJ at his side. Think Justice (the French duo), but reimagined with a multi-instrumentalist's touch.  With each release, Luciano continues to expand his artistic universe—one rooted in passion, purpose, and the transformative power of music.   JOIN THE MOVEMENT Luciano's music is already connecting with listeners around the world. Now, supporters can help bring his message to an even bigger audience—by sharing his story, streaming the music, and participating in the Global Citizen journey alongside him.  This opportunity carries deep personal meaning for Luciano. In the wake of Hurricane Helene, music became both his refuge and his way of giving back—transforming loss into light, and hardship into hope.
