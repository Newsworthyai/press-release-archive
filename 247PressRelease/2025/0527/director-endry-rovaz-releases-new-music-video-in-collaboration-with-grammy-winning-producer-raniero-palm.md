# Director Endry Rovaz Releases New Music Video in Collaboration with Grammy-Winning Producer Raniero Palm

MIAMI, FL, May 27, 2025 -- Audiovisual director Endry Rovaz presents his latest music video, a powerful piece titled "De Esposa a Amante", performed by the talented singer Ina Peralta and written by Maryelis Olivera. The production, created in collaboration with renowned Grammy-winning producer Raniero Palm, was filmed in the city of Miami, combining artistic studio scenes with the breathtaking sunrises of Miami Beach.  The video stands out for its visual strength, with a color palette dominated by red and black-and-white sequences that emphasize the emotional intensity of the song. Both the musical and visual performances are charged with energy and emotion, reinforcing Rovaz's signature narrative style.  This is not the first time Rovaz and Palm have joined forces. They previously collaborated on the major production "Hashtag", by the Panamanian group Los Rabanes in collaboration with reggaeton icon Jowell (of the duo Jowell & Randy). That video, also filmed between Puerto Rico and Miami, premiered on May 3 and has gained popularity across several Latin American countries thanks to its vibrant energy and colorful aesthetic.  The creative duo also worked together on "Unworthy (Indignos)", the award-winning short film directed by Rovaz, in which Raniero Palm and pianist Gabriel Lococo contributed three original pieces to the soundtrack. This collaboration earned them the Best Soundtrack Award at the HSS3 Film Festival in Houston, Texas.  "I met Raniero on a red carpet during an awards event in the Dominican Republic, where I had a video nominated. However, it wasn't until we crossed paths again through artist Felipe Pel√°ez that we began working together. Since then, we've built an excellent professional relationship," said Endry Rovaz.  The video "De Esposa a Amante" is now available on YouTube, along with "Hashtag", standing out as two of the most relevant audiovisual releases this May under the Astral Films banner. Meanwhile, Unworthy continues its international journey with new nominations at film festivals in Europe and Asia, in addition to the awards it has already received in the United States.
