# Creative Biolabs Uses B. bifidum to Enhance Gastrointestinal Drug Development Processes

SHIRLEY, NY, February 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bifidobacterium bifidum (B. bifidum) possesses unique ecological features that make it an important member of the gut microbiota and one that enhances digestion, immunological defenses, and clears infections.  Services for Engineering Bifidobacterium In order to accelerate the use of B. bifidum for a drug formulation, Creative Biolabs has set up a complete engineering Bifidobacterium service specializing in drug discovery that includes knockout, quality control, insertion, and more. This service is designed to meet the needs of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic researchers by providing complete solutions from Bifidobacterium strain selection, genetic modification, protein expression, and functional verification.  • Gene Knockout and Knock-in: Using the gene knockout method, some selected genes in Bifidobacterium linked to gut health can be deleted as a way of studying their contribution. At the same time, exogenous foreign genes can be inserted into Bifidobacterium using gene insertions to functionalize the organism to possess specific new therapeutic capabilities.   • Deliverables: Each strain of modified Bifidobacterium can be preserved in glycerol stock, which facilitates their easy shipment as well as effective long-term storage for future research studies.  • Quality Control and Verification: All of the designed Bifidobacterium strains undergo quality control and functional verification. This includes genome sequencing verification, an optional Western blot, and PAGE or cell-based functional analysis. The verification methods guarantee that the engineered strain is functional and meets the required standards for research or application.  According to an expert in probiotic research at Creative Biolabs, "The Bifidobacterium services that we provide go beyond standard genetic modifications, as they include precise functional validation and specialized analysis to ensure that all strains achieve high-quality clinical and research application value."  Treatment of some gastrointestinal diseases has greatly benefited from Bifidobacterium bifidum probiotics. In particular, Bifidobacterium is able to mitigate inflammation and improve gut health in patients suffering from immune-mediated gastrointestinal diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) by modulating immune responses and strengthening the gut barrier function. There are also therapeutic promises for celiac disease (CeD) using Bifidobacterium. It can help restore intestinal cellular health and strengthen gut barrier function, thus protecting the intestine from gluten damage.  "We are studying the bifidobacterium bifidum benefits, particularly those with modified DNA, because they may be more effective for research and treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders," the expert stated.
