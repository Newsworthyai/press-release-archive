# Valencia By FivePoint Fulfilled Their Lifestyle Priorities

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, July 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- They searched for a new home and community that could deliver affordability with high value, excellent school districts, neighborhood stability, a pleasing climate, outdoor activities and feasible commutes to their work in LA. Yes, they wanted a lot.  Nithin and Sneha Gridhalluru found the place that satisfied priorities in home and community when they scouted Valencia by FivePoint. They bought their new Lennar home and moved in with their toddler son and have since added a baby daughter.   Affordability with high value was key. "We've found a good balance here," said Nithin. "While the market is still competitive, we feel the value we're getting in the home itself and in the neighborhood, has been worth it."  Excellent school districts was a top priority, and the Gridhallurus are very pleased. "The local schools have strong academic programs and supportive communities, which has made a big difference for our family," said Sneha. "Our son has started pre-school, and we're extremely happy with the environment he's in for this important milestone—it's nurturing, safe, and focused on early learning in a fun, engaging way.  "Even at the pre-school level, we're seeing the benefits of strong school districts," she added. "The teachers are wonderful, and it's been amazing to watch him start forming friendships and becoming more independent."  Neighborhood stability and security: "The area feels safe, and there's a strong sense of community," said Nithin. "We've connected with neighbors and there's a shared pride in keeping the area well-maintained."  "We've also been lucky to have neighbors become real friends, which has been wonderful, especially for us as new parents," added Sneha. "It's nice to have people nearby who look out for each other and genuinely enjoy spending time together."  "The neighborhood experience has exceeded our expectations," said Nithin. "It's vibrant, welcoming, and has just the right balance of community and privacy. And this location continues to be a strong point, giving us a good balance between being close enough to the city for work and far enough away to enjoy a quieter, more relaxed lifestyle."  Valencia's community spaces have helped create the kind of neighborhood the Gridhallurus had hoped for. "Whether it's casual chats at the park or kids playing together, there's a real sense of connection here," said Nithin. "It's easy to strike up conversations, and that's made it feel like home faster than we expected."  And their home? The Gridhallurus bought one of Lennar's triplex designs. Downstairs is a great room with family, dining and kitchen spaces. Also on this level is a secluded bedroom suite, a powder room and a large laundry room. The two-bay garage provides a private owner entry to the interior.   Upstairs, the owners' suite provides view windows and a large, compartmented bath with dual vanities, walk-in shower and walk-in wardrobe. "We really wanted a home where the second floor is dedicated to us and the children, while the downstairs suite is ideal for guests," said Nithin.   "Sneha and I really wanted a clear separation between family space and guest space, and this floor plan delivers exactly that," said Nithin. "Upstairs feels like our own peaceful sanctuary, especially with our two kids."  "The natural light in the owner's suite is something we enjoy every single day, and the layout with the dual vanities and walk-in wardrobe makes our routine feel organized and stress-free, even with babies around!" added Sneha.   Having the guest suite downstairs has been a huge blessing. "We've had family visit us from India, and having a private space for them has made hosting so much more comfortable for them and for us. It's quiet, convenient, and everyone feels at home right away," said Nithin. "We're so glad we chose the Plan 1A layout—it's really been a perfect fit for our family."  They have also come to appreciate some details they did not think much about at first, like the private entry from garage. "It has made daily life so much easier, especially when juggling a diaper bag, groceries, and a sleepy baby!" said Sneha.   Added Nithin, "The laundry room is bigger than we expected, and it's become one of those behind-the-scenes spaces that keeps things running smoothly. All in all, the home feels warm, functional, and truly ours. It's been everything we hoped for, and we've grown into it even more as parents."  Commuting to jobs in LA: For many Southern Californians, commuting is a given. "Commutes can still be a challenge depending on the day," said Sneha. "But we've been able to adjust our schedules and explore hybrid work options to make it manageable. Valencia's location works well for getting into L.A. when needed, and on remote days, we really appreciate how peaceful and accessible everything is locally."  Pleasing climate and outdoor activities were very important to this active couple. "The weather has lived up to our expectations," said Nithin. "We spend a lot of time outdoors, and having access to trails, parks, and weekend getaways has been a major lifestyle upgrade.  "Having access to so much outdoor space was a big reason we chose this location, and it's really delivered. It's one of the things we were most looking forward to, and it hasn't disappointed!" added Nithin.   "We've been exploring the local hiking trails and parks on our weekends—it's a great way for us to unwind as a family, and our kids love being out in nature," said Sneha. "The climate here makes it easy to stay active year-round, so hiking and exploring as a family has become a regular weekend activity. We feel this is helping us live a healthier, more balanced lifestyle."  Two E-bikes contribute to outdoor activity. "They are such a fun and convenient way to get around the neighborhood and explore local paths," said Nithin. "It's a great alternative to driving for short trips, and it's added a new layer of adventure to our weekends. Just riding to a local cafe or park is something we look forward to."  Parks & Events—"Confluence Park has become one of our favorite spots," said Sneha. "We go there often as a family, especially in the evenings or on weekends. The pool, the open spaces, and the views make it a great place to relax or meet up with neighbors."  The family has also taken part in such special events with Valencia's Fallencia, Movie Nights and Friday Night Happenings among the favorites. "They're such a fun way to feel part of the community and make great memories as a family," said Nithin. More activities are always in store, so check www.valencia.com and www.Facebook.com/ValenciaCalifornia for the latest doings.   Valencia's weekly Farmer's Market also earned praise. "It has become a fun routine for us to pick up fresh, local produce and connect with the community. It's a great way to start the weekend and supports so many local vendors.  "We're also excited about upcoming parks and other spaces planned for the area," he added. "It feels like Valencia is growing in all the right ways, and it's great to see our neighborhood evolving while keeping that strong sense of community we love."  "We continue to feel that we've made a smart and meaningful investment here," said Nithin and Sneha. "The home, the neighborhood, the lifestyle—it all adds up to something that feels truly valuable, financially and emotionally. We're building not just equity, but a life we love. We're really glad that Valencia is our home and it's where we see our family growing in the years ahead."
