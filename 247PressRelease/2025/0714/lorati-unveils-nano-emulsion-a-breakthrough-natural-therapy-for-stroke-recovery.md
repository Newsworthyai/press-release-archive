# Lorati Unveils Nano-Emulsion: A Breakthrough Natural Therapy for Stroke Recovery

TAICHUNG, TAIWAN, July 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lorati Co., Ltd., a pioneer in nano-grade biomedical innovation, proudly announces a major medical breakthrough: Lorati Nano-Emulsion, a 100% natural, mineral-based emulsion developed to support full recovery for both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke patients.  Unlike conventional treatments, Lorati Nano-Emulsion offers a non-invasive, at-home therapy. Patients consume between 1,600 to 2,000 cc daily, with recovery timelines ranging from 12 to 30 months, depending on stroke type, blood pressure condition, and other underlying health issues.  The Science Behind the Cure Effective stroke recovery requires: • Complete clearance of blood clots (aneurysms) and foam cells • Restoration of elasticity in stiffened blood vessels • Elimination of inhibitory molecules such as AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-products), ALEs (Advanced Lipoxidation End-products), and excessive heavy metals  By cleansing the body of these inhibitory factors, endogenous stem cells can be activated to regenerate damaged brain tissue through differentiation, dedifferentiation, and proliferation.  Mr. David Lo, CEO of Lorati, explains that true stem cell therapy lies in restoring the body's own regenerative ability—not through autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplants, which are fundamentally flawed.  Historic Success: Brain Stem Stroke Recovery A recent case involving a patient with central pontine hemorrhagic stroke—one of the most severe types of brainstem stroke—has been fully cured after 30 months of nano-emulsion therapy. This unprecedented outcome has stunned medical experts, including professors at National Taiwan University. It marks the first recorded instance in human history of a complete recovery from this type of stroke.  Mr. Lo further explains that if brainstem hemorrhagic strokes can be cured with Lorati's Nano-emulsion, other forms of stroke may also be curable with the same therapy.  About Lorati Co., Ltd. Founded in 2012 in Taichung, Taiwan, Lorati Co., Ltd. is a global leader in nano-grade mineral-based medicine. Through proprietary extraction and refinement of montmorillonite—referred to as "God's extract of clay"—the company produces advanced, all-natural therapies designed to regenerate tissue and support healing without side effects.
