# Alsco Uniforms Donates $25,000 and 500 First Aid Kits to Support Texas Flood Relief

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, July 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alsco Uniforms, a uniform, linen, and facility service provider operating nine laundry facilities across Texas, is donating $25,000 to The Salvation Army to support flood relief and recovery efforts following the devastating floods in the state. They are also providing 500 personal first aid kits for the Salvation Army to distribute. With these donations, they hope to offer immediate relief and contribute to long-term recovery efforts throughout the state.   During the Fourth of July 2025 weekend, flash floods raged across central Texas, especially along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. The flood killed more than 100 people, including many young girls from the Mystic summer camp. The flood swept away houses and businesses, tearing apart homes and families in its wake. Local and national organizations have come together to provide aid and support to affected communities.   "Our laundry facilities throughout Texas are integrated into many of the communities affected," said Bob Steiner, CEO of Alsco Uniforms. "With nine locations throughout Texas, we feel a deep sense of connection to the state. Texas has supported our business for decades, and we want to be there for the community. We hope these contributions can help families in this trying time."  The Salvation Army is working fast to help the people of Texas. They've deployed mobile kitchens and rapid response units to provide food, beverages, blankets, clothing, and other essentials to people impacted by the flood. They plan to continue to serve the community as the floodwaters recede and people rebuild. These donations will help them provide immediate first aid, distribute essential supplies, and fund recovery projects.   Local Alsco Uniforms General Manager Anthony Wessels stated, "My neighbors, friends, and family have all been affected by this disaster, and I'm thankful I work for a company that can help give back in this time of need."   To support flood recovery efforts, consider donating to The Salvation Army here. Every contribution will provide relief to those in need.
