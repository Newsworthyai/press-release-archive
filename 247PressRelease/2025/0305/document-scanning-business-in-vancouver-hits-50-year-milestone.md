# Document Scanning Business in Vancouver Hits 50-Year Milestone

VANCOUVER, BC, March 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 1975 was quite a year. A great white shark terrorized swimmers at the theatres, a massive freighter sank in Lake Superior, and Pink Floyd performed at the PNE Coliseum. It was also the year Micro Com launched in a crowded office on Powell Street. For more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/micro-com-systems-ltd-50th-anniversary-year/  When Micro Com started operations, it was closer to a service bureau offering Computer Output Microfilm as its sole product. At the time, COM, as it was known, enabled organizations large and small to reduce computer processing time and vastly diminish paper printing and distribution costs.  Business was good, and in the early 1980s, the team moved into a much bigger (but ultimately still crowded) location off Kingsway, hiring a writer (this one) to expand service offerings to include a full range of traditional micrographic services.  Micro Com Systems Services 50th Anniversary  Over time, the business grew, even absorbing a few smaller competitors along the way. In 1992, the original owner headed to warmer climates to sell racing and luxury yachts, and the company was purchased by two enterprising employees, who began adding digital services such as document scanning and larger format scanning to compliment the micrographic offerings.  Business flourished, and MCS relocated again, this time to a four-story building in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood. Over time, the owners added more services, including microfilm/microfiche scanning and Aperture Card scanning, and the team quickly filled up nearly 22,000 square feet of building space.  In 2010, one of the two managing partners departed for the sun and surf of the Caribbean, leaving the current owner (and writer), Craig Hollingum, to run and manage operations.   With 50 years of success under its belt, this is a team that's doing something right.
