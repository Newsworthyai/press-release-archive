# Canadian Doctor Launches Kids Vitamin Doctor Supplements Across Canada

VANCOUVER, BC, March 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There's a new face in the world of kids' vitamins, and it's Canadian. On March 1st, The Kids Vitamin Doctor will introduce its new line of kids' multivitamins and Vitamin D products for sale across Canada.  Founded by Vancouver-based doctor Dr. Caroline Barclay and partner Jason Torpey, parents of three, Caroline was inspired to simplify children's nutrition, which she found challenging to navigate, even as a physician.  "Many supplements do not meet modern nutritional guidelines. It seems strange to consider nutrient deficiencies in a country like Canada. Hidden hunger is the term we use when kids aren't getting the vitamins and minerals they need, even though there's no shortage of calories."  Vitamin Doctor supplements are formulated to address common nutrient deficiencies seen by doctors and paediatricians, including Vitamin D, Folate, Zinc, and B12.  In North America, nutrient deficiencies are often the result of picky eating. Kids can be sensitive to flavours, textures, and smells, so they avoid foods like vegetables or fish, resulting in nutrient gaps. This is where a multivitamin becomes useful.   More people are realizing that kids' nutrition goes beyond developing healthy bones and bodies. There's increasing evidence around how diet supports mental health, particularly in the developmental years. B vitamins play a role in producing brain chemicals that affect mood and other brain functions. Low levels of B vitamins and folate have been linked to depression. Energy and mood are also linked to nutrition. The brain requires specific nutrients to regulate emotions, maintain concentration, and build emotional resilience.  "Not all kids require a multivitamin, but taking one is a great way to round out a healthy diet, especially for fussy eaters, says Dr. Barclay."  Vitamin Doctor supplements are flavoured naturally with fruit juices, low in sugar, vegan, gluten and nut-free. Formulas are precisely balanced to meet different age requirements. The kids' multivitamin, for example, contains approximately 50% of the Recommended Daily Value (RDA) of 13 essential nutrients and 100% of Vitamin D for kids 4 years and up.   "It's important not to overdo fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, which can build up and become harmful," explains Dr. Barclay. "Multivitamins should account for the fact that kids will get at least part of their daily nutritional requirements from their diets and then fill in the gaps."  The Kids Vitamin Doctor is proud to launch three new items, including a kids' multivitamin gummy, a vitamin D gummy, and a choke-safe vitamin D spray in a kid-approved Strawberry Spritz flavour.  "We hope to be a resource for parents who want to learn about nutrition and kids' health. Introductory offers will be available on the website as part of our mission to create superior vitamin supplements and help Canadian families Grow Healthy.  About The Kids Vitamin Doctor  The Kids Vitamin Doctor was founded in 2023 by Dr. Caroline Barclay, a family doctor who works and resides in beautiful Vancouver, BC. After becoming a mom, Caroline found children's supplements hard to navigate, even as an MD! As part of her ongoing mission to support family health, she designed a line of age-appropriate children's supplements. Precisely calculated to meet modern nutritional requirements, our safe, no-choke sprays and low in sugar gummies are easy for parents to give and children to takeâ€”because staying healthy shouldn't be hard.
