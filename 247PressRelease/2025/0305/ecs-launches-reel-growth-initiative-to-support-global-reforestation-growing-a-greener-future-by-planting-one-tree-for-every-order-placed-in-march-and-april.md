# ECS Launches "Reel Growth" Initiative to Support Global Reforestation: Growing a greener future by planting one tree for every order placed in March and April

VANCOUVER, BC, March 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In partnership with Evertreen, an organization dedicated to reforestation, ECS will plant one tree for every order placed between March 3 and April 30, 2025 (up to 7,500 trees). This initiative underscores ECS's ongoing efforts to reduce its environmental impact while supporting a greener future.  ECS branches across Canada rely on reels to transport and store cable, reusing them multiple times before they are no longer safe to use and discarded. While ECS actively recycles and returns as many reels as possible to manufacturing partners, the company recognizes the need to take further action to reduce its ecological footprint.   "Understanding our environmental impact is important to us at ECS. Through our partnership with Evertreen, we are turning our responsibility into tangible action, helping to support a greener world—one tree at a time." – Christy Morrison, President.  The campaign name, "Reel Growth," reflects both the cable reels used in ECS's operations and the company's broader mission to contribute to environmental growth. By linking everyday business activities to meaningful environmental action, ECS hopes to inspire customers and partners to join in the effort.  Industry Partners Supporting the Initiative The "Reel Growth" campaign is made possible with the support of ECS's valued partners: PTI Cables, Domtech, and Techspan. Their sponsorship plays a crucial role in amplifying the initiative's impact, reinforcing the collective responsibility we all have in fostering a healthier planet.
