# Country Artist Hugh Phillips Signs with String Kitchen Music/SSM Nashville Records & Releases His Single, "Bottom of the Bottle"

NASHVILLE, TN, March 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Colorado Native, Hugh Phillips has been taking over the Rockies and giving them a taste of 'Colorado Country'. 10+ years of songwriting stems from growing up in the Rocky Mountains and shows in the stories he weaves. After putting out an album and performing all over, Hugh decided to bring some rock to the "Music City" and come to Nashville. He began writing with established songwriters and producer Dean Scallan on Music Row and released his debut song, "Boys That's a Cowgirl" last year. The great success of the single led him to sign a record deal with SKM/SSM Nashville Records in late 2024.  He has been preparing for the release of his subsequent single, "Bottom of the Bottle" which was released to country radio two weeks ago. It will be available on all streaming platforms on March 14th and its music video will drop in early April. He wrote the song with Nashville songwriter Dustin James. He said, "We always get some great ideas [when working together] and create a vision so the story is solid and people can relate to it." Rather than writing a sappy break-up song, they opted to turn it into "a sweet kind of party break-up thing."  Hugh had just performed at his local fair and thought putting that into the song would be cool. The opening lyrics, "Well I met you at Carbondale Mountain Fair, we danced out by the main stage you had flowers in your hair" bring the story to life from the beginning. He says that although "everyone is gonna go through a break up at some point, it sucks, but you need to be careful how you react."   Hugh and his band have been performing at fairs, festivals, and honky-tonks all over Colorado. With talents on multiple instruments, he can sonically create a musical vision the likes of many who came before and still has a cutting edge in modern country. You can count on an exciting show rocking country and western with a bluegrass flair when they're in your area.
