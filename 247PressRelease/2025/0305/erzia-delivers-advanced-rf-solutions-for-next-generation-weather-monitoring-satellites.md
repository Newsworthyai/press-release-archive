# ERZIA Delivers Advanced RF Solutions for Next-Generation Weather Monitoring Satellites

ALEXANDRIA, VA, March 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ERZIA, the European leader in high-performance radio frequency (RF) and microwave solutions, proudly announces the successful delivery of 36 Ka-Band transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) subsystems to support a groundbreaking satellite constellation dedicated to global weather forecasting.  The custom units are Ka-band TR modules featuring 100 dB isolation between transmit and receive paths, along with high-rejection filtering to suppress interference and prevent spurious signal generation. Delivering over 34 dBm of output power in the transmit path and a low noise figure in the receive path, these advanced RF subsystems enable real-time, high-resolution radar observations of atmospheric conditions. This innovation enhances weather data availability in regions with limited or no radar infrastructure, reinforcing ERZIA's commitment to pioneering cutting-edge technology for the evolving NewSpace industry.  "Our expertise in engineering and manufacturing RF systems allowed us to meet an ambitious timeline while ensuring exceptional performance and reliability," said Alejandro Rodriguez, ERZIA's R&D Director. "This project highlights ERZIA's role in advancing satellite-based weather monitoring and providing critical data to improve forecasting accuracy worldwide."  With an expanding portfolio of space-qualified RF solutions, ERZIA continues to push the boundaries of innovation, delivering state-of-the-art subsystems that meet the rigorous demands of modern satellite and radar applications.  About ERZIA: ERZIA stands at the forefront of RF and microwave technology, engineering high-performance solutions for ambitious space, defense, and telecommunications missions. Founded in 2002, ERZIA's comprehensive portfolio includes radar systems, satellite communications amplifiers, electronic warfare solutions, laboratory test instruments, and space-qualified components. Trusted by organizations like NASA and the European Space Agency, ERZIA operates from its headquarters in Santander, Spain, with a subsidiary in Virginia, USA.
