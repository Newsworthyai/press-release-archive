# Nutritional Products International CEO Mitch Gould Pays Tribute to the Iconic Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan

BOCA RATON, FL, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When Hulk Hogan passed, the pain was felt around the world as countless fans and loved ones mourned the loss of the 71-year-old WWE Hall of Famer.   As Nutritional Products International (NPI) founder Mitch Gould reflects on his time working with the champion, he's grateful he got to know Bollea, the man behind the wrestling champ's larger-than-life persona.   How Gould Remembers Hogan He brought the excitement and the drama as he menacingly taunted his rival wrestlers, asking, "Whatcha gonna do, brother?"  "I first met Hogan in 2009. His team introduced me to Hogan Energy Granules, a nutrient-rich supplement that gives users high energy, at half the cost of other popular energy drinks.  "I was excited for NPI to work with his brand and quickly got distribution on Amazon.com, Drugstore.com, and made presentations to major drug chains throughout the United States," he said.   Mitch Gould and Sports Nutritional Innovations Inks Deal with Wrestling Giant Hulk Hogan Following the success of their first project together, Gould pitched Hogan to do HoganNutrition.com, a health website featuring over 3,500 products that include vitamins, sports nutrition, and other health and wellness products.  "In 2011, a deal was struck, and we formed Sports Nutritional Innovations, Inc. Terry and I were 50/50 partners in the venture," he said.  Gould and Hogan decided to throw a launch party to spread the word about their business at a popular venue in Delray Beach, Fla., with over 500 guests, including the mayor.   But Gould recalls a discreet moment before the launch party where the two went out to dinner. As they were walking through the restaurant, they passed a disabled boy and Hogan immediately stopped and started having a conversation with the child.   "He really took the time to take pictures and interact with him. I could tell he made the boy's day," he said.   Hogan was so impactful in Gould's life, that he wrote about their experiences together in Gould's 2021 memoir titled The Blonde, The Ferrari, and The Kwan in chapter 32.   "I have represented and worked with major athletes and celebrities like Steven Seagal, Bob Wall, and more. But getting to know Hogan was the most memorable time in my career," Gould said. "Thank you for the memories, they will always be cherished. You are a legend."  MORE ON NPI AND ITS FOUNDER Gould, known as a global marketing guru, also has represented icons from the sports and entertainment worlds such as Steven Seagal, Ronnie Coleman, Roberto Clemente Jr., Chuck Liddell, Wayne Gretzky, and the late, legendary Hulk Hogan.
