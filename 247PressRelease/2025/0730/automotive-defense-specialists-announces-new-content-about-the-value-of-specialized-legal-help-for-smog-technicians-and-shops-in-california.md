THE BEST SMOG TECH LAWYER PROVIDES THE FUEL TO DEFEND AGAINST SMOG CHECK ACCUSATIONS  Here is the background on this release. The value of a trustworthy, hard-working SMOG technician may be difficult for a SMOG shop owner to assess. If a letter arrives from the Bureau of Automotive Repair, a technician may be confused about how to handle addressing the charges. Persons specialized in auto repair and SMOG testing may be "out of their league" when it comes to regulatory battles. Additionally, if a technician takes time away from work to handle a SMOG accusation alone, it could negatively impact the bottom line of an auto repair shop.
