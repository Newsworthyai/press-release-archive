FORT WORTH, TX, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- One of the most beloved modern sports cars of its era, the 2007 Honda S2000 represents the pinnacle of Honda's engineering prowess and driver-focused design. With just over 1,800 original miles, this pristine red example is now showcased at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, part of the renowned Ron Sturgeon Collection.  At the heart of the S2000 lies the 2.2-liter F22C1 inline-four, factory-rated at 237 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, featuring VTEC variable valve timing that delivers a thrilling, high-revving experience. Paired with a slick six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip rear differential, this lightweight roadster is purpose-built for balance, agility, and connection to the road.  Factory equipment includes xenon headlights, painted mirror caps, and polished exhaust outlets, while a four-wheel double-wishbone suspension with gas-pressurized shocks ensures crisp handling. Inside, the cabin is appointed with black leather upholstery, a color-matched dashboard, and modern conveniences such as air conditioning, cruise control, a CD stereo, and power accessories.  Drivers are greeted by a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a race-inspired digital cluster, including a 9,000-rpm tachometer, digital speedometer, and readouts for fuel and temperature.  Unmodified and meticulously preserved, this low-mileage S2000 offers collectors and enthusiasts a rare opportunity to witness one of the final expressions of Honda's analog sports car excellence—just as it left the factory.  Now on public display, this S2000 is a shining example of what made the model a legend among roadsters—and a proud addition to the ever-evolving Ron Sturgeon Collection.
