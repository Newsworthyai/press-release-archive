# The Law Champ Announces New Resources on Trucking Accidents and Personal Injury Law in Texas

BROWNSVILLE, TX, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Law Champ, a top-rated personal injury law firm serving Brownsville and Cameron County, is proud to announce updated information on trucking accidents. It includes detailed information on trucking accidents, the risks involved, the issues surrounding injuries, and even the reality that trucking companies have well-financed attorneys and insurance providers who fight hard to reduce claims.  "An accident with a big truck is not a mere fender-bender," said Javier Villarreal, lead attorney. "These crashes can lead to serious injuries as cars, motorcycles, pedestrians, and bicycles are significantly smaller, and the physics of crashes do not work towards the smaller vehicle or entity. Even worse, trucking companies often have highly paid attorneys and insurance teams that fight hard to minimize payouts."  As summer comes to an end, traffic begins to rise throughout the Rio Grande Valley. Families return from vacation, kids head back to school, and commercial truck activity near the border increases. From big 18-wheelers to mid-sized delivery trucks and company vans, large vehicles share the road with increased traffic. The result is a general uptick in accidents and, unfortunately, an uptick in injuries, including even serious injuries.  In the newly updated content, The Law Champ urges the public to stay alert and understand their rights in the event of a serious crash.  VARIOUS TYPES OF TRUCKS CAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACCIDENTS  The updated trucking accident page at https://jvlawfirm.net/practice-areas/trucking-accidents/ explains the various types of trucks commonly found on Texas roads. These include:  18-wheelers and tractor-trailers, often used for long-haul freight, and much heavier than the average passenger car. Box trucks and commercial haulers, used for construction, moving, or short-range delivery Company vans and fleet vehicles, like those operated by Amazon, FedEx, and USPS. Each type of vehicle is generally much larger than a car. The additional reality is that the drivers are often more aggressive and face challenges with visibility and compliance with Texas law. A collision with a large or commercial vehicle can cause major injuries, especially to drivers and passengers in smaller cars.  GETTING LEGAL HELP FOR AN INJURY ACCIDENT WITH A TRUCK  Trucking companies typically have robust insurance coverage and legal teams that fight hard to minimize payouts. Their goal is to limit payouts and protect their profits. Victims often face pressure to settle fast, before they understand the full extent of their injuries or legal rights. Insurance industry lawyers often outcompete victims; however, hiring a lawyer on a contingency fee can level the playing field.  The Villarreal Law Firm encourages anyone involved in a truck accident to seek legal advice immediately. The firm offers free consultations and operates on a contingency basis, meaning that no legal fees are incurred unless the case is successfully resolved.  With experience in trucking litigation and a bilingual staff, the firm supports clients throughout every stage of the recovery process, from medical care and vehicle damage to advocating for full compensation.
