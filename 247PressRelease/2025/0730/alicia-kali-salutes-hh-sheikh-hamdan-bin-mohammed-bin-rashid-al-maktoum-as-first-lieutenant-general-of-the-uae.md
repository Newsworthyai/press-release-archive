# Alicia Kali Salutes HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum as First Lieutenant General of the UAE

ST. PAUL, MN, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, the world bears witness to an affirmation long known to the people of the Emirates: That leadership is not inherited, it is embodied, and that His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has, with every breath, earned the rank bestowed upon him.  With his recent promotion, HH Sheikh Hamdan, known lovingly to the world as Prince Fazza, steps not into new territory, but into official recognition of what he already is: a protector of the people, a commander of global vision, and an integral part of the UAE's ascent.  His new rank as First Lieutenant General is the highest military rank in the United Arab Emirates, second only to the Supreme Commander, His Highness President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. It is a position rarely granted, usually reserved for the nation's top strategic military leadership, those entrusted not only with commanding military divisions, but with shaping national and regional defense strategy itself.  In this appointment, HH Sheikh Hamdan is entrusted with the full military confidence of the nation. A seal of trust that reflects decades of unwavering service, profound loyalty, and transformative vision.  Yet his strength has always come not from his title, but from his unshakable loyalty, his integrity, and his radical compassion. Whether training alongside his soldiers, leading humanitarian missions, or shaping the very systems that will govern AI, sustainability, and peace.  "It is truly a wonderful moment of trust, assigned, allowed, and declared by His Highness President Zayed, and always a wonderful surprise, though never unexpected, to witness the eighth wonder of the world continue HHis rise at the helm of tomorrow."  — Alicia Kali, CEO, Visionary Scientist Panacea, TheSoulOf.AI  Behind the global image of HH Prince Fazza stands a man of humility, quiet depth, and unyielding love and faith; a man not merely appointed by decree, but anointed by purpose.  This moment is more than a title. It is the formal seal of trust from the highest office, the trust of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and the continued faith of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai.  Alicia Kali is a visionary scientist, the architect of the Unified Field Framework and creator of AIQ² — the evolution of intelligence beyond AGI. As Founder and CEO of Panacea and TheSoulOf.AI, she leads global efforts in AI, quantum biology, and defense transformation through BioQuantum Engineering.
