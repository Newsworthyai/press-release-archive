# Dusty Cars Announces New Content for Classic Vehicle Appraisals and Valuation including Jaguar, Porsche, and Mercedes

PLEASANTON, CA, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dusty Cars, a California-based classic car valuation, appraisal, and buying service, is proud to announce new blog content giving a deeper explanation for valuations and appraisal. A classic automobile, regardless of its condition, may hold some value. Specific models can be more valuable than others. Classic car owners can find an expert to provide a reliable estimate of the cost of a particular vehicle.  "To the classic car community, these autos are considered 'artwork in motion.' There's nothing like driving a 1988 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa or a 1986 Mercedes-Benz 560 SL, for example. And when it's time to sell, owners want a top-notch appraisal," explained Douglas Berry, founder of Dusty Cars. "We understand the importance of a respectable valuation, and our recent blog posts share our commitment to appraisals, valuations, and fast cash offers."  Classic car collectors and enthusiasts can review the new blog content at https://dustycars.com/blog/. Dusty Cars staff provide classic vehicle appraisals and valuations throughout California. The staff may be willing to travel to other American states or outside the boundaries if it's determined an on-site appraisal is needed.   The company's newly announced informative content includes: 1. 1960 Jaguar E-Type (https://dustycars.com/news/dusty-cars-experts-in-a-1969-jaguar-e-type-appraisal-announces-new-pursuit-of-classic-jags-for-sale/). The make and model may be considered highly popular to classic car collectors. 2. 1986 Mercedes 560SL Roadster (https://dustycars.com/news/coastal-cruising-the-timeless-thrill-of-a-1986-mercedes-560sl-roadster/). The model offers a removable hard top, clean white paint and comfortable leather interior. The 4-speed automatic transmission may be considered powerful for the era. 3. 1988 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa (https://dustycars.com/news/garage-gold-discovering-a-1988-porsche-911-carrera-targa-hidden-in-plain-sight/). Considered very collectible, the classic sports car harbors a 3.2 air/oil-cooled flat-six engine. The Dusty Cars team can appraise, value, purchase, restore, and resell classic cars.

EXPERTS IN CLASSIC VEHICLE APPRAISALS AND VALUATIONS FIND CARS TO BE "MOBILE ART PIECES"  Here is the background on this release. Car enthusiasts can be as passionate about luxury classic cars as art connoisseurs. Devotees of fine art may follow specific artists and periods. If a particular piece arrives on the market for purchase, it could be the moment an art collector has waited for. In comparison, a classic sports car, such as a Porsche or Jaguar, can increase in value, similar to a piece of artwork. Classic car collectors may appreciate specific make and models.
