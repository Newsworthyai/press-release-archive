# Lawsuit Legal News Releases July 2025 Update on Suboxone Tooth Decay Litigation

CLEARWATER, FL, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lawsuit Legal News (LLN), a leading source for mass tort updates and pharmaceutical litigation coverage, has issued a new update on the fast-developing Suboxone tooth decay lawsuits. As of July 2025, key procedural milestones are reshaping expectations for potential settlement timelines and trial preparations in the federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) against Indivior, the manufacturer of Suboxone.  Strong Scientific Evidence Driving Momentum The claims linking sublingual Suboxone strips to severe dental issues, including tooth loss, decay, and oral infections, are gaining traction. Legal experts at LLN note that the emerging science appears to strongly support the plaintiffs' position. While a final outcome will depend on whether the cases are resolved through trial or mediation, current evidence points to a compelling narrative for those affected.  Critical July Developments In its July 2025 update, LLN highlights several developments:  Pharmacy Records Delays: Plaintiffs continue to face delays in accessing vital pharmacy records needed to confirm Suboxone use. Walgreens is under increased legal scrutiny after allegedly failing to produce records within the court-mandated 30-day timeframe. A hearing has been scheduled to address the company's noncompliance, while Safeway and Porch Light Health have resolved their record production issues.  Plaintiff Pool Adjustments: Of the 500 plaintiffs initially selected for early-stage discovery, 48 have been removed due to voluntary dismissal or documentation issues. These individuals have been replaced through a random selection process. This refined pool will form the foundation of the bellwether trial process, with 100 cases moving to deeper discovery and four advancing to trial.  Settlement Outlook: Despite growing interest from affected parties, a Suboxone settlement is not expected in the immediate future. LLN legal analysts believe that Indivior is likely holding off on negotiations until the three-year statute of limitations passes, reducing their exposure to new claims. Realistic projections place meaningful settlement discussions toward late 2025 or early 2026.
