# Missing Thorn Launches Premium Alcohol-Removed Wine Collection Across Canada

NAPA, CA and TORONTO, ON, July 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Missing Thorn, the acclaimed Napa Valley-based non-alcoholic wine brand co-founded by award-winning winemaker Aaron Pott and innovative vintner Stephanie Honig, today announced its official launch and expanded availability across Canada, partnering with Scott Merwin and Ravenna Wine Imports. Starting this month in Ontario, the brand's full lineup of alcohol-removed wines will be available, with expansion to other provinces planned. This launch meets surging Canadian demand for sophisticated alcohol-free options, a market projected to reach C$68 million by 2030 and growing rapidly.  A Wine Experience Without Compromise Missing Thorn redefines non-alcoholic wine, offering an expressive, expertly crafted experience for mindful drinkers. Each wine begins as a traditionally crafted premium wine made from California-sourced grapes, then undergoes a cutting-edge low-temperature vacuum distillation to preserve its character. The name "Missing Thorn" symbolizes removing alcohol while retaining the wine's beauty and essence, enabling "clarity and freedom" in every celebration.  The collection includes a Still Red, Still White and Still Rosé, and a Sparkling White and Sparkling Rosé—all natural, vegan, gluten-free, and low in calories (15 to 30 calories per 5 oz serving).  Critical Acclaim and Market Momentum Since its late 2024 debut, Missing Thorn has seen extraordinary consumer enthusiasm, achieving 300% growth in Q1 and Q2 2025. Critics laud the brand, with The New York Times calling Missing Thorn's still wines "unicorns" and Food & Wine praising the brand's Rosé "as good as actual rosé—honestly, better than many." Famed restaurateur Danny Meyer even called Missing Thorn a "game-changer."  Voices Behind the Vision "We're beyond excited to share Missing Thorn with Canada's wine lovers," said Stephanie Honig, President and Co-Founder. "Canada's consumers are leading the way in mindful drinking. We're honored to introduce Missing Thorn to such a forward-thinking market. We're proud to toast a new era of mindful drinking across Canada."  Aaron Pott, Co-Founder and Winemaker, added, "As a winemaker, it's rewarding to deliver all the flavor, aroma, and complexity of great wine—without the alcohol. We believe Canadian palates will recognize the craftsmanship in each bottle."  "We are proud to partner with Missing Thorn to bring this groundbreaking collection to Canada," said Scott Merwin, Founder of Ravenna Wine Imports (Missing Thorn's Canadian distribution partner). "We've observed a significant rise in demand for non-alcoholic beverages here in Canada—in fact, the category grew over 24% last year—as consumers seek sophisticated alternatives. As an international brand with a shared commitment to quality and authenticity, Missing Thorn sets a new standard in the alcohol-free wine category. We anticipate a very strong reception from consumers and hospitality partners across the country as we roll it out nationwide."
