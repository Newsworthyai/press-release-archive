# Bestselling WWII Novel, Aaron's War By Richard McMaster, Will Be Available In Ebook Form At No Charge March 10th and 11th, 2025, At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, March 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Richard McMaster recently announced that his bestselling WWII novel, 'Aaron's War', will be available at no charge in ebook form on March 10 and 11, 2025 at Amazon.  Bestselling author Richard McMaster's historical fiction novel is a gripping coming-of-age story that drops readers into the harsh realities of World War II. Readers follow along on the journey of Aaron Vanko, an innocent Iowa farm boy who undertakes the ultimate test of humanity—the willingness to kill another human being in the name of duty.  But Aaron's journey takes a stunning turn when he discovers a previously unknown truth: he is Jewish. This revelation adds a new layer of complexity to his life-changing odyssey, forcing him to grapple with his allegiance to his country, his personal beliefs, and his newfound identity, all while battling enemy forces that threaten the world.  'Aaron's War' is more than just a historical narrative; it is a powerful and compelling exploration of challenges that have persisted across generations. From the ethical dilemmas that soldiers face on the battlefield to the formidable personal struggles that veterans confront upon their return home, this story offers a poignant examination of the human condition.  This captivating and engrossing tale sheds light on issues such as antisemitism, PTSD, and substance abuse, making its exploration of these themes all the more relevant and compelling.  USA TODAY Best-Selling Author Holly S. Roberts says 'Aaron's War' is "A coming of age story that grips your soul and takes you on a thought-provoking journey."  Readers and reviewers have praised 'Aaron's War'. Tom Porter, author of All I Need To Know About Business I Learned From A Duck stated, "An engaging, informative and thought-provoking tale of survival, love and faith. Make room for Richard McMaster on your list of up-and-coming authors." Lynn M. Safris said, "The descriptions and details given throughout this author's writing draw the reader into each page, making Aaron's journey feel like their own. I believe this book would appeal to a wide audience of readers. I truly enjoyed reading Aaron's War and I highly recommend this book."  Richard McMaster is also the author of 'A Love Divided By Time', described as "one part The Notebook, one part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter, and find peace by joining her in the ever after.  A Writer's Digest critique stated, "This book is exemplary in its voice and writing style. It has a unique voice, and the writing style is consistent throughout."  In McMaster's latest book, 'Voyage Of Life', the life journey of Sean Buchanan is detailed through metaphoric depictions of the four stages of life in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings, childhood, youth, manhood, and Old Age. The painting's depictions are a metaphor for his life—the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood become turbulent in youth, and early in manhood the shores turn rocky when he faces one obstacle after another. Secrets that live in darkness can take a lifetime to see the light of day and the secret that has hovered over him since Youth is revealed late in his life.
