The foundation also has a website (https://journeytowellness.org/) to help spread the word on alternative treatments for cancer. Sturgeon had a cancer scare in 2023, which was the inspiration for the foundation.   "I have a number of friends who have used alternative methods and recovered from cancer quickly, without the typical surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy. Their stories are on the websites of the journey to wellness website," Sturgeon said.  Joe Mannes serves as the foundation's treasurer. The asset investment committee is composed of Chair Mark Wood and Jerry Thompson and Robert Gottlich. The charity identification committee is composed of Chair Lee Jackson and Gloria Starling and Barry Kromann.
