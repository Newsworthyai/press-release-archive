MESA, AZ, September 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Susan Lewis Simons, Founder and President of Under the Shield, Inc., was recently featured on Innovators' Journey to discuss her groundbreaking work in mental wellness for First Responders and their families.  Founded in 1992, Under the Shield, Inc. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing proactive, anonymous mental wellness services to law enforcement officers, firefighters, military members, and their families. The organization delivers individualized Stress Coaching, as well as training programs designed to strengthen resilience and support both First Responders and their spouses or significant others.  At the core of all the services is The Simons Theory of the Psychological Garbage Can, developed by Ms. Simons.
