# ADAP Advocacy Publishes Two Infographics on 340B Drug Pricing Program

WASHINGTON, DC, September 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today, as part of its 340B Project, published two new infographics highlighting medical debt and its impact on patients. The infographics complement the recently-released commercial, and are part of the ongoing 340B national advocacy campaign, "Is the 340B Drug Pricing Program the Next 'Too Big to Fail'?"   The '340B Too Big to Fail – Medical Debt – Part 1' infographic focuses on how the 340B Drug Pricing Program was designed to help poor patients access healthcare services. Yet, despite this program growing to $66 billion, primarily benefiting hospitals, medical debt continues to be a crippling financial burden for many Americans, with most of the debt being owed to these 340B-eligible hospitals.  The '340B Too Big to Fail – Medical Debt – Part 2' infographic showcases how many hospitals participating in the 340B Program are threatening patients with aggressive, predatory debt collection…often damaging consumer credit reports. 340B hospitals are choosing not to set reasonable prices and offer robust financial assistance. They sue their patients rather than provide free charity care, as is required by law.  The two-part infographic series can be downloaded online here: https://www.adapadvocacy.org/publications.html#i.
