# Ocare Brings Jellycat Toys to New Zealand

AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, September 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To delight children and parents worldwide, Ocare has expanded its toy line with the beloved Jellycat line, now available online through its New Zealand platform. This new collection features a range of soft, cozy plush toys that showcase the quality, craftsmanship, and emotional connection that characterizes the New Zealand toy industry.  An Ocare spokesperson said, "As we continue to expand our international reach, we're thrilled to bring the whimsy of Jellycat to families around the world. Our Jellycat bunny plush toys, in particular, have captured the hearts of countless consumers – they're the perfect companion for toddlers, nursery decor, and even collectors."  The Appeal of Jellycat in Today's Toy Market In recent years, parents have increasingly sought toys that are both tactile and aesthetically pleasing. The Jellycat brand, renowned for its high-quality materials and adorable, expressive designs, perfectly meets this demand. The Jellycat bunny, with its irresistibly soft fur, floppy ears, and docile personality, remains a favorite.  While major toy stores and chain retailers continue to offer a wide variety of products, niche toy retailers like Ocare and online boutiques are also catering to the growing demand for handmade and high-end toys. Jellycat's products, which combine the qualities of toys and souvenirs, are beloved by children and adults alike.  Why Ocare's Jellycat Collection Matters? Accessibility Across Regions Shoppers from Auckland to Dunedin can now access a curated collection of Jellycat plush toys directly from the Ocare website—no need to wait for international shipping or worry about stock shortages.  Quality Assurance Every jellycat bunny and complementary plush undergoes rigorous quality checks before shipping, ensuring that only the softest, safest toys reach homes.  Aesthetic and Emotional Value Jellycat's popular bunny range is celebrated not just for plush textures but for its design appeal; these bunnies are renowned amongst collectors and parents alike.  A Boutique Alternative to The Big Stores In contrast to chain megastores like Toyworld NZ, Ocare offers a boutique shopping experience with personalized customer service, careful packaging, and a unique product assortment.  What's Next for Toys in New Zealand? The inclusion of Jellycat at Ocare marks a broader shift in consumption patterns among New Zealand toy shoppers—seeking out plush toys with character, safety, and a story. As the retail landscape evolves, hybrid shopping models (combining the selection of national store chains with the charm of independent boutiques) are poised to thrive.  Parents, collectors, and gift shoppers can explore Jellycat's full product line, including the Jellycat bunny plush, on the Ocare website. Ocare is committed to providing high-quality toys, satisfying gift needs, and elevating the quality of New Zealand plush toys.  Ocare is a global retailer specializing in high-quality toys and children's products, with a growing presence in New Zealand. Focused on combining comfort, design, and craftsmanship, Ocare offers carefully selected items that resonate with families and collectors.
