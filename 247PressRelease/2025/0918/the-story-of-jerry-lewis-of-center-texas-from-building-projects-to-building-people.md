# The Story of Jerry Lewis of Center, Texas From Building Projects to Building People

CENTER, TX, September 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Some men build businesses. Some build churches. A few, like Jerry Lewis, build both — but always with a deeper purpose in mind.  Lewis, a Shelby County native, spent over two decades leading construction projects across Texas, guiding developments that ranged from retail centers to luxury estates. At the height of his career, he grew his construction company from a modest start into a thriving multi-million-dollar operation. By all accounts, he was a successful entrepreneur. But Jerry will tell you his story has never been about business — it's been about calling.  A former pastor, Lewis stepped away from the pulpit and eventually his company to pursue what he describes as "full-time ministry in everyday life." That decision has led him across borders — from helping missionaries build facilities in Mexico to advising community projects in Ghana. Whether swinging a hammer or preaching revival, Lewis believes faith should always be lived, not just spoken.  "Ministry doesn't start at 11 a.m. on Sunday," he says. "It starts in the parking lot, the jobsite, or the kitchen table. Wherever people are — that's where God shows up."  Those who know him say that philosophy is more than words. Friends recount stories of him stopping to help strangers in need, giving to those who are without, mentoring young men through a 100-day health challenge, supporting the people around him, or simply showing up for families when tragedy struck.  Lewis also lends his expertise in moments when churches find themselves at a disadvantage. He is currently consulting with a congregation threatened with the loss of its property to a Texas Department of Transportation project — a move that would render the church unusable. Offering his guidance pro bono, Lewis is serving as their advocate, helping them navigate ongoing negotiations to secure fair compensation and preserve their ability to continue operating. "Sometimes churches just need a voice," he says. "I try to give them one."  His ability to blend the practical with the spiritual has made him a trusted guide for congregations navigating construction and crisis alike — leading them not just through budgets and blueprints, but toward solutions that protect their ministry.  At home, Lewis is just as intentional. A devoted father of three, he often reminds his children that family stability is part of a person's witness. It's a principle that shapes his life as much as his work. Family will always come first for Jerry Lewis.  In every season, Lewis has sought to keep one mission at the center: serve faithfully, encourage others, and remind people that God is near. You must love God and you must love people is his message.  To some, he is a builder. To others, a mentor. To many, a friend. But to Jerry Lewis, the titles matter less than the testimony — a life lived for others and for the glory of God.  Jerry Lewis of Center, Texas is a builder, mentor, and minister dedicated to serving both his local community and churches abroad. After more than 20 years leading multimillion-dollar construction projects across Texas, Lewis stepped away from business ownership to pursue full-time ministry. His work has taken him from Mexico to Ghana, supporting missionaries, advising congregations, and helping communities in times of need. A former pastor and lifelong entrepreneur, Lewis continues to blend practical expertise with spiritual leadership, reminding others that faith is lived out daily—in families, on jobsites, and wherever people gather.
