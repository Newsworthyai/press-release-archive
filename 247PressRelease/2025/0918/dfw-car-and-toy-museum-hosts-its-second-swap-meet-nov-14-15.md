Visitors to the event will discover a veritable treasure trove of automotive delights, as they meet and greet fellow car enthusiasts.

The car swap meet starts 8 a.m. Friday, Nov. 14 and wraps up at 3 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 15. It will be held at the recently opened DFW Car and Toy Museum, located at 2550 McMillan Parkway (at Meacham and I-35 West) in Fort Worth, Texas.  If you've never attended a swap meet, here's a bit of background for you. Evolving from old-fashioned flea markets, the automotive-focused versions started gaining popularity in the mid-20th century, specifically in the 1950s, as interest in post-WWII classic cars surged. Early automotive swap meets were often small, local affairs, but organizers for large-scale car events in Hershey, Pennsylvania and Paramount, California in the 1950s served as pioneers for modern-day swap meets, which cater to collectors and restorers.  Swap meets have expanded exponentially in size and quality over recent years, as many restorers and car owners seek out parts and services to maintain their prized vehicles. Today, car swap meet attendees will find treasures and collectibles, along with hard-to-find vintage car parts and accessories. At the Fort Worth Car Storage Car Swap Meet, visitors can enjoy a variety of vendors, from car parts to clothing. And when it's time for a break, an assortment of local food trucks will be on hand, selling a diverse, tasty selection of food, snacks and beverages.  The Fort Worth Car Storage Car Swap Meet promises to be a delightful time for everyone from car collectors to families.  "Whether you're looking to buy, sell, or simply admire, this event offers something for car lovers of all ages," said Sturgeon, who is also founder and owner of the DFW Car and Toy Museum. "And while you're at the swap meet, make sure to check out the museum's collection of more than 200 cars and 3,000 rare and collectible toys."  Admission to this event is free.
