# FlipHTML5's AI Catalog Maker Creates Engaging Catalogs from Simple Prompts

HONG KONG, September 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- FlipHTML5 introduces the AI Catalog Maker, a powerful tool designed to make creating professional, interactive catalogs faster and easier than ever. Leveraging advanced AI technology, this tool is tailored for businesses and marketers seeking streamlined workflows and polished results. The AI Catalog Maker offers two innovative content generation modes to suit users at any stage of the creative process, along with robust customization options for a truly personalized touch.  The first content generation mode allows users to create a catalog from a title and a description. Users just need to input a catalog title and a brief description of its main content, target audience, and tone. The AI Catalog Maker analyzes the prompt and generates a well-structured, visually appealing electronic catalog within minutes. This option is ideal for users who have a clear concept but need a quick and professional execution. Generating via markdown guidelines is the second mode, ideal for users with pre-structured content. By uploading markdown-formatted text with chapter headers, page breaks, and image tags, users can enjoy precise control over the catalog's layout and content while benefiting from the AI's formatting expertise.  Customization options are a focal point of the AI Catalog Maker. Users can select from various page sizes, including A4, Presentation, and Flyer formats, to suit their specific publication needs. Additional features, such as color customization and multi-language support, enable users to tailor their catalogs to diverse audiences worldwide. These settings ensure that every catalog produced aligns with the user's branding, style, and communication goals.  FlipHTML5 enhances the catalog creation process with versatile features that go beyond static design. Its AI Assistant enables users to polish written content, translate text into multiple languages, and even generate images based on text prompts. Multimedia and interactive add-ons, such as embedded videos, audio, slideshows, hyperlinks, and CTA buttons, transform catalogs into dynamic publications that engage readers and drive action. Once completed, catalogs can be distributed seamlessly through custom URLs, QR codes, or embed codes, ensuring effortless sharing across websites, marketing platforms, and social media channels.  "We are thrilled to launch the AI Catalog Maker as part of our AI-powered content creation suite," said Winston Zhang, CEO of FlipHTML5.
