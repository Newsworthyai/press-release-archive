# Enzo Didi, the 26-Year-Old Tech CEO with a $174.9 Million Fortune—Defying Norms Yet Still Mistaken for a Student

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Enzo Didi, the 26-Year-Old Tech CEO with a $174.9 Million Fortune—Defying Norms Yet Still Mistaken for a Student  With his easygoing style and island lifestyle, Enzo Didi could easily be misjudged for a student on a gap year or a vacationer. But behind this casual image lies a visionary entrepreneur with a fortune estimated at $174.9 million USD as of February 20, 2025, according to Equidam. Enzo Didi owns 99.09% of the company Perfumeo.  At just 26, he is the CEO of Perfumeo, a fast-growing American tech startup specializing in AI-driven smart fragrance diffusers. His groundbreaking innovation, protected by three strategic patents across 157 countries, is revolutionizing the market by integrating artificial intelligence and smart home technology, creating a fully personalized olfactory experience.  A CEO Everyone Thinks Is a Student Whether he's wandering through the charming avenues of Saint Martin, running alongside locals on the scenic roads of Terres Basses, or playing beach volleyball on the paradisiacal white sands of Mullet Bay Beach, one question keeps coming up:  — "So, what do you do? Are you a student?"  With an amused smile, he simply replies:  — "No, I'm not a student."  The reaction is always the same—pure shock. And yet, this is probably the 36th time he's been asked!  What makes it even funnier? He was a student—but that's ancient history now. He graduated with an MSc in Marketing & Innovation in 2021, but at this point, it feels like another lifetime. It's almost ironic—no matter how much he achieves, people still assume he's just a student on vacation. A perfect reminder that appearances can be deceiving—and that clothes don't make the man.  A Successful Entrepreneur Who Breaks the Rules In a world where success is still often linked to suits and austere boardrooms, Enzo Didi represents a new kind of entrepreneur. His mindset is clear: to combine innovation, ambition, and simplicity—all while maintaining his relaxed lifestyle.  His American company, Perfumeo, based in Silicon Valley, has already caught the attention of major industry players—especially after partnering with Google. Their technology allows environments to automatically adapt to users' scent preferences, making waves in both the home fragrance and smart home markets.  But despite his meteoric rise, Enzo refuses to change his way of life. He values freedom, prioritizes a balance between business and leisure, and proves that you can reshape an industry while working remotely, under the tropical Caribbean sun.  "Success isn't about wearing a suit—it's about vision, execution, and freedom. I built Perfumeo to innovate while living life on my own terms." — Enzo Didi, CEO & founder of Perfumeo  A student? No. A game-changer redefining the future of tech? Absolutely.  And this is just the beginning. Keep an eye on Perfumeo—big things are coming.  Perfumeo is an innovative American company specializing in AI-powered smart fragrances. Founded by Enzo Didi in 2021, the company is revolutionizing the fragrance industry by combining cutting-edge technology with personalized scent experiences. Using advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence, Perfumeo creates tailor-made fragrances that adapt to individual preferences and emotions.  Headquartered in Cupertino, at the heart of Silicon Valley, Perfumeo has established itself as a key player in the industry, with a valuation reaching $176.5 million as of February 2025. Its unique approach blends luxury, science, and innovation to deliver an unprecedented sensory experience.  For more information, visit: perfumeo-ai.com
