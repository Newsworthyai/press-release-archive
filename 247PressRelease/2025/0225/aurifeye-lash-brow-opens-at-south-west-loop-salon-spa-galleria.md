# Aurifeye Lash & Brow Opens at South West Loop Salon & Spa Galleria

FORT WORTH, TX, February 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Brooke Luitjens is pleased to announce the opening of her new salon — Aurifeye Lash & Brow — located in Suite 402 of the Salon & Spa Galleria Hulen at 5530 SW Loop 820 in Fort Worth.  A graduate of the Aveda Institute in Denver, Ms. Luitjens is both a licensed esthetician and a certified lash technician. She was first drawn to her chosen profession when, at the age of fifteen, she developed Vitiligo, an auto-immune disease which causes white or light-colored patches on the skin and hair. With the help of beauty professionals, she was ultimately able to find the support needed in order to embrace her unique skin condition. Says Brooke, "I want to do for others what the beauty industry has done for me; to make others feel confident by enhancing their natural beauty, and I have found my niche in lashes and brows."  Eyelashes can be enhanced in a variety of ways, not only with classic eyelash extensions, but also with volume extensions (for the fullest, fluffiest, most dramatic look), and hybrid sets (a mix of classic and volume extensions for a more textured look). Lashes can also be tinted and/or "lifted," a treatment that keeps lashes curled for 6-8 weeks.  Options for brows go well beyond traditional shaping and waxing. Brow tint can help darken or create a filled-in brow look, while threading helps shape brows using thread and is especially good for clients who don't react well to waxes or tints. Brow lamination, which is the process of straightening unruly hairs into a gelled look that lasts about 4 to 6 weeks, is also available.

When booking online, please type "new15"in appointment notes to be sure to receive the discount.  When asked why she choose the Salon and Spa Galleria for her new endeavor, Brooke replied "I love this location because it's so easy to get to right off loop 820… my clients have said they love that they can get a lot of their shopping done when they're in this area." Brooke also likes the luxurious feel of the space which, along with her ergonomically designed furniture, helps ensure that clients feel as comfortable as possible during appointments.  As to the name of the salon, Brooke explained that it comes from the word "aurify," which means to turn into gold. "I changed the ending to eye because my work is in eyes. I like to think my work is 'golden'." Above all, she has a passion for the work and enjoys seeing her clients on a regular basis. "We really get to know each other and become friends… my clients and I joke that I'm part lash tech and part therapist."
