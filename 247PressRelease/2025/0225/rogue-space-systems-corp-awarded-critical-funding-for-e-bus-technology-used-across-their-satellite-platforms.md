# Rogue Space Systems Corp. awarded critical funding for E-Bus technology used across their satellite platforms

LACONIA, NH, February 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rogue Space Systems Corporation announces its recent award through SpaceWERX - the innovation arm of the U.S. Space Force and a unique division within AFWERX - for the development of its extensible E-Bus technology suite. The contract is valued at $1.25M and will go towards making the Rogue spacecraft platforms widely and quickly adaptable to mission needs by accommodating all communications between payloads and bus-sub systems as well as power distribution and thermal control support.   The "E-Bus" is a "Low Size, Weight, and Power" (low-SWaP) device that functions as both a power distribution module and as a networking switch with software configurable data and power ports. These ports can receive any number of common power and data interfaces used by spacecraft payloads and sub-systems.  This system has the added benefit of being highly scalable, able to support many payloads with a single device, and expandable through the use of multiple devices. Additionally, redundant devices could be used for resiliency and the nature of the design allows dynamic interconnection between any two devices on the network, allowing for straight-forward fail-over or reconfiguration on orbit.  "This investment and development for standardized and extensible bus technologies will remove the need for hardware NRE when adapting payloads. This allows Rogue to build the data infrastructure needed to make dynamically configurable crafts to support a cost-effective space logistics operation," said Michael Pica, Rogue's CTIO.   Rogue Chief Executive Officer Jon Beam states, "For space commerce to become as 'normal' to us as e-commerce became twenty years ago, spacecraft will need to become more plug-and-play and software-defined. Gone will be the days of 'wooden shoe making' of satellites, and components and subsystems will simply be plugged in. I'm thrilled that Rogue Space is at the forefront of this evolution in spacecraft development!"
