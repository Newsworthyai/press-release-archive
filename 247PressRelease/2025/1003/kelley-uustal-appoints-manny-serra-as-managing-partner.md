# Kelley | Uustal Appoints Manny Serra as Managing Partner

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Kelley | Uustal, recognized as one of the nation's premier plaintiff trial firms, is proud to announce that Manny Serra has been appointed as Managing Partner. "Manny is here to help ensure that our track record of securing precedent-setting verdicts and life-changing outcomes continues to be matched by technology, infrastructure, and modern leadership at the pinnacle of trial law," explained founder John Uustal.  Serra has litigated more than 1,500 cases and conducted over 30 jury trials. Early in his career at the Broward County Public Defender's Office, he became known for "policing the police" and Judges nicknamed him "Motion Manny." When working in the field of first-party property litigation, he witnessed how large insurers systematically underpaid claims and treated people as case files rather than human beings. "People who find themselves in our legal system deserve no stone left unturned in the quest for justice. There are no shortcuts," he said.  This conviction drove Serra to focus on delivering personalized, client-centered justice through technology, teaching other attorneys how to use artificial intelligence in practice management and law firm operations. "Tech is not about taking people out of the picture; it's about centering the person. I believe the best way to humanize the practice of law is to systematize it for the client's best interest," he explained.   Serra continued: "Kelley | Uustal is a place where the highest level of trial advocacy meets an uncompromising commitment to justice. My role is to make sure our team can stay entirely focused on getting extraordinary results for clients across the country, while I oversee the systems and innovation that sustain our success."  Prior to joining Kelley | Uustal, Serra was the managing partner of a trial firm based in Fort Lauderdale. Serra earned his law degree from Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law where he was a member of the Law Review and Moot Court Society. He has been recognized by the National Trial Lawyers Association in Top 40 Trial Lawyers Under 40, Florida Super Lawyers, Lawyers of Distinction, and most recently, the National Association of Distinguished Counsel.
