# Coastal Windows &amp; Exteriors Ranks #1 Woman-Owned Remodeler and #4 in New England — Only Roofing Company in the Region's Top 500 on the 2025 Qualified Remodeler List

BOSTON, MA, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Coastal Windows & Exteriors has been recognized on the 2025 Qualified Remodeler Top 500, ranking as New England's #1 woman-owned exterior remodeler and the only roofing company in the New England region to make the list. The family-owned company has climbed more than 200 positions in just four years, including a 42-spot jump since last year, to reach #191 nationally and #4 overall in New England. With 842+ verified Google A+ reviews with a 4.8-star rating, Coastal stands apart as the region's most trusted remodeler, delivering award-winning service in roofing, windows, doors and siding.  In an industry increasingly dominated by private equity firms and national franchises, Coastal Windows & Exteriors stands out as a family-owned, woman-led company that has climbed more than 200 spots in just four years. Owner Stephanie Vanderbilt was named Massachusetts Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration — national recognition that underscores Coastal's strength as an independent business competing at the highest level. While women hold only 13% of construction jobs nationwide (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), far fewer lead exterior remodeling firms at this scale. This makes Coastal's achievement as New England's #1 woman-owned remodeler — and the only roofing company in the region's Top 500 — especially significant.
