# Henry Halladay's "Learn Learn Learn" Turns the Lens on Itself with AI-Driven Episode 17

BELLEVUE, WA, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Learn Learn Learn, the long-running podumentary series hosted by Dr. Henry Halladay, is entering a new phase of experimentation with the introduction of an AI-assisted production format in its upcoming 17th episode. Known for providing structured insights into complex technologies, Dr. Halladay is now applying the very tools he has taught his audience about for years—artificial intelligence—directly into the creative process of the program.  For this episode, previous installments of Learn Learn Learn were used to train an AI model on Dr. Halladay's subject matter, cadence, and style. The model then produced a draft script written in what can be described as the voice of a "virtual Henry." The material was carefully reviewed and approved by Dr. Halladay, who ultimately recorded and delivered the program himself. The result is a seamless presentation that reflects his established approach while integrating the efficiency of AI assistance.  The structure of this episode is self-referential—what is often called "meta." In this context, it means the program is not only about artificial intelligence (among other things) but also partially created by it.   Henry himself asks audiences, "What better way is there for you to learn first-hand what I've been explaining all these years?"   Listeners will hear Dr. Halladay explain AI while, at the same time, delivering material generated by his own AI-trained counterpart.  Halladay adds: "It is, in many ways, the ultimate example of art reflecting life reflecting technology. I have spent years helping audiences understand the rise of AI. To now use it as part of my own production process demonstrates how these tools can extend human capability without replacing it."  The adoption of this AI-enhanced workflow will continue in at least the next two episodes as Learn Learn Learn evaluates its effectiveness and audience reception. The series remains committed to clarity, accuracy, and thoughtful commentary, while also modeling the practical applications of technologies it covers.  Will this method continue beyond these upcoming installments? "Only time will tell," says Henry.   To learn more about Learn Learn Learn, please visit the official website.
