# The Italian Barrel Reopens October 8 After 9-Week Refresh

NEW ORLEANS, LA, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Italian Barrel, a beloved French Quarter fixture for 17 years, is reopening its doors after a 9-week refresh that blends respect for its historic building with thoughtful modern updates.  Founded by Chef Samantha Castagnetti and located at the corner of Barracks Street across from the Jazz Museum, The Italian Barrel has long been celebrated for authentic Northern Italian cuisine and a romantic atmosphere. In April 2025, Lori and Kevin Cates—longtime guests who were engaged at the restaurant and are also the owners of Teddy Wong's Dumplings & Wine in Fort Worth—took stewardship to preserve and expand its legacy.  Preserving Legacy, Elevating Experience The refresh has elevated every corner of the restaurant: - Team First – the staff guests know and love remain, with extensive training to refine both service and culinary skills. - Bar Transformation – custom oak shelving and LED backlighting now highlight the exposed brick wall behind the bar and a greatly expanded wine collection. - New Furnishings – stylish, comfortable chairs and barstools. - Floor-to-Ceiling Drapery – framing French Quarter views while heightening intimacy. - Bathrooms – refreshed and modernized (and yes, the "throne" is gone—iykyk). - Infrastructure – upgraded kitchen equipment, new AC, grease trap, and back-of-house improvements.  A Menu Rooted in Northern Italy The revitalized menu honors Italy's regional traditions: Nonna Novella's Bolognese – Bologna Style: a family recipe rich with authenticity and depth. Osso Buco – now offered seven days a week. Penne al Gorgonzola e Noci – a classic Ligurian dish of creamy Gorgonzola, toasted walnuts, and balsamic. Seared Tuna Steak – inspired by the Northern Italian coast, served over arugula pine-nut pesto linguini with blistered cherry tomatoes and oyster mushrooms. Wine Program – expanded to feature over 30 Italian wines by the glass, with a strong emphasis on Barolo, Barbaresco, and Southern Italian discoveries.  Hours, Holidays & Reservations - Reservations: now available via OpenTable. - Hours: open seven days a week, 11 AM – 10 PM. - Holiday Service: open on both Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, offering a warm Italian setting with large tables for the season's celebrations.  Upcoming Experiences - Grand Reopening – October 8, 2025. - Fall Truffle Specials – late October 2025. - Holiday Menus – November & December 2025. - Private Dining Room & Wine Dinner Series – launching Spring 2026, with seating for up to 36.  "For us, The Italian Barrel is personal—we fell in love with this restaurant long before we became its stewards. My mother emigrated from near Venice, so bringing authentic Northern Italian flavors to the French Quarter feels like honoring both her heritage and the legacy of this neighborhood treasure." — Kevin Cates, Co-Owner  Additionally, The Italian Barrel refreshed their website and social media channels.
