SALT LAKE CITY, UT, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alsco Uniforms provides uniforms, linens, and facility services to businesses throughout Southern California and around the world. At their recent Managers Meeting in San Diego, they announced a donation of $50,000 to Father Joe's Villages. This contribution will help Father Joe's Villages provide services and support for people experiencing homelessness in the San Diego area.  Over 9,900 people face the challenges of homelessness in San Diego County. Across the United States, homeless populations are at a record high, and demand for services continues to rise. With rising housing costs and insufficient resources, homelessness is a major challenge for many cities.  "At Alsco Uniforms, we recognize that we are a part of the communities we serve," said Bob Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Alsco Uniforms. "We've been serving businesses in Southern California for 92 years, we feel at home here, and we want to help take care of our most vulnerable neighbors. Father Joe's has been helping people for 75 years, and we are honored to contribute to their important work."  Father Joe's Villages has helped homeless people in San Diego for 75 years. After starting as a small chapel in 1950, the organization has expanded to offer aid like housing, meals, childcare, family services, medical and dental care, and vocational training. These services help meet basic needs to address immediate concerns and strengthen self-sufficiency so people can achieve long-term independence.  "We warmly thank Alsco Uniform for their generous gift of $50,000, a contribution that will support lifesaving work to help our neighbors access housing, health care, and a brighter future. But this gift is more than even that: it's our own community coming together to show our neighbors that, together, we care," said Deacon Jim Vargas, CEO of Father Joe's Villages.  With this donation, Alsco Uniforms is supporting Father Joe's Villages' mission to prevent and end homelessness. The contribution reflects ongoing corporate social responsibility efforts from Alsco Uniforms.  "I'm proud to work for a company that believes in giving back," said Francisco Lopez, General Manager of the Alsco Uniforms Vista branch.
