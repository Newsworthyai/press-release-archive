# Rare Elegance Meets Utility: 1960 Mercedes-Benz 190b Binz Kombiwagen on Display at the DFW Car and Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The perfect fusion of classic style and practical innovation, the 1960 Mercedes-Benz 190b Binz Kombiwagen now stands proudly among the automotive icons of the Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. One of just 349 examples converted by renowned German coachbuilder Binz between 1958 and 1961, this rare Kombiwagen embodies the spirit of postwar luxury reimagined for versatility.  Finished in an eye-catching Salmon (SW) hue, the 190b is powered by a robust 1.9-liter inline-four engine paired to a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Recently overhauled during its refurbishment, the drivetrain delivers smooth and reliable performance befitting its pedigree.   Beneath its elegant lines, the factory double-wishbone front and single-joint rear axle suspension with coil springs ensure a composed ride, while braking is handled by four-corner drum brakes.  Inside, the cabin is refreshingly authentic with Tobacco MB-Tex vinyl upholstery, matching door panels, gray molded rubber floor liners, and classic woodgrain accents along the dash. Thoughtful details like vent windows, polished rear door pulls, a locking glove box, and a period-correct Becker Mexico radio highlight the craftsmanship Mercedes-Benz was known for during this golden era of design.  The true magic of the Binz conversion lies in its functionality: a split-opening tailgate and liftgate, a forward-folding rear bench for a flat extended load surface, and an enclosed storage compartment beneath the floorâ€”all features that made this vehicle as useful as it was luxurious.  Framed by a two-spoke steering wheel with a chrome horn ring, the VDO instrumentation and 100-mph speedometer offer a driving experience steeped in nostalgia and charm.  As part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, this 1960 Mercedes-Benz 190b Binz Kombiwagen is a tribute to the ingenuity of custom coachbuilding and the enduring beauty of one of Germany's most storied marques.
