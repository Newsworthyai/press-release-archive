# New Record Set For Law Rocks Seattle

SEATTLE, WA, October 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Seattle personal injury lawyers at Herschensohn Law Firm are proud to be featured sponsors for the Second Annual Seattle Law Rocks concert event, featuring musical acts from some of the city's top legal firms. Law Rocks is an international foundation with a mission to fund music education for underprivileged youth, partnering with local nonprofit organizations in each host city of a Law Rocks concert.  Combining the power of generosity with the power of music, Law Rocks is an epic battle of the bands fundraising concert, starring legal professionals in their "night jobs" as hard rockers and ballad crooners.  "Our goal is to raise money for those less fortunate than ourselves, while giving the legal industry the chance to realize their potential as rock stars!" ~ Nick Child, Law Rocks Founder  Six amateur bands comprised of members of the Seattle community gathered onstage at The Crocodile on Saturday, September 25. Groups were judged by fellow members of the legal community, including those from Herschensohn Law Firm, PLLC.  The Overall Winner and Hustle & Heart Award went to The Funk Docket (featuring legal talent from Schroeter Goldmark & Bender, The Law Offices of Edward H. Moore, Keller Rohrback, and L.M. Jones), which rocked for the Academy for Creating Excellence (ACE).  Our Judges' Choice Award went to The Lumberjax (featuring legal talent from Christensen O'Connor Johnson Kindness) rocking for Teen Talking Circles.  In the two years since Law Rocks implemented the Music Matters grant, supporting music education in underserved communities, the organization has raised $9 million and toured to 31 cities across five continents, bringing its signature combination of rock 'n' roll and charitable donations.  Seattle's Law Rocks concert raised an impressive $105,000, with most of the funds remaining in the local community to benefit youth. Over 600 tickets were sold for this year's event; we anticipate an even higher turnout for 2026!
