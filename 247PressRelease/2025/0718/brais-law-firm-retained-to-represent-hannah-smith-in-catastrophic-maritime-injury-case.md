# Brais Law Firm Retained to Represent Hannah Smith in Catastrophic Maritime Injury Case

MIAMI, FL, July 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On May 12, 2025, Hannah Smith, a 22-year-old summa cum laude graduate of Miles College, suffered catastrophic injuries during a shore excursion in Nassau, Bahamas, booked through Carnival Cruise Line's "Pearl Island Beach Escape with Lunch." While disembarking from a catamaran operated by Pearl Investment Management Group, Ltd. and Sun Cay Ltd., Ms. Smith was drawn into the vessel's propellers, which were reportedly running and engaged in reverse, leading to severe injuries. She underwent multiple emergency surgeries in Nassau and was later airlifted to Miami for advanced care, ultimately requiring three successive amputations of her right leg, culminating in a hip disarticulation. Brais Law Firm, specializing in maritime personal injury litigation, has been retained to represent Ms. Smith and is conducting a thorough investigation into the incident.  The firm anticipates filing a lawsuit against Carnival Corporation, Pearl Investment Management Group, Ltd., and Sun Cay Ltd., alleging direct negligence by Carnival for failing to ensure the safety of the excursion and vicarious liability due to the excursion operators acting as Carnival's agents. Claims against the operators focus on unsafe practices, particularly allowing disembarkation while the vessel's engines were active, violating industry safety standards. Carnival is expected to deny liability, claiming the excursion operators were independent contractors and that it lacked control or knowledge of unsafe practices. Brais Law Firm plans to counter these defenses by emphasizing Carnival's role in marketing and selling the excursion, establishing apparent agency under maritime law.
