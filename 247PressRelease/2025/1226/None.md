# I Can't See My Ears by Riley Peiker

SAN JOSE, CA, December 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Riley Peiker's I Can't See My Ears is a warm, playful celebration of curiosity, confidence, and the joy of being exactly who you are, told through the eyes of a lovable dog named Murphy.  Page by page, Murphy shares a simple but funny truth: he can't see his own ears. But that doesn't stop him from noticing everything else that makes his world wonderful. From smelling cats and rats, chasing balls, barking all day long, and stretching out like "Super Dog," Murphy invites readers into the everyday magic of a dog's life. Along the way, young readers laugh, recognize themselves, and learn that not seeing something doesn't mean it isn't there.  With rhythmic repetition and gentle humor, the story builds confidence and self-awareness in a way that feels natural and joyful. Murphy may not see his ears—or even the spots on his face, but he knows who he is. And by the end, so do we.   "I can't see my ears," Murphy reminds us, "but I sure am cute."   Perfect for read-aloud, classrooms, and bedtime routines, I Can't See My Ears encourages children to explore perspective, body awareness, and self-love, all through the playful lens of a dog who naps hard, listens closely, and definitely notices what's on the counter.   Murphy's story doesn't just live on the page. As the final wink to readers reveals, you can even see him on Instagram, proof that sometimes being seen isn't about what you can see, but how others see you.

About the Author  Riley Peiker writes with humor, heart, and an appreciation for the small moments that make life meaningful.
