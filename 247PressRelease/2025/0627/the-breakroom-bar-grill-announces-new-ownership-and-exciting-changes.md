# The Breakroom Bar &amp; Grill Announces New Ownership and Exciting Changes

CLEARWATER, FL, June 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Big things are happening at The Breakroom Bar & Grill! We're proud to announce that the restaurant is officially under new ownership — and we can't wait for you to experience what's next.  Earlier this year, Angela Hiatt made the bold decision to leave behind a demanding 9–5 job as a medical biller and pursue a lifelong dream: owning her own business. With no previous restaurant or business ownership experience, Angela poured her passion, energy, and heart into creating something she could truly call her own.  She's joined by her son, Maxx Alexander, who left a successful career in web development (and before that, the machinist trade) to help lead the transformation. While Maxx first stepped into the food service industry at 18, this time he's doing more than just working in a restaurant — he's helping to run one. Together, this mother-son team is bringing new life, community spirit, and a fresh perspective to The Breakroom.  While the ownership has changed, many of the familiar faces that guests know and love are still part of the team. Erik, a longtime favorite among Breakroom regulars, continues to deliver his signature warmth, expertise, and hospitality — making everyone feel like family the moment they walk in the door.  In the kitchen, beloved chefs Christian and Oscar are back at it, continuing to craft the made-from-scratch dishes that have become staples of The Breakroom experience. With their culinary creativity and deep passion for food, they're committed to serving meals that are both comforting and innovative.  Lunch is Back!  One of the first exciting updates under the new leadership is the return of lunch service on Thursdays and Fridays — complete with a brand new menu full of fresh, flavorful options perfect for a midday bite.  New Hours of Operation: • Monday–Wednesday: 4pm – 10pm • Thursday & Friday: 11am – 10pm  And there's more to come. Plans are underway to expand lunch service to 4–5 days a week, refresh the dinner menu, and introduce new entertainment and dining experiences for the community to enjoy.  "This is more than a business," says Angela. "It's a dream come true. We want The Breakroom to be a place where everyone feels welcome, where the food is made with love, and where community comes first."  Whether you're a long-time regular or a first-time guest, now is the perfect time to stop by and see what's new. The Breakroom Bar & Grill is entering a new era — and we'd love for you to be part of it.  Follow us on social media for the latest updates, menu additions, and special events.
