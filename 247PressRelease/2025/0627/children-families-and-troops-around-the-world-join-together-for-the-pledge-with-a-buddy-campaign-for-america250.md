"From classrooms to military bases, the Pledge of Allegiance is more than just words — it's a shared promise that connects Americans of all ages and backgrounds. Whether spoken by a child learning it for the first time or a service member reciting it far from home, the pledge represents unity, purpose, and pride.  With Patriot Buddy, we're helping turn this daily tradition into a meaningful, lasting lesson. Each Buddy encourages children to understand the values behind the pledge — liberty, justice, and unity — through storytelling, character, and connection. It's not just about memorization. It's about making the words matter.  One buddy. One voice. One shared purpose.  Together, we honor the past, engage the present, and inspire the future — one pledge at a time."  — The Curly Girly Button Buddies Team  "May the hand of a buddy always be near."   Meet the Button Buddies – Designed for Wonder, Made for Connection Our unique and educational children's products are crafted to spark imagination and encourage meaningful discovery—for kids and grown-ups alike!  Button Buddies are more than just adorable companions—they're storytelling sidekicks, imaginative playmates, and comforting friends. Each Buddy is easy to recognize by their colorful belly "button," which matches the color of their right foot. Their soft Velcro hands and sit-down bottoms make them perfect for both praying and playing, holding hands, or clutching small treasures.
