# A Farewell to an Era: 1994 Ferrari 348 Spyder Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, June 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A sleek symbol of transition and legacy, the 1994 Ferrari 348 Spider now takes its place in the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collectionâ€”a fitting tribute to the last V8 Ferrari developed during Enzo Ferrari's lifetime.  Finished in striking blue, this open-top stunner is powered by a 3.4-liter DOHC V8 (Tipo F119) paired with a gated five-speed dogleg manual transaxle. With Bosch Motronic engine management, the power plant delivers a factory-rated 312 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, funneled to the rear wheels through a limited-slip differential.  Designed by legendary Pininfarina stylist Leonardo Fioravanti, the 348 was a departure from its predecessors, embracing sharp angles and refined aerodynamics. Braking is handled by four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes with Ferrari-branded calipers and ventilated rotors, ensuring high-speed control with signature Italian precision.  Inside, the leather-wrapped cockpit features Veglia Borletti instrumentation, including a 200-mph speedometer, a 7,500-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges neatly mounted in the center stack. The gated shifter, Tubi Style exhaust, and only 8,000 miles on the odometer make this example as mechanically thrilling as it is visually striking.  "This car represents the end of an era and the dawn of modern Ferrari performance," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a beautifully preserved piece of history, and a true driver's car."  With timeless styling, low miles, and pure analog engagement, the 1994 Ferrari 348 Spider is a striking reminder of Ferrari's golden bridge between past and future.
