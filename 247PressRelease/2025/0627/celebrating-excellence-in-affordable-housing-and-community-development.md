# Celebrating Excellence in Affordable Housing and Community Development:

RALEIGH, NC, June 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Annually, CAHEC recognizes individuals and organizations for their significant contributions to the affordable housing and community development industries at our Awards Luncheon during the Partners Conference. This year the conference was held in downtown Raleigh, with the Awards Luncheon occurring on June 3rd – the first day of the conference.  CAHEC is pleased to share the recipients of the 2025 CAHEC Awards:  • Development of the Year - Davis Park Station   Davis Park Station, winner of the Development of the Year award, is a vibrant new development offering 73 affordable housing units for families, featuring a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom garden-style apartments. Designed with comfort and convenience in mind, each unit includes washer/dryer hookups and Energy Star appliances. The community also provides on-site laundry facilities and a dedicated management office. What truly sets Davis Park Station apart is its innovative public-private partnership with the City of Lexington, which has resulted in the integration of a Workforce Training Center directly within the community. This unique facility will deliver valuable career development and employment services to both residents and members of the surrounding neighborhood. Located in the heart of downtown Lexington—a focal point of ongoing revitalization efforts—Davis Park Station is part of a broader vision that includes mixed-use housing and community growth. It stands as a model for inclusive urban development, where affordable living and opportunity go hand in hand.  • CAHEC Values Award – Reacy Lockhart  Reacy Lockhart serves as the Maintenance Lead Technician for the Columbus Housing Authority in Columbus, GA. With over 16 years of dedicated service, he stands out as one of the Authority's most experienced and long-tenured maintenance professionals. Reacy currently oversees maintenance operations at two CAHEC-managed communities: Arbor Pointe II and Arbor Pointe III, which comprise 148 and 120 units, respectively. In addition, there is a third phase of comparable size, although not under CAHEC's management. These expansive properties feature a wide array of shared amenities, including a swimming pool, splash pad, theater room, multiple playgrounds, shuffleboard courts, and more, offering residents a vibrant and well-maintained living environment. Reacy is dedicated, hardworking, and personable. He serves those around him with a smile on his face, truly living out CAHEC's values.  • Outstanding Community Impact - Goodwill West Louisville Opportunity Center   Goodwill Industries of Kentucky was honored with the Outstanding Community Impact Award for its transformative and forward-thinking approach to community development. Rather than simply constructing a new headquarters, Goodwill made the bold decision to establish its West Louisville Opportunity Center in a severely distressed neighborhood, envisioning a comprehensive social services center that would offer holistic support and life-improving opportunities for local residents offering a hand up, not a hand out. A key factor in the project's success was the depth of community engagement throughout its planning and development. Through surveys, focus groups, and ongoing dialogue, Goodwill ensured the voices and needs of the community were at the heart of the initiative. The effort also exemplified strong collaboration, requiring coordination with numerous local service providers co-locating in the center, healthcare organizations, and stakeholders, along with substantial fundraising efforts to bring the vision to life. One of the most remarkable outcomes of the project was the improvement in healthcare access. The initiative served as a catalyst for the development of a new hospital on the campus—the first in the area in over 150 years—marking a historic milestone in addressing longstanding healthcare disparities in the community.  • Resident Spotlight – Kellie Freeman  This year's Resident Spotlight Award was given to Kellie Freeman, a resident of Cornelia Gardens in Cornelia, GA. When Kellie moved into Cornelia Garden Apartments at the end of 2021, she was struggling with depression, anxiety, and significant stress. She had recently left a difficult situation at a nearby apartment complex, where a lack of support and unaffordable rent left her choosing between shelter and basic necessities. Since moving to Cornelia Gardens, Kellie's life has taken a remarkable turn. With stable, affordable housing, she can now comfortably manage her rent, pay her bills, access healthcare, and maintain a healthy diet. The supportive management team has provided her with a renewed sense of security and peace of mind. Beyond finding stability, Kellie has truly become an active and cherished member of the community. She actively participates in on-site activities and frequently spreads kindness by sharing homemade baked goods with her neighbors. Kellie helps foster a welcoming environment at Cornelia Garden, and she's often recognized as someone with a positive and uplifting presence.
