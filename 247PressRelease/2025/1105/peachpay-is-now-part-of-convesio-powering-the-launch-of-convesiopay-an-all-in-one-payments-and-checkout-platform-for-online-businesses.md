NAPLES, FL, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Convesio today announced that PeachPay is now part of Convesio, with the PeachPay team joining Convesio, and that ConvesioPay – Convesio's existing payments platform – will now be powered and delivered through PeachPay's all-in-one payments and checkout experience for modern WooCommerce and online businesses.  Convesio now serves more than 10,000 sites across its platform. With ConvesioPay fully integrated into PeachPay and Convesio operating as a payment facilitator, the company is evolving from a pure hosting provider into a fintech-driven commerce platform that helps merchants run their stores, get paid, and manage their payments stack.  "As PeachPay becomes part of Convesio and their team joins ours, this is a pivotal milestone for our platform," said Tom Fanelli, Founder and CEO of Convesio. "By bringing PeachPay's all-in-one payments and checkout experience into Convesio, we're turning Convesio into a true commerce engine – the fastest way to host, scale & get paid on WordPress. ConvesioPay lets them connect more payment methods, see everything in one dashboard, and deliver a modern checkout that actually helps them sell more."  With the launch of ConvesioPay, Convesio has become a payment facilitator, allowing the company to support merchants across the full payment lifecycle – from onboarding and payouts to risk management and reporting – while PeachPay powers the checkout and payment experience on the front end.  "I'm excited about what ConvesioPay means for merchants and agencies," Fanelli said. "Our goal is to take the complexity out of payments so our customers can focus on building products, serving customers, and growing revenue. With the PeachPay team now at Convesio, powering the payment and checkout experience, and Convesio supporting everything from infrastructure to payouts, we think ConvesioPay is going to be a huge unlock for the businesses we work with."
