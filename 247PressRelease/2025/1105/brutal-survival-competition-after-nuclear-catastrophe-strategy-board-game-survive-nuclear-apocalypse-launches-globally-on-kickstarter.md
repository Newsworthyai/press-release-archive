# Brutal Survival Competition After Nuclear Catastrophe: Strategy Board Game "Survive Nuclear Apocalypse!" Launches Globally on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Board Collie Games, a studio specializing in strategic board games, is officially launching its survival strategy board game "Survive Nuclear Apocalypse!" on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  Centered around the single premise that "not everyone can survive," this game is a 30‑minute strategic survival experience where every player's choice determines their fate. Amid a ruined city and scarce resources, players must decide whether to form alliances or face betrayal and fight for survival alone — every decision shapes a different ending.  "Survive Nuclear Apocalypse!" is a 2–4 player strategy board game featuring 160 cards—including Event, Item, Supply, and Radiation cards—and three types of custom dice: Standard, Lucky, and Exhausted. Each round, players roll dice to complete missions, trade resources, or forge alliances to increase their chances of survival. Those who run out of food and water must rely on the risk‑laden "Exhausted Die," while accumulating five Radiation (Rad) cards leads to immediate elimination, heightening the game's tension. Despite its short playtime, it offers deep immersion and high replayability, with every session unfolding differently based on shuffled cards.  In this Kickstarter campaign, special item cards (stretch goals) that can alter the course of the game will be revealed based on backer participation. Each funding milestone unlocks new cards and scenarios, with gameplay difficulty and experience evolving according to the scale of support.  All rules are presented on a single sheet, allowing beginners to learn the game in under five minutes. Although each session lasts only around 30 minutes, elements of resource management, negotiation, betrayal, and luck interweave to create intense strategic tension for every player. Two‑player matches emphasize fast‑paced mind games, while four‑player sessions heighten complexity through fierce resource competition and unpredictable twists.  A representative from Board Collie Games stated, "Through this Kickstarter campaign, we plan to directly engage with a global audience and lay the foundation for market entry." They added, "We will actively continue collaborations with U.S.-based board game YouTubers, reviewers, and communities to develop follow-up products and theme-based series."  Board Collie Games, "Survive Nuclear Apocalypse!" will be available for backing on the Kickstarter homepage starting October 28, 2025, with special perks offered to supporters on launch day.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1256013520/1018532486?ref=3i8fl3
