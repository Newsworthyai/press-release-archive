# Beneath the Regime, Beyond the Fear makes its powerful debut

MILTON KEYNES, ENGLAND, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Beneath the Regime, Beyond the Fear, the hauntingly intimate memoir by Syrian defector Naser, written by Andrea D. Woolhead, is now officially available worldwide—and early readers are calling it "a vital testimony of modern history" and "a brave act of remembrance and defiance."  Launched just weeks ago to strong early praise, the book offers a rare and eye-opening perspective on life within Bashar al-Assad's inner circle, through the eyes of a man who walked away from it all. A former Major General in Syria's feared Political Security Department, Naser risked everything by speaking out against the regime's atrocities. His decision led to months of solitary confinement and brutal interrogations, but the years that followed were no less painful, as he was cast out and isolated, even after fleeing Syria.  Now living in the UK, Naser shares his story not as a victim, but as a witness, on behalf of those still silenced. "I had to tell the world," He writes. "Not to seek sympathy, but to prevent forgetting."  Since its release, the memoir has sparked emotional reactions from readers and reviewers alike, who applaud its honesty, humility, and timely political relevance. The narrative deftly combines personal testimony with cultural history, exploring the psychological cost of complicity and the courage it takes to resist an entire system.  What the Critics Are Saying:  • "An unflinching account that puts a human face to the headlines." • "Reads like a political thriller—except it's heartbreakingly true." • "More than a refugee story. It's a blueprint for moral courage."  Naser is a former Syrian intelligence officer turned whistleblower. He now lives in exile in the UK and dedicates his life to raising awareness about authoritarian regimes and their impact on civil society.  Andrea D.
