# Ispirer Systems Announces New Web-Based SQLWays Platform to Streamline Database Migration

DOVER, DE, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ispirer Systems, an international software company that provides customers with an effective way to improve IT infrastructure, today announced the launch of its completely redesigned, web-based SQLWays platform. This new version simplifies the database migration process by providing a flexible and intuitive web interface with enhanced project management and code-handling capabilities.  The new SQLWays addresses common migration challenges by replacing complex, manual processes with a central hub. This allows database administrators (DBAs) and developers to manage every stage of their project, from setup to execution and validation, with greater control and clarity.  A Redesigned Migration Workflow  The new platform introduces a ground-up redesign focused on user experience and project control. Key features include:  1. Centralized Project Management A new web dashboard displays all migration projects in a single, visible list, replacing manual file tracking.  2. Simplified Project Setup A three-stage process (Project Type, Source, Target) allows for faster project creation, down from a 10-step wizard.  3. Integrated Code Editor Users can now view, edit, and fix conversion results directly within the SQLWays interface. This enables a rapid fix-and-test cycle by allowing the import of single objects to validate changes.  4. Detailed Status Tracking The tool provides clear status updates for every object (Conversion, Import) and introduces a custom Validated status for users to track their manual review process.  5. Intuitive Configuration Complex migration options have been moved from text files into a clean GUI. The interface contextually displays only relevant settings and includes built-in documentation and code examples for each option.  The new SQLWays platform transforms the migration workflow. The built-in editor eliminates the need for external tools, while the in-app guidance empowers users to configure advanced settings with confidence, reducing reliance on support.  Availability Ispirer is inviting everyone interested to be the first to experience the new web-based SQLWays. The web-based tool is available now at the Ispirer website.
