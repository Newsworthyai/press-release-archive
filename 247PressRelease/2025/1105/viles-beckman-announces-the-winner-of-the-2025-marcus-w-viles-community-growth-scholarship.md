# Viles &amp; Beckman Announces the Winner of the 2025 Marcus W. Viles Community Growth Scholarship

FORT MYERS, FL, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Viles & Beckman Foundation, Inc., in connection with Viles & Beckman, offers its Marcus W. Viles Community Growth Scholarship to honor Marcus Viles's commitment to bettering the world around him. This year, the scholarship selection committee chose Claudia Masmitja Corujo to carry on Marcus's legacy.  Claudio Corujo is a student at the University of Florida, majoring in Health Education and Behavior on a Pre-PA track. Her scholarship essay goes into detail about her experience as a first-generation college student with an international background. That background has shaped her perspective on community and inspired her to offer a helping hand to young people seeking support.  Corujo was born in Spain to a family with "deep Cuban roots." Her family moved to Miami when she was young, at which point they were rapidly integrated into a community that "embraced, understood, and celebrated" all of her identities. "The kindness I received during that difficult transition inspired me to one day become that source of comfort and familiarity for others," she says.  Her essay continues to elaborate on how this experience affected her desire to support the people around her. Upon going to college, Corujo joined the First-Generation Leadership Program, which connected her with other multicultural, first-generation students looking for support.  Corujo's experiences with the First-Generation Leadership Program saw her grow her personal network and find new mentorship opportunities. From 2024 to 2025, she served as the program's Head of Public Relations, intent on giving back to the institution that had helped her grow.   At the same time, she partnered with the Member Leadership Program and began working as a substitute teacher with the UF Early Childhood Collaboratory.  Corujo's consistency and determination make her the ideal candidate to carry on Marcus Viles' legacy. Her scholarship essay paints a picture of a young woman who has gone to exceptional lengths to connect with the people around her and developed a symbiotic, supportive relationship as a result.  When asked about the impact that The Marcus W. Viles Community Growth Scholarship will have on her college career, Corujo reports that the scholarship's $2,500 will help her continue to study "how economic disparities and social inequities disproportionately affect marginalized groups, especially in healthcare."   She hopes to pursue a Health Education and Behavior Combined Master's Program upon her graduation, after which she intends to work in pediatrics or neonatal care.  The scholarship selection committee with Viles & Beckman Foundation, Inc., and Viles & Beckman applauds Corujo's compassion and wishes her the best of luck as she continues her studies.
