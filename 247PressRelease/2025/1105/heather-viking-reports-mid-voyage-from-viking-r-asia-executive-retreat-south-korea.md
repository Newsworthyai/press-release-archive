# Heather Viking Reports Mid-Voyage from Viking® Asia Executive Retreat — South Korea

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA, November 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Where in the World is Heather Viking?  Today, she's in Busan, South Korea, leading Day 10 of the Viking Asia Executive Retreat aboard the Viking Yi Dun.  From the decks of this sleek ocean vessel, Heather Viking, Director of the Viking Journey Benefits & Rewards Advantage™ Division by Club Cruise™, shares insights as Viking's Vice President Michele Saegesser—newly named Godmother of the Viking Honin—hosts an exclusive leadership voyage across Asia.  The retreat blends executive training, cultural discovery, and cutting-edge travel technology while Club Cruise™ Sunny California HQ celebrates a record quarter back home.  A Milestone at Sea  Now docked in Busan, participants explored Haedong Yonggungsa Temple and Gijang Market before re-boarding for evening leadership sessions.  The Viking Yi Dun (formerly Viking Sun) is Viking's first ship permanently based in Asia, underscoring the brand's commitment to sustainable tourism and cross-cultural understanding.  Fun Fact: South Korea is nearly 70 percent mountainous, and Busan's Gamcheon Culture Village was once a wartime refuge that artists later transformed into a pastel-colored hillside maze — now one of the country's most photographed neighborhoods.  Heather's Asia Insights — Day 10 Dispatch  Language Tip (Japan): "Arigatō gozaimasu" () is the polite way to say thank you — the longer phrase adds respect.  Language Tip (Korea): "" (Gamsahamnida) means thank you in Korean — polite, warm, and universally appreciated.  Did You Know? The number 4 ("shi") is considered unlucky in Japan and Korea; many buildings and ships skip Deck 4 entirely.  Cultural Note (Korea): Remove your shoes before entering a home or traditional restaurant — it's a gesture of humility and cleanliness.  Time Sense (China): 8 p.m. is the "prosperity hour" for celebrations — the number 8 sounds like wealth in Mandarin.  Tech Insight: Heather's AI-enhanced Google Glass Meta Shades instantly translate menus, convert currencies, and capture media. From translation to SEO tagging, her wearables turn travel into interactive storytelling.  Leadership and Learning  Heather Viking continues to demonstrate why she's a leading authority among Viking® specialists.  Her Viking Journey Advantage™ Rewards program offers exclusive perks including pre-paid gratuities, $500 Bonus Spending Credits, and the popular Club Cruise Silver Spirits Package — the gold standard for inclusive luxury at sea.  Momentum from Sunny California HQ  Back home in Northern California, Club Cruise™ finished its quarter with record Viking® momentum and a surge of last-minute group bookings, including a new contract departure.  Group discounts, Bonus Credits, and Advantage Rewards continue to attract discerning travelers who value concierge-level planning and trusted expertise.
