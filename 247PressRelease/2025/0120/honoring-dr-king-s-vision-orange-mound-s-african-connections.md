MEMPHIS, TN, January 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On November 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill making the third Monday in January a federal holiday in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy. Anthony "Amp" Elmore Sr., a Memphis-born, 5-time world kickboxing champion, community activist, Memphis's first 35mm independent theatrical filmmaker, and content creator, is using his skills and dedication to honor Dr. King's vision through Orange Mound's African connections.   Elmore explains; my mission in Orange Mound 'Honoring Dr. King's Vision: Orange Mound's African Connections,' is to challenge the oppressive narrative that attributes the origins of Orange Mound solely to a White plantation owner John Deaderick from the 1825 to 1830, and to assert the rightful history and heritage of Orange Mound as rooted in the rich Afro-Indigenous culture, tracing back to the ancient Mali Empire and the Mound Builders, thereby empowering the community to reclaim and celebrate its true legacy beyond the confines of a slave narrative."   Elmore's efforts have influenced Orange Mound to become "The Birthplace of African Cultural Diplomacy" in honor of Dr. King's legacy. Click here to see Video.

In his last speech in Memphis on April 3, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. mentioned Nairobi, Kenya; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Accra, Ghana. Founded in 1953 by Black man Bayard Rustin and White Man George Houser the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) was dedicated to supporting African liberation struggles and informing the American public about African issues. As one of the first national organizations dedicated to anti-colonial struggles in Africa, the organization played host to countless African leaders in the United States. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. served on the national committee from 1957 until his death.   Elmore explains we must remember the name Bayard Rustin. From December 5, 1955 to December 20, 1956 Dr. Martin Luther King lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott whereas 4 months before the end of the Montgomery Bus Boycott on August 15,1956 ACOA brought a 26 year old African by the name of Tom Mboya from a place then called British East Africa that would later become Kenya. Mboya spoke at colleges in America garnering scholarships for Africans to come to America for an education. Mboya noted that for his people to operate their County youth needed to be educated  From March 4 to March 12, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King traveled to West Africa to attend Ghana's independence ceremony. One month later, on April 19, 1957, Dr. King spoke in Memphis at Metropolitan Baptist Church across from Lemoyne College in Memphis. Dr. King was connected to Memphis long before his death in Memphis in 1968. Unknown and untold Dr. King loved Orange Mound and one of his closest friends in Memphis was Adjua Naantaabuu who started Kwanzaa celebration in Memphis whereas she operated the "Village Barber Shop in Orange Mound."   In regards to the Montgomery Bus Boycott Anthony "Amp" Elmore quit college in 1972 to join with Dr. King's and the SCLC Chief Strategist of the Montgomery Bus Boycott Rev. James Bevel.

On April 18, 1959, Dr. King was the chair and spoke at the "Youth for Integrated Schools" event in Washington, D.C. Among the speakers was Tom Mboya, the voice from Africa. Less than a month later, on May 13, 1959, Dr. King and the SCLC honored Tom Mboya via an event called "The African Freedom Dinner."  Honoring Tom Mboya at Atlanta University, Dr. King said, "Our struggle is not an isolated struggle. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality." Dr. King was deeply connected to Africa and Elmore notes that celebrations honoring Dr. King should include his efforts to join Africans and African/Americans together.  "Dr. King who successfully led the Montgomery Bus Boycott that ended in December of 1956 was a pivotal moment in the American civil rights struggle. Meanwhile, from 1956 to 1959, Tom Mboya was at the forefront of an equally transformative movement in Africa, advocating for independence from colonial rule.   Young and articulate, Mboya's leadership reshaped American perceptions of Africa and Africans. His efforts culminated in the "Airlift America" program in 1959 where he secured numerous scholarships for African students. The program gained support from notable figures like baseball legend Jackie Robinson, singer Harry Belafonte, and actor Sidney Poitier, who helped raise funds for chartering a flight to bring African students to America. Among those who benefited was a 23-year-old Kenyan, Barack Obama Sr., who traveled to Hawaii for his education. His son Barack Obama Jr. would later become America's 1st Black President in 2008.  On May 13, 1959, Dr. King and the SCLC hosted the "African Freedom Dinner" in honor of Tom Mboya. Dr. King Pictured in Orange Mound at Mt Moriah Baptist Church August of 1959 tells a story about Dr. King's strong association to Orange Mound. On September 11, 1959, 81 students arrived from East Africa., Dr. King's church sponsored a few of the African students, further bridging the civil rights movements in America and Africa."   Tom Mboya played a pivotal role in American history, particularly in the context of the 1960 Presidential Election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Mboya, a charismatic and articulate leader from Kenya, was instrumental in reshaping American perceptions of Africa and Africans. His efforts in securing scholarships for African students brought the "Airlift America" program that launched Mboya into the spotlight. In 1960, Mboya appeared on the cover of Time Magazine on March 7, 1960 highlighting his influence and the significance of his work.  In 1960 Mboya has acquired so many scholarship whereas he needed to charter another airplane to bring students to America for College. Mboya asked Vice President Nixon and the state department declined. Desperate Mboya met with Kennedy whereas when Kennedy learned that there was no one to support the African students Kennedy agreed that their family's foundation would assist.  This strategic move helped Kennedy gain crucial support from the Black community, ultimately contributing to his victory in the 1960 election. Mboya's influence extended beyond his own continent, leaving a lasting impact on American civil rights and politics in America.  This story noted earlier to remember the name Bayard Rustin. Bayard Rustin who help found ACOA in 1953 whereas ACOA brought Tom Mboya to America in 1956. It was Bayard Rustin who organized the most significant "March on Washington in American history."
