# National Memoir Writing Month Spotlight: 88-Year-Old Author Shares a Lifetime of Resilience in The Hawk

BOCA RATON, FL, November 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As National Memoir Writing Month celebrates the power of personal storytelling, 88-year-old Armenian-American author Shahen Guiragossian reminds the world that it's never too late to tell your story. His debut memoir, The Hawk, soars with themes of survival, heritage, and hope — proving that lived experience itself can be the most powerful form of legacy.  Born to survivors of the Armenian Genocide, Guiragossian grew up surrounded by silence and unspoken grief. The Hawk traces his journey from the shadow of inherited trauma to a life built on loyalty, love, and perseverance. It's both an immigrant's story and a universal reflection on family, identity, and the human spirit's capacity to heal.  "Resilience runs in our blood. My parents had it, I had it, and I hope others see that they have it too," said Guiragossian.  Part refugee memoir, part testament to the strength of brotherhood and chosen family, The Hawk captures a lifetime of endurance — from rebuilding after loss to finding meaning in later life. Written in his eighth decade, the memoir is a reminder that stories of survival don't fade with age; they deepen.  A true reflection of his heart, Guiragossian donates proceeds from the book to the Armenian Relief Society and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, honoring both his family's heritage and the memory of his nephew lost in the September 11 tragedy.  The Hawk is available now on Amazon in paperback, hardcover, and eBook formats.  For interviews, review copies, or speaking inquiries, please contact thehawkmemoir@gmail.com.  About the Author Shahen Guiragossian is an Armenian-American author and storyteller based in Coconut Creek, Florida. A lifelong dreamer and entrepreneur, he channels his reflections on struggle, success, and survival into The Hawk — a story meant to inspire and endure. When he isn't writing, he spends time with music and reflection — the two companions that have carried him through every chapter of life.  Website: https://www.thehawkmemoir.com
