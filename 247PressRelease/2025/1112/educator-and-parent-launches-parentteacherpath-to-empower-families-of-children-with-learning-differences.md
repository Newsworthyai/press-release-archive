PARK RIDGE, NJ, November 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Veteran educator and devoted parent Ken Soussa has launched ParentTeacherPath, a growing online movement dedicated to supporting families of children with special needs and learning differences.

His stories are personal yet universal, offering encouragement, strategies, and hope to those navigating IEP meetings, school transitions, and emotional hurdles.

The ParentTeacherPath blog features authentic stories, parent guides, and printable resources. The YouTube channel brings those stories to life through short, heartfelt videos told from multiple perspectives—parent, teacher, and child—creating an emotional bridge that invites understanding and community connection.
