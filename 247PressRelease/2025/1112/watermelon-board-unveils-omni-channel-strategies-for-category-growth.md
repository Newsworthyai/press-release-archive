# Watermelon Board Unveils Omni-Channel Strategies for Category Growth

WINTER SPRINGS, FL, November 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The National Watermelon Promotion Board (NWPB) has released its latest research, Omnichannel Strategies for Watermelon Category Growth, revealing that the category has added 7 million new purchasing households since 2021, with watermelon now in 75% of all U.S. households. These new buyers helped generate $782 million in incremental purchases, pushing total category purchases to $3.2 billion — a 33% increase over the period. The research findings provide marketers with actionable insights into these watermelon trends, highlighting how channel dynamics, purchase behaviors, and evolving shopper demographics are reshaping the category.  "Industry partners now have a clear roadmap for growing watermelon sales across retail channels," said Mark Arney, Executive Director for the NWPB. "By tailoring strategies to the unique opportunities present in each channel and among evolving shopper demographics, retailers can strengthen loyalty, broaden penetration, and drive incremental trips and dollars."  Key Findings and Opportunities  • Refine Channel Strategies: Grocery remains the leading retail channel for watermelon, but Mass, Club, and Online channels are seeing new shoppers and are growing at faster rates. The industry can strengthen omni-channel engagement by adapting marketing and merchandising strategies across these formats.  • Leverage Club Channel Momentum: Club has become an increasingly important outlet for the watermelon category. Merchandising tactics that boost volume per trip represent a key opportunity for the channel.  • Engage Evolving Household Demographics: Watermelon growth is strong among smaller, higher-income, younger and more diverse households, while engagement among older households is also rising. Marketers and retailers can balance efforts between loyal Heavy shoppers and these emerging segments.  To help industry stakeholders capitalize on these opportunities, the NWPB has released a companion Marketing Guide designed to help translate channel and demographic trends into actionable steps that support category growth.  "As shopper habits continue to evolve across retail formats, understanding where and how consumers buy watermelon helps the industry make smarter decisions about marketing, merchandising, and promotions," added Arney.   This study builds on NWPB's initiative to invest in research that helps the industry grow the watermelon category, including the Watermelon Attitudes and Usage and Watermelon Shopper Segmentation studies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolving watermelon shopper landscape.
