# New DHS Policy Ends Automatic Work Permit Extensions Nationwide

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On October 30, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published an interim final rule (IFR) that will end the practice of automatically extending work authorization for certain employment-authorization document (EAD) renewal applicants.   Under previous rules, many foreign nationals whose EAD renewal application (Form I-765) was timely filed were eligible for an automatic extension of their existing EAD validity (often up to 540 days) while the renewal was pending.   Renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025, are not eligible for the automatic extension benefit for most of the affected EAD categories. Filing early is more important than ever. USCIS recommends filing up to 180 days before the expiration of the current EAD. But even with early filing, delays may still lead to a gap in work authorization. Working after your EAD expires and before the renewal is approved (for applications filed on or after October 30) may jeopardize your immigration status and future benefits.  According to DHS and USCIS, ending the automatic-extension practice allows for more rigorous screening, background checks, and vetting of applicants before continuing their employment authorization. The rule is framed as a national security and public safety measure.   The end of the automatic extension of EAD renewals marks a significant shift in U.S. immigration-authorization policy. While many relied on that safety net for years, the new rule places greater emphasis on advance planning, timely filing, and understanding the risks of work-authorization interruption. Employers and individuals alike will need to be more proactive than ever to ensure continuity of employment authorization.   Immigration attorneys can help individuals and businesses adapt to this change by providing filing strategies, monitoring renewal timelines, or updating employer verification practices.
