# Shincheonji Church Hosts 3rd Special Lecture on Revelation Open to All Nations

NEW YORK, NY, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, recently hosted its 3rd Special Lecture on Revelation Open to All Nations.  Starting on October 30, participants enjoyed three nights and four days of praise, prayer and discussion centered around the prophecies and fulfillment recorded in the Bible's Book of Revelation. The event, which took place in Cheongju, South Korea, was held under the theme, "The Path of Understanding Led by the Bible, the Path of Peace Walked Together by Religions."   The Special Lecture on Revelation Open to All Nations is an international exchange program seeking interfaith dialogue and peace. Since the first special lecture was held, the gathering has grown with each session to become a global platform for interreligious dialogue.   The first special lecture held in February 2024 brought together about 80 leaders from 10 religious denominations across 28 countries. The second special lecture, held later that year, included about 270 religious leaders representing 57 countries.  The 3rd Special Lecture on Revelation Open to All Nations was the largest event to date with over 1,000 total attendees, including 440 religious leaders from 59 countries.  Participants collectively expressed that the "truth" they learned through Shincheonji Church of Jesus carries great power.  "I think the reason Shincheonji is reviving and developing further is the 'power of the Word,'" said Venerable Yulyeoseongwon, head of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. "It was a time to confirm that this Word is the path to unity for humanity, transcending religious barriers."  Leaders from other religions also spoke highly of the seminar.  "Shincheonji Church's curriculum that conveys peace and truth is perfect," said Mohammed Usman, an Islamic leader from Eswatini, emphasizing the importance of achieving the peace that all humanity hopes for.   A total of 317 religious leaders participated in an exam on the Book of Revelation, with 154 achieving perfect scores. Furthermore, 125 participants — 42 from Korea and 83 from abroad — who successfully completed seven weeks of lectures and examinations were appointed as honorary Bible instructors.
