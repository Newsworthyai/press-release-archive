# Recycled Brain Part Two Opens Global Pre-Orders: Dr. Sci-Fi Storyteller Takahiro Yonemura Drops His 70th Title

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After debuting in global pre-order following the San Diego Comic-Con Spotlight, Recycled Brain Part Two now enters full release.  Engineer and author Takahiro Yonemura, Ph.D. celebrates a creative milestone with a seventieth published title, continuing a career that links science, art, and emotion through storytelling.  A Growing Universe of Ideas  The Recycled Brain saga began as a reflection on memory and technology, evolving into a dialogue between Japan and the United States.  Part Two expands the philosophical core of the series while deepening its visual storytelling through collaboration with Japanese manga artists.  Its release also coincides with new creative projects in Japan, underscoring Yonemura's belief that science and imagination can move forward together.  Between Logic and Feeling  "Every story I write is a dialogue between the human heart and the logic that steers it," Yonemura says, grinning. "I'm crazy about AI and tinker with it every day, but when it comes to my art I stay delightfully old-school. Honestly, if AI ever beats me at storytelling I'd probably pass out, so I'm hanging on to my title a little longer—letting the machines nap while I borrow their sparks of inspiration."  This humor and respect capture the essence of Recycled Brain: a human dialogue with the technologies shaping tomorrow.  Continuing a Global Journey  Yonemura's earlier English-language release, Beast Code (2022), marked a first U.S. publication.  Though unrelated in story, both titles share a science-driven sense of wonder and emotional depth.  The first Recycled Brain volume also received positive coverage from U.S. Review of Books, which noted its balance of technology and humanity.  Together, these works trace a growing body of science-inspired fiction that connects readers across cultures.
