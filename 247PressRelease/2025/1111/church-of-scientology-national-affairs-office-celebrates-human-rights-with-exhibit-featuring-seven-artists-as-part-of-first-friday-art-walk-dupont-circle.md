# Church of Scientology National Affairs Office Celebrates Human Rights with Exhibit Featuring Seven Artists as part of First Friday: Art Walk Dupont Circle

WASHINGTON, DC, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- More than 100 people attended the November art exhibit co-hosted by the Church of Scientology National Affairs Office, Youth for Human Rights International's Washington, DC chapter, and Art Impact International. The "United for Human Rights" pop-up exhibit, held at the historic Fraser Mansion in Dupont Circle, was part of the monthly First Friday: Art Walk Dupont Circle, and showcased powerful artistic expressions celebrating human rights.  The exhibit featured seven distinguished artists, who showed portraits of famous human rights activists, landscapes, abstracts, layered artwork, batik art, and wax on glass.  The artists -- Carolyn Goodridge, E. J. Lee, P.J.P. Martin, Sharon Robinson, Patrick Smith, and J. Thomas Wells – were on site and discussed their work and the human rights themes that inspired them. Artwork from Hubert Jackson was displayed and discussed by Carolyn Goodridge.  Mr. Azhar Haq, Executive Director of Youth for Human Rights International's DC chapter, emphasized the significance of art in human rights advocacy, stating, "Art speaks where words can't fully communicate the same concepts. As we enter the holiday season, peace is even more meaningful. Art brings people of all different beliefs and cultures together to appreciate something beautiful."  In addition to the artwork, free educational materials on the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights were available to attendees, courtesy of Youth for Human Rights International, whose mission is to promote human rights awareness and advocacy through creative expression.   These materials on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights are also available free at www.youthforhumanrights.org. More information is available at https://www.facebook.com/YHRDC.
