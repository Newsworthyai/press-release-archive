# Rylee Anne Laman Wins 2025 Animal Rescue Scholarship From Texas Law Dog

ARLINGTON, TX, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Animal Rescue Scholarship made available by The Texas Law Dog strives to celebrate a young person who has learned invaluable lessons while caring for animals in need. This year, the scholarship's $2,500 goes to Rylee Anne Laman, a student at Southern Nazarene University, pursuing a multidisciplinary major in Pre-Athletic Training and Sports Business.  Laman's scholarship essay is a moving collection of stories about her family's commitment to bettering the lives of dogs. Laman speaks about her family's efforts to help foster dogs in need of extra support, as well as their "foster fails," or times when they adopted dogs in need.  Laman specifically notes that while her family offered homes to dogs of all sorts, they developed a particular fondness for pugs. Three pugs in particular had a direct impact on Laman's perspective on animal advocacy.   "Each dog I've cared for has not only needed a home but has also helped me grow in empathy and patience," she says. "This journey has shaped me in so many meaningful ways."  Laman's deep love for the pugs and other dogs in her life is a testament to the positive impact that animals can have on the lives of the people who care for them. The scholarship selection committee with The Texas Law Dog wants to reward that self-recognition, as well as Laman's effort to provide support to animals in need.  Laman intends to continue offering dogs in need a place in her life as she graduates and pursues her career. She hopes to pursue a master's degree in Athletic Training and wants to use her education to help aspiring athletes meet and exceed their goals.  The personal injury lawyers with The Texas Law Dog are proud to offer Laman the 2025 Animal Rescue Scholarship. The team hopes that the financial support will make it easier for Laman to pursue her academic goals while continuing to advocate for the four-legged friends who've made such a positive impact on her life.
