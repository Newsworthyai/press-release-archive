WEATHERFORD, TX, November 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ms. Gina Fong is pleased to announce the opening of the Haneul Spa located in the Salon & Spa Galleria at 801 Interstate 20, Frontage Road, in Weatherford, Texas 76087. "At Haneul Spa, we embrace the vibrant culture and beauty standards of K-Beauty. From refreshing facials to rejuvenating body facials, we focus on enhancing your natural beauty while providing an immersive K-Beauty experience."  Gina Fong's love for K-Beauty started when she embarked on a personal quest for healthier and more beautiful skin herself. "I was fascinated by the Korean philosophy of skincare: that it's not just a routine, but a form of self-care and wellness. It's about nurturing your skin with effective ingredients and taking a mindful moment for yourself." One of the reasons she chose to lease a suite at the Salon and Spa Galleria is that she wanted "to create a space where others could experience that same transformation and peace."  Gina attended the Nu Beauty School in Plano where she learned advanced techniques in the field of Esthetics and gained hundreds of hours of hands-on experience. Her unique combination of knowledge and experience enables her to tailor treatments to each individual client.  The Haneul Spa can be found in Suite #514 of the Salon and Spa Galleria at 801 Interstate 20, Frontage Road, in Weatherford. Appointments can be made on-line via the spa's website (haneulspa.com/book-online) or by calling/texting at (817) 296-8274.  A variety of facial packages are listed on the website including the "Flash Glow Express," the "Deluxe K-beauty," and the "Glass Skincare Signature" facial. Other packages focus specifically on Pore Refining and Calming, Collagen Firming, K-Glow Gentle Teen Treatment, and a "Refresh and Rebalance" facial for men. The "Glow Back Care" package is a rejuvenating facial-style treatment for your back which includes thorough cleansing, exfoliating and nourishing to restore your skin's natural glow and promote a radiant and more youthful appearance. Treatments can also be customized to address specific issues like acne-prone skin, inadequate hydration, signs of aging, and more.  According to its website, "Haneul Spa is your ultimate destination for relaxation and beauty, where every treatment is tailored just for you." By choosing to lease a private suite at the Weatherford Salon & Spa Galleria, spa owner Gina Fong has joined a group of professional business owners who are each able to offer personalized beauty and wellness services in their own luxurious suite.
