# Tarrant Events Center Among Best Fort Worth Birthday Party Rental Venues

HALTOM CITY, TX, January 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tarrant Events Center is tops among affordable rental venues for those wanting to celebrate birthdays. "Choosing the right one from among local birthday venues is crucial to honor this important milestone and ensure an experience that will be remembered for years to come," said Marketing Manager Jennifer Knittel.  And because of how pet-friendly this venue is parties may also be held there to celebrate the birthdays of canine and feline companions, according to Knittel.  The Tarrant Events Center (TEC), which opened about two years ago, is one of Tarrant County's newest social events venues and very popular among local birthday party places.  TEC offers modern amenities in a pristine indoor environment, plus over an acre of park-like grounds. It has enough space to accommodate large affairs with up to 300 guests. Or less space may be rented for small gatherings of family and friends, Knittel said.  TEC's all-inclusive pricing ensures there won't be any surprises regarding the cost of using the facility. The all-inclusive pricing means that the rental covers the use of all indoor and outdoor spaces with customizable staging and floor plan set-ups, state-of the art audio/visual equipment with 10 huge LED TVs, and much more.  The 10 LED TVs can be used to broadcast videos and/or photographs relating to birthday parties, weddings, receptions, reunions, and numerous other events according to Knittel.  "Our prices include many of the extras that other budget social events venues charge separately for, such as tables, chairs, cake table, dance floor and sound equipment and use of our onsite warming and finishing kitchen," Knittel said.  A luxurious and private VIP room can be used to make preparations prior to an event. Also, a second private room can be set up as you choose, perhaps as a quiet space for young children or other guests who might need a break from the festivities, according to Knittel.
