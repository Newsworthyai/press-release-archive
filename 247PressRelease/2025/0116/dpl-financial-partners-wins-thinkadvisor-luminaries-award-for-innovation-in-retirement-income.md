# DPL Financial Partners wins ThinkAdvisor Luminaries award for innovation in retirement income

LOUISVILLE, KY, January 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DPL Financial Partners, the leading platform for commission-free annuities, today announced its selection as a ThinkAdvisor Luminaries award winner. The firm was honored in the Retirement Income Firm Award â€“ Innovation category for its work to modernize annuities and provide advisors and their clients with access to a wide range of no-load guaranteed retirement income solutions and enabling technology.  The Luminaries Award program, now in its fourth year, celebrates the trailblazers redefining excellence in financial services. DPL was recognized as a driving force opening the annuity market to RIAs and their clients, many of whom want and need the benefits annuities provide to strengthen their financial plans for retirement.  "Annuities are foundational retirement planning products providing secure income and asset protection," said DPL Founder and CEO David Lau. "For too long the commissioned structure, pricing, and lack of integrated technology has made annuity solutions inaccessible to too many advisors. Through our product innovation, disruptive tools and technology, we enable advisors to normalize annuity solutions as key components of clients' financial plans."  DPL's nomination emphasized its broad efforts to shift the narrative on fiduciary advisors' use of annuities, as well as the impact of its dedicated program for helping advisors transition client annuity assets when they move to a fee-based advisory model:  "Through extensive educational initiatives, proprietary programs and technology for advisors, and efforts to educate the financial media about annuities, DPL has pushed the industry to recognize the importance of modern annuity products for the many benefits they bring to a firm and its clients. Through its Breakaway Accelerator Program, designed to transition annuity books to an advisory model, and integrations with leading wealth management platforms, DPL's reach extends across the advice industry, making annuities accessible and powerful tools for RIAs, whether fee-only, hybrid, or in transition to independence."  This is the second time the Luminaries have recognized DPL for its work to enable advisors and their clients to meet their long-term retirement income needs through low-cost, commission-free annuities. Lau was honored for executive leadership in 2021. The full list of winners can be found here.
