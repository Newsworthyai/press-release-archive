# Agustín Barenas: The Argentinian Accountant Revolutionizing Foreign Investment in the United States

MIAMI, FL, January 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Agustín Barenas, a certified public accountant and entrepreneur from Argentina, exemplifies the positive impact foreign professionals can have in the United States. Leveraging his personal and professional expertise, Barenas has designed a project aimed at driving the nation's economic growth by attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), enhancing business competitiveness, and strengthening tax education.  With over 25 years of experience and a clear focus on risk management and tax optimization, Barenas leads initiatives that have created significant economic impact, totaling over $60 million, particularly in sectors like real estate, gastronomy, and technology. His project also prioritizes advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to create more efficient and secure tax structures.  Building Bridges Between Foreign Investment and Local Development Barenas' project facilitates the entry of foreign capital into key markets while supporting U.S. companies in their international expansion. By ensuring proper tax structuring and regulatory compliance, it promotes financial stability and mitigates risks such as tax fraud.   The benefits extend beyond investors. This model increases job creation, strengthening the economic and labor fabric of the communities it serves. According to Barenas, "A company with proper tax structuring not only grows but also drives workforce hiring, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits everyone."  A Cross-Border Impact In less than four years, Ivanko Global, under Barenas' leadership, has supported the creation of more than 300 companies in the United States. This success highlights the effectiveness of his model and his commitment to the country's economic growth. "We are dedicated to educating our clients on the importance of tax management and how proper planning can transform not just businesses but entire communities," says Barenas.  A Partner in U.S. Economic Growth Barenas' project aligns with initiatives like "Invest in America," which aims to boost private investment and job creation nationwide. His approach enhances the competitiveness of U.S. businesses in the global market while supporting the integrity of the economic system.  With a clear vision and a commitment to progress, Agustín Barenas demonstrates that economic growth and social impact can go hand in hand, solidifying his role as a key ally compromised with the economic development of the United States.  My proposal is to provide specialized tax advice on investment structuring and risk management services to foreign companies, focusing on critical sectors such as real estate, trade and technology, to facilitate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the United States, strengthen the American economy and address gaps in the management of foreign investments.
