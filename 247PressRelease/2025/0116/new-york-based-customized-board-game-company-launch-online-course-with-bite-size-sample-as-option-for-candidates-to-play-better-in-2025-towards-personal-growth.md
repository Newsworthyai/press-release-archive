# New York Based Customized Board Game Company Launch Online Course with Bite-Size Sample as Option for Candidates to "Play Better" in 2025 Towards Personal Growth

NEW YORK, NY, January 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Many people are stuck in the mindset of what to do to make things different in 2025. We figured that a little self-competition can be the best new strategy. Trying to outscore and outpace who you were yesterday is a good place to start. This is the idea and concept behind, Gamify Your Goals to Win, online course - winning the daily rematch against yesterday's you - are strategic ways to crush your old scores.  The course is based on the V.I.C.T.O.R.Y. Methodology, a systematic learning tool created by Board Game Designer and Founder at Gamifyze, Inc. We believe this course is the first of its kind—an immersive game-like experience that delivers a psychological punch, challenging participants' decision-making, resilience, and strategic thinking while fostering real-world growth.  Another example of our innovative approach is the bite-sized sample of the course that's available. Rather than committing to the entire course at once, you can enjoy it in easy-to-digest bits. No need to jump in headfirst—just dip your toes in!  Gamifyze, Inc. continues to build customized board games for companies who rather have their story, training and brand message played, not just told.
