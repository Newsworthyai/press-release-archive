PINEHURST, NC, June 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Active Defender, an industry leader in school safety solutions and emergency communications, will showcase the platform's newest security tool on June 16 at Sandhills Classical Christian School in Pinehurst for their School Leadership Safety Summit. The host school will become the first in the region to integrate Active Defender's wearable panic buttons with instant connections to emergency response systems, developed by local startup founder Jim Boyte, a retired Department of Defense software engineer.

The event will feature a live demonstration of the system in action, with interviews available from the founder, teachers, and school administrators.  "Every second counts in a school emergency," said Boyte Active Defender Founder and CEO. "We built Active Defender to give those seconds back to teachers â€” the people standing between danger and our kids. This technology was born in North Carolina, and we're proud to see it start here in Moore County."  Active Defender was recently awarded an NC IDEA SEED Grant, recognizing its innovative approach to school safety and potential to scale across the state. The platform is currently in use in multiple North and South Carolina schools and is expanding across the Southeast.
