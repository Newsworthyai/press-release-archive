# Footage Foundation and El-Agartuu Host Webinar on Storytelling, Compassion, and Prevention of Violence Against Women

BISHKEK, KYRGYZ REPUBLIC, June 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Footage Foundation and El Argatuu will host a webinar to discuss needs assessment research findings and Footage's innovative methods, on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM Bishkek time. This is the first of three events in their collaborative program. The event, a live webinar titled "Using Innovative Methods in the Prevention of Violence Against Women," will showcase the power of storytelling, compassion, and participatory methods in violence prevention and offer insights into how voice-centered, trauma-informed approaches can foster trust, shift harmful norms, and strengthen support systems.  The webinar follows completion of the program's first phase—a comprehensive needs assessment conducted between December 2024 and January 2025.   Through in-depth engagement with 108 participants, including government employees, NGO staff, and survivors of violence, the research provides a critical evidence base for designing effective, context-specific interventions.  One of the key findings revealed that 73% of victims of violence suffer with poor mental health and seek counselling. Needs identified include training and capacity building for government staff, more formal and better supported collaboration across NGO networks, awareness of cultural barriers that cause fear and mistrust, improved co-ordination across institutions and services and, better support for survivors for safe housing and income generation.   Footage Foundation and El-Agartuu will share key findings from the assessment during the webinar, highlighting gaps, successes, and actionable solutions. Together, they aim to build momentum toward addressing the social and economic impact of violence against women through compassionate and evidence-driven strategies.  "In our Kyrgyzstan assessments, many stakeholders highlighted the need for stronger training, clearer information pathways, and deeper collaboration. Survivors emphasized the importance of knowing their rights and accessing safe, supportive services. These insights point to an opportunity: when we invest in awareness, build professional capacity, and create spaces of trust and connection, we begin to shift the conditions that allow violence to take root," says Dr. Kristen Ali Eglinton, Co-founder and Executive Director of Footage Foundation who designed and led the research.   Nurzhan Tulegabylova of Kyrgyz El Agartuu Public Association says: "These findings point to the need for sustained community education and efforts to shift harmful norms. They are not isolated. They reflect larger patterns found across Central Asia and beyond. Prevention of violence against women is not an abstract goal—it is a shared and achievable commitment voiced by survivors, NGOs, and government partners alike."   "This first phase of the program is a positive step forward towards enhancing skills and strengthening our commitment to driving change. We welcome those interested in helping to shape solutions to join the discussion," she adds.
