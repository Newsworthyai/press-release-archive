FORT WORTH, TX, June 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A symbol of performance, luxury, and Z-car heritage has officially joined the ranks of the Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The 1980 Datsun 280ZX 10th Anniversary Edition, finished in the eye-catching Golden Mist and Thunder Black two-tone paint scheme, is a celebration of a decade of innovation and style.  One of only 3,000 special edition models produced, this particular 280ZX is #1731, as noted by the factory-mounted plaque ahead of the shifter. This limited-run model boasts commemorative decals on the fenders and hatch, black window trim, and a list of premium features that made it a standout in the Z-car lineup.  "This isn't just a 280ZX—it's a rolling tribute to a legacy," says museum founder Ron Sturgeon. "The 10th Anniversary Edition marked a turning point in Japanese sports car history, and this example is preserved with remarkable attention to detail."  Exterior features include a front spoiler, vented hood, removable T-top roof panels, headlight washers, rear window wiper, and heated rear glass. A polished single exhaust finisher, power steering, and four-wheel power-assisted disc brakes complete the sporty, functional package.  Inside, the 280ZX continues to impress with tan leather six-way manually adjustable bucket seats, color-coordinated door panels, and a contrasting brown dashboard and carpeting. Luxury touches include cruise control, automatic climate control, power windows, a Hitachi AM/FM cassette stereo, and Datsun-branded floor mats.  Under the hood, the fuel-injected 2.8L L28E inline-six delivers 135 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque through a five-speed manual transmission, staying true to the car's performance roots while offering smooth, responsive driving.  Factory instrumentation includes an 85-mph speedometer, tachometer, and center-stack gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, all framed by a two-spoke steering wheel that anchors the driver in the experience.
