# Award Winning Fashion Footwear Designer, Candy Marx, Launches Organic Lounge Wear

ATLANTA, GA, June 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Former high-end fashion footwear designer Candy Marx, known for her early success on the international fashion circuit and her values-led exit from the leather industry, has launched The Solar Shift — a limited drop of ethically-made 100% organic cotton loungewear (sweat sets) and handcrafted copperware designed for intentional living. BLOOM is Candy's line of sweat sets, in which she is releasing 4 limited editions per year - The Solar Shift being the first one.  Candy began her career in fashion as the designer behind KeilanaSkye, a luxury footwear label that debuted at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney, as well as in New York and Los Angeles. Her designs were featured on Australia's Next Top Model, and she won the Qantas Spirit of Youth People's Choice Award and Australia's leading competition for emerging designers.  In 2014, she made the bold decision to transition her label (renamed KSKYE) to become Australia's first established fashion brand to go fully cruelty-free — a move inspired by her personal shift toward veganism and ethical living.  Now based in Western Australia, Candy has spent the past decade immersed in holistic health, plant-based nutrition, spiritual wellness, and high-profile collaborations, while catering to the Australian, New Zealand, USA, and UK markets. The Solar Shift brings her design roots into harmony with her current path, offering simple yet powerful and intentional pieces to support holistic health and spiritual growth through imagery, words, numbers, and natural materials that enhance the energy field (aura) rather than dim it.  "This drop isn't about fashion — it's about energy," says Marx. "I wanted to create pieces that feel good, support our lifeforce, and carry intention. Clean fabrics, handcrafted copper, and symbols that assist alignment." The release features solar-inspired prints, embossed detailing, and sacred numerology (including 1 and 1111), woven subtly into the designs.  The Solar Shift limited release sweat sets are sourced from a renewable factory in the UK, using eco-dyes, and the copperware is handmade by Ayurvedic Artisans. It's available now for a four-week window at www.candymarx.com, while stocks last.
