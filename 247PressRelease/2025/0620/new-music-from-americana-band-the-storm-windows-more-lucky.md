# New Music from Americana Band The Storm Windows: "More Lucky"

BURLINGTON, VT, June 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- New York and Vermont-based Americana band The Storm Windows today release their new single and EP, both entitled "More Lucky".  About More Lucky   The new single and title track from the EP "More Lucky" takes an optimistic view of the current state of things, noting that in the face of it all, "you gotta roll." It's a rustic singer-songwriter anthem of hope and perseverance featuring the performing trio of brothers Rob Mathews (guitar and vocals) and Don Mathews (upright bass and vocals) Mathews and drummer Erik Anderson, accompanied by a horn arrangement from Dima Faustov and background vocals by SamSam.  The new EP "More Lucky" consists of six original songs performed across a broad range of musical influences, all in the Americana spirit - from the folk-tinged "More Lucky" and "I Made a List" to the summer jam vibes of "I'm Going to Memphis" and "We All Have Ghosts", closing with the topical rock inspired "I Ain't Finished Yet" and the uplifting send-off "Angel (That Heaven Must Of Sent Down)." The songs are summer anthems for 2025, conveying a message of hope tinged with a yearning for something better, and the promise of the road to try to find it.  Following the live EP release event on Saturday, June 21 at the popular Stone Corral Brewery in Richmond, Vermont, the trio will showcase the new EP at a performance on Saturday, June 28 at the historic Silver Bay Auditorium on Lake George, New York.

The band takes their name The Storm Windows from a song title of one of their musical heroes, John Prine, but also as an appropriate description of some veteran musicians who have weathered a few storms but are still standing and singing about it. Critics have labeled their music "New Americana â€“ a blend of folk, rock and even jazz laced sonics."
