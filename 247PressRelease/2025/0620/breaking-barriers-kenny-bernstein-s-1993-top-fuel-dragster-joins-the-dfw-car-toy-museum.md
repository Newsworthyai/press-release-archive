# Breaking Barriers: Kenny Bernstein's 1993 Top Fuel Dragster Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, June 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A legendary machine built for pure speed is now roaring into the spotlight at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The 1993 NHRA Top Fuel Dragster driven by the iconic Kenny Bernstein, nicknamed the "King of Speed," is now part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, preserving a pivotal chapter in American motorsport history.  Bernstein, a six-time NHRA champion, made headlines not only for his wins but for his groundbreaking milestones. In 1992, he became the first driver in NHRA history to exceed 300 mph in a standing-start quarter-mile, a feat achieved at the Gatornationals in Gainesville. He would go on to break his own records, reaching 314.46 mph in 1994 and 332.18 mph in 1996.  The dragster now on display is believed to have been completed in December 1993 and was NHRA-certified for the 1994 season. Dressed in its unforgettable Budweiser King livery, it embodies the era of innovation and fearlessness that defined Bernstein's career. As a pioneer who also won titles in both the Funny Car and Top Fuel categories—and as an owner in NASCAR and IndyCar—Bernstein remains the only racer to achieve victories in all three of the United States' top racing series.  "This car is more than a race machine—it's a rocket with wheels and a legacy," said museum founder Ron Sturgeon. "To have something from Kenny Bernstein's golden years is an honor and a thrill for every motorsport fan who visits."  See the dragster that shattered records and inspired generations.
