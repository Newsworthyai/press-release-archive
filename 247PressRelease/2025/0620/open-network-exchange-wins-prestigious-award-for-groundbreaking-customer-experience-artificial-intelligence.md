# Open Network Exchange Wins Prestigious Award for Groundbreaking Customer Experience Artificial Intelligence

SCOTTSDALE, AZ, June 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Open Network Exchange (ONE), a global leader in travel and loyalty solutions, has been honored with the 2025 NICE CX Excellence Award for its transformative use of AI-powered automation to revolutionize customer experience and payment processing. This award recognizes ONE's strategic deployment of NICE's CXone Mpower platform, which resulted in over 250% increase in agentless payment transactions and is projected to surpass $65 million in secure autonomous payments by the end of 2025.  To reduce costs and reliance on live agents for payment-related calls, ONE partnered with NICE to implement an advanced suite of tools including conversational IVR, natural language understanding (NLU), omnichannel routing, and real-time analytics. These innovations significantly reduced support call volume—by nearly 10% and cut live-agent opt-in rates from 60% to below 8%.  "Reducing payment-related call volume by 10% while doubling autonomous transactions has aided in our continuous business transformation," said Ryan Romero, Senior Vice President of Global Technology Strategy & Innovation at ONE. "With NICE, we're not just automating our services—we're redefining the customer experience."
