# The Dairy Alliance Launches First-in-the-Nation Portable Milk Dispenser in Tennessee

ATLANTA, GA, September 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, joined Kingsport City School District, Sullivan County, Tennessee, to celebrate a major dairy innovation in the school milk experience: the official ribbon cutting for the Udderly Cold Portable Milk Dispenser. Designed specifically for K–12 schools, this compact yet powerful system is transforming the way students enjoy milk at school.   This Portable Milk System keeps milk at a consistent 35 degrees, which enhances the flavor and encourages students to drink more milk. The new system holds up to 25 gallons of bulk milk bags. With its smart design, multiple bags can be connected for triple capacity, dispensing up to 400 perfectly portioned 8 oz servings before product rotation is needed. Students pour what they want and love drinking ice-cold real milk out of a cup! This dispenser is funded by an Endowment Grant from the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.   Local leaders shared remarks during the ribbon cutting ceremony at John Sevier Middle School, celebrating the launch of the portable milk dispenser while students enjoyed fresh servings of real dairy milk. The event highlighted the excitement and curiosity of students as they explored the new dispenser, asked questions about dairy nutrition, and engaged with school and community leaders.   "Milk dispensers in schools are a win for students and farmers alike," said Charlie Hatcher, D.V.M., 10th-generation Tennessee dairy farmer and Commissioner of Agriculture. "Dispensers keep milk fresh and high-quality, reduce waste, and help schools serve the best possible milk to students every day. As farmers, we take pride in knowing our milk reaches students directly and at its highest quality   "This program marks an important step forward in supporting student health and sustainable nutrition," said Farrah Newberry, CEO of The Dairy Alliance. "By providing an innovative way of delivering dairy milk directly to students, we help schools incorporate nutritious dairy into daily meals and encourage them to build lifelong healthy habits. Initiatives like the Udderly Cold Mobile Milk Dispenser demonstrate how partnerships between schools, local leaders, and dairy farmers can spark meaningful change in student wellness."   "Milk is the number one source of calcium in the diets of children and teens, and that matters—especially for teenage girls. I worry they're not drinking enough milk during the years when their bones need it most," said Jennifer Walker, RD, Kingsport City School Nutrition Director, Tennessee. "That's why we placed the new milk dispensers in schools—to encourage all students to enjoy milk with their reimbursable meal. I want every child to have access to good nutrition, and that includes the health benefits of milk in every cup."   "Kingsport City Schools is incredibly grateful to The Dairy Alliance, Udderly Cold, and everyone who played a part in bringing this innovative milk delivery system to KCS. Innovation is always exciting, but it's especially so when it directly impacts the health and wellbeing of our students in such a positive and meaningful way," said Dr. R. Andrew True, Assistant Superintendent – Administration, Kingsport City School District, TN.   The ribbon cutting drew attendees from the Kingsport community and highlighted the broader impact of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture Endowment Grant. Hardin County Schools in Savannah, TN has also implemented an Udderly Cold milk dispenser at Northside Elementary School. This innovative approach to serving milk continues to maximize access to and consumption of milk for students across the state.   By bringing real dairy milk directly to students, The Dairy Alliance enhances access to healthy beverages, encourages balanced nutrition, and supports overall wellness, demonstrating how innovative programs can make a tangible difference in school communities.
