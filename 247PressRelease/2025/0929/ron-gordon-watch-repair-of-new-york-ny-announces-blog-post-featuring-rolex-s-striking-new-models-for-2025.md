# Ron Gordon Watch Repair of New York, NY Announces Blog Post Featuring Rolex's Striking New Models for 2025

NEW YORK, NY, September 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ron Gordon Watch Repair, a top-rated luxury watch repair shop in New York, NY, is proud to announce a new, informative blog post on Rolex's 2025 most interesting releases. The new content presents a watchmaker's perspective on three perennial standouts—the Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona, the Oyster Perpetual GMT-Master II, and the Sky-Dweller—and why these models are bold yet timeless.  "Rolex is one of my favorite brands, not just to service or repair, but to keep abreast of their innovations," explained Ron Gordon, proprietor of Ron Gordon Watch Repair. "Our readers can use this quick update to identify three of the funnest models for 2025, and those with watch issues are encouraged to visit the shop for an estimate and potential repair."  Here is background on this release. The new content can be found at https://www.rongordonwatches.com/2025/09/2025-new-models/ and information on Rolex repair in New York, NY, can be found at https://www.rongordonwatches.com/rolex-repair/. Founded in 1905 in London, Rolex (https://www.rolex.com/) relocated its headquarters to Geneva. The company is recognized worldwide as one of the first to receive chronometric certification for a wristwatch. That relentless quest for exactitude remains today, and it is on full display with the new 2025 Cosmograph Daytona equipped with a case in 18 kt yellow gold and a turquoise-blue lacquer dial. It is an attractive combination of contemporary color and traditional Rolex technology. The look is completed with a black Cerachrom bezel and an Oysterflex bracelet featuring an Oysterlock safety clasp.A view of an authorized Rolex repair shop in New York, NY.  In the same post, Ron delves into the GMT-Master II featuring a natural stone dial constructed from tiger iron — an unusual mix of tiger's eye, red jasper and hematite. "It is one dial at a time," Ron said. "All that natural variation gives it a depth and warmth you just don't find in more mass-produced design." Created in the 1950s for international pilots, the GMT-Master II is renowned for its ability to display two different time zones simultaneously, making it a favorite among both professional aviators and frequent travelers. The 2025 model, crafted from 18kt Everose gold with a two-tone ceramic bezel, is tailor-made for world travel (or simply navigating life in a city as vibrant as New York). New York City is widely recognized as one of the most linguistically diverse cities in the world, with hundreds of languages spoken — a strong reminder that time is kept here like almost nowhere else.  The Sky-Dweller didn't get a publicly highlighted aesthetic makeover for 2025, but as Ron points out, "it remains one of Rolex's most equipped watches for business traveling individuals and executives." The Sky-Dweller, with its 42mm case, signature fluted bezel and the Caliber 9002 driving its dual time zone and annual calendar displays, is a watch designed to do double duty. The fluted bezel, originally designed to screw down and enhance water resistance, is today one of the most recognizable design features in watches. "There's history in every little thing," Ron said. Similarly, New York City strikes that same innovation-tradition balance itself—its own subway system being the oldest in the U.S. (it debuted in 1904) and still updating every day.  Ron also stresses the solid technical side of these watches. The Daytona is powered by the new Caliber 4131, with an estimated 72-hour power reserve and beautifully finished movement bridges. The GMT-Master II is housed with Caliber 3285, while the Sky-Dweller boasts of Caliber 9002—both in-house made by Rolex from the ground-up. Ever since Rolex introduced the world's first waterproof wristwatch in 1926 (the Oyster), it has been a brand associated with performance and dependability. "When I disassemble a Rolex, there's attention to detail in every part," Ron said. "They're built to last — and to be repairable when they don't."
