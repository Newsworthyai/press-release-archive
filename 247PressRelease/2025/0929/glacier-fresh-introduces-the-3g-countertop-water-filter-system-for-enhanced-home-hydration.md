"The 3G Countertop Water Filter System is engineered to meet that demand by combining advanced filtration technology with a practical, install-anywhere design".  Key performance and design attributes of Glacier Fresh 3G countertop water filter include:  Elarisey™ filtration technology Water is filtered through a positively charged nanofiber membrane, removing most of the lead, permanent chemicals, microplastics, and over 50 other pollutants. And gravity-fed flow requires no electricity or plumbing connection.  Ample capacity and water flow The unit holds approximately 3 gallons total (with roughly 0.8 gallons of filtered water available and the remainder reserved in the upper chamber), and a filter flow rate of approximately 3 gallons per hour.  Smart filter life monitor Typical cartridge service life is listed at approximately 200 gallons or three months, whichever occurs first; a visual indicator on the lid is provided to help users track remaining life.
