# New Communities Utilize Digital Fine Art to Inspire Hindus, Muslims

MUMBAI, INDIA, April 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Two new online communities, one made up of Muslims and the other one of Hindus, have been formed, coalescing around newly created digital images devoted to every Surah in the Koran, and every chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. According to co-founder Yasmin Mustafa, "Fine art can be a magical doorway to spiritual truth. AI, rather than obstructing religious growth, can be an impressive asset that encourages believers. That's why we created Islamwisdomnetwork.org and Vedantawisdomnetwork.org."  How it works: believers apply to join the communities, which will be hosted on Whop.com. After acceptance, they are invited to choose their favorite verse and write a sentence or tell a story about how it touched them.   If a member's contribution is judged likely to inspire others, their words, their name, and a unique work of original art keyed to the particular surah or verse and created for the occasion by either human artists or AI (like the ones accompanying this article) appear in the communities' social media, and in the group's academia.edu site.  "We put their testimonials in all these places," says Education Director Ross Tomkins, "because we know that years from now some believer, perhaps someone going through a difficult time, will happen upon that witnessing and be inspired by it."  The Whop communities will allow members to join or start discussion groups based on favorite verses, share spiritual insights, and post on the forum. Starting in July, if a member's forum contribution receives at least 10 comments, they will be invited to co-host a regular Zoom session to discuss their favorite passage.  According to Member Services Director Savithri Machiraju, "Each verse of these holy books can be seen as an ambassador of sorts, a kind of key the Almighty uses to unlock spiritual insights in us. We just want to open up that process, make it available to believers, and recognize them for their inspiration."  vedantawisdomnetwork.org islamwisdomnetwork.org  Media inquiries: bobstimson@gmail.com General questions: fixxer@prodigy.net
