# From Memory to Motion: "Richard Runyon's Storybook" Makes Its Long-Awaited Premiere

SEATTLE, WA, April 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acclaimed storyteller Richard Runyon debuts Richard Runyon's Storybook, a powerful new web series that brings his most vivid personal stories to life through immersive visuals and gripping narration. The premiere episode dives into Runyon's childhood journey between Germany and the U.S., a wildly controversial show-and-tell incident, and the fights, mishaps, and lessons that defined his early years.  "This series is deeply personal," says Runyon. "It captures the people, places, and moments that shaped me—and the visual format brings those stories into sharper focus than ever before."  Each episode is also paired with an original song from Richard Runyon's Musicbook, a companion album that adds emotional weight and texture to the storytelling. The music is crafted by a team of top-tier producers and collaborators, with every track tailored to the themes of the corresponding episode.  "This project has been a long time coming," adds S.W. Miliano, series producer and Managing Director/Co-Founder of The Stone Register, a leading New York-based media and marketing firm. "The first episode took time to get right—but now that we've locked the tone and direction, the rest of the series will follow quickly. Storybook also complements Richard's long-form interview series, A Story to Tell, expanding his creative universe."  The premiere episode, titled Growing Pains, sets the tone for what's to come—raw, personal, and unapologetically real. It's streaming now and marks the official start of Richard Runyon's most ambitious storytelling journey to date.  Watch and follow the journey at:  www.RRStorybook.com  www.RichardRunyon.com
