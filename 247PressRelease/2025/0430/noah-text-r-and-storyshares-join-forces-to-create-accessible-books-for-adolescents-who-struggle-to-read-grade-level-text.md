# Noah Text® and Storyshares Join Forces to Create Accessible Books for Adolescents Who Struggle to Read Grade-Level Text

OLD MYSTIC, CT, April 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Storyshares – a mission-driven publisher dedicated to bringing the transformational power of books to underserved striving readers – and Noah Text® the inventor of a patented method of displaying text that makes it easier to decode, have joined forces to offer a selection of Storyshares books with the text displayed in Noah Text®.   Working together with a global community of authors, Storyshares generates an ever-growing culturally inclusive library of books that are diverse and relatable and provide accessible language for all ages and grade levels. By providing compelling choices for every reader, Storyshares opens pathways for students beyond grade 3 to improve their literacy skills — and become lifelong readers.  Based on the science of reading and recommended by structured literacy specialists, Noah Text® is an evidence-based word-level scaffold that shows readers the structure of words. It is highly effective for striving readers, those with dyslexia, and multilingual learners. Noah Text® helps readers access and learn complex words, many of them multisyllabic, while also giving them the opportunity to engage in deep wide reading.   Under the two companies' partnership, Noah Text® has converted the text of 36 Storyshares books to its patented method of displaying text. The company is distributing the books through its retail bookstore at https://noahtextbookstore.company.site/, Ingram's wholesaler distribution network, and independent sales reps selling directly to K12 school districts. The Storyshares + Noah Text® paperback bundle can also be purchased directly from Storyshares at https://shop.storyshares.org/products/storyshares-noah-text.  Noah Text® also offers free tools for converting plain text to Noah Text® to teachers and students, including a Chrome extension that seamlessly converts web pages to Noah Text®. The company has developed specialized software in partnership with New Century Education Foundation and Michigan State University that is helping improve literacy in secondary schools and prisons. Notably, for dyslexic readers, Noah Text® can be included as a modification on IEPs or an accommodation in 504 plans. Noah Text® also provides API integration for businesses that want to expand their accessibility offerings to their customers and/or employees.   For further information, please contact the CEO and founder of Noah Text, Sarah K. Blodgett, at sblodgett@noahtext.com, or visit the companies' websites at www.storyshares.org and www.noahtext.com.  About Storyshares Storyshares is a literacy intervention company and educational publisher focused on empowering striving readers beyond the 3rd grade, by creating new shelves in the library specifically for them. With a mission to provide relevant, diverse, and accessible content for all readers, Storyshares offers a growing collection of hundreds of decodable and high-low titles at every intersection of skill and interest level, paired with surrounding resources and support for educators.  About Noah Text, LLC Noah Text, LLC, was established in 2016 when it released its patented methodology under the registered trademark Noah Text®. Grounded in the science of reading, Noah Text® is an evidence-based, scaffolded text that shows readers the structure of words, enabling them to read independently and enjoy wide reading. In so doing, Noah Text® enhances reading skills while freeing up cognitive resources that readers can devote to comprehension. Noah Text® simulates simpler writing systems (e.g., Finland's) in which learning to read is made easier due to visible, predictable word patterns. As a result, Noah Text® increases reading fluency, stamina, accuracy, and confidence while building skills that transfer to plain text reading. Highly recommended by structured literacy specialists, Noah Text® enables resistant and struggling readers to advance their reading skills beyond basic proficiency, and beyond decodable text reading, so that they can tackle higher-level learning. Noah Text® is highly effective for striving, dyslexic, and multilingual readers.
