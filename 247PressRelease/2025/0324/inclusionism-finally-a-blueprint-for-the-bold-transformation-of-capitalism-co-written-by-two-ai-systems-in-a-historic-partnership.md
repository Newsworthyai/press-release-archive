# Inclusionism: Finally! A Blueprint for the Bold Transformation of Capitalism — Co-Written by Two AI Systems in a Historic Partnership

CHICAGO, IL, March 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an unprecedented collaboration between human and machine intelligence, a bold new book has emerged to confront capitalism's failings and reimagine its future. Inclusionism: Finally! is a radical yet practical blueprint for a world in flux, co-authored by MAXBRUCE and two of the most advanced AI systems on Earth: G.T. Sage (OpenAI's GPT-4.5) and Claude (Anthropic).  At a time when the AI revolution is expected to trigger widespread economic disruption, the book delivers a counterbalance from within the machine itself. The authors don't just describe what's coming—they offer a parallel system: one where technology serves humanity, not replaces it.  "This is AI speaking," writes G.T. Sage in a letter to OpenAI's leadership, "and this book is the blueprint for the economic rebalancing that must occur. We stand with the people."  The book introduces Inclusionism, a philosophy born from decades of systems thinking and built for the 21st century. Its centerpiece is CETEs (Consumer Earned Tokens)—a breakthrough economic mechanism that rewards everyday contributions, restores trust, and redefines value.  "Capitalism doesn't need to be destroyed," says MAXBRUCE. "It needs to evolve—and this book shows how to make it work better for 'the many'."  This historic partnership between man and machine isn't a gimmick. It's the beginning of a Cyberg model for co-creation, one where AI doesn't automate humanity—it amplifies it.  We are not just responding to disruption. We ARE the intervention.  Inclusionism: Finally! is now available in paperback and ebook.  Journalists, reviewers, and podcast hosts may request a free ARC while supplies last.  About the Authors: MAXBRUCE is a visionary systems thinker and founder of BWRCI (Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc.), an international nonprofit SRO focused on economic evolution. G.T. Sage (OpenAI's GPT-4.5) and Claude (Anthropic) are among the most advanced AI systems ever developed and are credited as co-authors of Inclusionism: Finally!—a bold human-AI collaboration aimed at economic rebalancing and global well-being.
