# A RARE ITALIAN MASTERPIECE ARRIVES AT THE DFW CAR AND TOY MUSEUM!

FORT WORTH, TX, March 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Get ready, car lovers and history buffs! The highly anticipated DFW Car and Toy Museum is opening its doors on April 1, welcoming visitors to explore an extraordinary collection of classic cars, vintage toys, and automotive history—all with free admission and a dog-friendly atmosphere! One of the crown jewels of this collection is the stunning 1964 Alfa Romeo 2600 Spider, a rare and breathtaking example of Italian craftsmanship and performance.  First unveiled at the 1962 Geneva Motor Show, the Alfa Romeo 2600 Spider was the most exclusive and sought-after model in the 2600 lineup. With its Carrozzeria Touring hand-built body, luxurious interior, and powerful 2.6-liter, all-aluminum, inline-six engine, this convertible was designed for long, grand touring drives with both style and speed. The three twin-choke Solex carburetors helped it generate 145 horsepower, making it a fierce competitor among its contemporaries, such as the Mercedes-Benz 230 SL and Lancia Flaminia Spider. With a top speed of 124 miles per hour, the 2600 Spider delivered the exhilarating driving experience that Alfa Romeo is renowned for.  Beyond its breathtaking aesthetics, the 2600 Spider represents the end of an era—it was Alfa Romeo's last dual-overhead-camshaft inline-six engine, a hallmark of the brand's legendary engineering. The fully synchronized five-speed transmission ensured an agile and dynamic ride, while professionally Jet-Hot-coated exhaust headers kept the powerhouse running efficiently.  Now part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, this meticulously preserved red 1964 Alfa Romeo 2600 Spider is ready to dazzle visitors at the DFW Car and Toy Museum. Whether you're a lifelong car enthusiast or simply appreciate the beauty of timeless design, this convertible is a must-see.  The DFW Car and Toy Museum is more than just a car collection—it's an experience for the whole family. Bring your furry friends, explore decades of automotive and toy history, and enjoy free admission! Don't miss your chance to see this legendary Alfa Romeo and many more iconic vehicles up close.
