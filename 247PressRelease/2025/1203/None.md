# Hotel Guest Wins $2M Verdict After Severe Injuries in Communal Shower Fall

NEW YORK, NY, December 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A Manhattan jury has awarded $2,021,000 to a 64-year-old gentleman who was seriously injured in a fall in a communal shower at The Jane Hotel in New York City.  According to trial testimony, the plaintiff was using a communal bathroom at The Jane Hotel when he slipped on the wet marble floor outside the shower and fell, suffering multiple pelvic fractures and spinal disc herniations. The plaintiff's attorney, Jeffrey Weiskopf of The Law Office of Jeffrey Weiskopf, P.C., presented evidence showing that The Jane Hotel knew, or should have known, that the marble tiles in the communal bathroom lacked proper drainage and did not meet standards for slip resistance.  "This case was about a hotel choosing aesthetics over safety," said Jeffrey Weiskopf. "The jury sent a clear message: if you invite paying guests to use a communal bathroom, you have to make sure the floor is safe for use in a wet environment. You don't get a pass just because the tile looks good in photos."  The plaintiff's wife was also successful in bringing a derivative claim for the impact the injuries had on their marriage and daily life together. After a multi-day trial, the jury deliberated for just over two hours before finding that The Jane Hotel was negligent in failing to maintain a reasonably safe bathroom floor, leading to the plaintiff's injuries. The $2 million settlement verdict included compensation for the victim's pain and suffering, lost earnings, and other damages.   Attorney Weiskopf hopes this case serves as a wake-up call to hotels and property owners who prioritize aesthetics and decor over the safety of their guests and patrons.
