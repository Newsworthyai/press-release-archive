Kraus specializes in creating unique and innovative pop-up stores, galleries, and activations in non-traditional "white box spaces".  Pop-up events have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a unique and exciting way for businesses to engage with their customers.

His expertise in event planning and retail allows him to transform any space into a one-of-a-kind experience for both businesses and customers.  Kraus explained that some of his SmallConferences.com clientele needed him to look beyond the traditional event venue.  "The problem is these venues are very short term focused, they don't lend well to 'experimental marketing' – plus, quite frankly, they can be boring!" says Robert.  He had clients who were doing a variety of events, including:  • Brand activations  • Designer sample sales  • Product launches  • Art expos  • Wholesalers looking to liquidate excess inventory   These clients typically needed a space for more than just a few days. They also wanted a look that worked with their branding rather than having to have a set décor.  Robert explains that this led him to generate a concept to focus on the needs of those who did not want their event at a "traditional" venue. He states, "I want to be the go-to source for unique and affordable venues! Thus, PopUpsByDesign.com was born!"  "I am thrilled to launch PopUpsByDesign.com and offer my services to businesses looking to create temporary events," says Kraus.
