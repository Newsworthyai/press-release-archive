# Author Victorya Wright Introduces the Release of Her New Book "God Storys: Told By a Daughter of the Most High King"

MAGNOLIA, TX, November 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Do you have a personal mantra that guides you? Have you ever felt God's presence so strongly that it seemed as if He was right beside you? Do you seek His wisdom when faced with tough decisions?  Born at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles during one of the city's largest earthquakes, author Victorya Wright took her first breath as the building swayed and the gurney rolled— her parents recount a dramatic beginning marked by both chaos and grace. Life since then has been rich with God's goodness, meaningful relationships, and profound learning.   It has also brought seasons of hardship, loss, and shame— yet grace has always abounded. Victorya spent most of her life working in healthcare and continues to serve part time in her orofacial myofunctional therapy private practice in San Diego County and beyond. She is passionate about proclaiming all that God has done.   For Victorya, her constant prayer is "Not in my own strength, Lord. Not in my own strength. Guide me. Direct me. Help me." Since childhood she has experienced God's undeniable presence, leading her in ways both profound and personal. When uncertainty arises, she seeks clarity through prayer and her own version of the ancient Thummim and Urim – trusting Him to reveal the way forward.   Her new book, "God Storys", is a compilation of 30 true, standalone vignettes that testify to these divine encounters – extraordinary moments that are not mere coincidences, but God-instances. May these stories inspire you, strengthen your faith, and open your eyes to His presence in your own life.   As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Victorya's book will educate, support and inspire. "God Storys" reminds believers that God is intentionally personal and interested in you as a unique individual!
