# Beauty Junction Opens at the Weatherford Salon &amp; Spa Galleria

WEATHERFORD, TX, November 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Salon Owner Samantha Stafford is thrilled to announce the opening of her new specialty salon, Beauty Junction, located in Suite #516 of the Salon & Spa Galleria at 801 Interstate 20 E, Frontage Road, in Weatherford, Texas 76087. The newly opened salon is unique in that it offers professional make-up/make-over services, custom spray tanning, and creative photography sessions all-in-one location.  Ms. Stafford developed her craft through formal esthetics training (working as a licensed esthetician in Arizona before moving to Texas) and years of hands-on experience with a wide range of clients, friends, and family "who helped me discover my true passion for helping others look and feel their best."   When asked why she decided to open her unique salon she replied "I started Beauty Junction to create a space where women can reconnect with their confidence and feel beautiful inside and out. After working in the beauty industry for several years, I wanted to combine my love for esthetics and creative photography into one experience."  Samantha knows firsthand what it feels like to lose yourself, something that is all-too-common today with many women working nonstop, pouring their energy into everyone around them, and dealing with life's pressures. "That's why my goal is for every service I offer to feel like a moment for you, a chance to reconnect with that confident, glowing version of yourself that's still there, just waiting to be seen again."  Operating hours for Beauty Junction are Monday thru Thursday 3pm to 9pm and Friday thru Sunday 7am to 6pm. Hours outside of the regular schedule are also possible when needed and arranged in advance. To make an appointment, call or text Samantha directly at (602) 686-7661 or book online through the salon's "Book Now" webpage (samstafford.glossgenius.com/services). Sessions are by appointment only to ensure that every client gets the personalized time and attention they deserve.  In honor of the Grand Opening of Beauty Junction, Samantha is offering $40 spray tans and $60 photo sessions for a limited time. Additionally, in order to quickly expand the new salon's portfolio, "I'm offering $25 model specials for makeup, tanning and photo services" for those who are willing to let their Before and After or photography session photos be posted as well.  Samantha is passionate about helping women look and feel their best, and stressed "My heart is in helping women feel confident again."
