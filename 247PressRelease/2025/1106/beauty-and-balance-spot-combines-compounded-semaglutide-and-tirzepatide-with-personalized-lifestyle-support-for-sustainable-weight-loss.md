# Beauty and Balance Spot Combines Compounded Semaglutide and Tirzepatide with Personalized Lifestyle Support for Sustainable Weight Loss

HOLLYWOOD, FL, November 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Beauty & Balance Spot, a LegitScript-certified medical weight management clinic, today announced the expansion of its medically-supervised GLP-1 therapy program. The comprehensive program combines compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide medications with personalized nutrition plans and exercise protocols, addressing the growing demand for evidence-based weight loss solutions in South Florida.  The program was developed by Dr. Barbara Sharief, DNP, who brings 34 years of nursing experience to weight management care. Dr. Sharief's personal journey—losing 104 pounds over 14 months through a disciplined low-fat, high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, regular workouts, and GLP-1 medication support—inspired the creation of Beauty & Balance Spot's patient-centered approach.  "Weight loss isn't just about calories in versus calories out," said Dr. Barbara Sharief, founder of Beauty & Balance Spot. "Chronic stress, poor sleep, elevated cortisol levels, and insulin resistance can sabotage metabolism and drive cravings, causing the body to cling to fat even when patients are eating well and exercising. Our program evaluates hormone balance, sleep quality, vitamin status, and cravings so the body is prepared to benefit fully once medication and lifestyle changes begin."  Evidence-Based GLP-1 Therapy  Clinical trials consistently show that GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and related GIP-GLP-1 medications can produce substantial, sustained weight loss when paired with lifestyle changes. Patients in major studies achieved double-digit weight loss percentages while under medical supervision and support. These medications help reduce appetite, slow digestion, and improve metabolic health.  Comprehensive Program Features  Beauty & Balance Spot's program stands out through several key features:  • LegitScript-Certified, High-Quality Medications: The practice sources only top-quality compounded GLP-1 therapies and closely monitors dosing, side effects, progress, and adjustments.  • Personalized Lifestyle Integration: The program combines medication with diet recommendations (low-fat, high-protein, low-carbohydrate), exercise guidance (30-45 minutes, 2-3 times weekly), and behavioral support to drive results.  • Holistic Support: The clinic checks vitamin levels, addresses nutrient deficits, and provides vitamin injections and supplements as needed. Staff support patients through side effects, cravings, and the emotional aspects of weight loss.  • Experienced Medical Supervision: With three decades in nursing, Dr. Barbara Sharief emphasizes that effective weight loss requires medical supervision, empathy, and realistic goals.  Addressing Hidden Obstacles  The practice addresses hidden obstacles to weight loss that many programs overlook. Chronic stress, poor sleep, and elevated cortisol levels can sabotage metabolism and drive sugar and carbohydrate cravings. Combined with insulin resistance, the body may resist fat loss even with proper diet and exercise. Beauty & Balance Spot's comprehensive evaluation ensures patients' bodies are optimized for success before beginning treatment.  "Many patients come to us saying 'I've tried everything,'" Dr. Barbara Sharief added. "But when you combine the right medication with personalized care and a realistic lifestyle strategy, you dramatically increase the chances of lasting success. Whether patients have 20 pounds or 100 pounds to lose, we provide the highest standard of care."  Long-Term Health Focus  The program is designed for patients seeking sustainable weight loss through medical supervision rather than quick fixes or fad diets. Beauty & Balance Spot's approach focuses on long-term health improvements including increased energy, reduced joint pain, improved breathing, and enhanced confidence.
