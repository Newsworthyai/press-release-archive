# Historic Portland Senior Campus Unveils Immersive New Digital Experience for Families

PORTLAND, OR, November 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Designed to reflect the warmth, heritage, and vibrancy of the Cedars-Sinai Park campus, the new site invites visitors to do more than browse - it invites them to experience life on campus through a beautifully curated, storytelling-driven design.  "For more than 100 years, Cedars-Sinai Park has cared for Portland's seniors with dignity and purpose," said Rachael White, Administrator . "Now, our new website carries that same heart and hospitality into the digital world, giving families an authentic sense of who we are before they ever set foot on campus."  The new design moves beyond traditional senior care websites, trading clinical structure for emotional connection. From immersive visuals and intuitive navigation to thoughtfully written content and distinct journeys for each of the Park's service lines; Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing, Rehabilitation, Adult Day Services, and In-Home Care. The new website reflects Cedars-Sinai Park's holistic approach to care.  "We didn't just redesign a website," said Greatness Digital, the digital marketing agency behind the project. "We reimagined how families feel when they're searching for care. Every page was built to mirror the warmth, respect, and vibrancy that define the Cedars-Sinai Park experience." The website also honors the organization's deep Portland roots, weaving history, culture, and community into a modern, mobile-first design. Interactive photography, accessible layouts, and a clear storytelling flow guide visitors through more than a century of service, while showcasing how Cedars-Sinai Park continues to evolve to meet today's standards of excellence.  Visitors can explore the new digital experience now at www.cedarsinaipark.org.  Founded over a century ago, Cedars-Sinai Park is one of Portland's most trusted and respected senior care communities, offering a full continuum of care — including assisted living, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, adult day services, and in-home care. Rooted in compassion and Jewish tradition, Cedars-Sinai Park continues to serve seniors and families with integrity, innovation, and heart.
