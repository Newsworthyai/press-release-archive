# California's Most Festive Whimsical Holiday Event: The Mad Hatter Holiday Festival, Parade &amp; Tree Lighting in Vallejo's Historic Downtown that is Recreated as a Wonderland of Magic &amp; Enchantment

VALLEJO, CA, November 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Mad Hatter Holiday Festival returns on Saturday, December 6, 2025, attracting thousands of people to the historic downtown district of Vallejo with its creative lighted and fire-shooting Wonderland recreations that turn the city into a fantasy world for children and adults alike.  The historic downtown of Vallejo comes alive for the holiday season. There is no other festival nor parade like it in the states. Larger-than-life Wonderland characters: the Mad Hatter & his marvelous tea party guest lead the parade & captivate the crowds alongside award winning Burning Man mutant vehicles of serpents, dragons & rhinos, all shooting fire. There is the classic restored 48 and 8 Train from the early 1900s blowing its horn awakening the city to all its glory followed by Storm Troopers led by Darth Vader from the Golden Gate Garrison 501 Legion, Aladdin's Lamp, Maritime Cadets in their Blues, dancing groups of children ballerinas, as well as a dancing Grinch with his followers. The list continues with cultural dancing groups, hip-hop performers and lighted floats that inspire and fascinate the attendees.   There are two announcing stages: one created for Burning Man as a Starway to Heaven that is an elevated chair fifteen feet high above the Mad Hatter Holiday Parade as they pass and the second stage hosts a Hatter's Queen Court that will also be crowning young princesses and Queens before the parade begins.   The festival grounds are surrounded by holiday gift and food vendors, live musical performances and a photo-op between two giant flaming feathers. All the Hatter's Characters line the festival grounds to interact with the public. There is a bell ringing lighted holiday train for children to ride around the festival grounds and by the dazzling glow of the holiday tree. The cheerful spirited atmosphere brings out the joyful excitement of a once held memory and vision of a wonderful American old town past-time with a great feeling of togetherness for all families and attendees.  The sparkling Christmas Tree of over three thousand lights go on after the countdown by our Mayor and Grand Marshals: Freddie Stone of Sly & The Family Stone, along with our Community Grand Marshal, Amanda Williams, a single mom, who put her life on the line for another in a devastating situation. A massive constructive Victorian Ship with a 30' colorful blimp on its top will host the staging for the performing program that will end with the lighting of the 50' tree, one of California's largest holiday trees.
