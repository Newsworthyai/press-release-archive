# Beyond The Buzz - Top Motivational Speaker Rocky Romanella On Why People Still Matter Most

WILMINGTON, NC, November 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Artificial intelligence is all the rage today, and for good reasons. Nevertheless, people are fundamentally more important in business than artificial intelligence, as people bring qualities to the table that machines cannot possibly replicate. Intuition, emotional intelligence, social relationships, empathy, and trust are fundamental to cultivating customer loyalty and driving long-term success. Innovative problem-solving often stems from experience, human insight and imagination. The "human" element is essential for strategy development, balanced leadership, and maintaining the ethical and moral standards that govern successful business practices.  Top motivational speaker and best-selling author Rocky Romanella recently addressed this subject in a newsletter titled, 'Beyond The Buzz: Why People Still Matter Most'. In that article, he wrote in part:  In this edition, I want to shift the spotlight back to what truly drives every great organization: its people. I know—in a world buzzing about artificial intelligence, algorithms, and automation, this might sound old school. But here's the reality: no technology, no tool, no trend can replace the power of a committed, inspired, and well-led team.  While AI might optimize processes, it's people who build trust, spark innovation, and close deals. They are the heartbeat of culture, the architects of strategy, and the ones who turn vision into reality.  My belief that people are our greatest asset isn't just a leadership mantra—it's a conviction rooted in one of my favorite passages from history. In his 1910 speech "Citizenship in a Republic," Theodore Roosevelt delivered a timeless reminder of where true value lies:  "It is not the critic who counts… The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…"  This excerpt—famously known as "The Man in the Arena"—celebrates those who dare, who strive, who show up with grit and heart. It's a tribute to the doers, the builders, the leaders who face challenges head-on and keep moving forward.  That's who your people are. They are in the arena every day—making calls, solving problems, leading teams, and pushing toward goals that matter.  So, as you plan for the year ahead, ask yourself:  • How are you equipping your people to thrive in the arena? • What culture are you building to support their courage and resilience? • Are you recognizing the effort, not just the outcome?  Let's lead with intention. Let's invest in the people in the arena who make it all happen.  Rebuilding the Bridge: People First in 2026  Over the past few years, uncertainty has taken its toll. And too often, the first casualty has been the training and development of our greatest asset—our people. It's the first cut, the deepest wound, and the slowest to heal.  That's why I believe 2026 must be the year we reverse that trend. Our people are not just important—they are essential. They deserve our priority, our investment, and our focus.  Disciplined Approach: Develop Leaders, Elevate Talent  If we want to build the best, the brightest, and the most informed professionals in our industry, we must treat leadership development as a strategic imperative—not a luxury. The past few years have seen training and development take a backseat. It's often the first cut and the slowest to return. That must change.  In 2026, our competitive edge will come from how well we mentor, educate, and prepare our people to lead—not just today, but into the future.  Here's what a disciplined approach to leadership development looks like:  • Leadership Alignment: Leaders must model the mindset of continuous learning and intentional growth. • Mentorship Culture: Create systems where experience is passed down, and emerging leaders are coached to rise. • Hiring for Potential: Seek out individuals with the curiosity and character to grow into leadership roles. • Performance Development: Go beyond evaluation—invest in education, feedback, and stretch opportunities. • Resilience & Adaptability: Equip leaders to navigate change with clarity, confidence, and composure.  Disciplined development is the bridge between potential and performance. It's how we turn promising individuals into industry-defining leaders.  A strategic business plan must include more than vision and execution—it must include a commitment to building leaders. We've talked before about how disciplined people with disciplined thought create world-class organizations through disciplined action. Now, we must apply that same principle to leadership development.  Because the future belongs to those who prepare their people to lead it.
