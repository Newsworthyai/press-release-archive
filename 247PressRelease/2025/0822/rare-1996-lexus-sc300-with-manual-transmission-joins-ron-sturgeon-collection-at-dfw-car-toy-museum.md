# Rare 1996 Lexus SC300 with Manual Transmission Joins Ron Sturgeon Collection at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, August 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A striking 1996 Lexus SC300 — powered by the iconic 3.0-liter inline-six engine paired with a five-speed manual transmission — is now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  This rare black SC300 features the desirable manual gearbox, enhancing its status among collectors of Japanese grand touring cars. The well-preserved vehicle boasts only 51,000 miles on the odometer and showcases timeless Lexus craftsmanship and performance.  Equipped with four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, the car delivers a refined driving experience. Inside the cabin, luxury meets functionality with wood trim, driver-seat memory, cruise control, cassette stereo, and automatic climate control. A four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, 8,000-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level.  Under the hood, the 3.0-liter 2JZ-GE inline-six engine produces 225 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, sending power to the rear wheels through the manual transmission — a configuration highly prized by enthusiasts today.  "The Lexus SC300 is one of those cars that quietly became a legend," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It combined Toyota's bulletproof engineering with Lexus-level luxury, and finding one with a manual transmission in such great condition is getting harder every year. I'm excited to share this special car with our museum visitors."  The DFW Car & Toy Museum is home to over 200 classic, exotic, and rare vehicles, along with more than 3,000 collectible toys. Visitors can explore a wide variety of automotive history, with new cars added to the collection throughout the year.
