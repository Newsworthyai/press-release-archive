# Christopher Bowden and Marvin Williams set to develop "Original Hustler", the TV Series surrounding Mr. Bowden, Los Angeles and the notorious 90's Music Industry that would captivate the world

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The series, currently titled "Original Hustler", centers on the enormously pivotal moments of Christopher "C Style" Bowden's life and reputation which was synonymous with the treacherous Los Angeles streets as well his timely influence on iconic music artists and record labels of the 90's.   From unforeseeable moments in some of the toughest "Hoods" in LA to music sessions and critical label meetings that he organized, Bowden's hustle and grit would help to deliver music the world would receive and applaud. With the emergence and globalization of hip hop music and artists taking off and more pointedly "West Coast Rap Music" Bowden both remarkably and respectfully emerged from the epicenter of carnage to help create, monetize and deliver emerging artists and labels onto the world stage. That remarkable truth, forged from navigating the deadliest of scenarios, would defy societal gravity and unravel upwards into the grandest of boardrooms as hip hop/rap music would expose a symbiotic tone that the world would absorb and transform into a multi-billion dollar economic force and global musical genre that pumped out hits globally from a Los Angeles epicenter.  From the aforementioned moments, Bowden's resolve would be tested. The street to the boardroom would reveal different obstacles and from this perspective, his life's perspective - a unique paradigm of moments would forever be initiated forward as he would be a catalyst and trusted force to a selection of rap music's most iconic and respected artists. Bowden's rolodex and ambition would involve rap music and producing icons that ranged Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Ice T, Korupt, Dj Quick, DJ Pooh as well as Executives Jimmy Iovene, Andrew Shack and Kevin Black as a very short list. Bowden has also experienced running imprint labels ranging from 19th Street Records with ranged distribution under Capital, Virgin and Priority Records with additional executive influence from Gary Girsch, Malik Levy and Eric Brooks.  Bowden remains respected by true icons of music and entertainment talent as well as the street. From this unique perspective, this life truth of navigation and a life lived through carnage as told through an art that spans the world â€“ Bowden's true to life TV Series will emerge.  "I'm excited at this moment in my life. To say I've seen it all is an understatement. From discovering Snoop before he was Snoop to the real shit lived through with DeathRow and other endeavors, I've seen a lot. To start from the bottom and then travel the world is not simply a life everyone gets to see or live, especially from Long Beach. I feel very blessed to have lived and survived through LA and am very excited to bring it to life with Marv because few have his ability. I've seen a lot of people and I've respect a few. I acknowledge what others have done in Music, TV and Film but now, I'm blessed to have my moment, my time to develop my story and most importantly do it my way. As talented as Marv is he's not "Hollywood" and it's unique to find a creative who's also an executive and who's really more of a friend and a homie versus a creative writer or producer only interested in doing things their way for their benefit. I respect and appreciate that." - Says Bowden  Marvin Williams, who's known for being a talent recognized by some of the most elite in the business, whose credits and associations include FOX Studios (SOUL, Tubi), Disney Records, Sony Pictures, Sony Music, Universal Music, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, Dionne Warwick, The Golden Globes, Clive Davis, The Jacksons, Magic Johnson MTV Teen Choice Awards and most recently the NAACP Theatre Awards as a partial list.  "I've been blessed to work with the best in the business through my unique approach. That momentum and force naturally created a shared understanding and creative angle with C Style. His POV in life is not only synonymous with the scene in LA timelined from the 80's, 90's and 2000's but he was integral in the incubation and mentorship of some of the most prolific LA talent that went global. That's amazing originating from the streets of Long Beach. From Snoop Dogg, a formidable goat in any discussion, to the iconic Dr. Dre, the infamous Deathrow records and DJ Pooh, DJ Quick, the legendary Korupt plus so many more, he's lived it and more importantly earned it. When you look at his real life story and then take notice to the successes of the comparables ranging from the magnificent success of 50 Cent's "Power", to FOX's "Empire" or the engagement in FX's "Snowfall" even HBO's "The Sopranos" there are a select few TV Series IP's that raise the bar and become the barometer of real success and at the end of the day Christopher's story is just as amazing as it is true against the others. To say 'based on actual events' will be the understatement. The big guy started from the bottom, the belly of Los Angeles/Long Beach, and lived through the carnage and then he transition through street and business smarts and instinct while aligning with brands and talent that would impact music and art around the world. With those odds stacked against him, it's nothing short of magnificent." - Says Williams.
