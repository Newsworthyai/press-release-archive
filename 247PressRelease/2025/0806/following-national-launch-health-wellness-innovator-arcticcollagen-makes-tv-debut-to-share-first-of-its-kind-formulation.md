# Following National Launch, Health &amp; Wellness Innovator ArcticCollagen Makes TV Debut to Share First-of-Its-Kind Formulation

BOCA RATON, FL, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the dietary supplement market meets renewed demand for collagen products, health and wellness leader ArcticCollagen, the first marine collagen dietary supplement to deliver 8,000 mg of hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin C in delicious single-use, honey-like packs, is hitting American TVs following an interview on The Donna Drake Show highlighting their recent launch, inspiration, and promise of quality.   "We are truly honored for the opportunity to better connect with consumers across the U.S., as well as join the incredible world of visionaries and innovators that have been welcomed aboard The Donna Drake Show," said ArcticCollagen President and Co-Founder Jasmien Winqvist. "This appearance is an incredible symbol of how far we've come since our launch, and we are excited for what the future holds."   Founded in 2024 by Jasmien Winqvist and Lennart Winqvist, ArcticCollagen came to life after the duo were dissatisfied with collagen options on the market. The result? A travel-ready, one-a-day strawberry and lemon flavored sachet made from wild caught fish (a hypoallergenic alternative to bovine and porcine sources) and rich in type-1 collagen, known for its superior bioavailability in the body.   "Collagen is an incredible resource for the body- it accounts for 30% of our protein, and is essential for maintaining skin, muscle, bone, and connective tissue support," added Winqvist. "By age 25, natural collagen levels begin to decrease, leaving us vulnerable to joint pain, wrinkled skin, less flexible tendons and ligaments, and even issues with blood flow. Our formulation not only boosts levels across the body, it is easily added to any meal or taken as a sweet treat for maximum comfort."   "Words cannot describe how proud I am of our company's accomplishment. We have crafted a new kind of collagen, one that embraces consumer needs and makes staying healthy and youthful easier than ever before."  ArcticCollagen can be purchased on OneLavi.com and Medpaid Market, with launches on Amazon.com and Walmart.com coming soon. A pack of 14 single-use, tear-top sachets retails for $59.99.
