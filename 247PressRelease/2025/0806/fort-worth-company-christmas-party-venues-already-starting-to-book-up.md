It's not just meeting space, it's the venue for between 50 and 500 guests that Trip Advisor tagged as Fort Worth's #1 best thing to do out of 328 fun things to do in Fort Worth.  With 150,000 square feet of space and more than 200 antique, vintage and exotic autos, DFW Car and Toy Museum is serious fun. Add more than 3,000 rare and vintage toys and you and sure to have found the event venue that will get your colleagues talking and sharing memories.   July is not too soon to start planning your event. Start by making your list of the top company Christmas party venues and begin to narrow the list.   If you work in Fort Worth or anywhere in the DFW Metroplex, I suggest holding your company holiday party at the brand-new DFW Car and Toy Museum at 2550 McMillan Pkwy Fort Worth, Texas 76137.   Located centrally, DFW Car and Toy Museum is tops among local venues because it has plenty of free parking and can customize its space to execute the vision you have for your event.   Even if money is tight, DFW Car and Toy Museum allows you to have a first-rate Christmas party. Rather than being locked into a preset list of approved caterers, at the museum, you can use the caterer of your choice for the party or even do the cooking for the event and use our onsite warming and finishing kitchen that is included in the event venue rental.   "We also are set up to have holiday events where local gourmet food trucks provide the fare for guests, which is a great way to offer more food choices and add some fun to the event," said museum Marketing Manager Jennifer Brook.   "We also can accommodate a wide variety of arrangements for bar service, including everything from professional trained and certified bartenders to BYOB," said Brook.   The museum has opened bookings for holiday parties for 2025 and beyond. To reserve for your company Christmas party and get the widest choice of dates, call (817) 834-3625 x1.
