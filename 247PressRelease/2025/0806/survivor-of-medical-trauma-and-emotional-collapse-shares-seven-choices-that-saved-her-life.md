# Survivor of Medical Trauma and Emotional Collapse Shares Seven Choices That Saved Her Life

CIRCLE MOUNT, MN, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a culture overwhelmed by stress and uncertainty, What On Earth Are We Doing? by Allison Shawn arrives as both a memoir and a mirror. This compelling true story of recovery from physical trauma, emotional betrayal, and chronic illness is as inspiring as it is instructive.  With over 70% of adults reporting high levels of stress, many are seeking stories that offer more than sympathy—they want solutions. Shawn's seven choices, including learning to trust again, living with integrity, and choosing faith over fear, offer grounded steps toward mental and emotional stability.  "I had to trust my soul instincts, even at rock-bottom. I had nothing left—except my will to believe there was still a purpose for my life," says Shawn.  Through reflective storytelling and practical application, readers are equipped with tools for navigating grief, disappointment, and personal reinvention. The book also explores how choices made under pressure reveal the deepest truths about who we are—and who we can become.  Available now wherever books are sold.  Press contact: 612-965-0698
