# TUOFA CNC Rapid Manufacturing for Hard Metal Machining: Faster Lead Times, Tighter Tolerances, Stronger Parts

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TUOFA CNC Machining today introduced a Rapid Manufacturing line dedicated to hard-metal parts, aimed at shortening lead times for aerospace, energy, medical, robotics, and electric-vehicle programs that rely on difficult-to-machine alloys.  The upgrade centers on three pillars—capacity, control, and consistency:  1. Materials: TUOFA metal custom machining is better at making hard CNC materials, such as titanium alloys, nickel superalloys (Inconel 718, Hastelloy), hardened stainless steels (17-4 PH, 15-5 PH), tool steels (H13, D2), and cobalt-chrome. Besides CNC metals, TUOFA precision also provides CNC engineering plastic machining custom services.  2. Processes: 5-axis and multi-axis CNC milling, high-precision turning, single-setup turn-mill, wire and sinker EDM, plus hard turning and grinding for post-heat-treat finishes. From CAD to manufacturing, one-stop workflow process.  3. Equipment base: Conventional and CNC lathes and mills, Swiss-type automatics, grinders, drill-tap units, laser cutters, stamping presses (15 t–130 t), and the newly installed 5-axis cell with through-spindle coolant and in-machine probing.  Applications split into two broad groups:  1. Structural components such as turbine housings, motor casings, and robotic brackets that demand fatigue strength and tight GD&T.  2. Functional or wear components including valve seats, gears, dies, and corrosion-resistant fasteners operating in high-temperature or abrasive environments.  3. Quality controls include CMM, optical, and white-light scanning, with tolerances to ±0.005 mm and surface finishes to Ra 0.2 µm; full lot traceability supports regulated sectors.  "Hard metals slow many projects; they can't slow ours," said Andy, General Manager. "This line keeps schedules on track while meeting the mechanical requirements these alloys were chosen for."  Planned next-year investments target additional 5-axis capacity, expanded superfinish grinding, and NADCAP-aligned process controls.  About TUOFA CNC Machining Founded in 2006, TUOFA provides custom CNC machining for metals and engineering plastics, offering end-to-end machining, finishing, and inspection services.
