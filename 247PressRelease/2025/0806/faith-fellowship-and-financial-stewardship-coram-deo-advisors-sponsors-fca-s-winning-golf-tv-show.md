# Faith, Fellowship, and Financial Stewardship: Coram Deo Advisors Sponsors FCA's Winning Golf TV Show

LANCASTER, PA, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Coram Deo Advisors recently sponsored the Fellowship of Christian Athletes' "Winning Golf" TV show segment, where owner Dave Over served as a blue team coach on July 23rd, 2025, at the prestigious Applecross Country Club in Downingtown, PA. This partnership exemplifies how faith-driven financial planning firms can extend their impact beyond traditional wealth management services to support ministries that transform lives through athletic ministry.  The connection between golf, faith, and financial stewardship runs deeper than many realize. The Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) was founded in 1954 by Don McClanen, a basketball coach at Eastern Oklahoma A&M, who recognized the unique platform that sports figures possessed to share their Christian faith. Today, this vision continues through specialized programs like "Winning Golf," which combines competitive athletics with spiritual mentorship.  A Family Connection That Opened Doors for Ministry  Dave Over's involvement with FCA's "Winning Golf" program stems from a meaningful family connection that demonstrates how God orchestrates opportunities for Kingdom work. Phil Over, Dave's brother, serves as an Area Director for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, specifically overseeing the "Winning Golf" television segment that airs as part of FCA programming.  This family bond created a natural bridge between Coram Deo Advisors' mission to guide clients through faith-based financial planning and FCA's commitment to transforming lives through athletic ministry. When the opportunity arose for Coram Deo to sponsor the show and for Dave to participate as a blue team coach, it represented more than just a business partnership—it embodied the firm's core value of walking alongside ministries dedicated to serving others.  The July 23rd event at Applecross Country Club brought together young golfers, coaches, and supporters in an environment where competitive athletics and spiritual formation intersected. Applecross Country Club boasts the first and only Nicklaus-designed golf course in the Philadelphia area, characterized by rolling terrain, manicured fairways, and significant elevation changes that offer breathtaking views from many tees. This stunning backdrop served as the perfect venue for combining high-level golf instruction with character development rooted in Christian principles.  The Heart Behind Financial Stewardship and Athletic Ministry  Both organizations share a foundational belief that how we handle resources—whether financial assets or athletic abilities—reflects our deeper values and commitment to serving God's Kingdom. FCA Golf exists to lead every coach and athlete into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ and His church. At the same time, Coram Deo Advisors guides individuals, families, and ministries toward financial independence through a Biblical worldview.  This alignment creates powerful synergies. Young athletes learning discipline, teamwork, and perseverance on the golf course benefit from understanding how these same principles apply to financial stewardship throughout their lives. Meanwhile, families and business owners who work with financial advisors in Lancaster, PA, appreciate firms that invest in community organizations, making lasting impacts.  The "Winning Golf" program targets youth development, providing comprehensive athletic, spiritual, and leadership training for aspiring young golfers. This holistic approach aligns with Coram Deo's multi-generational planning philosophy, which considers not only immediate financial goals but also the lasting legacy impact across generations.  Leading Your Legacy Through Strategic Partnerships  Coram Deo Advisors' sponsorship of "Winning Golf" exemplifies their "Lead Your Legacy" philosophy in action. Rather than simply managing portfolios, the firm actively invests in organizations that create lasting transformation in the lives of young people. This approach resonates strongly with clients who share similar values about stewardship, generosity, and Kingdom impact.  The partnership also highlights how Christian financial advisors can authentically integrate their faith into business practices. Instead of compartmentalizing spiritual beliefs from professional services, Coram Deo demonstrates that Biblical principles should inform every aspect of how they serve clients and support their community.  Dave Over's role as blue team coach provided hands-on mentorship to young golfers, sharing not just technical expertise but also life wisdom grounded in faith. This personal investment reflects the firm's broader commitment to relationship-building, whether with individual clients, families, or ministry partners.  The Intersection of Wealth Management and Athletic Development  Professional golf has long attracted Christian athletes who use their platform to share their faith. Golfers like Bubba Watson credit Jesus and the Bible for their success, while Phil Mickelson openly discusses how Christianity has helped him find joy and truly appreciate his golfing accomplishments. These examples provide powerful role models for young athletes participating in FCA programs.  For financial planning clients, especially business owners and high-net-worth individuals, supporting athletic ministry creates meaningful opportunities to align their charitable giving with values-driven organizations. Planned giving via appreciated assets—a specialty area for Coram Deo—allows clients to support programs like "Winning Golf" while maximizing tax efficiency and Kingdom impact.  The firm's expertise in working with ministries and nonprofits dedicated to serving others makes them uniquely positioned to help clients structure their generosity strategically. Whether through direct sponsorships, endowment contributions, or planned giving arrangements, Christian families can create lasting legacies that extend far beyond traditional wealth transfer.  Building Relationships Before the Sight of God  The phrase "Coram Deo"—meaning "before the sight of God"—captures the firm's commitment to conducting every aspect of their work with integrity and transparency. This principle guided their approach to the FCA partnership, viewing it not as a marketing opportunity but as a genuine ministry investment.  Dave Over's coaching role required a significant time commitment, personal investment in the development of young athletes, and authentic relationship-building activities that extend well beyond typical business networking. This approach reflects the firm's broader philosophy of prioritizing relationships over transactions, whether with clients, community partners, or ministry organizations.  The "Winning Golf" sponsorship also demonstrates how established, transparent fee structure principles apply beyond client relationships. Too often, people sell products they don't understand or are charged hidden fees they weren't aware of. At Coram Deo Advisors, we do things differently. We invest with an established, transparent fee structure—just honest guidance rooted in clarity and purpose. Our promise to serve isn't just words—you'll see it in every step we take with you on your journey, including our community investments.  Strategic Community Investment for Financial Advisors  For retirement planning and wealth management firms, community involvement creates multiple benefits beyond simple brand recognition. Strategic partnerships with organizations like FCA build authentic connections with families who share similar values, often leading to meaningful professional relationships built on trust and shared purpose.  The "Winning Golf" partnership specifically appeals to clients who appreciate comprehensive approaches to life and financial planning. Parents who invest in their children's athletic development often demonstrate similar thoughtfulness in their educational funding, retirement planning, and estate planning considerations.  Additionally, involvement in youth development programs offers valuable insights into generational trends, family dynamics, and emerging community needs. These observations inform how financial advisors in Lancaster, PA, structure services for multigenerational planning and family wealth management.  The Dave Ramsey Connection and Debt Management Excellence  Coram Deo Advisors' holistic approach includes comprehensive debt management services, working closely as Dave Ramsey SmartVestor Pros. This designation aligns perfectly with their participation in youth development programs, as financial education and responsible money management principles benefit young athletes preparing for college and professional careers.  The Dave Ramsey methodology emphasizes systematic debt elimination, building an emergency fund, and intentional wealth accumulation—principles that complement the discipline and goal-setting skills developed through competitive athletics. Young golfers learning to manage practice schedules, tournament preparation, and academic responsibilities benefit from parallel instruction in financial responsibility and stewardship.  For parents supporting young athletes, debt management becomes particularly crucial when considering tournament travel, equipment costs, coaching fees, and potential college recruiting expenses. Working with advisors who understand both the financial realities of competitive athletics and proven debt elimination strategies creates valuable peace of mind.  Estate Planning Integration for Ministry-Minded Families  While Coram Deo Advisors works with clients and legal professionals to create legal documents for estate plans—as they are not estate attorneys and don't provide that specific legal advice—they excel at coordinating comprehensive legacy planning that includes ministry giving components.  Families involved in athletic ministry often wish to include organizations like FCA in their long-term charitable giving strategies. This requires careful coordination between financial planning, legal document preparation, and tax optimization strategies. The firm's experience working with ministries and nonprofits enables them to guide clients through complex giving arrangements that honor their values while achieving estate planning objectives.  Retirement planning for families with strong ministry connections often includes specific provisions for continued charitable giving throughout their golden years. The firm's Biblical worldview approach helps clients balance personal security needs with generous Kingdom investing, creating sustainable giving patterns that continue across generations.  Fiduciary Standards and Ministry Partnership Transparency  The partnership with FCA's "Winning Golf" program exemplifies Coram Deo's commitment to fiduciary standards in all relationships. Just as they prioritize client interests in financial planning decisions, their community partnerships focus on genuine ministry impact rather than self-promotional objectives.  This transparency extends to fee structures, service explanations, and the motivations behind partnerships. Clients appreciate working with advisors who demonstrate consistent integrity across all relationships, whether managing investment portfolios or supporting youth development programs.  The firm's transparent fee structure—no sales pitches, just clarity—applies equally to community investments. Sponsorship decisions are made based on ministry effectiveness, values alignment, and genuine opportunity to serve others, not marketing calculations or business development targets.  Multi-Generational Impact Through Athletic Ministry  Wealth management clients often express deep concern about transferring values alongside financial assets to the next generation. Supporting programs like "Winning Golf" provides concrete examples of how families can invest in character development, leadership skills, and spiritual formation for young people.  The athletic ministry model creates unique opportunities for cross-generational mentorship, where successful business owners and professionals can share wisdom with young athletes preparing for life transitions. Dave Over's coaching role exemplifies this approach, combining golf instruction with life mentorship rooted in Biblical principles.  For families building multi-generational wealth, involvement in youth development programs offers valuable insights into effective leadership development, character formation, and strategies for transmitting values. These observations often inform family business succession planning, educational funding priorities, and areas of focus for charitable giving.  The Power of Relationship-Driven Financial Planning  Coram Deo Advisors' approach to the FCA partnership reflects their broader philosophy of relationship-driven financial planning. Rather than treating community involvement as separate from professional services, they integrate ministry support into their comprehensive approach to serving clients and their broader community.  This integration fosters authentic connections with families who appreciate advisors willing to invest in causes they care about personally. Parents of young athletes, ministry supporters, and values-driven business owners often prefer working with financial professionals who demonstrate a similar commitment to faith-based community development.  The "Winning Golf" sponsorship also provides natural conversation opportunities about stewardship, generosity, and Kingdom impact—topics that resonate strongly with Christian families as they make significant financial planning decisions.
