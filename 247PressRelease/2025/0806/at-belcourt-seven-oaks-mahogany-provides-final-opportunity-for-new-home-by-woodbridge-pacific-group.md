BAKERSFIELD, CA, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Selective shoppers seeking a preferred home in Bakersfield are heading to Belcourt at Seven Oaks. Here, the luxury neighborhood of Mahogany by Woodbridge Pacific Group is enhanced by Belcourt's host of lifestyle advantages.   "Now is the final opportunity to secure one of our new homes at Belcourt," said WPG President Todd Cunningham. "Mahogany epitomizes WPG's design and planning goals at Belcourt, and we are proud to complete our work here with this outstanding collection."  Mahogany's pricing includes upgrades and begins in the $800,000's, for homes with 3 to 4 bedrooms and 3 to 4.5 baths in 2,543 to 3,209 square feet of living space. Each home provides a 3-car garage, on a pool-sized lot.   At press time, 11 Mahogany homes were available, all featuring architectural distinction and superb livability. This choice selection includes three move-in ready homes in gated Belcourt Westhaven.  Shoppers can review choices with the assistance of WPG, or independently, said WPG Senior Sales Counselor Kathy Breeding. "We offer self-guided tours for shoppers who want to pick the day and time that works best for them to visit the home they are considering," she said. "They can tour the home at their convenience between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. and follow up with our sales office as needed."  Breeding said that those who wish to schedule a self-guided tour can call 661-348-9797 or email WPG New Home Specialist Monica Schanz (mtschanz@woodbridgepacific.com) for scheduling information.  Classic style is a Mahogany hallmark, beginning with the covered entry that highlights every home's gracious architecture. Brick, stone and wood enrichments add craftsman flair to Mahogany streetscapes, promoting established character throughout this neighborhood.   Mahogany's one- and two-story designs feature versatile, smoothly functioning layouts and pleasing connectivity to each home's Belcourt Room, an expansive, covered outdoor space that is ideal for entertaining or leisure time. These spaces range from 333 to 466 square feet, depending on plan.   Design and finish quality were as influential as the home's capacity in Chris and Stacey's decision to choose Mahogany at Belcourt in Bakersfield. "We liked Plan One's Traditional exterior immediately," said Chris. "The grand entrance is impressive, and the pluses just kept going from there. The design is elegant, feels big and lives big. This home is ideal for comfortable family living."  Mahogany's sophisticated, comfortable designs combine with a stone's throw to the walkable, connected and charming village of Belcourt. Amenities of this established village include the core destination of Belcourt Center Club, where a resort style pool and spa highlight 7,250 square feet of interior space.   Belcourt Center Club also provides residents with a fitness center, multi-purpose and community rooms, billiards room and catering kitchen. "This is is the heart of Belcourt," said Breeding. "Belcourt residents enjoy special events, workouts and simply relaxing with friends and neighbors here."  Belcourt Park holds more options. Created as a public park by WPG, Seven Oaks master developer Bolthouse Properties and the City of Bakersfield, its 8.3 acres hold a multi-use sports field, tennis courts, amphitheater, and shaded tot lot and play area.   Belcourt also features a delightful paseo that connects with a network of internal trails that link to Belcourt amenities. Some pathways connect with additional destinations in Seven Oaks, including Bolthouse Park by Bolthouse Properties. It features medical and professional offices, light dining, convenience shopping, service station and a Montessori school.  "Belcourt residents can skip the drive for many aspects of everyday living," said Cunningham. "Life here means more time to enjoy family and leisure, and all of us can appreciate this luxury."
