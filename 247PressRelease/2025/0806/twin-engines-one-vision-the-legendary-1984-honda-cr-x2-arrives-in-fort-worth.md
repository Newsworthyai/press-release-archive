# Twin Engines. One Vision. The Legendary 1984 Honda CR-X² Arrives in Fort Worth

FORT WORTH, TX, August 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It's not every day that a car breaks the mold—and then shatters expectations. Meet the 1984 Honda CR-X², an audacious twin-engine experiment born from a visionary collaboration between Car and Driver, American Honda, Racing Beat, and Mugen. Now, this legendary one-off lives in Fort Worth as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, where it stands as a symbol of what happens when bold ideas meet performance engineering.  Originally built in the mid-1980s, the CR-X² began as a stock CRX until Car and Driver—with Honda's blessing—installed a second powertrain in the rear, transforming it into a twin-engine, four-wheel-drive marvel. Later upgraded with dual 1.8L inline-fours from the Honda Accord, the car features dual automatic transaxles, four-wheel disc brakes, electronic fuel injection, and a striking Mugen body kit.  Inside, you'll find a custom console with dual tachometers, an Accord-sourced shifter, and auxiliary gauges, while Koni shocks, torsion bars, and a custom rear MacPherson strut suspension ensure performance to match the vision. During Car and Driver's rigorous testing, the car clocked a 0–60 mph time as fast as 6.2 seconds, with a quarter-mile pass in just 14.5 seconds—numbers that blew minds in the mid-'80s.  The CR-X² made waves when it graced the May 1985 cover of Car and Driver under the headline "Synchronicity," and again when it reappeared on the magazine's site and on Jay Leno's Garage in December 2024.  More than a collector's dream, this car is a historic artifact of innovation, pushing the limits of what a subcompact coupe could be and capturing the imaginations of enthusiasts, engineers, and editors alike.  Now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, the CR-X² invites guests to see, up close, a machine that dared to double everything—power, creativity, and ambition.
