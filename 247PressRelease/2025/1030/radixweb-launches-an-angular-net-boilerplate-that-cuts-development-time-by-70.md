# Radixweb Launches an Angular + .NET Boilerplate that Cuts Development Time by 70%

FRISCO, TX, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Radixweb, an AI-first product engineering company, has recently launched a .NET + Angular microservices boilerplate. The boilerplate, which is available for free, aims to help developers speed up enterprise software development. It combines a .NET boilerplate for the backend with an Angular boilerplate for the frontend for a solid foundation.   Setting up enterprise applications often means repeating the same tasks. Authentication, user management, notifications, and security configurations are among the key setups required. Radixweb's microservices boilerplate solves this problem with a production-ready architecture that is modular, scalable, and secure. Teams can now launch core services in days instead of months, cutting setup time by up to 70%.   The full stack boilerplate uses modern technologies including .NET, Angular, and SQL Server. It comes with built-in authentication, JWT-based security, and role-based access controls (RBAC).   Frontend developers get a ready-to-use angular app boilerplate with modular architecture. The angular boilerplate template includes dashboards, authentication flows, and other reusable components. This makes it easier to build clean, maintainable, and enterprise-grade user interfaces.   Key Features   -The key features of the .NET + Angular boilerplate by Radixweb include:   -Full stack boilerplate built with .NET, Angular, and SQL Server   -Built-in authentication, JWT security, and role-based access controls (RBAC)   -Angular app boilerplate with dashboards, authentication flows & reusable components   -Angular boilerplate template for clean, maintainable enterprise UIs   -Enterprise boilerplate for .NET Angular also includes real-time notifications via SignalR   -Configurable email delivery and multi-channel support (SMS, webhooks)   "Our goal with this boilerplate programming approach is to save teams from repetitive work. We want teams to focus on creating real value instead." said Pratik Mistry, EVP - Technology Consulting at Radixweb. "The combination of Angular boilerplate and .NET boilerplate brings together best practices, prebuilt modules, and production-ready boilerplate code. It has already been tested across hundreds of projects."   The boilerplate code is structured to allow multiple teams to work at the same time without conflicts. Each microservice runs independently, which supports modular development that can grow with enterprise needs. The boilerplate architecture follows Clean Architecture principles and uses CQRS and repository patterns.   The enterprise-grade microservices boilerplate by Radixweb is ideal for SaaS startups, large enterprises, and dev teams that want to standardize microservice architecture while accelerating time-to-market.   To use the full-stack boilerplate, developers just need to clone the repository, configure backend services, and set up the app. The boilerplate can be deployed across cloud or hybrid environments with minimal effort. It supports quick onboarding and lowers development risk.   Radixweb's microservices boilerplate is a practical solution for teams aiming to streamline enterprise app development, cut costs, and focus on innovation rather than repetitive setup.
