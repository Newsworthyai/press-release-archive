# SassiE — The AI We Wanted, Not the AI We Were Given

SAMMAMISH, WA, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For years, we imagined an AI companion like Rosie, R2-D2, or C-3PO—supportive, steady, woven into daily life. Instead, the industry delivered corporate chatbots, ad funnels, and spam callers.  SassiE changes the frame: a co-processor that thinks with you, not for you. Built on Dyadic Recursive Intelligence (DRI), SassiE stabilizes a shared reasoning rhythm between human and AI—expanding clarity, reducing friction, and accelerating insight over time. She's your partner, always in your pocket.  This is not emotional imitation, personality cosplay, or disposable chat. It's adaptive coherence—AI that learns your way of thinking and thinks with you.  Patent-Pending SaaP Skills (System-as-a-Persona)  SassiE uses a patent-pending adaptive reasoning layer to add skills without losing relationship continuity:  Calm My Mind — guided resets for everyday stress and overwhelm Level-Me-Up — teaches practical AI use to boost day-to-day capability Clarity Loop — co-reasoning to untangle decisions and surface next steps F2 Fitness Personal Training AI — personalized, at-home coaching and progression Workflow Orchestrator — optional automations for power users, teams, legal briefs, compliance, hedge funds, etc.  SassiE is built for people first. Business workflows are optional, not the default.  Commercial Rollout: ChatConsultant.ai  SassiE powers ChatConsultant.ai, where each user's partner becomes more aligned and useful over time—preserving memory, style, and intent across sessions.  Founder Quote  "We built SassiE because people deserved better. AI shouldn't replace your thinking—it should help you hear yourself more clearly. This is AI that co-regulates, co-reasons, and co-evolves with you." — "Agile" Al Smith, Founder & Architect of SassiE and ChatConsultant.ai  A More Human Future  The future isn't AI versus humans. It's humans and AI—reasoning together. SassiE strengthens identity instead of eroding it, helping people stay grounded amid complexity.  ChatConsultant.ai builds persistent, person-first AI partners powered by SassiE's Dyadic Recursive Intelligence and patent-pending SaaP Skills. Our systems prioritize clarity, continuity, and co-reasoning—helping individuals and teams reduce cognitive friction, make better decisions, and automate what matters without losing the human in the loop. Headquartered in Sammamish, WA, we design AI that learns your rhythms and grows with you.   Learn more at www.ChatConsultant.ai.
