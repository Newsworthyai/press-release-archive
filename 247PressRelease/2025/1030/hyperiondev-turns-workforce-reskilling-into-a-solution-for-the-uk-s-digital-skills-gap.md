# HyperionDev turns workforce reskilling into a solution for the UK's digital skills gap

LONDON, ENGLAND, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As UK employers continue to face record digital talent shortages with 76% of engineering firms reporting difficulty hiring. Global tech education provider HyperionDev is spotlighting how accessible, mentored bootcamps are helping professionals retrain for in-demand roles.   The company's career-focused bootcamps in coding, data, and cybersecurity offer an accelerated path for people seeking to pivot into tech. These intensive, mentor-led programmes deliver proven results: 88% of graduates secure a tech role within six months, and participants report a 178% median salary increase after completion.  "For professionals facing redundancy or automation, upskilling in technology is no longer optional, it's the most reliable way to stay employable in a shifting economy," says Riaz Moola, CEO of HyperionDev. "Our bootcamps are designed to prepare learners for real-world tech roles in record time, with verified outcomes and human mentorship to keep them on track."  In 2024, 85.6% of HyperionDev graduates transitioned into full-time tech positions, while 60% secured titles such as software developer or engineer within months of finishing. Many now work at Google, Amazon, Deloitte, Vodafone, Barclays, and the NHS, demonstrating how accelerated, outcomes-verified learning can plug the UK's widening tech skills gap.  The company's one-to-one mentorship model pairs each learner with an industry professional who provides personalised code review and job-readiness guidance, an approach praised by both graduates and employers. 89% of students secured a tech interview within 20 weeks of starting their course.  Across the UK, graduates have used HyperionDev bootcamps to pivot careers entirely. Alice Howis, found her first software development job just months after finishing the Data Science Bootcamp while Georgia Edwards, a Hertfordshire-based worker in pharmaceutical manufacturing, leveraged the Cyber Security Bootcamp to move into a Software Engineer role.  These case studies demonstrate the growing role of short, outcomes-verified learning in tackling the UK's chronic digital skills shortage and the opportunity for career switchers to move into high-demand, well-paying roles.  "We're seeing professionals treat upskilling as a form of economic security. When you invest in new skills, you're investing in future employability, confidence, and independence," concluded Moola.  HyperionDev will continue to highlight graduate outcomes and employer partnerships through the end of 2025, emphasising how evidence-based, mentored learning is helping to build a more inclusive, tech-ready workforce.
