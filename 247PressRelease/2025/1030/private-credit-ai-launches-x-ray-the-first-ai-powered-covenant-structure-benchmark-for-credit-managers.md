# Private-Credit.ai Launches "X-Ray" — The First AI-Powered Covenant &amp; Structure Benchmark for Credit Managers

NEW YORK, NY, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Private-Credit.ai today announced the launch of X-Ray, an AI-driven analytics platform that enables private credit managers to quantify and benchmark the strength of their credit documentation — just as they measure leverage, yield, or returns.  "Private markets have long needed a transparent, data-driven way to evaluate documentation quality and covenant strength," said Joseph DiTomaso, Inventor of Private-Credit.ai. "With X-Ray, teams can now visualize documentation strength deal-by-deal, identify risks, and make faster, more confident investment decisions."  Built on Private-Credit.ai's proprietary Orion Engine, X-Ray uses natural language processing and structured scoring to evaluate key sections of credit agreements — including Maintenance Covenants, Debt Incurrence, Restricted Payments, and MFN Protections — generating a color-normalized heatmap that highlights strengths and vulnerabilities in real time.  X-Ray is part of a broader Private-Credit.ai suite that includes modules for Deal Execution Tracking, Compliance Monitoring, Shadow Ratings, and Portfolio Risk Visualization. Together, these tools help direct lenders, private credit funds, CLO managers, and institutional allocators transform document-heavy processes into data-driven insights.  Private-Credit.ai is actively expanding partnerships with global asset managers and service providers to integrate X-Ray into existing document and portfolio management workflows.  About Private-Credit.ai Private-Credit.ai was founded to help credit professionals make faster, smarter decisions. The company believes the future of private credit lies in combining domain expertise with advanced technology. Its mission is to enable investment professionals, allocators, and asset managers to scale with precision through AI-powered document parsing, credit risk scoring, and portfolio optimization. As private markets expand faster than traditional systems can support, Private-Credit.ai bridges the gap with rapid ingestion of complex deal materials, consistent underwriting logic, and powerful compliance monitoring. The platform helps clients transform static documents into dynamic insights. Private-Credit.ai works with direct lenders, private credit funds, BDCs, CLO managers, family offices, and institutional allocators. Founded by a former investment banker and fintech entrepreneur, the company combines deep industry knowledge with proven execution in AI-enabled software—built by practitioners, for practitioners.
