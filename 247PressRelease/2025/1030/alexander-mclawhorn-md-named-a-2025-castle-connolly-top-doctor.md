# Alexander McLawhorn, MD, Named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor

NEW YORK, NY, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alexander McLawhorn, MD, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, the first year he has received the esteemed Top Doctor designation. Only 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen each year as Castle Connolly Top Doctors for their specialties in their regions.  Dr. McLawhorn is an orthopedic surgeon and joint reconstruction specialist at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), a leading institution recognized nationally as a Gold Standard Top Hospital for hip and knee replacement surgery.  With offices and surgical facilities in both New York City and Stamford, Dr. McLawhorn provides specialized care to residents throughout the tri-state area. He is proud to serve the local communities in Greenwich, Fairfield County, and Southern Connecticut.  Dr. McLawhorn has particular expertise in direct anterior total hip replacement, including the integration of the bikini incision anterior approach with robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA), a technique that avoids cutting through major muscles.  "The bikini incision follows the natural inguinal skin crease, providing a cosmetically appealing, low-profile scar," he says. "This method is designed to facilitate faster functional recovery, reduce postoperative pain, and lower the risk of dislocation."  His expertise also includes robotic and computer-assisted hip replacement, hip resurfacing, partial knee replacement, minimally invasive total knee replacement, and rapid-recovery joint replacement. As one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, Dr. McLawhorn performs over 600 joint replacements and more than 400 robotic hip surgeries annually.  "When combined with robotic assistance, surgeons can achieve precise and accurate implant positioning and leg length restoration, optimizing hip biomechanics and joint stability," he says. "This precision lowers the risk of dislocation and leg length discrepancy â€” two of the most common concerns after hip replacement."  Dr. McLawhorn received his Doctor of Medicine from Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons. He completed his residency in orthopedic surgery and his fellowship in adult reconstruction and joint replacement at Hospital for Special Surgery.  In addition to his clinical practice, Dr. McLawhorn serves as an Assistant Professor in Orthopaedic Surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College and as the Director of Research and Innovation for Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement at HSS. He is board-certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications. Nominations are open to all board-certified MDs, DOs, and DPMs. The Castle Connolly team chooses honorees based on nominee criteria that includes their medical education, training, hospital appointments, and disciplinary histories.  Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected as a Castle Connolly Top Doctor.
