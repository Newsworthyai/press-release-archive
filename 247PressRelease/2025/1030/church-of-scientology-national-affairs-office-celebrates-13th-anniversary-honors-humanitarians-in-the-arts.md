# Church of Scientology National Affairs Office Celebrates 13th Anniversary, Honors Humanitarians in the Arts

WASHINGTON, DC, October 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Church of Scientology National Affairs Office commemorated their 13th Anniversary event at the historic Fraser Mansion, in Washington, DC, bringing the community together to honor individuals and groups for their humanitarian efforts to improve society through the arts.   Executive Director Beth Akiyama gave an overview of the National Affairs Office's work over the last year in the fields of the arts, human rights, disaster response, drug education, and the protection of religious freedom internationally. Following the overview, the Arts Humanitarian Awards were presented. The inspiration for the awards is a quote from humanitarian and Founder of Scientology L. Ron Hubbard, "A civilization is as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamed by artists."  The first award was for the First Friday: Dupont Circle Art Walk, which is organized and promoted by the Dupont Circle Business Improvement District (BID). Held every month, the Art Walk highlights Dupont Circle's art galleries, embassies and other organizations, opening up these hidden gems in Dupont Circle to the community free of charge. First Friday: Dupont Circle Art Walk allows artists to display their work in venues throughout the area, including the Fraser Mansion, which houses the Church of Scientology National Affairs Office.   The executive director of the Dupont Circle Business Improvement District (BID), William (Bill) McLeod, accepted the Arts Humanitarian Award from Reverend Susan Taylor of the Church of Scientology with whom he has worked for years on community projects. McLeod imparted why the Art Walk tradition began years ago. "Dupont Circle used to be a luxurious residential area," he explained. "As times changed, what became the thing to do in Dupont Circle was to have an art gallery." McLeod, who has worked to promote Dupont Circle for over 20 years, went on to say, "It's been a pleasure to work with the galleries and organizations and the Church of Scientology National Affairs Office for all of these years."  The next awardee was Dr. Kate Ndi, the founder and CEO of the Miss Africa USA pageant. Through Dr. Ndi's work, young African women living in the United States are empowered to become leaders, promoting their unique African cultures through their traditional dress and artistic performances. Participants are required to have a humanitarian platform such as human rights, disability rights, the arts, education or similar causes through which they strive to improve society and the world.   Dr. Ndi's dedication to humanity has empowered hundreds of African women throughout Miss Africa USA's 20-year history. In July, she led a delegation of Miss Africa USA finalists to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, where they represented six countries at the Youth for Human Rights International Summit, which is sponsored by the Church of Scientology International. Through participation in this and similar initiatives, Dr. Ndi fosters a deeper understanding of human rights in the young African leaders with whom she works.  Affectionately called "Lady Kate" before achieving her doctorate earlier this year and becoming "Dr. Kate," Ndi sets the example and pays it forward. When she accepted the award, Dr. Ndi graciously called Miss Africa USA's Honorary Queen Ambassador Porscha Taylor; Miss Africa USA Congeniality 2025 Atemkeng Tazi; and Miss Universe Eritrea Snit Tewoldemedhin to the join her. She thanked the Church of Scientology for the award, but stressed that it was also the pageant participants who earned the award, saying, "This award is about using the arts through fashion and cultural enrichment to impact humanity and make the world a better place."  The final award was a Lifetime Achievement Arts Humanitarian Award given to Chateau and John Gardecki, founders of the Washington International Piano Arts Council (WIPAC). It was 25 years ago that their love of classical piano music first lead them to inspire adult, nonprofessional pianists to enter their Washington International Piano Arts Council competition. The WIPAC competition fosters appreciation of classical music while acknowledging those who play simply for the love of music. The Gardecki's lightness of spirit and love for the arts is apparent throughout this popular annual competition.   Established in 2002, WIPAC has held 20 annual competitions for nonprofessional pianists who come to Washington, DC, from around the world to extend their artistry in stiff competition.   In accepting the award, Chateau thanked her board members and all who helped make WIPAC successful, saying, "I only have one message: Love only grows if you share it."   John Gardecki, a highly accomplished, top-level amateur pianist, graced the room with a moving performance of three classical piano pieces. Chateau thanked long-time champion of WIPAC, embassy liaison Rhoda Septilici, who first introduced WIPAC to the Church of Scientology National Affairs Office in 2013, and has remained a steadfast partner of WIPAC.   The event underscored the commitment of the Church of Scientology National Affairs Office to recognizing and supporting individuals who enrich society through their humanitarian efforts.  The Church of Scientology National Affairs Office represents the Church in the Nation's Capital and works with many organizations to improve human rights, criminal law reform, drug education, and religious freedom internationally.
