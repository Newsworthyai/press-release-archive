# Trollinger Law Announces Winners of Annual Hometown Heroes Awards

WALDORF, MD, July 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Trollinger Law LLC proudly continues its annual tradition of recognizing local first responders by announcing the recipients of its 2025 Hometown Heroes Awards.  Each year, the firm invites the public to nominate first responders who have made a meaningful impact on the lives of Marylanders through their professionalism and commitment to public safety.  "This year's honorees are an extraordinary group of first responders with diverse backgrounds in law enforcement throughout Southern Maryland," says firm founder Matt Trollinger. "Their dedication goes well beyond the traditional duties associated with police and sheriff roles. They are leaders, they are humble, and they are true champions for our community, creating a legacy of community involvement and positive change that will be felt for years to come."  The winners are:  - Retired Sgt. Gus Proctor – A Maryland native and retired sergeant with the Charles County Sheriff's Department, Gus Proctor is being recognized for his decades of service and continued dedication to the community. Over his 30-year law enforcement career, he held numerous roles before transitioning to his current position as a civilian community organizer for the sheriff's office. For the past 19 years, Proctor has led the Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics Maryland, helping to raise $1.1 million in support of the organization's athletes. He also serves on the boards of Spring Dell Center, Inc. and Sagepoint Senior Living Services, and partners with Lifestyles of Maryland, Inc. to coordinate an annual Easter Basket Giveaway, which has provided more than 3,000 baskets to children in need.  - Lt. Everett West – Lieutenant Everett West of the Maryland State Police is a United States Marine Corps veteran and the current commander of the La Plata Barrack. Lt. West has built his career on service, leadership, and integrity. He leads with a firm commitment to public safety while championing ethical leadership and community connection across Southern Maryland. Off duty, Lt. West is the visionary behind impactful outreach programs like the Kids and Cruisers Car Show, No Hunger November, and Shop With a Cop — initiatives that have united law enforcement, families, and local businesses to support children in need. A devoted husband of 19 years to Jaime, and a proud father to Jaelyn and Landon, Lt. West lives out the core values he expects from others. As he often says, 'Leadership isn't about authority—it's about responsibility.'  - Carl Schinner – Schinner has served nearly 40 years in law enforcement, beginning with the Greenbelt Police Department and later serving as Chief of Police for the La Plata Police Department from 2013 until his recent retirement. Under his leadership, the La Plata department earned national accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). He now serves in the 21st Century Policing Unit of the Prince George's County Police Department. Schinner is the driving force behind several community safety initiatives, including Operation Prevent Porch Piracy, the #9PM Routine, and the Prevent the Morning After impaired driving campaign. He is a strong advocate for inclusive policing, securing federal resources and training for autistic individuals and those with dementia and other cognitive conditions.  The winners are receiving recognition during halftime at DC United games this summer and on September 13 during Trollinger Law's First Responders Night at the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs game.  After a serious accident, an injury can leave you with ongoing medical expenses, unable to work, and worrying about your future. It's easy to feel overwhelmed in these situations, and the thought of hiring an attorney can be intimidating.
