LOS ANGELES, CA, July 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dusty Films LLC is thrilled to announce the appointment of Jihyun Lee as Lead Editor for the highly anticipated feature film "Connection", set to begin pre-production in Los Angeles on July 25th, 2025.  "Connection" is an original story that explores the vibrant intersection of music, culture, and digital identity. The film follows a Filipino musician who discovers an unauthorized copy of his song by a rival content creator, sparking a high-stakes, multilingual musical duel across social media platforms. This timely narrative will be brought to life by Dusty Films, a company founded by siblings Achim Mendoza and Jemima Marie Holt to champion underrepresented voices in independent filmmaking.  Jihyun Lee will be involved in the project from the earliest stages of development through final delivery, ensuring that the editorial vision and workflow are seamlessly integrated throughout the filmmaking process. Lee's role encompasses: Pre-Production: Collaborating with the director, producers, and cinematographer to shape story structure, plan shotlists, and design an efficient editorial pipeline.  Production: Serving as both On-Set Editor and DIT, Lee will provide real-time editorial feedback, assemble rough cuts, and ensure data integrity and creative continuity on location.  Post-Production: Leading the picture editorial process, integrating musical and rhythmic editing, overseeing multilingual subtitling, and coordinating with post-production teams for a polished final product.  "Jihyun's expertise in narrative structure, musical editing, and multilingual storytelling is the perfect match for 'Connection,'" said Achim Mendoza, CFO of Dusty Films. "Her involvement from script to screen will help us realize our vision of a film that is as technically innovative as it is emotionally resonant."  Dusty Films is dedicated to supporting filmmakers from underrepresented backgrounds, with a particular focus on guiding projects through the often challenging post-production phase. As highlighted in a recent Shoutout LA interview with Achim Mendoza, the company aims to provide sustainable pathways for independent filmmakers to complete and share their stories.  "Connection" will film in Los Angeles from August 2026, with post-production running through December 2027. The film will feature a dynamic blend of English, Tagalog, and other languages, reflecting the multicultural heart of its story.
