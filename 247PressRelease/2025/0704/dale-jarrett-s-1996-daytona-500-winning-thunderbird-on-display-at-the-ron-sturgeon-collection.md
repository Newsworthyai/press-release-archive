# Dale Jarrett's 1996 Daytona 500-Winning Thunderbird on Display at the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, July 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A true relic of NASCAR royalty has taken its place in the Ron Sturgeon Collection—the very 1996 Ford Thunderbird driven by Dale Jarrett to victory at the Daytona 500. Wearing battle scars from 200 grueling laps at the sport's most iconic venue, this car is more than a machine—it's a piece of motorsports history.  Son of the beloved champion and broadcaster "Gentleman" Ned Jarrett, Dale Jarrett rose through the ranks with grit, skill, and championship pedigree. His legendary 1993 Daytona 500 win was just the beginning of a Hall of Fame career that reached its pinnacle in 1999 when he captured the NASCAR Winston Cup Series title—making the Jarretts the second father-son duo to each become national champions.  At the 1996 Daytona 500, Jarrett rolled off from the fourth row and found himself battling legends like Dale Earnhardt, Terry Labonte, Sterling Marlin, and Jeff Gordon. The final sprint to the finish became a showdown between Earnhardt and Jarrett—dubbed "The Dale & Dale Show" by broadcasters. In a key moment of strategy, Jarrett's team opted for four fresh Goodyear tires while Earnhardt took only two, giving the #88 Thunderbird a critical grip advantage. Lap after lap, Jarrett defended the lead and ultimately captured his second Daytona 500 win in thrilling fashion.  Following the race, the car was sent directly to the Victory Lane exhibit in Daytona for a year, then displayed for over 15 years at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega. According to team owner Robert Yates, the car remains "untouched" since that win—complete with tire markings, bird strike damage on the front quarter, and grit-worn paint from hitting 190 mph on the high banks of Daytona.  "This isn't a replica or a tribute—it's the car that won Daytona," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's raw, real, and carries every inch of history it earned on the track."  From its preserved battle scars to its unmatched legacy, Dale Jarrett's 1996 Ford Thunderbird is more than a race car—it's a time capsule of NASCAR greatness.
