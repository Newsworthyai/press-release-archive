# Medsien Launches Fully Managed Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) Solution to Power the Next Generation of Primary Care

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Medsien, the leading provider of full-service Remote Care Management solutions, today announced the launch of its Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) program, a first-of-its-kind solution designed to help healthcare organizations adopt CMS's new care model, transform chronic care delivery and unlock sustainable growth.  Launched by CMS in 2025, APCM introduces a bold new direction for Medicare reimbursement, replacing rigid, time-based requirements with a streamlined, monthly per-patient payment model. With billing codes G0556, G0557 and G0558, providers can now stratify patients by risk and receive bundled payments for a broad range of services, including Chronic Care Management (CCM), Transitional Care Management (TCM), Primary Care Management (PCM), virtual visits, telehealth check-ins and remote evaluations. This shift rewards readiness and continuity of care over administrative time tracking, empowering practices to focus on what truly matters: their patients.  Medsien's APCM program brings this vision to life with a fast, scalable and future-ready solution that helps practices go live in just five days. Key features include:  • Turnkey implementation with no need for additional staff or complex onboarding • Seamless EHR integration for consistent, automated documentation • AI-driven workflows that streamline program operations and ensure compliance • Full-service delivery model from patient identification to ongoing, personalized outreach • Care delivery managed by Medsien's experienced team of dedicated care partners  "This program is more than a billing opportunity, it's a transformation in how care is delivered," said Hamed Ahmadi, Co-Founder and CEO of Medsien. "We've built APCM to help practices embrace relationship-based, proactive care with confidence and scalability."  Medsien's APCM solution reduces operational burden, ensures compliance and empowers healthcare organizations to thrive in today's value-based care landscape.
