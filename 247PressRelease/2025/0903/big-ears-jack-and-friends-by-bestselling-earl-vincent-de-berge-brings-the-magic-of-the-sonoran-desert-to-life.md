# Big Ears Jack And Friends By Bestselling Earl Vincent de Berge Brings The Magic Of The Sonoran Desert To Life

WILMINGTON, NC, September 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Earl Vincent de Berge's 'Big Ears Jack and Friends' is a bestselling YA book that has received a 5-star review from Readers Favorite. It is one of those rare books that transport young readers into the heart of a world seldom seen by most, where they will enjoy learning about the extraordinary animals and plants found in the Sonoran Desert.  Earl's adventures in Baja California ignited a lifelong passion for the Sonoran Desert's unique plants and animals, fueling his inspiration to create this enchanting collection of tales for young readers.  The main character in these delightful stories is Big Ears Jack: a very big jackrabbit with huge ears -- and magical powers to use for good! Jack is the king of desert kindness, a good friend to all desert critters.  Among Jack's friends readers will meet Nosey and Wag, mischievous coyote brothers; Blue Dasher, a racing dragonfly; the Kangaroo Rat Chorus; tree-lizard Boris; Giro the dust devil; Hawk Conchita and the red ants; Lady Treble Clef, a watchful cactus; Paulina, the puma poet; Diana the musical tarantula; Lady Chrona, a sea lion who dreams of flying; a scheming sea gull named Swindler; the beautiful bobcat Miss Mucha Purrs; Mr. Shellie the chatterbox tortoise; and Young Red Fox and his sweet love, the beautiful rabbit Adorna -- along with many others.  Reviewer Essien Asian said, "The author presents educational information in detail while using the dialogue between the characters to stimulate young readers' imaginations. The mix of strategically placed pictures, an engaging narrative style, and thought-provoking subplots regarding these animals ensures that young readers will learn vital lessons in diplomacy and survival from 'Big Ears Jack and Friends' while enjoying a captivating adventure.  In his review on Amazon Mark Winheld stated, "If you're up for more fantasy fun, you'll be tempted by chapter titles like 'Sheriff Diamondback and the Egg-Thieving Coyotes,' or 'Dianna the Musical Tarantula,' or 'Swindler (a thieving seagull) and Big Umpo the Sea Lion,' or 'Lady Treble Clef and Dust Devils Rescue a Javelina Family,' and many more."  An AWA reviewer said, "One of the book's greatest strengths is its world-building. De Berge weaves the flora and fauna of Baja California into the narrative, making the setting feel like a character itself. Talking cacti, dust devils playing tag, and wise desert tortoises enrich the stories, placing readers in an enchanting ecosystem where the line between reality and fantasy blurs.  "The themes of community, creativity, and environmental respect run throughout the collection. Young readers will enjoy the magical adventures and witty dialogue, while adults will appreciate the underlying messages about cooperation, individuality, and harmony with nature."  'Big Ears Jack and Friends' is available in print and ebook form on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Earl-Vincent-de-Berge/author/B09R6M1G4Y?.  De Berge is also the author of a dramatic and exciting travel memoir, 'A Finger Of Land On An Old Man's Hand'. In this book, readers are immersed with four explorers in a transformative journey through Baja California in 1962 and 1964, inspired by 'The Forgotten Peninsula' by Joseph Wood Krutch. The book received a 5-star review from ReaderViews, and another reviewer called the book, ". . . a beautifully written, fabulous tale of an incredibly brave and daring journey."
