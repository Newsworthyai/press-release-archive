LOS ANGELES, CA, September 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nocturnal Collective proudly announces two major international projects under the direction of acclaimed filmmaker Jiaxin Wang, affirming his role as one of the most versatile and visionary directors shaping contemporary independent cinema and music video art.  Wang will lead Riders, an ambitious feature documentary scheduled for production from February 1, 2027 to August 1, 2027, and Kidnap, a visually daring music video collaboration with rising Chinese rapper Yaka, currently in post-production. Together, these projects reflect both the socially urgent and stylistically innovative dimensions of Wang's directing career.  RIDERS – A Feature Documentary by Nocturnal Collective Tagline: They carry the city on two wheels—but who carries them? Riders follows the lives of e‑bike delivery workers in Brooklyn, New York and Chinese mega-cities, weaving parallel stories of resilience, risk, and survival. By immersing himself in the daily realities of these essential yet invisible workers, Wang leads a project that pushes audiences to confront the human cost of convenience in the on-demand economy.  "This is a story about movement, power, and survival on both sides of the globe," said Yinan Shi, representing Nocturnal Collective. "Jiaxin Wang is uniquely positioned to tell it with both urgency and beauty."  Distinguished Creative Team: Cinematography: Paul Song (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8615747/)  1st AD: Joy Wu (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13615975/)  Producer: Eddie Yukun Long (https://voyagela.com/interview/daily-inspiration-meet-eddie-yukun-long/)  Composer: Oscar Pan (zhioscarpan.com)  Targeting premiere at international film festivals and global distribution platforms, Riders is actively seeking support from Catapult Film Fund, Sundance Institute Documentary Fund, Ford Foundation's JustFilms, and CNEX Foundation.  KIDNAP – Music Video Collaboration with Yaka Directed by Wang from 2025–2026, Kidnap is a concept-driven, VFX-intensive music video for emerging rapper Yaka (Spotify profile). Blending noir-inspired surrealism with nonlinear storytelling, choreography, and cutting-edge visual effects, the video explores themes of obsession, memory, and emotional captivity.  Jiaxin Wang oversaw creative direction, visual worldbuilding, choreography integration, and post-production VFX oversight—ensuring conceptual cohesion from treatment to delivery. Currently in post-production, Kidnap is slated for submission to top music video and short-form festivals worldwide.
