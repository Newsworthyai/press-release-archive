# Racing Heritage Reborn: 1948 Maserati A6GCS Monofaro Re-Creation Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly welcomes a striking new addition to its collection of European racing legends: a 1948 Maserati A6GCS Monofaro Re-Creation, now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  This meticulously crafted tribute pays homage to one of Maserati's most celebrated post-war competition cars—the original A6GCS 2.0-liter sports racer introduced in 1947 under the guidance of Maserati's chief technical engineer Alberto Massimino and co-founder Ernesto Maserati.   Designed for Formula 2 competition, the A6GCS helped cement Maserati's racing legacy in the late 1940s and was famously driven by Juan Manuel Fangio at the 1949 Rome Grand Prix.  Approximately 15 examples of the original A6GCS Monofaro were built, and today they remain among the most coveted Maserati race cars. The "Monofaro" nickname—meaning "single headlight"—refers to the car's distinctive Fantuzzi-designed aluminum bodywork with its iconic grille-mounted light.  The re-creation on display was constructed in the 1980s by renowned Argentinian builder and former racing driver Nestor Salerno. It features a hand-built steel-tube frame cloaked in lightweight aluminum and fiberglass coachwork, precisely replicating the Monofaro's unmistakable silhouette.  Powering the car is a robust 4.0-liter Ford inline-six, breathing through triple Weber 45 DCOE carburetors and paired with a four-speed manual transmission—a fitting tribute to the car's high-performance roots. Additional features include 15-inch wire wheels, four-wheel hydraulic disc brakes, coil-over suspension, an aluminum fuel tank, and removable cycle-style fenders.  The minimalist interior features black-trimmed seating, exposed aluminum panels, red lap belts, and race-inspired details such as a polished shift knob and aluminum pedals. Underneath, a double-wishbone independent front suspension and solid rear axle maintain period-correct driving dynamics, ensuring the car delivers a raw, engaging experience.  While technically a re-creation, this Maserati A6GCS Monofaro is far more than a replica—it is a handcrafted celebration of an era when artistry and engineering were inseparable on the race track.  "Maserati's original Monofaro represents one of the purest expressions of post-war Italian racing design," said Ron Sturgeon, museum founder. "This faithful re-creation honors that spirit and allows visitors to experience the shape, sound, and presence of a legendary competition car that defined its time."  Visitors can now view this spectacular 1948 Maserati A6GCS Monofaro Re-Creation at the DFW Car & Toy Museum—part of a collection that spans more than 200 classic cars and 3,000 vintage toys in one of Fort Worth's most exciting cultural attractions.
