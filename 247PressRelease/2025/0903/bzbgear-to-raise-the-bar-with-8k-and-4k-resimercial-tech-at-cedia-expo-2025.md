# BZBGEAR to Raise the Bar with 8K and 4K Resimercial Tech at CEDIA Expo 2025

DENVER, CO, September 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BZBGEAR®, a global leader in Pro AV and Broadcasting solutions, is excited to be exhibiting for their first time at the nation's premier event for the resimercial market. Just as BZBGEAR bridges the gap between Pro AV and Broadcasting, CEDIA Expo does the same with the residential and commercial industries.   CEDIA Expo 2025 is being held at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver, CO, from September 3 through September 6. Find BZBGEAR at their main exhibit in Booth C301. They will also have a presence at the 8K Association exhibit in Booth 4501. You can get free passes with code BZBGEAR25.  Education and conference sessions runs from Sept. 3–5, while the expo floor opens Sept. 4–6 for the actual show. This year's event is fully co located and promoted as CEDIA Expo/CIX (for the Commercial Integrator Expo)  The CEDIA Expo / Commercial Integrator Expo will underscore the merging of residential and commercial integration with more than half of attendees having dual market projects.  One of the big things to watch for this year is the prevalence of 8K resolution. 8K Ultra HD is no longer niche, it's becoming more accessible and garnering more attention. Expect demos featuring massive 8K video walls doubling as digital art canvases in luxury homes, retail, corporate, and educational settings. It's also gaining momentum in the gaming world and high-end competitions. Leading brands like BZBGEAR, who happens to be at the forefront as proud 8K Association members, will have their latest 8K solutions on display.  "Exhibiting at CEDIA Expo for the first time is a significant milestone for BZBGEAR," said Eugene Bocharov, CEO and President, BZBGEAR. "And with the rise of 8K technology transforming how we think about content delivery, we're proud to be spearheading that evolution."  Newly-rebranded BZBGEAR will be among 50 new exhibitors joining this year's show. You won't want to miss the market's first-ever 8K 16x16 matrix switcher: BG-8K-1616MA. This was recently recognized and awarded at InfoComm 2025. Another new 8K product is their 8K AV over IP multicast transceivers (BG-IPGEAR-XTREME series).  Their Swiss Army Knife of AV Distribution will be there: the 4K-VP and 4K-VPPRO series of UHD matrix switchers supporting video walls, multiview, and signal extension.  BZBGEAR will also have their latest 4K video streaming encoders/decoders (BG-STREAM series) and a new IP/Serial joystick controller in their highly-anticipated second generation Commander unit.  Lastly, fan-favorite ADAMO—aka The Most Awarded PTZ Camera in the Market—is making an appearance. This eight-time winner is getting a boost with a powerful 40x optical zoom lens.  Come celebrate BZBGEAR's new look and new gear at CEDIA Expo/CIX 2025 in Denver, CO, from Sept. 4–6. See them at their main Booth C301 as well as with 8K Association at Booth 4501.
