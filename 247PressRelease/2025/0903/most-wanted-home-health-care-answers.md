# Most Wanted Home Health Care Answers

MORRISTOWN, NJ, September 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Consumers with home care needs are concerned about affordability and require assistance understanding what benefits are available to them to under Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance plans, and grant subsidized programs based on inquires received by the Visiting Nurse Association of Northern NJ, via its vnannj.org/contact and 1-800-WE VISIT. VNANNJ, a regional provider of home-based care including skilled nursing visits, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, certified aides, elder care, family caregiver assistance, and hospice, serves more than 140 municipalities across Morris, Hunterdon, Sussex, Warren, Somerset, and Passaic Counties.   "Our organization serves as a safety net for those who aren't sure where to turn. We're able to reassure many by confirming their eligibility for home care and addressing other concerns," said Faith Scott, MPH, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Visiting Nurse Association of Northern NJ. "Often, we can expedite enrollment by coordinating with a physician or insurance provider or guiding someone through the application process for grant-funded services.   "As the sole designated administrator for the NJ Statewide Respite Care Program in Morris, Sussex, Somerset, and Passaic Counties and a participant in other government and private grant programs, VNANNJ is empowered to screen seniors and family caregivers and arrange for those who qualify to receive free or reduced-cost help with essential, non-medical tasks or caregiver respites, counseling, or training," Scott said.   Growing demand for home care Demand for home care, including the Visiting Nurse Association of Northern NJ's services, is escalating due to population, lifestyle, and health care industry trends as more seniors are aging in place and home care is increasingly prescribed for patients of all ages to shorten inpatient stays.   In fact, a survey released by AARP in December 2024 found that 75% of people over 50 want to remain in their current homes as they age. Other studies indicate that more than 70% of all seniors will require assistance with routine activities of daily living between age 65 and the end of life.   Home care costs and outcomes have also been the focus of research. In February 2024, an analysis of 14 studies published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health compared home health care and hospital care. The authors concluded that "evidence suggests home care interventions are likely to be cost saving and as effective as hospital care."  The Visiting Nurse Association of Northern NJ (VNA), vnannj.org, is a leading nonprofit provider of comprehensive home health care with a distinguished tradition of caring that began in Morristown in 1898. VNA services include skilled nursing; physical, occupational and speech therapy; hospice and palliative care; certified home health aides; caregiver respites, counseling, and training; and other home-based care solutions. VNA currently serves residents of more than 140 municipalities across six counties.
