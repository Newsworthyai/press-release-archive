# A Modern Legend with Historic DNA: 2017 Ford GT in Riviera Blue Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, July 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With Ferrari once in its crosshairs, Ford's original GT40 was born out of rivalry and raced its way into history with four straight wins at Le Mans from 1966 to 1969. Decades later, Ford reignited that legacy with the stunning revival of the Ford GT—culminating in a modern marvel now proudly showcased at the DFW Car & Toy Museum.  Finished in a rare, brilliant Riviera Blue from Ford's $30,000 Extended Color Palette 2 option, this 2017 Ford GT is believed to be the only example in existence with this color for the model year. It also carries a striking gloss carbon-fiber exterior package, valued at $15,000, adding even more aggression and elegance to an already breathtaking silhouette.  Under the hood lies a 647-horsepower, 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6—a technological leap from its V8 predecessors—capable of pushing the GT to 60 mph in under three seconds, with a top speed of 216 mph. Paired with a seven-speed Getrag dual-clutch transmission, the GT is a triumph of design and engineering, reflecting the insight of motorsport icon Carroll Shelby and the innovation of Ford's Performance division.  This GT is more than just fast. Inside, the Dark Energy-themed cockpit features a race-ready F1-style steering wheel, fixed Sparco carbon-fiber seats, and Ford's SYNC 3 infotainment system. Perhaps most notably, it is believed to be the only factory-delivered GT without the NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) panel over the rear bulkhead—revealing a stunning raw carbon-fiber finish and marking it as truly one-of-a-kind.  Assigned serial number H040 in homage to the legendary GT40, this car honors Ford's racing heritage while rewriting what a modern supercar can be.  This exceptional Ford GT is now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection—a museum where automotive passion and rare history meet.
