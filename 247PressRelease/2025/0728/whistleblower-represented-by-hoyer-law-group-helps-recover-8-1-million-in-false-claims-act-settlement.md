# Whistleblower Represented by Hoyer Law Group Helps Recover $8.1 Million in False Claims Act Settlement

TAMPA, FL, July 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hoyer Law Group, PLLC is honored to have represented Dr. Herbert Remidez, whose whistleblower case led to an $8.1 million settlement resolving allegations that federal pandemic relief funds were improperly used in violation of the False Claims Act. The Department of Justice announced the settlement on July 15, 2025, returning substantial taxpayer funds to the U.S. Treasury.  The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleged that certifications submitted under the Treasury Department's Payroll Support Program (PSP) were inaccurate and failed to disclose known breaches. The PSP was established under the CARES Act to provide critical financial relief to the airline industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to specific limitations and reporting obligations.  "This result reflects exactly what the False Claims Act was designed to achieve," said Dave Scher, a partner at Hoyer Law Group. "It is an honor and a privilege for our firm to represent Dr. Remidez. His commitment to integrity and accountability ensured that taxpayer dollars were protected. We are deeply grateful for the hard work and professionalism shown by the Department of Justice in achieving this resolution."  "I felt a responsibility to speak up when I realized what had happened," said Dr. Herbert Remidez. "I'm grateful to the Department of Justice for taking the matter seriously, and to my legal team at Hoyer Law Group for standing by me throughout this process."  The whistleblower complaint alleged that certain employees at the defendant company received compensation in excess of statutory limits under the PSP, and that the company continued certifying compliance after the breaches occurred. The settlement includes over $4 million in restitution, and the whistleblower will receive a statutory share of the recovery.  Hoyer Law Group expresses its appreciation to the DOJ's Civil Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia for their dedication and partnership. The case is captioned United States ex rel. H Remidez LLC v. Delta Air Lines Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01116.
