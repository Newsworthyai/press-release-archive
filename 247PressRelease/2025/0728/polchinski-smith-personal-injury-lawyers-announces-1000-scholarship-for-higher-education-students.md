OKLAHOMA CITY, OK, July 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Polchinski & Smith Personal Injury Lawyers announces the foundation of a $1,000 scholarship for law students committed to protecting the rights of injured people, the Commitment To Justice Scholarship. Polchinski & Smith are personal injury attorneys serving Oklahoma City and throughout Oklahoma.  As a firm founded on the principles of justice and giving voice to the unheard, Polchinski & Smith Personal Injury Lawyers is committed to giving back to the legal community. Firm co-founder Houston M. Smith, as a lifetime member of the Thurgood Marshall National Alumni Association, is especially passionate about encouraging younger people interested in becoming attorneys. We established our Commitment To Justice Scholarship to support the next generation of aspiring lawyers who share our values of compassion, integrity, and commitment to justice. This scholarship is open to students enrolled at an institute of higher learning or high school seniors who plan to attend secondary school.  The ideal applicant will have a demonstrated commitment to advocating for others who cannot advocate for themselves, whether as a volunteer in their community, in school, or a broader setting. We seek individuals with a keen sense of civic responsibility and a vision for making a positive impact in their chosen careers. While we give additional weight to applicants who are planning to earn their Juris Doctor and enter the field of personal injury law, we carefully consider the entirety of each applicant and their desire to support the rights of others.  Polchinski & Smith's Commitment to Justice Scholarship is valued at $1,000, intended to pay for tuition and academic fees. Applicants will submit a current resume and transcript, along with a 1,000-word essay answering three questions about their role in advocating for the interests of others and their active involvement in their communities. Deadlines, submission information, and additional details about the scholarship are available on the firm's website.  About Polchinski & Smith Personal Injury Lawyers  Polchinski & Smith Personal Injury Lawyers was founded in 2025 by Houston M. Smith and Andrew and Ryan Polchinski. The three decided to open their own firm after years of litigating personal injury claims for other law firms, with a distinct mission to give voice to people who are hurt and unable to achieve justice on their own. In the short time Polchinski & Smith has been in business, the firm has already developed a reputation in the OKC legal community as tenacious personal injury litigators.
