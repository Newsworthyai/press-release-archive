# California Couple Files Federal Complaint Against Hawaiian Prosecutor; Calls on Trump Administration to Back Law Criminalizing Prosecutorial Lies

WASHINGTON, DC, July 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christopher and Erin Mazzei, a California couple and small business owners, have filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) against Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Yates, accusing him of repeated prosecutorial misconduct in their federal PPP loan case. Their petition for clemency is now under review by Alice Marie Johnson, President Trump's official Pardon Czar and a leading advocate for justice reform.  The Mazzei's—first-time, non-violent defendants—were prosecuted for a PPP loan obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic and sentenced to prison after what they describe as a politically motivated campaign to "make an example" of them. The complaint outlines a pattern of unethical conduct that included:  • Knowingly false statements in court and filings, including a fabricated claim that the Mazzei's used PPP funds to purchase a billboard to get Dewayne "The Rock" Johnson attention. • Suppression of exculpatory evidence, including written guidance from a loan originator that directly contradicted the government's narrative. • Asset seizures nearly a year before any indictment, violating DOJ policies on due process. • Orchestration of the foreclosure of the Mazzei's family home of 10 years, followed by federal agents bidding on the property using the same funds the Mazzei's had already repaid. • Coercive plea deal tactics, including threats to indict an elderly family member unless the couple accepted a plea that also barred them from seeking a reduced sentence.  "This isn't just about us—it's about a system where prosecutors can lie, cheat, and abuse their power without consequences," said Mazzei. "The truth was buried so they could build a narrative and destroy our family in the process."  A Growing National Crisis The Mazzei's case is far from unique. Prosecutorial misconduct has been documented in thousands of federal cases across the country, yet almost no federal prosecutor has ever been criminally charged for it. One of the most high-profile recent examples is the Trevor Milton case, in which the former Nikola CEO was convicted based on evidence that key testimony was potentially false and critical facts were misrepresented. Despite major credibility issues in the government's case, no accountability has followed for the prosecution's conduct.  The Innocence Project data and numerous legal reviews have shown that prosecutorial misconduct—especially the withholding of exculpatory evidence (Brady violations)—has played a role in a majority of overturned wrongful convictions. Yet in most of these cases, the prosecutors responsible continue to work and try cases, facing no meaningful repercussions.  "If an average American lies to a federal agent, they can go to prison," said Mazzei. "But if a federal prosecutor lies to a judge, manipulates evidence, nothing happens. That is not justice."  The Call for Real Reform The Mazzei's are now calling on Congress to pass legislation that would make it a federal felony for prosecutors to knowingly lie in court or withhold exculpatory evidence—a move they say is essential to restoring public faith in the justice system.  Chris Mazzei has begun contacting members of Congress and is willing to testify publicly on the matter. The family is also receiving support from Roger Stone, who has called the case "an outrageous abuse of power" and publicly endorsed their clemency petition.  Most importantly, Alice Marie Johnson, President Trump's pardon Czar, is now personally reviewing the Mazzei clemency petition and the supporting evidence of misconduct.  "If President Trump wants to lead the next phase of criminal justice reform, this is how to do it," said Mazzei. "Don't just pardon the victims—start punishing the bad actors. Hold prosecutors to the same standards they hold every American to. That's the only way we restore integrity."  The Mazzei's full complaint, clemency petition, and supporting materials are available upon request. Their story has already attracted national attention and could become a flashpoint in the next wave of justice reform under the second Trump administration.
