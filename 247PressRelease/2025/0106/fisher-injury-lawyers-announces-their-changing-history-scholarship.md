# Fisher Injury Lawyers Announces Their Changing History Scholarship

BATON ROUGE, LA, January 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fisher Injury Lawyers' new Changing History Scholarship encourages students to think creatively about the events that have shaped our modern world. The team is offering $2,500 to a student in financial need who can thoughtfully create a 1,000 to 1,500-word essay detailing one event in world history they'd like to alter.  The change students propose making to history can be large or small, but it must be well-researched. Fisher Injury Lawyers want students to include citations and a bibliography in their scholarship essays. Students must also uphold formatting criteria outlined in the scholarship's terms and conditions.  Students should not use AI to generate their scholarship essays. The inappropriate use of AI will see a student's application removed from Fisher Injury Lawyers' applicant pool.  The scholarship selection committee will only consider scholarship applications that include all essential materials and meet the firm's expectations. Likewise, students must submit their applications to the firm by May 30, 2025, to be eligible for the Changing History Scholarship. Fisher Injury Lawyers will not consider applications submitted after the deadline passes.  Students can expect the firm to announce its winner one to three months after the scholarship deadline passes. The firm asks that neither students nor their parents reach out to firm representatives with questions about an application's status during this time. The team cannot answer questions about its Changing History Scholarship.  Fisher Injury Lawyers will celebrate the winning student's achievements in a blog post and press release before sending the winning funds to the student's college of choice.  The scholarship selection committee will choose its winner by comparing students' creativity, in-depth historical research, and essay presentation. Notably, Fisher Injury Lawyers will only contact its winning student when selecting the best scholarship essay.
