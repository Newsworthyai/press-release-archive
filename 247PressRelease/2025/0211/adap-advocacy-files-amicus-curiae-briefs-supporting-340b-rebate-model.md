# ADAP Advocacy Files Amicus Curiae Briefs Supporting 340B Rebate Model

WASHINGTON, DC, February 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today announced it has filed two amicus curiae briefs in support drug manufacturers motion for summary judgement against the Health Resources Services Administration, arguing the program is failing patients. Both briefs, which were filed jointly with CF United, outline how the program has grown, the level of chief executive compensation (which often has increased, quite dramatically), and the level of charity care (which fails, rather consistently, to correspond in any meaningful way to the explosive program expansion).  Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, summarized: "The 340B Program has become a cash cow for the program's Covered Entities, with too many big hospital systems and mega services providers abusing it. Patients are being left behind, evidenced by data estimates showing that people in the United States owe at least $220 billion in medical debt. We support a robust 340B Program, but one that puts the patients ahead of the providers."  William Sarraille, ADAP Advocacy's Special Counsel for 340B Issues, said: "All too often the patient gets lost in the 340B debate. It's how we know the 340B program has utterly lost its way. I was honored to represent ADAP Advocacy and CF United in their effort to honor the patient voice in the rebate model cases. The rebate model can and should be a mechanism to allow the patients, whose drug therapies generate billions and billions for covered entities, to know whether they are sharing in 340B pricing or are just being used for the profits they create. We can make 340B work for patients and still generate subsidies for covered entities. And the rebate model is the means to do exactly that."  Guy Anthony, Chair of the ADAP Advocacy 340B Patient Advisory Committee, added: "As someone deeply committed to health equity, I know firsthand how vital the 340B program is for people living with and affected by HIV. The amicus curiae filed today with support from ADAP Advocacy and CF United is a crucial step in protecting this program, which so many rely on. We must continue to fight for 340B reform and bring an end to this status quo because real lives depend on it."
