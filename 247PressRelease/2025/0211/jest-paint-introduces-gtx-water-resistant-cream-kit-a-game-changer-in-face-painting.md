# Jest Paint Introduces GTX Water Resistant Cream Kit â€“ A Game-Changer in Face Painting

PORTAGE, MI, February 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jest Paint is excited to launch the GTX Water Resistant Cream Kit on its website. This is the first ready-to-use, silicone-based face paint that requires no activator or airbrush. This innovative formula is designed for professional face painters and enthusiasts who need long-lasting, water-resistant paint that applies smoothly and stays vibrant.  Revolutionizing Face Painting  Unlike traditional alcohol-based formulas, GTX Cream Paint contains no alcohol, eliminating strong odors and irritation. It features an airless pump bottle, keeping the product fresh and free from contamination. The slow-drying formula allows seamless blending, making it perfect for one-stroke like designs, full-face artwork, and temporary tattoos.  This face paint is ideal for summer parties, festivals, and events where sweat, water, or friction could usually ruin designs. With GTX, artists can create stunning looks that last, even in humid conditions.  What's Included?  The GTX Water Resistant Cream Kit includes: 15 airless pump bottles with 15ml of GTX silicone-based cream paint. A glitter mixing palette for custom color blends. A 36-month shelf life for long-term use. 15 vibrant colors, including True Black, Rodeo Red, Blue Bonnet, Corn Bread Yellow, Plum Pie, and more.  How to Use GTX Cream Paint  Simply pump small paint dots onto a palette, load a dry brush, and apply directly to the skin. For one-stroke like designs, place colors side by side and swipe the brush through them. The paint dries slowly, allowing for extended blending and reloading time. GTX paints also work well through glitter tattoo adhesive stencils for designs that can last for days with proper care.  Easy Removal & Cleanup  For skin: Use an oil-based cleanser, micellar water, or natural oils like coconut or olive oil. For brushes: Clean them with alcohol between uses and let them dry completely. Designed by Artists for Artists  GTX is a family-run company in Texas. It was founded by Amber Massa, who was inspired by her daughter's love of face painting. Amber, who also develops permanent makeup inks, collaborated with artists worldwide to create this proprietary formula. GTX products are MOCRA-registered in the USA and use FDA-compliant pigments.
