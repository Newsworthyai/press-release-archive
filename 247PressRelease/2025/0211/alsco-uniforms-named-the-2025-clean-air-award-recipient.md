# Alsco Uniforms Named the 2025 Clean Air Award Recipient

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, February 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alsco Uniforms has been selected as the 2025 Clean Air Award recipient for their business practices that help to reduce air emissions, announced the Spokane Regional Clean Air Agency (Spokane Clean Air).  "We are thrilled to announce that our 21st annual Clean Air Award goes to Alsco Uniforms, in recognition of their exemplary work to reduce emissions at their Spokane facility and in our communities," stated April Westby, executive director at Spokane Clean Air.  Alsco Uniforms opened in Spokane in 1955, but the company's roots date back to 1889 as a small Nebraska towel delivery route. Today the company operates in over 200 locations worldwide, providing many products and services, including linens, uniforms, floor mats, washroom supplies, and more.  "Spokane Clean Air is recognizing Alsco Uniforms for the numerous measures they've taken to reduce energy consumption, which directly benefits the air we share," added Westby.  Their measures to improve energy efficiencies at their Spokane facility include:  • Upgrading its industrial dryers to reduce natural gas consumption  • Replacing outdated heating and cooling units with more energy-efficient models  • Implementing equipment maintenance practices to ensure peak efficiency  • Optimizing its delivery routes to maximize fuel efficiency  "Across our company, we are committed to pollution prevention and sustainable practices," said Joey Kink, general manager of Spokane's Alsco Uniforms facility. "We provide reusable products, which means less disposable waste. We choose our vendors carefully, for example, our table linens are made with American-produced fabric, with a 50-80% longer life cycle than imported linen. Our mat vendor recycles over 1.25 million pounds of mat rubber annually. We collaborate with laundry chemical suppliers to create eco-friendly formulas that are better for our environment. These are just a few examples of steps we take to be environmental stewards within the communities we serve."  Spokane Clean Air will present the award at a ceremony on February 12.
