# Mainly Mozart All-Star Orchestra Festival Returns to San Diego June 18–28, 2025

SAN DIEDO, CA, February 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Mainly Mozart All-Star Orchestra Festival returns to San Diego June 18 to June 28, 2025. The annual summer festival is a highlight of the classical music calendar and the country's largest gathering of concertmasters and principal players from the nation's top orchestras. Under the baton of Maestro Michael Francis, who returns for his 11th year as Music Director and conductor, the 2025 festival features six, unique performances at two venues, The Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center and the UC San Diego Epstein Family Amphitheater. The festival, the largest Mozart celebration in North America, opens with a must-hear performance of Mozart's newly discovered Serenade in C Major.   "We are thrilled to announce the return of the All-Star Orchestra Festival, the largest Mozart festival in North America," Nancy Laturno, Founding CEO, Mainly Mozart. "To celebrate, we will open the festival with Mozart's newly discovered Serenade in C, written when he was just 10-13 years old. The remarkable discovery, made last September in a German library, has captivated Mozart fans worldwide. We're excited to give San Diegans the opportunity to experience a remarkable chapter of Mozart's early genius brought to life."  Beyond Mozart's work, and the reason for the "mainly" in Mainly Mozart, the orchestra performs pieces from other leading classical composers. This year's concerts include works by Strauss, Bach, Beethoven, Saint-Saëns, Mendelssohn and Vivaldi, among others.   "This year's program celebrates the virtuosity of our musicians and presents orchestral works on the grandest scale," said Maestro Michael Francis. "Audiences will experience some of Baroque's most virtuosic symphonies through the Brandenberg concertos, marvel in the expressive power of Beethoven's symphonic masterpieces, and enjoy an intimate chamber experience through the newly discovered Mozart Serenade in C and Ignaz von Seyfried's arrangement of Mozart's F Minor Fantasy. The tremendous talent of our orchestral and international soloists takes center stage during Saint-Saëns's Piano Concerto No. 2, Strauss's Duet Concertino, A Klezmer Concerto and Beethoven's Triple Concerto."  The All-Star Orchestra musicians represent top U.S and Canadian orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Atlanta Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Dallas Symphony, Toronto Symphony, San Francisco Symphony and The Philadelphia Orchestra. Last year's orchestra roster included musicians from 30 top orchestras. The full orchestra roster for 2025 will be released in May.   At The Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center in La Jolla, each concert will be preceded by new Mozart-themed pre-concert talks or mini-concerts at 6pm in The JAI, which will be included in the base ticket price. At the UC San Diego Epstein Family Amphitheater, attendees will now be able to bring in their own food and (non-alcoholic) beverages. Guests are also welcome to bring their own picnic spreads, with new grass-seating areas, and picnic music provided by Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra ensembles throughout the venue.   2025 Soloists Soloists for the 2025 festival include Clarinetist Boris Allakhverdyan and Bassoonist Whitney Crockett who will perform Richard Strauss's Duet Concertino on June 20.
