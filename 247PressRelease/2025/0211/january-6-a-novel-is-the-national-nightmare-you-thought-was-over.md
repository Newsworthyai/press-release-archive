# "January 6: A Novel" is the National Nightmare You Thought was Over

PORTLAND, OR, February 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "January 6: A Novel," Book 3 in The Anti-Hero Rebellions series, will be free in eBook on Thursday, Feb. 13 on Amazon. https://rebrand.ly/odddpev  While works of fiction, the series by veteran D.C. journalist Norman Brewer captures story lines that could jump out of today's partisan politics.  In "January 6: A Novel," Democracy comes under siege when the President's rally morphs into a mob and storms the Capitol.  Right-wing extremists take the House Speaker hostage, force a horrific standoff and unleash terrorism nationwide. Assassinations, bombings in malls and other attacks inflame civil unrest.  The President weighs declaring martial law to restore order – and justify refusing to leave office.  "Journalist/novelist Norm Brewer has masterfully combined both those skills in a cracklingly good narrative...," wrote Ron Cohen, former managing editor of UPI. "His terrorists might be fictional characters, but he has so skillfully woven them into the horrors of that day you will feel like you've known them all your life."   "January 6: A Novel" was a 2024 Readers' Favorite Award Finalist for political thrillers. Books in The Anti-Hero Rebellions series are Amazon bestsellers.  Book 1 is "Blending In: A Tale of Homegrown Terrorism." Casualties mount as two ruthless terrorists attack soft targets – a press conference in D.C., an iconic mall in the Heartland. Fear grips the nation. Other right-wing extremists join their horrific crusade. Can they be stopped?  Book 2 is "Killer Politics - A Satirical Tale of Homegrown Terrorism," with a Trump-like president inspiring a white supremacist to attack innocents in a treasonous bid to incite civil war. It can be read as a stand-alone book or a sequel to "Blending In."  Brewer worked for The Des Moines Register and Tribune and for Gannett News Service in Washington, D.C., covering Congress, the White House, and pursuing award-winning investigations. He was also Director of Employee Communications at the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. He can be reached at bbyb1@outlook.com.
