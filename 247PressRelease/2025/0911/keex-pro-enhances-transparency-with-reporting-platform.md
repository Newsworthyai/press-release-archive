# KEEX Pro Enhances Transparency with Reporting Platform

HOUSTON, TX, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ --   Real-Time Market Data Access KEEX Pro has introduced a Transparency Reporting Platform, a comprehensive solution that offers users, regulators, and industry partners direct access to live platform data. The service includes real-time trading volume, liquidity depth, and slippage statistics. By making this data accessible in a standardized format, KEEX Pro enables market participants to track performance consistently and objectively.  Fee Schedules and Methodology Notes The platform also features a complete fee schedule with detailed methodology notes explaining how trading fees, funding rates, and borrowing costs are derived. This transparency ensures that users understand cost structures in advance, reducing uncertainty and preventing hidden charges. For institutional clients, it also serves as a reference point when comparing execution quality across venues.  Verified Proof-of-Reserves To strengthen accountability, KEEX Pro publishes independently verified proof-of-reserves audits through the platform. These audits confirm that all customer deposits are fully backed, combining on-chain verifications with custodial attestations. By offering this evidence publicly, KEEX Pro builds measurable trust while maintaining strict privacy safeguards for users.  Broader Industry Impact The introduction of this reporting platform is not limited to complianceâ€”it is also intended to set a new benchmark for industry transparency. With regulators worldwide increasing oversight on digital asset exchanges, KEEX Pro positions itself at the forefront by voluntarily disclosing metrics that most platforms keep private. This move underscores the company's belief that transparency is essential for sustainable growth and long-term adoption of digital assets.  Leadership Statement "Transparency builds confidence, and confidence drives long-term adoption," said Daniel Carter, Head of Compliance at KEEX Pro. "With this platform, we are giving our users clear visibility into fees, liquidity, and reserves, ensuring that they always trade with confidence and trust."  Commitment to Accountability By combining real-time market data, detailed cost structures, and verified reserves, KEEX Pro aims to create an ecosystem where information asymmetry is minimized.
