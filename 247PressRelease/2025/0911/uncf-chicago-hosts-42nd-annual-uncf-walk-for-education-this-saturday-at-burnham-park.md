# UNCF CHICAGO HOSTS 42ND ANNUAL UNCF WALK FOR EDUCATION THIS SATURDAY AT BURNHAM PARK

CHICAGO, IL, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On September 13, 2025, the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) will hold its 42nd Annual Chicago Walk for Education. The event kicks off at 9:00 a.m. at Burnham Park at 39th and South Dusable Lake Shore Drive.  "For every one kid we give a scholarship to, there are five more who need it," said Lisa Rollins, UNCF Development Director. "We know for a fact that the average $5000 scholarship can, for a first-generation college student, singularly change the life of their family. That's why events like this are so important."   The UNCF Walk for Education serves as UNCF's premier grassroots fundraising initiative, providing crucial support to the colleges, universities, and students it serves through the contributions of individuals, corporations, and various group donors. Event participants can register for a 5K walk/run or a 10K bike/skate on their own, join a team, or form their own team online at uncf.org/chicagowalk or on-site, starting at 7:00 am on race day. There will be plenty of music, dancing, food, and fun for the whole family.  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle will chair the Walk, which will be emceed by Omni Channel Radio Personality Davante "Stone Pony" Stone, along with media personalities Frankie Robinson and Tamera Fair. The 2025 Walk honors Grand Marshals, including Dr. Macquline King, Interim Superintendent/CEO of Chicago Public Schools; Reggie Summerise, President of the National Pan-Hellenic Council Chicago; Lady Vynessa Alexander of Top Ladies of Distinction, Inc.; Donavon Isaac "JukieThaKidd," DJ and community influencer; and media personality Frankie Robinson. The Chicago chapter of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, led by Reggie Summerise, is partnering to mobilize its Divine Nine organizations in support of scholarships and educational opportunities.  The UNCF's top priority is to increase the total number of underrepresented college graduates by focusing on activities that ensure more students are college-ready, enroll in college, and continue to graduation.
