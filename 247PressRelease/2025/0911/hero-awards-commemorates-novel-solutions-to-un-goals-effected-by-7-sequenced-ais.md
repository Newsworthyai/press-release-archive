# Hero Awards Commemorates Novel Solutions to UN Goals Effected by 7 Sequenced AIs

CAMBRIDGE, UK, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Hero Awards, which has recognized outstanding accomplishments in the pursuit of the UN's 17 Sustainability Goals since 2019, has announced a new program aimed at allowing citizen activists to achieve recognition for their efforts through following a unique, customized progression cycle of 7 popular and powerful AIs, according to CIO John Toomey.  "We noticed that there isn't a way for everyday 'heroes' to be recognized for devoted efforts towards planetary improvement" says Hero Awards Sustainability Director Amy Chang. "So we created a process, involving the most efficient ways of harnessing both AI and human intelligence, to evolve answers to the UN's 169 Targets within the 17 Agenda for Sustainability Goals."   This process takes advantage of the strong points each LLM model has, while drastically reducing hallucination. The result is a comprehensive, trustworthy, solidly grounded plan of action for achieving the given Target.  The sequence which has so far proven to elicit the most original, profound, and actionable solutions is this:  1. Meta.ai 2. Claude.ai 3. Copilot.microsoft.com 4. Gemini.google.com 5. Perplexity.ai 6. Deepseek.com 7. Chatgpt.com (v.5)  Turned into a viable prompt, every Target is given to each AI in turn, and the answer fed into the next one, until it has been strengthened and refined by all seven. Initial testing was performed by students from Cambridge, Yale, Berkeley, Princeton, Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford.   They were assisted by girls from the Herat Underground School in Afghanistan, founded to educate girls who are forbidden by the Taliban to attend formal school.  The project was co-created by Friends Beyond Borders, AI Happiness Accelerator, and the World Mind Network.  When someone follows the formula carefully, they will very likely win a Hero Award, as the probability is overwhelming that this much AI-assisted cogitation will unearth valuable new innovative answers.  Answers are archived on The Hero Awards' academia.edu site, so they can be studied indefinitely. Participants can address more than one UN Target, and multiple people can utilize the same Target, as the AIs (and their human partners) are almost endlessly creative in deriving new solutions.   Winners of the Hero Award are celebrated in the group's social media, blogs, websites, and in press releases. One privilege associated with earning the prize is that a winner can confer it upon others, provided they follow the protocol.  In initial experiments it has been discovered that as valuable as the multiple-AI derived results can be, far more important has been the advancement in cognitive skills experienced by participants who work with the 7 AIs this way. "Each AI has a different 'personality'; each has varied strengths and weaknesses. As users work the system, they improve the ability of each AI to respond, but they also improve their own problem-solving skills exponentially" says Hero Award Education Director Savithri Machiraju.  In a preliminary project which was a forerunner to this one, it was discovered that for every 100 run-throughs, 61 participants wrote a popular blog post, 39 published an article, 8 started an NGO or non-profit entity associated with the chosen Target, and 5 initiated a startup. Similar results are expected in the new venture.  "We see this as a way of democratizing efforts towards planetary preservation and human thriving", says Chang. "It does involve a bit of work, but it's fun work involving AIs that many people are familiar with. It has the potential to build a global mindset that shows that change is both possible and personally rewarding."
