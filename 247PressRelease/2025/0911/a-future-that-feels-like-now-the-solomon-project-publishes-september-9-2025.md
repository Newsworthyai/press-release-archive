# A Future That Feels Like Now: The Solomon Project Publishes September 9, 2025

PITTSBURGH, PA, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Solomon Project, a speculative thriller by Randy Swank, publishes today with a premise that echoes the world outside our windows: a powerful program called Nemo collides with an ancient artifact tied to the Tree of Knowledge, forcing humanity to wrestle with truth, justice, and the choices that shape our future.  "Would you heal the worldâ€¦ or judge it? Two brothers. One has a vision of hope. One a plan of judgment." That central dilemma drives the story of Adam, a brilliant programmer, and Jack, his foster brother. As Nemo's influence spreads and the mystery of an ancient box resurfaces, the brothers' opposing paths bring a global debate into sharp focus: control or compassion, punishment or repair, data or dignity.  Why it resonates now:  Set in a near-future that feels uncomfortably familiar, The Solomon Project explores disinformation, technological power, trauma, and accountability through psychological realism and big-idea stakes. Concepts like "Final Truth" and the artifact made from the Tree of Knowledge anchor the novel's moral and spiritual questions to concrete, plot-driven events.
