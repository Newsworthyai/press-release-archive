# So Square It's Cool: 1973 VW Type 181 "Thing" Adds Bold Attitude to the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With its unapologetically boxy silhouette and military roots, the 1973 Volkswagen Type 181—also affectionately known as "The Thing"—continues to capture imaginations decades after its production. Finished in brilliant orange and built on the rugged foundation of Beetle and Karmann Ghia components, this standout piece reflects the fun, freedom, and functionality that defined VW's most unconventional creation.  The Type 181 traces its origins to a military utility vehicle developed for the German Army in the late 1960s. Civilian production followed, and by 1972, U.S. customers could get their hands on this open-top oddity. Powered by VW's air-cooled 1,600cc flat-four engine and equipped with a four-speed manual transmission, the car delivers more than charm—it delivers an experience.  "Few cars have as much personality per square inch as the VW Thing," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's quirky, it's capable, and it's impossible not to smile when you see one drive by—especially in orange."  Though civilian sales in the U.S. ended in 1974 due to evolving safety standards, the Type 181 continued production internationally until 1983, with over 90,000 units produced in total. This example combines utilitarian simplicity with undeniable charisma, offering a smooth-shifting ride that can easily cruise above 60 mph—perfect for weekend drives and vacation escapes.  Displayed among more than 200 classic and collector vehicles, the VW Thing stands out not only for its distinct look, but for the joy it brings to drivers and spectators alike.
