# Zentral Launches First Mindfulness-Driven Productivity App for Focused Work

NEW YORK, NY, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Zentral, a new productivity platform, today announced the launch of its Chrome extension, marking the first tool to combine focus timers, task management, and distraction blocking with mindfulness practices such as guided breathwork, daily affirmations, and reflective journaling.  Built for freelancers, entrepreneurs, students, and professionals balancing multiple priorities, Zentral transforms the browser into a calm, intentional workspace that helps users focus deeply while reducing stress and avoiding burnout. Whether it's managing several projects, working with multiple clients, building a side business, or even planning a vacation, Zentral makes it easier to stay centered and productive.  "Most productivity apps push people to do more, faster," said Josh Gallup, Founder of Zentral. "We wanted to flip that script. Zentral helps people slow down, breathe, and set clear intentions before diving into their work. By weaving mindfulness into everyday tasks, we're making productivity more sustainable — and a lot healthier."  Key Features of Zentral: - Mindful Focus Sessions — Start each session with guided breathwork to reduce stress and sharpen focus. - Journaling & Reflection — Capture thoughts, track progress, and improve self-awareness with session prompts. - Lightweight To-Do & Project Management System — Stay on top of priorities without overwhelming complexity. - Website Blocker — Limit digital distractions to protect focus time. - Ambient Audio & Screen Tinting — Create a calming digital environment to support deep work. - Daily Streaks & Affirmations — Build lasting habits with momentum-boosting streaks and positive reinforcement.  With burnout and digital overload rising across the workforce, Zentral offers an alternative to traditional productivity tools that only measure output. Research shows mindfulness practices can improve focus by up to 16% and significantly lower stress levels — making Zentral's integration of breathwork and journaling a timely innovation for anyone striving to balance competing demands.
