# Immortalize Your Pet in a Stunning Work of Fused Glass Art

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CA, September 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For pet lovers, a beloved animal is never "just a pet." They are family, companions, and sources of unconditional love. Now, Ventura artist BJ Fitzgerald is giving owners a way to keep those memories alive forever—through one-of-a-kind fused glass portraits that capture not only a pet's likeness but their spirit.  Working out of the Glass Arts Collective, Fitzgerald transforms simple photographs into breathtaking works of art, layering shards of vibrant colored glass and kiln-firing them into detailed, lifelike portraits. Each piece is more than a picture—it's a tribute.  "When I work on a portrait, I'm not just trying to replicate an image," Fitzgerald explains. "I'm trying to tell the story of that pet—through their eyes, their markings, their expression—so that when someone looks at the piece, they feel their companion is still right there with them."  From Silk to Glass: An Artist's Journey  Fitzgerald's path to this unique medium is as colorful as her work. With a background in painting on silk and even beekeeping, she has always gravitated toward creative, hands-on pursuits. But it was in fused glass that she found her perfect canvas—one that allowed her to combine precision craftsmanship with deep emotional storytelling.  Her custom pet portraits are now sought after by clients across the region, many commissioning pieces as memorials or special gifts. "These aren't just art pieces; they're heirlooms," she says. "I want them to be something you'll cherish for decades."  A Process That's Both Artistic and Personal  The creation begins with a single photograph. From there, Fitzgerald studies the details that make each pet unique—the subtle tilt of the head, the particular shade of fur, the sparkle in their eyes. She then layers glass in a meticulous arrangement, using color and texture to recreate those defining features.  After the design is set, the work is fired in a kiln at high temperatures, fusing the individual pieces into one cohesive portrait. The result is a richly textured, light-catching work of art that feels alive from every angle.  A recent example, a calico cat portrait, radiates personality: soft caramel and chestnut tones ripple through the fur, delicate whiskers arc across the face, and piercing green eyes seem to follow the viewer around the room.  "I often see people tear up when they first view their portrait," Fitzgerald says. "It's not sadness—it's recognition. They see their friend looking back at them."  Personalization for a Deeper Connection  Fitzgerald offers multiple ways to personalize each piece, from engraved names and dates to subtle symbolic details woven into the glass itself. These touches turn the art into a story, making it an especially meaningful gift for pet owners.  Whether honoring a pet who has passed or celebrating one still bounding through life, her portraits become cherished mementos—capturing the essence of the animals who have captured our hearts.  Why Fused Glass?  Fused glass offers a durability and depth of color that few mediums can match. The vibrant hues never fade, and the tactile quality adds dimension, making the portrait as much a pleasure to touch as to see. "Glass has this magical way of playing with light," Fitzgerald explains. "It shifts with the time of day, so it feels dynamic—almost alive."  A Place to See the Magic  Fitzgerald can often be found at the Glass Arts Collective, working at her bench with sunlight streaming over an array of glass shards, each waiting to become part of someone's treasured keepsake. Visitors are welcome to stop by, see her process, and discuss commissioning their own portrait.  "When you love a pet, that bond doesn't fade," Fitzgerald reflects. "My goal is to honor that bond with something beautiful, tangible, and lasting—so their presence is always felt."
