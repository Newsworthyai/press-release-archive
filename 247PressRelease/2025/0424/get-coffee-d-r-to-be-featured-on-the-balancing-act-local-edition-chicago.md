# GET COFFEE'D® to Be Featured on The Balancing Act: Local Edition – Chicago

VELVA, ND, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Last weekend, The Balancing Act Local Edition: Chicago put the spotlight on a sweet little powerhouse from the Midwest: GET COFFEE'D®, the creators of the original caffeinated candy chew. The segment aired on WPWR-MyNetwork:  • Saturday, April 19 at 11:00 AM CT • Sunday, April 20 at 10:30 AM CT  The episode featured the Crew from GET COFFEE'D® and explored how these hard caramel candies deliver a "wide-awake, ray-of-sunshine" kind of energy, without the crash. Each candy is crafted in North Dakota using real cold brew coffee, hints of chocolate, vanilla, and caramel undertones, organic sweetened condensed milk, and L-theanine from green tea, offering 48mg of caffeine that kicks in fast (five times faster than your traditional beverage!).  Whether you're powering through meetings, road-tripping, or skipping the coffee shop line, GET COFFEE'D® makes energizing simple and seriously delicious.  "We're excited to share our story with The Balancing Act. We wanted to create something convenient, natural, and effective," said Tate Howe. "You shouldn't have to crash after your caffeine fix—or wait 30 minutes for it to kick in."  Whether you're heading to the gym, gearing up for work, or simply looking to ditch the caffeine jitters, GET COFFEE'D® offers a new way to energize your day.  Watch the full segment here: The Rise of Cold Brew-Infused Hard Chews - The Balancing Act and discover why more people are switching to GET COFFEE'D® to energize their day.

Sure, GET COFFEE'D makes caffeinated chews, but it also makes life a little better, both for the people who've discovered it and the people who make it.   Ten years ago, Tate stumbled upon the idea for a caffeinated chew in the most unexpected place. While navigating life's turbulence, the idea blossomed as he learned and grew in the grocery business, perfected the recipe, and led sales for the wildly successful Dot's Pretzels. After the Dot's acquisition, Tate knew the time (and place) was right for GET COFFEE'D to come to life.  It's what's on the inside that counts, and this couldn't be truer than with GET COFFEE'D and the team that makes it, with a full-circle journey back to Velva, ND to reassemble the Dot's team into a new Brew Chew Crew at the original Dot's facility. Waking up every day to work with great people to build a special company – that's transformational.  Following your dreams takes energy. GET COFFEE'D is here to help.
