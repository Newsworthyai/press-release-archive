# Acclaimed Production Designer Hojin Lee joins Largo Legend for Psychological Horror Feature "Answer the Question"

JACKSONVILLE, FL, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Answer the Question is a psychological horror story that follows four university students as they document their stay at a psychic's bed and breakfast, only to find themselves ensnared in a deadly supernatural game. The film's chilling narrative and period-inspired setting demand a production designer with a keen eye for atmospheric detail and narrative-driven environments—a role tailor-made for Ms. Lee.  A Distinctive Vision for Horror Ms. Lee brings an extensive background in horror and thriller genres, having designed over 20 short films and features, including the award-winning The Monkey's Paw, which earned Best Horror Film at the Follywood Film Festival. Her expertise in creating immersive, emotionally charged spaces will be central to Answer the Question's gothic, antique horror aesthetic, inspired by haunted New England inns and early 20th-century spiritualist movements.  Lee's responsibilities will include: •	Breaking down the script to identify all design needs, with a focus on supernatural and horror-based elements. •	Designing and sourcing set dressings and props, such as antique occult items and customized "game" props integral to the plot. •	Transforming a historic inn into a haunted bed-and-breakfast, complete with eerie textures, aged interiors, and atmospheric lighting. •	Collaborating closely with special effects and stunt departments to seamlessly integrate horror effects into the set. •	Maintaining continuity across evolving set environments as supernatural events escalate throughout the film.  Reflecting on her approach, Lee says: "This film lets me dive deep into one of my favorite genres—horror—while building an immersive world where fear is built through space and texture. I'm especially excited to bring the psychic's space to life as both a character and a trap within the story."
