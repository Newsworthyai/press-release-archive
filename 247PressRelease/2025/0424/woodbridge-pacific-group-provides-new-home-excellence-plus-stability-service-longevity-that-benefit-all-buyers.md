# Woodbridge Pacific Group Provides New Home Excellence Plus Stability, Service & Longevity That Benefit All Buyers

MISSION VIEJO, CA, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Peace of mind is as important as top value for many new-home shoppers. With Woodbridge Pacific Group, they secure both.  "We build high-quality homes in high-quality neighborhoods," said WPG President Todd Cunningham. "We also keep the process as smooth as possible and pay attention to variables our buyers need to address before they make the new-home investment."  Buying or Renting—Renting appears to require less of a commitment than buying but is not always easy. Rental markets continue to shrink in size and choice, especially in neighborhoods with lifestyle amenities, good schools and proximity to employment. And when you're renting, you can lose your place at any time.   Home ownership is an option with many positives, including a meaningful financial offset. You can also anticipate price appreciation over time, especially if you invest in comprehensive quality.   When you buy with Woodbridge Pacific Group, comprehensive quality is a given. It starts with distinctive designs.   Buyer-Centric Designs—Single professional Rahsaan Tilford chose Nova at University Park in Palm Desert. "I wanted to own a new home, and I wanted to get a place I could really love, as opposed to settling for just OK," said Rahsaan. "I liked this layout, and the size of my yard is just right—large enough to enjoy but not too big to manage. I finally found a place that I truly love."   Todd and Maria picked Nova before model homes were built, scouting their prospective builder by touring other WPG neighborhoods in the California desert. "We liked what we saw," said Maria. "We appreciated the designs and the quality they deliver, and both factors kept University Park at the top of our list.  "We found just what we were looking for when we reviewed these designs," Maria said. "Our floorplan is great, the architecture is modern and fresh, the location is exceptional—the vibe is super positive!"  Personalizing Choices—Most new WPG homes offer layout options, such as loft, den or home office in lieu of a bedroom; expanded kitchens with home centers and prep spaces; and laundry rooms with play and hobby spaces. Some design collections also feature ADU's, casitas and Multi-Gen suites among their optional layouts.   Working with WPG's professional design team, buyers can further personalize their new homes, choosing from an inviting array of features and finishes. These may include exterior materials, door styles, kitchen packages, bathroom finishes and lighting.   Close To Home Pleasures—In WPG neighborhoods, leisure fun is close at hand, thanks to nearby parks with play areas, tot lots, dog parks, basketball courts and expansive lawns. Many collections include private amenity centers.  At Bald Eagle Point in Boise's Treasure Valley, residents and guests can enjoy a pool, pickleball court, playground and fire pits at The Perch, a private oasis that is walkable from all Bald Eagle Point homes. "Our residents now have a pleasing place to relax and gather, a place that reflects WPG's commitment to inviting, high-quality neighborhoods," said WPG Vice President, Managing Director Jim Perry.   In WPG's walkable, charming village of Belcourt in Bakersfield, homeowners share the core destination of the Belcourt Center Club, which features a resort style pool and spa, a fitness center, multi-purpose and community rooms, billiards room and catering kitchen. This is the heart of Belcourt, for special events, workouts and simply relaxing with friends and neighbors.  University Park residents can tap The Grove, the master plan's amenity center. The Grove features a resort pool, a lap pool and a kiddie pool, plus gathering rooms, kitchen and an indoor fitness center. A shaded playground, pickleball court, a stage area, lawn areas for events and games, a firepit and a BBQ area add more enticing venues.  Customer Focus—WPG buyers can get help with the purchase process with U.S. Bank, the builder's preferred lender. Working with Jeff Weirsma and his team, buyers can count on expert help with financing, interest rate reductions and available incentives. Said Weirsma, "We help shoppers see whether new home purchase will work for them, whether they finance with U.S. Bank, or another lender."  Buyers who pick U.S. Bank are happy they did. "U.S. Bank was super helpful," said Nova buyer Rose Arguin. "They explained each step, told us what to do and what not to do, and all went as smooth as silk!"  "Rose and Dan clearly did their due diligence before buying with us, and we are delighted to have them at home in University Park," said Cunningham. "They add to the mix of singles, couples, families and empty nesters who have chosen a home at University Park—exactly what we hoped to see when we started these neighborhoods."  WPG buyers also have high praise for customer service. "Chad went the extra mile, always, and he contributed to the best buying experience I have ever had," Rahsaan said of Nova Sales Manager Chad Ross. "The customer service was spectacular through move-in and the few small fixes I needed. They said they would take care of everything within 30 days of closing—and actually did it!"  Visiting their build site during construction, Bald Eagle Point buyers Barbara and Bill McCain had high praise for WPG. "The site is super clean, which tells you there is pride in what they do," said Barbara. "Then we started meeting the people who work here, and we are truly impressed with WPG. The communication with our agent was steady and smooth, which was huge for me—with this company, someone actually calls back!"  Premium Locations—WPG builds in places people want to be. Convenient access to business and medical centers and recreational choices are hallmarks of WPG neighborhoods.   Signature destinations also include premium shopping districts, sports arenas and entertainment venues. Strong schools are a big plus for family households. Maturing buyers also check district rankings because they know that acclaimed schools boost property values.  Rahsaan's work center is convenient for him, and so is the University Park area. "You are close to a lot of amenities, lots of retail, places to eat, close to hiking trails and Joshua Tree—it's all easy from here," he says.   Maria and Todd enjoy the switch from California's Bay Area to Palm Desert. "We have a very walkable environment, a major selling point," said Maria. "This location will only get better as it matures and adds more retail, dining, and other leisure choices. It's terrific now, and after I retire, it will be a super place to stay engaged."  Settled in for more than a year, Dan and Rose appreciate their new friends and neighbors. "We love living here," said Rose simply. "We love the house, the area and our neighbors, and we will never move."  A Top Builder— WPG is a privately held developer/homebuilder with an excellent track record. The company has earned scores of prestigious honors for design and planning excellence, in regional and national competitions. See more at www.woodbridgepacific.com.
