# Norvell Jefferson publishes HIMSS25 trend report on AI, interoperability, and trust in healthcare

BOSTON, MA, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Norvell Jefferson's HIMSS25 Pulse of Industry Report highlights six major forces driving transformation in healthcare technology and communication. Based on on-site conversations, conference insights, and interviews with healthcare leaders, the report takes a close look at the shifting role of AI, the urgent need for interoperability, and how cybersecurity is becoming the bedrock of trust in digital care.  But it doesn't stop there—this report also speaks directly to healthcare marketers. It breaks down how these trends influence brand positioning, storytelling, and go-to-market strategies in an industry that's moving fast but still demands credibility and clarity.  Key insights from the report  AI that works behind the scenes: Ambient intelligence—AI that quietly listens, learns, and supports clinicians—is on the rise. Solutions like voice-enabled note-taking and real-time clinical support are no longer "nice to have" but part of the day-to-day workflow.  No interoperability, no AI: Without seamless data sharing, AI remains isolated. The report shows how standards like FHIR and TEFCA are helping connect systems, but fragmentation is still holding progress back.  Cybersecurity = trust: With AI tools processing sensitive patient data, trust is everything. Cybersecurity is no longer just an IT concern—it's a brand-level requirement and a make-or-break factor in adoption.  Care beyond the hospital: From remote monitoring to AI-powered virtual assistants, care is shifting away from hospitals and into homes and communities. This opens new messaging challenges—and opportunities—for brands trying to stay relevant.  Why marketing must evolve: Technical features aren't enough. Marketers must communicate value through outcomes, not buzzwords. Messaging needs to be simpler, more human, and focused on solving real problems for healthcare professionals and IT buyers.
