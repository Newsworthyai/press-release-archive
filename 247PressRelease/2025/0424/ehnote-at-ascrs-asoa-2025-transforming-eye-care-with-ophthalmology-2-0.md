# EHNOTE at ASCRS-ASOA 2025: Transforming Eye Care with Ophthalmology 2.0

LOS ANGELES, CA, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the ophthalmology community convenes at the 50th ASCRS Annual Meeting this week, a new chapter in eye care technology is unfolding. EHNOTE, the first platform built exclusively for ophthalmology practices and surgical centers, is exhibiting at Booth #1857, offering a glimpse of "Ophthalmology 2.0"—a unified system designed to replace fragmented software with one intelligent ecosystem.  What to Expect at Booth #1857   At ASCRS 2025, EHNOTE will provide live demonstrations of its fully integrated platform—encompassing Electronic Health Records (EHR), Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) software, Practice Management (PMS), and Billing. Attendees will have the opportunity to see how the platform brings together the clinical and operational sides of eye care into a seamless experience, eliminating silos and reducing friction in day-to-day workflows.   "Today's ophthalmology practices are being asked to do more with less—less time, less staff, and less margin for error," said the Product Leadership Team at EHNOTE. "Our platform was designed not only to meet the needs of today's eye care providers but to grow with them as those needs evolve."  A Solution Born from the Field   Unlike legacy systems that offer ophthalmology as one of many specialties, EHNOTE was developed from the ground up with direct input from ophthalmologists, surgeons, and administrators. Over half a decade of research and collaboration with stakeholders across the eye care ecosystem have resulted in a system that deeply understands the nuances of the field.   The result is a Most User-Friendly and Beautifully Designed, Single Platform Ever Built for Eye Care that enables end-to-end workflows—from clinic visits and surgical charting to billing and patient engagement—without the need for multiple vendors or complex integrations.   "Bringing EHNOTE into our clinic and ASC has allowed us to deliver truly seamless care" said Deepak Sobti, MD, Texas Eye and Cataract.* "From the moment a patient checks in to their post-op follow-up. It's a game-changer in integrating efficiency, accuracy, and excellence across all aspects of our practice."   EHNOTE will be at the ASCRS-ASOA 2025 Annual Meeting at booth #1857 during exhibit hours on April 25-28 in Los Angeles Convention Center, LA where the team will demo its latest solutions, including:   - EHR and ASC, Perfectly in Sync: allowing clinical, pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data to flow seamlessly  - Intelligent, visit-specific scheduling - providing convenience and control with reason-based appointment scheduling to providers s  - Built-in Billing - enabling auto-coding from clinical and surgical notes to ensure faster, cleaner claims  -Patient Engagement: Branded portals, self‑check‑in kiosks, and two‑way messaging that enhance patient experiences   For ophthalmologists, the promise is clear: more time for patient care, less time on clerical work, and a system that works as smart as they do.
