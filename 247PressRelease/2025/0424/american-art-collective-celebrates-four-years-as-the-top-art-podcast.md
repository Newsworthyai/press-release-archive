# American Art Collective Celebrates Four Years as the Top Art Podcast

SCOTTSDALE, AZ, April 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The American Art Collective, the leading art podcast in the country, celebrated its 325th episode on April 17, nearly four years to the day of launching the podcast and its first episode. When they initially started the podcast, producers Wendie Martin and Adolfo Castillo wanted a show that brought listeners into the art world—and not just into artists' studios, but also into collector's homes, museums, auction houses and galleries to tell a broader, more complete story about the art world.   Expert host Michael Clawson brings wit and charm to the show as he creates conversations that shed light on how art is made, sold, exhibited and collected from all corners of the American art market. Not only has he interviewed curators, art dealers and auction specialists, but he has also interviewed hundreds of artists who have shared with him their unique journeys that include trials and tribulations, but also soaring success.   The podcast has more than 200,000 downloads and more than 5,000 monthly listeners. Episodes release every other Tuesday. Guests have included celebrity master painters such as Brad Kunkle, Mark Maggiori, James Gurney, Sean Cheetham, Jeremy Mann, Logan Maxwell Hagege and Robert Lange to name just a few. Celebrity and special guests range from actor Willem Dafoe to curators at the Smithsonian to a special agent from the FBI's art crimes unit. American Art Collective already has a full slate of new guests for 2025.  In addition to the regular Tuesday episodes, the American Art Collective also releases two monthly First Look episodes devoted to the monthly issues of Western Art Collector and American Art Collector magazines. Both First Look episodes touch on a wide variety of topics related to American art, and they help guide listeners to art shows happening all around the country.  The podcast and the two magazine titles—as well as three other publications: American Fine Art Magazine, Native American Art and International Artist —are owned by parent company International Artist Publishing, based in Scottsdale, Arizona. You can find American Art Collective on Apple, Spotify, Audible and other major podcast services. The best way for listeners to stay in touch with the show and hear new episodes is to follow or subscribe, so new episodes are pushed to devices as they are released. The show is also on Instagram, @theamericanartcollective.
