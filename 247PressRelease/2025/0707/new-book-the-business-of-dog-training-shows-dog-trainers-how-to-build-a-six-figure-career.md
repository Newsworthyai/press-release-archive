HUNTSVILLE, AL, July 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After 17 years in the field and building his own six-figure dog training business from the ground up, Dale is sharing the strategies, tools, and lessons that helped him succeed—without the fluff or false promises. This book is a straightforward, real-world guide for aspiring and experienced dog trainers who want to make a full-time living doing what they love.

"They know how to train dogs, but no one ever taught them how to get clients, price their programs, or grow sustainably without burning out."  The Business of Dog Training covers key topics such as:  - How to price and sell high-ticket in-home training programs  - Marketing strategies that work in your local area  - Time and energy management for solo trainers  - Handling slow months, objections, and burnout  - Creating additional income streams beyond lessons  Unlike many generic business books, this one is written specifically for dog trainers who work in clients' homes, offering a practical blueprint they can apply immediately.  Whether you're just getting started or ready to scale, The Business of Dog Training delivers what you need to know—straightforward and without hype.  The book is now available at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGQ8CQPL  About the Author Dale Buchanan is a professional dog trainer at Top Gun Dog Training and business consultant with nearly two decades of experience in the pet industry. He operates a successful mobile dog training business in Huntsville, AL, and coaches other trainers across the country on how to grow profitable, sustainable businesses doing what they love.
