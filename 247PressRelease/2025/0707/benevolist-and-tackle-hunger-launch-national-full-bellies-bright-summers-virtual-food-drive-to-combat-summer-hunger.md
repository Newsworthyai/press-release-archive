# Benevolist and Tackle Hunger Launch National "Full Bellies, Bright Summers" Virtual Food Drive to Combat Summer Hunger

RALEIGH, NC, July 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With millions of children at risk of going hungry while school is out, Benevolist.org and Tackle Hunger are joining forces to launch a nationwide virtual food drive: Full Bellies, Bright Summers. The initiative kicks off on July 7th and runs through August 31st, inviting food pantries, businesses, congregations, and community groups across the U.S. to create virtual food drives to restock food pantry shelves.  The campaign offers an easy, high-impact way to tackle summer hunger through a customizable, pre-populated drive template hosted on Benevolist.org. Participants can set up and share their drive in just minutes—bringing critical food assistance to families in their own communities.  "Summer hunger is real. Families spend $300 more each month when school's out, straining food charities," said Alison Reese, Executive Director of Tackle Hunger. "This virtual fundraiser is a simple way to change the game and help feed more people."  At a time when so many children lose access to free or reduced-price meals provided during the school year, food pantries face increased demand with fewer resources. Full Bellies, Bright Summers helps fill the gap by empowering people everywhere to support hunger relief efforts—virtually and locally.  "This is about neighbors helping neighbors," said Cari Newton, CEO at Benevolist. "We've made it simple for anyone to step up, rally their networks, and provide essential items that pantries actually need—right when they need them most."  To start your virtual food drive today, visit www.benevolist.org.  About Benevolist  Benevolist.org is a no-cost online platform that simplifies item-based giving for nonprofit organizations.
