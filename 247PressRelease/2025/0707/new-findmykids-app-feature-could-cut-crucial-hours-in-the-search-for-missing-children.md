# New Findmykids App Feature Could Cut Crucial Hours in the Search for Missing Children

NEW YORK, NY, July 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Findmykids, a GPS-powered tracking app used by nearly a million families in the U.S. and U.K., has launched a new feature called "Help in finding children" to speed up local response in child disappearance cases.  The company designed this feature to build a crowdsourced safety network by alerting people when a child goes missing nearby. Opted-in users receive push notifications with the kid's photo, key identifying details, and the last known location. An interactive map in the app highlights the disappearance site with a special icon that users can tap for more information.  Findmykids distributes alerts based on geographic radius — limited to the city in densely populated areas, and expanded in rural regions to include neighboring towns and communities if necessary.   The team behind the app monitors reports from law enforcement and media daily to identify missing children and issue alerts. Parents can also report their missing child directly through the app. The team carefully reviews each submission, and if the information is accurate and complete, they publish the alert and add it to the system.   In 2023 alone, the U.S. saw over 375,000 missing child cases, FBI National Crime Information Center data shows. The more eyes on the ground, the greater the chance someone will spot the kid or notice a crucial detail — especially during the critical first three hours, when 74% of child abduction cases are decided, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.  While traditional tools remain important, Findmykids offers a complementary, faster-moving layer of defense, especially in the first chaotic hours when traditional systems are still spinning up.   "Missing child cases are a race against the clock," said Vadikh Giniatulin, СEO Letem, the company behind Findmykids app. "We're building a nationwide safety net — a connected community that can act within minutes, not hours. The more people in this network, the higher the chance someone will spot or know something about the missing child and can report it to the police — potentially preventing a tragedy."  The app has been steadily expanding its features since its 2016 launch. With this new addition, Findmykids hopes to transform passive bystanders into active allies when it matters most.  About Findmykids  Findmykids is a child safety app developed by LETEM LTD, based in Cyprus.
