# Innovative Law Professor Provides Exceptional Insights Regarding National Security Matters

AUBURN, AL, July 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to the Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA's) assessment of the global security environment, this year, more than in years past, the threat landscape is changing rapidly. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has recently issued one of its most serious public warnings to date, alerting Americans to a "heightened threat environment" following recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. And according to The Hill 82 percent of respondents said cyberterrorism was a critical threat, while 68 percent were concerned about domestic terrorism and 71 percent about international terrorism. Author and National Security Law Professor Scott Forehand addresses these issues and more in his latest edition of National Security Law- An Introduction Addressing Today's National Security Concerns and the legal issues surrounding this divisive issue. Written by a practitioner with more than 25 years of experience in the field and accessible to a non-legal audience, this book delivers a comprehensive and easy-to-follow legal and historical survey of the use of national security power by the United States government. It is an essential resource for government leaders, military officers, national security employees, policymakers, students, and concerned citizens. The book addresses some of the most controversial issues of our time, including immigration law, habeas corpus, posse comitatus, Alien Enemies Act, Insurrection Act, FISA surveillance, and much more.  "In the name of national security the United States has detained citizens indefinitely without trial, invaded countries, toppled regimes, conducted warrantless searches, collected data on millions of Americans who have been accused of no wrong, forcibly removed people of certain ethnicities from their homes, and kidnapped and tortured people. American citizens may naturally, and rightfully, wonder what rules are in place to protect themselves from the exercise of these vast and invasive powers," said Scott Forehand, Author and Law Professor. The "rules," so to speak, comprise what is generally known as national security law. This book surveys that body of law and history and equips the reader with a fundamental grasp of key concepts in national security law."  Mr. Forehand has personally utilized many of the powers discussed in his book, including the drafting and execution of search warrants, Title III wiretaps, national security letters, and FISA search and surveillance orders. He has utilized FISA-702 authorities, managed undercover operations, recruited and operated human informants, and conducted clandestine operational activity with the CIA and NSA. He served as Supervisor of the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Western New York, Assistant Division Counsel in the FBI Buffalo Field Office, and Firearms Instructor. Mr. Forehand earned awards and citations for conducting highly sensitive undercover and technical operations against foreign intelligence adversaries and international terrorist groups.  "National security by its nature is secretive, and rarely does the public get a glimpse into its workings," said Scott Forehand, Author and Law Professor. "A key goal of this book is to encourage the reader to grapple with the concept of national security visibility in a country that is supposed to be "of the people, by the people, for the people."
