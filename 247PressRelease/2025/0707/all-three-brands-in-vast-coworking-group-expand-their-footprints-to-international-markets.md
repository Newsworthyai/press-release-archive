# ALL THREE BRANDS IN VAST COWORKING GROUP EXPAND THEIR FOOTPRINTS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, July 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Vast Coworking Group™ (Vast), a global provider of innovative solutions in coworking and flexible workspaces, proudly announces a significant expansion of its international network by all three of its brands. Office Evolution® is launching operations abroad for the first time, starting with the opening of its first franchise in Canada and Master Licenses signed for Germany, Portugal, and South Africa. Sister brands Venture X® and Intelligent Office® already operate in international countries but have signed new Master Licenses for South Africa.  "We're excited to kick off international development for Office Evolution – this is a significant milestone and major leap forward for the brand," said Jason Anderson, President of Vast. "Building on the momentum we've seen with Venture X, we're confident these expansions will drive meaningful growth and strengthen our position as a leader in the global coworking industry. These new markets are ripe for expansion, and we're thrilled to partner with exceptional Master Franchisees who share our vision for shaping the future of work in their regions."  Office Evolution is opening its first international location in Canada this summer in the Massey Tower, located at 197 Yonge St. in the heart of downtown Toronto, Ontario. The location is owned by franchisee Mohammad Reza Sadeghian, who brings over 10 years of experience managing and directing supply chain and import-export trade in Toronto. Office Evolution was founded in 2003 and offers flexible workspace solutions close to home, and a thriving community where professionals, entrepreneurs, and small business owners can focus, collaborate, and grow.   The opening of Office Evolution Toronto will kick off a string of international development for the brand, with Master License agreements signed for: • Germany: Master Franchise Partner Bernd Harenkamp will oversee the development of Office Evolution in North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. A long-time entrepreneur, Harenkamp held a franchise license with Town & Country Haus, a German franchise concept specializing in residential home development, for 10 years. Prior to that, he held a franchise license with BNI (Business Network International) and grew a region in Germany from the ground up. Leveraging his dynamic experience in business management, franchising, and real estate, Harenkamp will recruit and support unit-level Office Evolution franchise owners in Germany. • Portugal: Building on Office Evolution's presence in Europe is Master Franchise Partner Debbie Hemmingsen, who will be establishing the brand's first Portugal location in Lisbon later this year. Hemmingsen has a lifetime of experience in franchising; growing up, her family owned a Dairy Queen restaurant and she herself owned three franchises with Cold Stone Creamery, four franchises with The Joint Chiropractic, as well as licenses for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. Hemmingsen relocated to Portugal last year and is now utilizing her franchising expertise to help local entrepreneurs launch their own Office Evolution locations. • South Africa: Spearheading the growth of Office Evolution in South Africa is local entrepreneur and Master Franchise Partner Cassim Khan. Khan is an award-winning multi-franchise owner of other flex spaces in South Africa, where he has a long history in the coworking and flexible office specialty. He will be opening the first Office Evolution in Johannesburg in July 2025 and another in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in November 2025.  In addition, VTX and Intelligent Office will also be growing in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Master Franchise Partner Daniel Halfpenny plans to open the first VTX in the country later this year in Umhlanga, near Durban. Since its founding in 2012, VTX has been offering beautiful, modern workspace solutions on flexible terms and now operates across 65+ locations worldwide. Intelligent Office launched in 1995 and was the first concept to commercialize the virtual office. The opening of Halfpenny's VTX in South Africa will mark the brand's entry into its seventh international country, eighth including the U.S. Halfpenny's development of Intelligent Office will mark the brand's entry in its second international country; it currently has over 50 throughout North America, including Canada.
