This milestone ensures that veterans in the region now have access to high-quality, non-invasive sleep solutions designed to improve their overall health and well-being.  Through partnerships with Sleep Impressions and Millennium Sleep Lab, both apZme companies serving as National Community Care Providers for the VA, Dr. VanDyke's practice will now offer alternative sleep apnea treatments to veterans who qualify for care through the VA Community Care Network. This program allows veterans to receive treatment from credentialed providers outside the VA system, ensuring they get the specialized care they need, closer to home.  With over 20 years of experience in dental sleep medicine, Sleep Impressions, and Millennium Sleep Lab are dedicated to providing innovative, patient-centered treatment options that address sleep apnea through comfortable, custom-fit oral appliances.
