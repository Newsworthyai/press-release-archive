# FUNDINGSTACK ACCELERATES FUNDRAISING WITH THE NEW "GET INTRO" FEATURE

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fundingstack.com, a specialized CRM solution for VCs, investment bankers and fundraising consultants, is excited to announce the launch of its brand new feature—"Get Intro". It is set to change the way VC firms connect with potential investors, as it bypasses the common problems of unsolicited LinkedIn outreach and cold emails.  Feature Highlights: How "Get Intro" Works Fundingstack's "Get Intro" makes identifying and connecting with potential investors much easier with the help of four new capabilities: 1. Smart Contact Integration: "Get Intro" can integrate with users' Google accounts and analyse all contacts, calendar entries, and email activity. This will help uncover potential connections within already existing networks. 2. LinkedIn Connection Mapping: "Get Intro" can scan 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree LinkedIn connections and provide users with a complete view of their extended professional network. 3. Optimized Pathway Discovery: "Get Intro" can identify the most effective pathways to target investors with the help of its sophisticated data analytics. This will reduce the time and effort needed for the fundraising process. 4. Tailored Introduction Messaging: "Get Intro" can offer personalized messaging templates. This will help warm introductions with both intermediaries and potential investors—and make conversions more likely.  VCs and LPs are more likely to give priority to people referred by someone they trust, while most cold emails are ignored. That is exactly why "Get Intro" is expected to translate into more pitch meetings, a more efficient fundraise, and an exponentially higher probability of raising capital.  Your Gateway to 227,000+ Global Investors The "Get Intro" feature is backed by Fundingstack's proprietary database of over 227,000 investors worldwide. It encompasses an array of venture capital funds, limited partners, angel investors, family offices, and more.   A vast dataset combined with new powerful features are expected to vastly improve the fundraising process for VC firms as well as investment bankers helping startup clients raise capital.  Executive Insights "Fundraising has traditionally been very labor-intensive for VC firms—and we hope to change that. That's why we are so proud to roll out "Get Intro". With this feature, we feel we will drastically improve the quality of investor interactions. This feature is all about personalization, efficiency, and ultimately, results." —Nathan Beckord, Fundingstack, CEO  Final Words Fundingstack's "Get Intro" will discover optimal connection pathways and help build personalized introductions. Venture capital professionals will now have one more powerful tool to build LP and other investor relationships more effectively, which will ultimately translate into more successful fundraising endeavors.
