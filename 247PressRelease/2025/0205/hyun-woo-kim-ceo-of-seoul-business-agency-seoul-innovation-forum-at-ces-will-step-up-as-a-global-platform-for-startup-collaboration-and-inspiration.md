# Hyun Woo Kim, CEO of Seoul Business Agency: "Seoul Innovation Forum at CES will Step Up as A Global Platform for Startup Collaboration and Inspiration"

SEOUL, KOREA, February 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Seoul Business Agency (SBA, CEO Hyun Woo Kim) successfully operated the Seoul Pavilion at CES 2025, held in Las Vegas, USA, from January 7 (Tuesday) to January 10 (Friday), local time.  Additionally, SBA organized the 'Seoul Innovation Forum,' bringing together startups from leading CES participant countries, including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. This forum, held on January 8 (Wednesday), the second day of CES, marked a groundbreaking initiative as a multi-national startup competition and collaboration platform within CES.  The key highlight of the Seoul Innovation Forum was an inter-country IR pitching competition. Each participating nation selected its most promising startups, which presented their pitches at both the forum's main stage and their respective national pavilions. A global panel of media judges then evaluated the pitches, awarding the Grand Winner title to E-Magy B.V. from the Netherlands. The First Runner-Up was BionicM from Japan, while South Korea's Apollon secured the Second Runner-Up position.  Following the pitching competition, a cross-border collaboration session featured discussions on startup support programs from each participating country. The session provided a valuable opportunity to share insights into startup incubation and growth strategies from some of the world's most advanced innovation ecosystems.  The Seoul Innovation Forum's participating institutions included Seoul Business Agency (South Korea), JETRO (Japan), Netherlands Enterprise Agency (Netherlands), SwissTech (Switzerland), and Taiwan Tech Arena (Taiwan).  During his address at the forum, Hyun Woo Kim, CEO of SBA, remarked, "CES has a long-standing history, but this is the first time we are witnessing a platform where different national organizations and startups come together for a competitive yet collaborative showcase evaluated by global media."  He further emphasized Korea's strong innovation ecosystem: "Korea is known for its vibrant startup culture, brimming with creativity and imagination. I am confident that all the startups participating in CES this year will achieve significant milestones."  Kim highlighted the forum's significance: "The Seoul Innovation Forum's role as a central hub for global startup collaboration is highly meaningful. This event serves as a bridge connecting startups across borders and as a platform for fostering inspiration, networking, and innovation."  Kim concluded with a strong commitment to continuity, saying, "Seoul Innovation Forum is no longer a one-time event. It has firmly established itself as a key CES-affiliated initiative for global startup networking and expansion. Even after CES, we will continue providing follow-up support to ensure sustained success for participating companies."
