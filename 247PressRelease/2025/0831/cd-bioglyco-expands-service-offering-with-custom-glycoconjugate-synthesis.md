# CD BioGlyco Expands Service Offering with Custom Glycoconjugate Synthesis

SHIRLEY, NY, August 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CD BioGlyco, a company focused on creating custom glycoconjugates, provides research teams with carbohydrate-based molecules that are frequently used in laboratory and biomedical experiments. Using the Glyco™ Synthesis Platform, glycans—either supplied by clients or made in-house—can be connected to proteins, lipids, or other carrier molecules. Each batch is carefully reviewed to confirm the structure and uniformity—though in many cases, small differences may appear, which is not unusual in lab work.  Custom Glycoconjugate Synthesis involves linking glycans—such as mono-, oligo-, or polysaccharides—to proteins, lipids, or other molecules.  In the lab, making these glycoconjugates usually involves a mix of chemical techniques, enzyme-driven steps, or sometimes both. For chemical approaches, labs often rely on activation and coupling methods, while enzyme-based methods tend to use glycosyltransferases or similar enzymes. Researchers can also ask for particular modifications or labels on the saccharides, protein, or lipid, depending on what their experiments require.  When used in experiments, these glycoconjugates let scientists observe how glycans affect cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses. They're also handy as reagents for preparing materials or studying molecular interactions involving glycans—and in many cases, they make experiments possible that would be hard to do with unmodified molecules.  "This service has slowly become a regular part of what we do in research," said Anna, a spokesperson for CD BioGlyco. "Well, in many labs, people use a mix of chemical and enzymatic methods. We check each batch several times to make sure it works as intended—and sometimes a few small adjustments are necessary. We really enjoy collaborating with academic teams, especially when it helps tackle new or unexpected research questions."  For labs interested in learning more about the system and its research applications, detailed information is available at:https://www.bioglyco.com/custom-glycoconjugate-synthesis.html  CD BioGlyco is a sub-brand of CD Bio Group.
