# IntegrateRNA Launches Custom Aminoacyl-tRNA In Vitro Synthesis Service to Support Protein Synthesis

NEW YORK, NY, August 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Creative Biogene's R&D focused business division, IntegrateRNA, which specializes in providing easy-to-use, superior products as well as high-quality novel services, today announced the launch of its Aminoacyl-tRNA In Vitro Synthesis Service. This service will help support and drive protein synthesis research by enabling the generation of customized aminoacylated tRNAs. The molecules are key to robust protein translation in in vitro systems, thus allowing for more accurate and scalable protein synthesis of non-canonical amino acid-containing proteins.  The technology is set to provide researchers with the tools they need to engineer proteins with improved functional characteristics and will find applications in synthetic biology, drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and more.  Technical Features and Innovations   The service works by taking advantage of a robust in vitro translation system to covalently link amino acids to transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This enzyme-based process, which is similar to that which happens inside living cells during translation, will enable the high-yield production of aminoacylated tRNAs. The technology will also support the inclusion of non-canonical or modified amino acids, enabling an expanded design space for researchers. This means that scientists can now design and produce custom proteins with enhanced stability, activity, or specificity, and have potential applications in developing new therapeutics or industrial enzymes.  Industries and Use Cases   Anticipated across pharma R&D, protein engineering, and novel biologics development, the use cases for this service include the ability to insert non-standard amino acids into proteins, which can help researchers create protein variants with unique properties that may not be possible through natural processes alone.  Marcia Brady, Head of Technology, Creative Biogene, stated: "Synthesizing proteins with non-canonical amino acids is a transformative development. It opens up new possibilities for designing proteins with specific properties and could significantly speed up the development of biotechnology."  Plans for the Future   In the future, IntegrateRNA plans to improve its Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis platform by enabling support for an even broader array of amino acid modifications and expanding production to an industrial scale. These advancements could have a major impact on synthetic biology and the development of therapeutic proteins, leading to the development of next-generation biopharmaceuticals and engineered enzymes.  About IntegrateRNA   IntegrateRNA is a division of Creative Biogene, and a trusted supplier of high-quality oligonucleotides and custom RNA synthesis services. Catering to academia, pharma, and biotech, the company is supporting research at the cutting edge of molecular biology and therapeutic development.
