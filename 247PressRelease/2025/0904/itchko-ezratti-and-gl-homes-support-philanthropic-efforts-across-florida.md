SUNRISE, FL, September 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Itchko Ezratti, founder of GL Homes, continues to redefine the meaning of net worth through impactful philanthropy across Florida.

From meal delivery initiatives to housing support and school-based programs, Itchko's efforts extend well beyond real estate to build a legacy of lasting community benefit.   Through its hunger relief programs, GL Homes Philanthropy partners with organizations across Florida to ensure that families have access to nutritious meals.

These resources help families transitioning from homelessness furnish their homes and create comfortable living environments, reflecting the company's belief that housing is the foundation for a better future.  GL Homes Philanthropy also invests in initiatives that support education and community enrichment across Florida. Programs such as Summer of Service engage employees and volunteers in hands-on projects that benefit local schools and neighborhoods, while Passion for Playgrounds creates safe, engaging spaces for children to play and connect.   Additional literacy and academic support programs help equip students with the tools they need to succeed, ensuring that the company's impact reaches future generations.  These efforts reflect Itchko Ezratti's belief that true net worth is measured not only by financial success but by the lives that are improved through philanthropic efforts. By aligning GL Homes' resources with meaningful causes, Ezratti has built a legacy that mirrors the company's commitment to quality and care.
