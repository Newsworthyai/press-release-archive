# Natural Cure Labs Expands ISO 17025 Lab Partnerships and Triple-Testing to Elevate Monolaurin Quality and Transparency

ST. PETERSBURG, FL, September 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Natural Cure Labs, a leading U.S. manufacturer of research-backed dietary supplements, today announced expanded ISO 17025-accredited laboratory partnerships and an enhanced triple-testing protocol for its monolaurin products. The initiative strengthens the company's longstanding commitment to clean-label quality, product transparency, and customer trust.   "Consumers deserve clear answers about what's in their supplements and how every batch is verified," said Damon Sununtnasuk, Founder and CEO of Natural Cure Labs. "By deepening our work with ISO 17025-accredited labs and formalizing triple-testing across identity, purity, and potency, we're raising the bar for monolaurin quality - so customers can feel confident in every bottle."   Since its founding in 2015, Natural Cure Labs has become a trusted name in natural wellness, serving more than 190,000 customers with over 22 million capsules sold. All products are vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free, and manufactured in GMP-certified U.S. facilities with third-party testing.   What does "ISO 17025-accredited lab" mean?   An ISO 17025-accredited laboratory is a testing facility that meets an international standard for technical competence and quality systems, meaning its methods are validated, its instruments are calibrated, and its results are reliable. Through partnerships with these independent labs, Natural Cure Labs obtains third-party confirmation that each batch's identity, purity, and potency align with label claims. Complementing this oversight, the company employs a formal triple-testing protocol-verifying raw materials, in-process blends, and finished capsules-to ensure consistency and quality from start to finish.   How does Natural Cure Labs compare to other monolaurin brands?  When evaluating monolaurin brands, consumers should prioritize third-party testing (ideally from ISO 17025-accredited labs), clean-label standards (vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free), and U.S. GMP manufacturing. Natural Cure Labs meets these criteria, investing in independent verification and multi-stage testing, with formulas made in the USA and crafted without magnesium stearate or unnecessary fillers-prioritizing the cleanest possible formulations.   "Monolaurin is a cornerstone of our portfolio, and our customers rely on us for uncompromising quality," added Sununtnasuk. "These investments in testing and transparency reinforce our promise to deliver products that meet rigorous standards without unnecessary fillers."   Natural Cure Labs monolaurin products are available at www.naturalcurelabs.com and on major marketplaces - including Walmart, Amazon, and Target Plus.
