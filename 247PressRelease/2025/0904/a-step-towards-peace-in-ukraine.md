# A STEP TOWARDS PEACE IN UKRAINE

ELIZABETH, NJ, September 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A STEP TOWARDS PEACE IN UKRAINE AND STRATEGIC STABILITY  THIS SHOULD BE PLAN B   Today, the American Party®—the only modern party—announced its plan to begin to resolve the Ukraine–Russia war. Innovative solutions are needed in an era when the U.N. Security Council cannot fulfill its core peacekeeping mission.   The Background  On September 12, 1938, Adolf Hitler addressed the closing of the NSDAP congress in Nuremberg. He said, in part: "Rather, I am simply demanding that the oppression of three and a half million Germans in Czechoslovakia cease and that the inalienable right to self-determination take its place." On October 1, 1938, Hitler annexed Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, home to a significant ethnic German population. The following year, the rest of Czechoslovakia was occupied and turned into a client state of Germany. Hitler's real motive for taking Czechoslovakia was Germany's need to augment its food production.  In 2014 and 2022, the world witnessed a replay of this event when Russia invaded Ukraine under the pretext of protecting Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. Investigations by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the OSCE, and independent human rights groups found no evidence of systematic persecution of Russian speakers.  Russian leadership has alternatively cited as a motive the Maidan Revolution of 2014 which ended the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych. In any event, the root cause of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict is that Russian leadership does not accept Ukrainian sovereignty.   The Legality Under International Law  Ukraine has been a fully recognized sovereign state since 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved. This is Ukraine's second attempt at sovereignty, as it existed as the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1921).  The 2014 Crimea annexation and the 2022 full-scale war are widely recognized by the United Nations, the International Court of Justice and most governments as serious breaches of international law. These need no reiteration here except to note that they include violations of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in which Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. promised to respect Ukraine's independence and existing borders in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal. Russia pledged not to use force or coercion against Ukraine, but has violated its commitments.  The Status   The war, on its present track, could continue indefinitely. A recent Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv killed 25 civilians and wounded another 48. Plan A of the Trump-Vance-Witkoff initiative has not worked. Plan A is to pursue diplomacy with Vladimir Putin's government while providing military aid and imposing direct and secondary sanctions. After six trips to Moscow by Steve Witkoff, and one summit in Alaska, Russia has not agreed to a ceasefire or to any process for negotiating an end to this war. Mr. Witkoff's assertions that "epic progress" was made during the summit appear too optimistic.  During the Alaska summit Putin made at least three demands: formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, commitments that Ukraine will not join NATO, and sovereignty over the entire Donbas region including territory that Russia does not currently control. All of these are non-starters with Ukraine.  The war remains stalemated on both the military and diplomatic fronts. The stakes are rising daily, and the conflict has already reached a stage where compromise appears extremely difficult. This week President Trump stated that he is giving Russia "a few more days" to agree to a meeting with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. We believe that a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting is very unlikely to lead to a ceasefire or peace process.   The "Plan B" Solution  A foundation must be laid upon which a durable peace agreement can be negotiated.  Phase 1  The U.S. Senate has a vital role in shaping U.S. foreign policy, and we believe it must be allowed to engage. To advance diplomacy, we urge the Trump-Vance administration to appoint a bipartisan Senate Select committee to negotiate with Ukrainian leaders, European partners, and a ministerial-level Russian delegation. We believe new interlocutors are needed on both sides. As members of the Senate's Ukraine Caucus, we believe that Senators Durbin, Murphy, Blumenthal, Wicker, Cramer and Johnson could be capable and willing selections.  This approach offers clear advantages. It empowers the Senate to maintain an oversight role that can continue for as long as needed. At the same time, it incorporates bipartisan perspectives while ensuring that President Trump retains the final authority in decision-making.  Phase 2(a)  This Senate Select committee would be empowered to engage with the G20 and other nations to build a consensus that the war must end. The war in Ukraine has become a defining international crisis, with consequences that extend far beyond the battlefield—reshaping global security, destabilizing energy and food markets, and testing the resilience of international law. Russia and Ukraine must be confronted by the collective voice of many nations urging peace.  Phase 2(b)  Russian leadership is attempting to compartmentalize the war, urging the U.S. to resume trade, diplomatic exchanges, arms control talks, and direct U.S.–Moscow flights while hostilities continue. The U.S. should not engage in such discussions. The U.S. National Defense Strategy and National Security Strategy explicitly name Russia as one of the top strategic competitors and adversaries to the U.S.   Phase 2(c)  Foreign nationals, including Russians and Chinese, are generally permitted to purchase U.S. residential and commercial property with full ownership rights. There is no blanket Federal restriction. That should change. The Senate Select committee, working with the House, would initiate appropriate legislative action concurrently with Phases 2(a) and 2(b).   Phase 3(a)  The Senate Select Committee, in cooperation with Ukrainian leadership, should work to initiate and deploy the European SkyShield Initiative beginning in western Ukraine. SkyShield is a European-led regional air and missile defense project with participation from about 24 nations. Its goal is to establish a ground-based, multi-layered, integrated air defense network to protect against drones and missiles. We believe Ukraine should be secured first in the western region, with expansion on a schedule to central and northern Ukraine. The objective is to provide security guarantees for most of the country while limiting the conflict to eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The risk of escalation is believed to be low, as SkyShield would involve only intercepting drones and missiles without engaging Russian aircraft. Russia has not flown its combat jets beyond the existing front lines since early 2022.  Phase 3(b)  Discussions with Russia continue as Phase 3(a) of the Sky Shield deployments moves forward. Much has been written about Europe's hesitation to provide air cover in Ukraine. Those concerns will not matter if the United States and its partners clearly state to Russia: "This is how it shall be: the SkyShield will be deployed starting in western Ukraine and then extended to northern and central Ukraine." At the same time the U.S. and partners must negotiate the cessation of drone and missile attacks beginning in Western Ukraine and then extending to Central and Northern Ukraine.  Russia repeatedly misrepresented its intentions in the period leading up to its full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Despite the Russian military build ups, Russian officials from November 2021 to February 2022 repeatedly denied that Russia had plans to invade Ukraine. When the invasion began, Russian President Vladimir Putin cited reasons like "denazification," protection from "genocide" in the Donbas region, and claims of NATO infrastructure building inside Ukraine. These claims have been thoroughly discredited. Russia should have no veto power over initiatives to end the war.  The Conclusion   The U.S. Government should continue discussions with Russia but designate a Senate Select Committee as the primary U.S. interlocutors. The U.S. should assist European nations in deploying the SkyShield commencing in Western Ukraine and extending on a schedule to Central and Northern Ukraine.  American Party® is a "clean-sheet" party created to solve problems pragmatically, free of ideological constraints. We do not use the words "liberal" or "conservative." We are a populist party, organized to serve all U.S. citizens and to support the rule of law under the U.S. Constitution, as amended.  Related Link: https://americanparty.mobi
