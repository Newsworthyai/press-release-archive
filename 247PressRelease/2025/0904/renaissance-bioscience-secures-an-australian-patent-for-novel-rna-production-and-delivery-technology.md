# Renaissance BioScience Secures An Australian Patent for Novel RNA Production and Delivery Technology

VANCOUVER, BC, September 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renaissance BioScience Corp. is pleased to announce that it has been granted another patent for its innovative yeast-based platform technology for the low-cost production and effective delivery of RNA. The new patent, awarded by the Australian patent office, is the second patent awarded for this RNA technology IP, with more jurisdictions pending. The first patent was awarded by China. This Australian patent joins the company's extensive IP portfolio of issued and pending patents for multiple end-use markets.   Renaissance's most commercially advanced application of its yeast-based RNA production and delivery system is a suite of RNAi-based biopesticide products designed for a precise, targeted approach to pest control. These RNAi-based biopesticides have an improved environmental safety profile compared to broad spectrum chemical pesticides but with similar cost structures when produced at scale. Importantly, this technology works seamlessly with existing farming practices and equipment.   As Australia is one of the world's most innovative and largest agricultural economies, the timing of this patent issuance corresponds well with Renaissance's current commercial agriculture application of this powerful technology.  In addition to use as a safe, effective and inexpensive insecticide for agriculture and other insect biocontrol uses, this RNA technology platform holds excellent potential in additional multi-billion-dollar market applications, particularly for animal health and human medicines.  Yeast-based platform technology addresses key challenges of RNA for broad industry uses  RNA is a powerful tool but has been restricted from use in many industrial applications due to a high cost of production and extreme fragility of the RNA molecules. The Renaissance RNA technology platform solves these problems and allows for significantly expanded use of RNA across multiple industries.  About Renaissance BioScience Corp. Based in Vancouver, Canada, Renaissance is a global leading yeast bioengineering company developing innovative, market-ready, functional microorganisms that provide cost-effective solutions to address a broad range of environmental, health and industrial challenges in agriculture, animal and human health, food and beverage, and energy.
