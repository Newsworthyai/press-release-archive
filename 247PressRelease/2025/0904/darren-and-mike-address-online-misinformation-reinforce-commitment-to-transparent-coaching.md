# Darren and Mike Address Online Misinformation, Reinforce Commitment to Transparent Coaching

VANCOUVER, BC, September 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Digital business coaches Darren and Mike have released a formal response to recent online criticism and misinformation. The duo, recognized for their Dream Team mentorship platform and longstanding success in the digital marketing space, is reaffirming their focus on education-first entrepreneurship and transparent coaching practices.  Operating in the network marketing and digital coaching industries often invites scrutiny, and Darren and Mike acknowledge that misinformation can quickly spread in online spaces. Their response is not intended to confront individual critics but to clarify the foundation of their work: providing individuals with a structured path toward building real, sustainable online businesses.  Through the Dream Team program, Darren and Mike have supported thousands of students from diverse backgrounds, many of whom had no prior experience in marketing or entrepreneurship. The program emphasizes skill development, strategic training, and long-term planning, all built around a values-driven community. Participants gain access to systems designed to create online income streams through content development, automation, and consistent business growth.  Independent media coverage has noted their distinct approach to mentorship. Features from respected outlets have highlighted their efforts to prioritize skill-building, integrity, and practical systems rather than short-term tactics commonly associated with traditional MLM models. Industry observers have positioned Mike and Darren as part of a broader shift toward a more ethical and sustainable style of digital business coaching.  In addition to mentorship, Darren and Mike have strengthened their commitment to transparency. Their platform includes accessible testimonials from program participants, public-facing training materials, and the upcoming release of a third-party impact report. This report is intended to validate the measurable outcomes of their coaching system and provide further clarity about its effectiveness.  The pair's work also extends beyond business training. Their recent initiatives include charitable contributions, such as a donation to the Enagic Foundation following the iReboot convention. That event, which focused on professional development, mindset, and marketing strategies, drew significant attendance and underscored their continued role as leaders in digital coaching.  Skepticism remains high, particularly in industries connected with network marketing. Mike and Darren's strategy for addressing this challenge emphasizes consistency, transparency, and evidence-based results. By combining mentorship, training, and community support, they continue to demonstrate a commitment to helping entrepreneurs pursue long-term business success built on clarity and accountability.
