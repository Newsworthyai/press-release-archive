In addition to the main competition, distributors have the chance to qualify for the Mower Family Elite Dinner Experience. This opportunity is open to those who purchase a Mower Mountain ticket and achieve 10,000+ Personal Sales Volume (PV) between the date of ticket purchase and May 1, 2026. The top 50 accounts meeting this threshold will receive an invitation for themselves and a guest to attend an exclusive dinner with the Mower family, Sisel executives, and a special guest speaker.  Winners of both the main competition and the Elite Dinner Experience will be announced on May 4, 2026, during the company's corporate call.
