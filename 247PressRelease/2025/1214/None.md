# The 9th Annual PenCraft Book Awards are proud to announce its top three winning books of 2025 and their talented authors

HOUSTON, TX, December 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 9th Annual PenCraft Book Awards are proud to announce its top three winning books of 2025, were: Glimmer of the Other: An Urban Fantasy Novel by Heather G. Harris, Winter's End by Barbara Pronin, and The Good Daughter Syndrome by Katherine Fabrizio.  Each year, the PenCraft Book Awards reviews over 1,000 entries to select what it considers the top three books from its submissions. This year, 2025, marked a historic milestone, as all three top positions were filled by exceptional women authors. In recognition of their outstanding achievements, each winning author is honored with a monetary award. In addition to the financial prize, they receive a formal certificate and commemorative gold seals to celebrate and acknowledge their significant literary win. Among them is Heather G. Harris, a top-100 Amazon best-selling fantasy author and the recipient of the prestigious Best Book of the Year award. Heather considers it both an honor and a privilege to work full-time as an author, a dream she has turned into a thriving career.  Heather's journey began as a student at a Liverpool university. During her time there, she not only pursued her studies but also took up skydiving—a thrilling hobby that ultimately led her to meet her future husband. Her vivid imagination fuels her storytelling, creating worlds filled with vampires, dragons, and heroines that embody strength and determination.  When Heather isn't immersed in her writing, she's kept busy by her three beautiful children, who add joy and excitement to her life. Even in her rare moments of spare time, her mind is constantly buzzing with ideas, often plotting her next book or dreaming up fantastical adventures. For Heather, writing isn't just a profession; it's a way of life that combines her passion for storytelling with the magic of everyday moments.  Our winner of the Best Nonfictional Book of the Year, Katherine Fabrizio, who isn't only a celebrated author but also a licensed psychotherapist with over three decades of clinical experience. When she's not crafting impactful, award-winning writing, she dedicates her professional career to a deeply personal mission: helping the daughters of narcissistic, borderline, and emotionally immature mothers. Her work focuses on guiding these women to finally break free from the deeply ingrained, lifelong patterns of guilt, persistent self-doubt, and complex emotional entanglement. These destructive cycles often leave them feeling stuck, perpetually unfulfilled, and unable to move forward in their own lives. Drawing from personal experience as both a daughter and the mother of two grown daughters, Katherine offers a unique perspective that blends psychological depth with practical, actionable clarity. Her work empowers women to stop living under the shadow of their mothers' expectations and emotional needs, rediscover their own identities, and embrace the freedom to live authentically.  PenCraft Book Awards' Best Fictional Book of the Year winner was Barbara Pronin's Winter's End. Barbara is a highly accomplished author whose work has earned praise from best-selling writers like Mary Higgins Clark, Tony Hillerman, and Faye Kellerman. Barbara Pronin has authored eight captivating mysteries, three of which were written under the pseudonym Barbara Nickolae. In addition to her writing career, she has led a fascinating and varied life, working as an actress, probation officer, journalist, and substitute teacher. These diverse experiences have undoubtedly enriched her storytelling.   Born in Brooklyn, Barbara earned degrees in communications and drama from California State College and pursued writing alongside her professional endeavors. Over the years, she penned six mysteries—three as Barbara Pronin and three as Barbara Nickolae (a collaboration with Nickolae Gerstner)—as well as two non-fiction books and hundreds of magazine articles. Her dedication to her craft is evident, as she is rarely found without a pen in hand. However, when she isn't writing—which isn't often—she's likely enjoying a book herself, working through the New York Times crossword puzzle in ink, or sitting at the piano, struggling to master a new piece. Her passion for creativity and determination to challenge herself are constants in her life, whether she's crafting compelling mysteries or attempting to perfect her musical skills.  The PenCraft Book Awards serve as a benchmark for recognizing and celebrating literary excellence. The rigorous judging process involves meticulously reviewing over 1,000 entries each year. This comprehensive evaluation aims to identify and honor the finest literary accomplishments across various genres, acknowledging the skill, creativity, and impact of the winning books and their talented authors. This year's awards were a milestone, showcasing the creative talent of three exceptional women authors who are shaping contemporary literature.  Winning a PenCraft award recognizes not just personal achievement but also a commitment to the craft that inspires the literary community. Each author's journey reflects a unique blend of passion and talent, making this a powerful celebration of their contributions.  PenCraft Book Award's mission is to inspire and entertain while giving every author a fair chance at recognition. With hundreds of nominated books, only the best receive the prestigious PenCraft Book Awards. As Editor-In-Chief David Hearne proudly states, "We believe that our PenCraft Book Awards help authors get their books noticed and sold. Our winning authors represent the absolute best in the industry. Our goal is to introduce to the world these talented authors and their extraordinary stories."  PenCraft Book Awards recognized the injustice of excluding authors based on their publisher or expensive entry fees. That's why we created PenCraft Book Awards that levels the playing field, allowing all authors to compete on an equal footing.  From its inception, the PenCraft Book Awards has supported authors worldwide and is committed to finding new methods to assist and to acknowledge their creative work.
