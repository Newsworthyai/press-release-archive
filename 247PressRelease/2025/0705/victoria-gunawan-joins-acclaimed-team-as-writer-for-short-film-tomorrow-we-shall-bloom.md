# Victoria Gunawan Joins Acclaimed Team as Writer for Short Film "Tomorrow, We Shall Bloom"

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Felisitas Stella is proud to announce that writer Victoria Gunawan has joined the creative team for the upcoming short film Tomorrow, We Shall Bloom, directed by the acclaimed Cedric Christophorus. The production, set to run from June 2025 through January 2026, promises to be a powerful and timely exploration of identity, faith, and community within the Indonesian queer diaspora in the United States.  Tomorrow, We Shall Bloom is a mixed media short documentary tracing the deeply personal and collective journey of a queer Indonesian filmmaker and his community as they navigate the complexities of religious shame, familial silence, and cultural narratives. Through a blend of voiceover, candid group conversations, archival footage, and innovative mixed media, the film charts a path from fear to freedom—illuminating stories too often left in the shadows.  Victoria Gunawan will oversee the story structure and all aspects of writing and development, ensuring the film's narrative is both authentic and resonant. Her responsibilities include:  Treatment Development: July 30 – August 18, 2025 First Draft: August 19 – October 24, 2025 Second Draft (with Producers): October 25 – December 23, 2025 Final Shooting Script: January 4 – January 28, 2026  Gunawan's collaboration with director Cedric Christophorus—a Chinese-Indonesian filmmaker based in Los Angeles whose work has been recognized by Academy Award®-qualifying festivals and the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences—marks an exciting chapter for both artists. Christophorus is known for his genre-bending approach to themes of race, gender, and immigration, and his recent accolades include a premiere at the 2025 National Film Festival for Talented Youth and a finalist spot for the 2025 Sundance Cultural Impact Residency.  Tomorrow, We Shall Bloom will target the international film festival circuit and seek distribution partners to amplify its urgent message.
