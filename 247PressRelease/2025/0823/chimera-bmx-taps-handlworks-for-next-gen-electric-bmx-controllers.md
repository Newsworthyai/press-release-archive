# Chimera BMX Taps Handlworks for Next-Gen Electric BMX Controllers

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Chimera BMX and Handlworks announce today that the two performance-obsessed Southern California brands are partnering in a move that combines OEM-level supply with a dominant vehicle platform.  Handlworks is an ebike speedshop providing a variety of performance enhancing components to ebike enthusiasts: customized controllers, batteries, and motors, supported by in-house engineering and dyno testing. Chimera BMX makes an electric BMX that weighs as little as 38lbs and yet rockets up to 40mph with 3HP at the wheel due in part to its proprietary High-Drive motorization system.  Under this partnership, Handlworks's production line will be used to build potted BAC855 controllers to Chimera's design specification. This promises to elevate the durability and long-term performance of the Chimera Electric BMX.  "For us it's a no-brainer," says Austin Duggan, Founder of Chimera BMX. "We've been tuning and wiring our own BAC855 controllers since we launched in 2022. We're good at it, and our customers are happy. But it's a ton of work. Plus the Handlworks team has developed a much more sophisticated way to test and tune. They iterated with us to perfect the controller alterations with excellent quality control throughout the process. It's ensuring us a better plug and play solution as we scale."  "We're following the natural evolution of businesses as they scale," says Harrison Lu, Founder of Handlworks. "As OEMs focus on expanding their business and developing their products, they need trusted industry partners to uphold their quality standards and design direction. We're happy to be a partner to a budding leader like Chimera, with so much room to grow in the high-performance segment."  Chimera began shipping its first Handlworks-equipped electric BMX bikes this week. "Our riders are excited for the team-up," says Duggan. "The ebike community is hungry for innovation, and it takes partnerships like this one to provide it."  Chimera BMX is a Los Angeles startup that hand assembles high performance throttle-on-demand electric bicycles featuring their proprietary "High Drive" powertrain.  Handlworks is an ebike speedshop that builds powertrain parts to provide freedom of customization to ebike owners.
