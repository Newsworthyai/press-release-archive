# THE WAY OF THE HOLY GRAIL ACHIEVES AN "EXCELLENT" RATING AND IS PREPARING FOR EUROPEAN CERTIFICATION

VALENCIA, SPAIN, August 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 'The International Association of the Cultural Itinerary of the Way of the Holy Grail in Europe'[1] has taken an historic step in its aspiration to obtain official recognition from the Council of Europe. Within the framework of the 2024-2025 certification cycle, the independent assessment report has awarded the highest possible grade, "excellent", to the candidacy of the Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, Way of Peace.  This achievement consolidates the route as a cultural, scientific and first-class touristic route in Europe and places it in a privileged position for the next certification of 2025-2026.  International recognition for a choral project The European report highlights that the candidacy stands out for its historical and cultural relevance, due to the strength of its international scientific committee and for its ability to link heritage, sustainable tourism and values of peace and intercultural dialogue.  Among the strong points pointed out by the evaluator, Dr. Isabelle Brianso, the relevance of the theme actually rescues an essential fragment of European memory. There is a quality of cooperation regarding the scientific and academic research on the Holy Chalice. Also, there is the enhancement of the tangible and intangible heritage linked to the route. This includes the creation of educational and cultural programmes aimed at young Europeans and the commitment to responsible tourism that revitalizes rural areas and urban areas too.  The impetus of the International Scientific Commission This success is the result of the work of the Scientific Commission for International Holy Grail Studies, composed of a multidisciplinary team that combines historical research, touristic innovation and cultural projection.  We highlight the work of Dr. Ana Mafé for her presence in Europe. García, the commission's president, is recognized as the leading world expert on the protohistory of the Holy Chalice that is preserved in Valencia Cathedral. Her more than twelve years of research have yielded both academic rigour and international recognition of the story of the Holy Grail. And also we refer to Dr. Fernando Molina Pons, an Intelligent Tourism specialist, who has linked this itinerary to the World Wide Web. Solidarity, Smart, Regenerative and Circular Routes [2] were presented on May 22, 2025 at the University Science Park from Valencia within the Innotransfer programme. Their work projects the route towards innovation and sustainability, connecting heritage with economic and social development.  From Valencia, Dr. Gabriel Songel González, director since 2022 of the Chair of Business Innovation, Design and Interculturality at the Universitat Politècnica de València, is a pioneer in studies on the Holy Chalice and its relationship with stonemasons' marks. Its academic research has given new international visibility to the relic and, in addition, personally received the evaluation in Valencia of the Council of Europe in October 2024, showing its support for this cultural itinerary.  A route with a universal vocation The Path of the Holy Grail, Path of Knowledge, Path of Peace is now an international reality. Born in 2022 from civil society in the province of Valencia, it has spread to France and Italy. It connects history, art, traditions, gastronomy and nature in a shared story that reflects the European values of peace, dialogue and cultural cooperation.  With the strength of a choral work, the route is prepared to reach official certification by the Council of Europe in 2026-2027, a recognition that will place it alongside other great routes such as the Camino de Santiago or the Via Francigena.  As stated by the President of the International Association, Dr. Ana Mafé García, "this excellent rating is the result of a collective effort that positions the Valencian Community as epicentre of a European cultural project with a universal vocation".  The International Association has the support of the Valencia Provincial Council for Tourism and the Government of Aragon to promote this route in Europe.
