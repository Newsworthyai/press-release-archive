BALTIMORE, MD, March 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For 24 straight hours from May 17 -18, 2025, The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre will hold Doomsday 2025, the fourth annual nonstop marathon livestreamed reading of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. This year's celebration also will include coordinated events in Ohio, and Tennessee, as well as Brazil, Italy, Scotland and England.  To raise money for Doomsday 2025, and to help fund The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre's award-winning Poe-themed radio dramas and stage productions, a donation page has been established at https://givebutter.com/xf5Qzi. Early supporters have already contributed to bring the event to life.  This year's Doomsday event is being held at Poe's Magic Theatre on the mezzanine level of The Lord Baltimore Hotel (20 W Baltimore St, Baltimore, MD 21201). Readers who have already committed to read Poe's works during Doomsday 2024 include Maryland State Delegates Luke Clippinger and Mark Edelson; Louis Joseph, Arts Council Director of The Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts; Janice Short, Coordinator of Theatre Arts at Morgan State University, and many more artists, writers and Poe enthusiasts.  For 2024, the Doomsday Poe celebration has gone international, spreading well beyond Baltimore. Participants from many other nations will be doing their own version of Doomsday this year, including the theatre groups Vigor Mortis in Curitiba, Brazil; Grand Guignol de Milan in Milan, Italy; Poetic Justice Productions in North Ayrshire, Scotland; and Threedumb Theatre in London, England. In the US, Poe fan groups will also participate, including Six Degrees of Poe in Tennessee and the Ohio Poe Facebook group in Ohio.  Meanwhile, back in Baltimore, the Doomsday 2025 reading will be free to all to view.  "We're pleased to support such an unusual and fun way to bring attention to Poe and Baltimore," said Vince Wilson, owner of Poe's Magic Theatre, a sponsor of the event.   "The Doomsday readathon has become a Baltimore tradition, and a creative way to emphasize the importance of literacy for people of all ages," Wilson added.   "It's hard to believe that something that started with eight readers in my basement in Baltimore City is now embraced globally, with works translated into languages spoken around the world," said Poe Theatre Founder and Artistic Director Alex Zavistovich. "We hope that Doomsday will grow into a thing of its own – an internationally recognized annual celebration of the works of Edgar Allan Poe."  Edgar Allan Poe worked in Baltimore for three years, during which time he authored some of his more notable stories, including "MS Found in a Bottle," "Berenice" and "Shadow – A Parable." His connection to Baltimore is much stronger than that, however, His wife, Virginia Clemm Poe, was born in Baltimore, and his grandfather, the renowned military leader David Poe, was a co-founder of Baltimore's historic First and Franklin Church. Edgar Allan Poe's body is buried on the grounds of Baltimore's Westminster Hall.  The National Edgar Allan Poe Theatre is the only company in the world dedicated to adapting the works of America's grandfather of horror and suspense onstage, on the air, and in the classroom. Throughout the pandemic, theatre produced monthly radio drama adaptations of Poe's stories. The award-winning programs are carried on Amazon Music and National Public Radio, among many other platforms. (https://www.poetheatre.org/poe-theatre-on-the-air)
