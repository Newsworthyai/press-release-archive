# Automotive Defense Specialists Announces New Content on Auto Repair Shop License Issues and Defense Attorney Support

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Automotive Defense Specialists, a California-based law firm servicing auto repair and SMOG businesses, is proud to announce new content. The threat of losing an ARD or Auto Repair Dealer license could be the loss of a business. The same goes for a SMOG license or STAR license. An auto repair shop defense attorney can help save one's license and stop a suspension, allowing a SMOG or auto repair business to continue to operate.  "When auto repair shops receive a citation or suspension letter, they are up against a mob of 'experts.' From the investigators to the documentation staff, a team is prepared to prove the auto shop is wrong," Stated William Ferreira, lead attorney at Automotive Defense Specialists. "The best way to defend a license against the Bureau of Auto Repair is for an auto shop to get their own legal team. We are ready to answer the call."  Here is background on this release. New content for managing an ARD license citation from the Bureau of Automotive Repair is available at https://automotivedefense.com/about/services/auto-shop-license/. Automotive Defense Specialists help defend auto repair shops and technicians from accusations and suspensions from the Bureau of Auto Repair. The defense attorney team provides support in Southern and Northern California. The law firm is led by William Ferreira, Esq. and is focused on auto repair and smog shops throughout California. The law firm manages STAR invalidations, SMOG check citations, interim suspension orders, ARD licensing issues, and criminal defense. The firm has managed over five hundred citations in the past eight years. Quite a few included using an undercover vehicle by the Bureau of Automotive Repair.

Several on the defense attorney team have backgrounds in smog testing and repair, engine rebuilds, diagnosis of modern computerized vehicles, and automotive repair. An auto repair shop owner might find an expert defense attorney could help dismiss a citation and save a business.  DEFENSE ATTORNEY STOPS AN ARD LICENSE CITATION IN ITS TRACKS  Auto repair shop owners must have a current Auto repair Dealer license or ARD (https://www.bar.ca.gov/licensing-ard). If the Bureau of Automotive Repair issues a citation, the license could be in jeopardy.
