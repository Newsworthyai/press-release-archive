SANTA BARBARA, CA, March 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Santa Barbara Contractors Association (SBCA) announced its annual awards, and Santa Barbara-based Kellow Construction won the Residential Remodel (Up to $750K) Award for its "Stunning, Resilient Home" project.  The prestigious Residential Remodel Award was granted to a project designed to address the aesthetic and practical needs of a fire-prone environment. The project showcased outstanding craftsmanship and a commitment to innovation in construction.  The award-winning "Stunning, Resilient Home" project stands as a testament to the growing importance of fire-resistant and sustainable building practices.   With over 40 submissions from 25 members competing across 15 categories, the selection of this home for the top honor underscores its exceptional focus on resilience, creativity, and environmental sensitivity.   This achievement adds to the ongoing efforts in the construction industry to redefine residential remodeling standards, particularly in regions facing heightened wildfire risks.  The home's design revolves around fire-resistant features, which address the vital needs of California's fire-prone environment. Kellow Construction's commitment to safety and durability led to the selection of visually attractive materials capable of tackling the region's unpredictable climate.   The "Stunning, Resilient Home" project exemplifies Kellow Construction's ability to combine form and function, creating a living space that is visually appealing and built to withstand the elements. The SBCA judging panel evaluated the project based on key factors such as craftsmanship, innovative problem-solving, and environmental sensitivity—values that Kellow Construction consistently applies to its work.  This award showcases the company's ability to think beyond ordinary design and material choices, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in residential remodeling. Kellow Construction's integration of fire-resistant and sustainable materials in home construction is at the forefront of a broader industry trend toward building homes that are aesthetically pleasing, environmentally responsible, and resilient to natural disasters.  In addition to the fire-resistant exterior, the home's interior features a selection of innovative materials that improve the space's aesthetic and environmental value. Vasari Plaster, an all-natural alternative to traditional drywall, created a unique interior texture while reducing environmental impact. This thoughtful decision reflects the company's broader commitment to sustainable construction practices, ensuring each project is beautiful and environmentally responsible.  The challenges of building a fire-resistant home in a fire-prone area required collaboration and creative problem-solving, and the success of this project would not have been possible without an expert team. The company worked closely with architects, designers, and contractors to ensure that every home detail met the highest quality, sustainability, and functionality standards. The result is a home that is as safe as it is stunning, providing peace of mind to homeowners while blending harmoniously with the natural landscape.  This award is a reminder that homebuilding is about more than just design—it is about creating resilient, sustainable spaces capable of standing the test of time.
