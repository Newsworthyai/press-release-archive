# When a DUI Isn't the End: How Attorneys Borchik and Parambath Fight for Their Clients

KENNETT SQUARE, PA, November 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For many, it threatens careers, reputations, and freedom. But at Perna & Abracht, LLC, attorneys Ryan Borchik and Joshua Parambath have built a strong reputation from proving that a DUI charge does not have to be the end of the road.  Known for their aggressive legal strategy and meticulous case preparation, Attorneys Borchik and Parambath represent individuals facing DUI charges in Chester, Delaware, and surrounding Pennsylvania counties. Their approach goes far beyond simply negotiating plea deals, they look at every angle to challenge evidence, preserve rights, and protect futures.  "A DUI arrest is overwhelming, but it is not a conviction," says Attorney Borchik. "There are constitutional protections and legal defenses that can make a real difference. We ensure our clients know their options and never feel like they are facing the system alone."  Both DUI attorneys emphasize the importance of early intervention. From challenging field sobriety tests and probable cause to breathalyzer calibration and lab reports, their defense begins the moment a client calls. Attorneys Borchik and Parambath have successfully defended clients by challenging illegal stops, procedural errors, and inaccurate blood alcohol content (BAC) results.  Attorney Parambath adds, "We are not here to pass judgment. We are here to listen, fight, and secure the best possible outcome. Whether that means reduced charges, alternative sentencing, or a full acquittal, we are committed to giving every client a second chance."  The firm's team-based approach also ensures that clients have the full support of Perna & Abracht's legal resources. In DUI cases that involve family law, personal injury, or employment concerns, their collaborative practice model helps clients navigate the broader impact of a criminal charge.  Clients also benefit from the firm's deep knowledge of Pennsylvania DUI laws, including first-time offender programs, license suspension hearings, ignition interlock requirements, and sentencing alternatives. Attorneys Borchik and Parambath stay current with changes in DUI enforcement and legislation, ensuring each case is built on the strongest possible legal foundation.  Beyond courtrooms, both attorneys are active in legal education and community outreach, working to help young drivers and first-time offenders understand their rights and responsibilities. Their advocacy goes hand-in-hand with their belief that legal mistakes do not define a person's future.  Whether defending a professional with a commercial driver's license, a college student, or a repeat offender facing enhanced penalties, Attorneys Borchik and Parambath apply the same level of dedication, urgency, and professionalism to every client's case.  "People come to us at one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives," says Attorney Borchik. "We take that seriously, and we fight like it is our own reputation on the line."
