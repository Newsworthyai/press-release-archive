# Expanding Affordable Housing and Strengthening Communities: CAHEC's 2024 Annual Impact Report

RALEIGH, NC, April 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Each year, CAHEC reflects on the impact we've made over the past 12 months, collaborating with our partners to strengthen the communities we serve. In 2024, we continued this mission by expanding our syndication portfolio with the addition of 59 properties across six states. This growth represents approximately 2,896 affordable housing units, providing homes for an estimated 7,620 residents.  Dana Boole, CAHEC's President and CEO, emphasized the organization's vision, stating, "CAHEC strives to be the South's premier community investment organization. Our core businesses—including syndications (equity and debt), property management, general partnerships, and preservation—are guided by our values of integrity, excellence, innovation, and fun. We're committed to delivering impactful programs that support our stakeholders, strengthen our financial foundation, and ensure long-term sustainability. While we continually seek improvement, our growth, service, and commitment to innovation remain the driving forces behind our success."  2024 Highlights:  •	Community Investments: CAHEC and the CAHEC Foundation invested $438,875 to provide residents with educational and wellness opportunities, including funding for 102,000 meals for families and 250 summer camp scholarships for low-income youth. •	New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Impact: CAHEC New Markets was awarded $50 million in NMTC allocations under the CY 2023 allocation round.
