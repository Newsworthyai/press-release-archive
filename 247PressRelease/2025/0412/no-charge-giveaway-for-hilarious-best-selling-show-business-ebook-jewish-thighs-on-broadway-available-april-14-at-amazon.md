# No Charge Giveaway For Hilarious Best Selling Show Business Ebook, Jewish Thighs On Broadway, Available April 14 At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, April 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Penny Orloff recently announced that her comedic novel, 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway: Misadventures of a Little Trouper,' will be available in ebook form at no charge April 14 at Amazon.  The ebook version of 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway' has achieved bestseller status in a number of categories: Comedy, Biographies of Comedians, Humorous Literary Fiction, and Theatre Biographies.  Orloff's novel is populated by an oddball immigrant family, on-again-off-again lovers, diets from Hell, and a Rogue's Gallery from the Showbiz underworld; and every scene has readers laughing out loud.  "Jewish Thighs is a quirky, funny, first-person story, based on slightly fictionalized true eventsâ€“the names have been changed to protect the guilty!" Penny said. "Like The Devil Wears Prada, it's a love-hate mixture of celebration and revenge, leveled at a very sparkly profession with a very dark underside."  Abigail Paine, born Miriam Rosen, has been in love with Showbiz and the performing arts since childhood, perpetually fantasizing herself as the Little Trouper Who Finds Stardom and True Love by the end of the movie. After a hundred shows and a hundred one-night stands, love and fame still elude her, and she'd rather eat cyanide than face another audition. Complicating her search for the Busby Berkeley ending is her primitive alter-ego: The Beast. This creature can track, kill, dismember, and devour an entire cheesecake; and kick the stuffing out of smaller muggers on the sidewalks of New York. When Abigail finds love at long last, she is faced with an agonizing choice: Showbiz or The Guy. As she laments, "Breaking into this Business is like breaking into Fort Knox; breaking out, we're talking Alcatraz."  Orloff's one-woman show, inspired by the novel, played to standing ovations and critical acclaim, including sold-out houses and rave reviews for its premiere in the Seattle Fringe Theater Festival in March, 2000. The show toured the U.S. for a decade, including a successful off-Broadway run in 2005.  The ebook version of the novel will be available free of charge April 14, 2025, at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Thighs-Broadway-Misadventures-Trouper-ebook/dp/B0DTC15NGZ/ref=sr_1_1?.  Metropolitan Opera Leading Tenor Jacques Trussel called 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway', "Ravishingly descriptive and continuously entertaining... the best book I have ever read on this subject... incredible warmth, wit, charm... Brilliant!"  Theater Puget Sound's review said, " . . . passionate. . . Wonderfully evocative language, lots of humor, tears where they belong...thoroughly enjoyable."  One Amazon reviewer wrote, "Fun book! I highly recommend it. Characters are bigger than life, and delightfully screwball. Everyone's Jewish family nightmare! Lots of laughs." Another stated, "No doubt the most fun I've had reading for many years. Read it and laugh!"  Penny Orloff is available for media interviews and can be reached at Penny@pennyorloff.com.
