What is a Fire Watch—and Why Does It Matter? Most business owners and property managers are unaware of what a fire watch is until it's urgently needed.  A fire watch is a temporary safety measure that involves continuous and systematic surveillance of a building or area when fire protection systems—like sprinklers or alarms—are out of service.  Essentially, a fire watch professional becomes a human fire alarm, patrolling a property by sight, smell, and sound, looking for signs of smoke, fire, or heat. If a fire is discovered, they: • Call 911 immediately • Alert all occupants to evacuate • Document activity in a fire watch log • Help prevent catastrophic loss of life and property  There is no sleeping during fire watch. The job is active, alert, and constant—fire watch can mean the difference between life and death.
