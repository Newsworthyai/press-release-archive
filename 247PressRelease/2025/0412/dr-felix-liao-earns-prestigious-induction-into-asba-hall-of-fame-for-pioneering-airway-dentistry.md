# Dr. Felix Liao Earns Prestigious Induction into ASBA Hall of Fame for Pioneering Airway Dentistry

HOUSTON, TX, April 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Felix Liao, DDS, a trailblazer in the realm of airway dentistry and the mind-mouth-body connection, has been celebrated with a prestigious induction into the American Sleep and Breathing Academy (ASBA) Hall of Fame. This accolade shines a spotlight on his groundbreaking contributions to dental sleep medicine and his relentless dedication to transforming lives through innovative oral health solutions.  The ASBA Hall of Fame recognizes individuals whose enduring and impactful work has reshaped the landscape of dental sleep medicine. Dr. Liao's induction honors his revolutionary discovery of Impaired Mouth Syndrome™ and the development of Holistic Mouth Solutions™—approaches that have redefined how dental professionals address sleep-related challenges and overall wellness.  With more than four decades of expertise, Dr. Liao has become a luminary in the field, authoring five transformative books, including Six-Foot Tiger, Three-Foot Cage, Early Sirens, and Licensed to Thrive. These works unravel the intricate links between oral health and systemic conditions, passionately advocating for a whole-body approach to dentistry that empowers patients to thrive.  Dr. Liao's influence extends far beyond the written word. Through his Airway Mouth Doctor™ (AMD™) training programs, he is shaping the future of dentistry by mentoring emerging professionals in non-invasive techniques. His methods prioritize patient comfort and healing, offering effective solutions without the need for pain, injections, drills, or surgery.  Although empirically verified to be effective in professional journals, this new skillset is not yet taught in dental schools or on seminar circuits. It includes, but is not limited to, assessing Impaired Mouth™ with 3D Jaw Diagnostics™ and treatment.  "Dr. Liao's induction into the ASBA Hall of Fame is a testament to his visionary leadership and commitment to bridging oral health with overall well-being," said a spokesperson for the Whole Health Dental Center. "His work doesn't just advance dentistry—it elevates lives, delivering measurable improvements for patients around the world."  This recognition cements Dr. Liao's legacy as a driving force in holistic health, highlighting the power of comprehensive care to unlock optimal wellness.  Website: https://drfelixliao.com
