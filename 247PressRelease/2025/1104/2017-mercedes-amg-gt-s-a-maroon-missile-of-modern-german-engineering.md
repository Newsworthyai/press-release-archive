# 2017 Mercedes-AMG GT S: A Maroon Missile of Modern German Engineering

FORT WORTH, TX, November 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sleek, sculpted, and unapologetically powerful, the 2017 Mercedes-AMG GT S has officially joined The Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. Finished in a stunning maroon hue and showing only 7,000 original miles, this handcrafted performance machine is a modern tribute to AMG's engineering dominance.  Powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter M178 V8, the GT S produces 503 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a carbon-fiber composite driveshaft. With dry-sump lubrication, direct fuel injection, and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, this front-mid engine coupe delivers supercar performance in a package engineered for precision.  From the factory, this example was outfitted with the AMG Dynamic Plus Package and AMG Adaptive Sport Suspension, sharpening its track-readiness while maintaining composure on the street. Braking is handled by red multi-piston calipers clamping down on cross-drilled, ventilated iron discs at all four corners, giving the GT S the stopping power to match its blistering acceleration.  The cockpit is a seamless fusion of luxury and motorsport-inspired functionality. The Dinamica-wrapped AMG Performance steering wheel frames a driver-focused instrument cluster with a 220-mph speedometer, 8k-rpm tachometer, and configurable digital display. Other features include dual-zone automatic climate control, Keyless-Go, COMAND infotainment with navigation, Burmester surround sound, and AMG-branded door sills—all highlighting the car's commitment to high-performance luxury.  "The AMG GT S is what happens when German precision meets raw, unapologetic power," says Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's one of the most exciting cars in the collection—not just to look at, but to experience."  With less than 10,000 miles on the odometer and an arsenal of AMG upgrades, this 2017 GT S is not only an icon of modern performance—it's a near-new time capsule from one of the most thrilling eras of Mercedes-AMG engineering.
