# Styled by Binky Opens at the Salon and Spa Galleria in Arlington

ARLINGTON, TX, November 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Stylist Taylor Meredith is pleased to announce the opening of her new salon, Styled by Binky, located in Suite #216 of the Salon and Spa Galleria at 5100 W. Sublett Road in Arlington. With more than a decade of experience and a talent for creative styling, Taylor has the knowledge and expertise to meet and exceed her clients' expectations.  Taylor first developed an interest in hairstyling as a young child and "picked it up naturally" while watching her father ply his trade in his own barbershop. As a young woman, she started to do braiding for friends and family and discovered that she had a natural talent for it as well. Word spread and her list of "clients" grew. Today, she is exceptionally skilled at a wide range of techniques and is able to serve men, women and children alike. A list of styles she offers can be found on the salon's website (StyledbyBinky.as.me), while photos of satisfied customers are available on Instagram (instagram.com/styledbybinky).  Styled by Binky is open from Tuesday through Saturday from 9:00am to 4:00pm. Appointments can be made on-line or by texting (682) 374-7803. Monday and Sunday appointments can also be arranged when needed, subject to a surcharge.  For clients who are interested in learning how to braid (or better their existing skills), Taylor also offers a two-hour 1 on 1 class with "Hands on learning from Parting to Braiding." Clients will learn 5 specific skills of their own choosing, and since the class is hands on, will need to bring a family member, friend, or other willing "head" to practice on.  By choosing to lease an upscale salon suite in the Arlington Salon & Spa Galleria, Taylor has joined a group of successful salon owners who are each able to offer specialized beauty and wellness services in their own private and luxurious setting. The location at W. Sublett Rd./Hwy 287 makes the salon easily accessible to clients not only in Arlington, but in Mansfield, Kennedale, Crowley, Burleson, Everman and the Forest Hill area as well.
