# Silent North: Fishing, Redefined

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Silent North, the rising star of outdoor watercraft innovation, is about to make waves with the launch of two next-generation inflatable fishing boats — Campcast Ultra and Spinfish Pro. Both will debut on Kickstarter on November 4, 2025, offering anglers and outdoor explorers a reimagined way to experience freedom on the water.  Campcast Ultra: Built for the Wild The Campcast Ultra is a multi-purpose inflatable catamaran designed for anglers who go beyond the shoreline. Its twin-hull structure ensures superior balance across rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, while its large built-in storage compartments keep fishing gear, batteries, and camping essentials neatly organized. Lightweight yet rugged, it can be quickly equipped with a motor, raised seat — turning from a compact fishing craft into a full outdoor base in minutes.  Spinfish Pro: 360° Control and Stability The Spinfish Pro takes control and balance to a new level with its 2.2-meter (7.2-foot) circular hull design — offering unmatched stability and 360° casting ability. Its central elevated seat keeps the angler's balance perfectly centered, minimizing sway even in waves. Designed for both electric and manual propulsion, it's made for those who fish seriously but love to travel light.  Innovation Meets Portability Both boats are constructed from military-grade PVC with reinforced seams — rugged enough for professionals yet lightweight for anyone who loves adventure. They fit easily into a car trunk and inflate in minutes, making them ideal companions for spontaneous fishing or weekend expeditions.  "We designed these boats for real-world anglers — people who want to reach places others can't," said Vincent, Head of Marketing and Business Development at Silent North. "It's about bringing professional-grade performance to anyone who loves the outdoors."  Kickstarter Launch and Rewards The Kickstarter campaign for Campcast Ultra and Spinfish Pro launches November 4, 2025, with early-bird supporters receiving up to 50% off the retail price.
