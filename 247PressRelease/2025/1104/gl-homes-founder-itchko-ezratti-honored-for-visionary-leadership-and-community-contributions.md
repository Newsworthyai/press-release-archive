# GL Homes Founder Itchko Ezratti Honored for Visionary Leadership and Community Contributions

SUNRISE, FL, November 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- GL Homes Founder and Chairman Itchko Ezratti has been recognized for his enduring contributions to Florida's home-building industry and his long-standing commitment to community development and philanthropy.   The honor highlights Itchko's decades of visionary leadership, which have helped shape GL Homes into one of Florida's most respected and community-focused organizations.  For nearly 50 years, Itchko Ezratti has guided GL Homes with the belief that success in business must go hand in hand with responsibility to people and place. His leadership philosophy emphasizes integrity, quality and thoughtful growth. These principles have positioned GL Homes as a model for responsible development and long-term community partnership across Florida.  Under Itchko's direction, the company's Smart Planning approach has led to the creation of vibrant, livable neighborhoods that balance growth with environmental respect. Each community is designed with open spaces, walkable layouts and natural preservation in mind — a reflection of Itchko Ezratti's belief that development should enhance both land and lifestyle.  Equally significant is Itchko's impact through GL Homes Philanthropy. The company has built a long-standing record of supporting local nonprofits dedicated to hunger relief, affordable housing, education and family wellness.   Notable partnerships include support for The Lord's Place Meal Mobile, which delivers meals and outreach services to individuals experiencing homelessness in Palm Beach County, as well as numerous regional programs aimed at improving quality of life for Florida families.  Recognized among Florida philanthropy leaders, Itchko Ezratti's leadership continues to set a standard for combining progress with purpose. His dedication to GL Homes' community impact has helped the company maintain a reputation for doing more than building homes by building communities that last.  Today, that vision continues under the leadership of GL Homes President Misha Ezratti, who upholds his father's enduring commitment to responsible growth and community partnership. Together, their shared mission ensures that GL Homes' success continues to strengthen the regions it serves throughout Florida.  About GL Homes Founded in 1976 by Itchko Ezratti, GL Homes is one of Florida's largest privately held home builders.
