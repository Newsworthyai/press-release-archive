Q2 (2nd Edition) Lead Implementer Training course.

Topics include the standard's overview, clause-by-clause requirements, key definitions, documentation best practices, and methods for data analysis, risk assessment, service delivery and validation. By the end of the course, participants will understand how to develop the documentation and controls needed for effective API Spec Q2 implementation.  The course provides comprehensive module coverage of all required topics and certification requirements, and is supported by rich downloadable learning materials (detailed handouts and practical templates including sample documents). It is delivered via a flexible, self-paced online format and culminates in an officially recognized certification upon successful completion.
