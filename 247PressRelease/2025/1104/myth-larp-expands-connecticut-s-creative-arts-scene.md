# Myth LARP Expands Connecticut's Creative Arts Scene

POMFRET, CT, November 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Founded in 2018, Myth LARP invites players to step inside a fantasy story instead of just reading one. The organization runs six immersive Adventure Weekends each year, creating a continuous, campaign-style narrative where each event picks up where the last left off. Participants design original characters, wear costumes, and bring the world to life through acting, teamwork, and improvisation.  Each event transforms 275 acres of Pomfret's scenic 4-H Camp into a living fantasy setting filled with quests, challenges, and collaborative storytelling. Players and volunteers work together to expand an evolving narrative that blends performance art, outdoor adventure, and community connection.  "Live-action role-play is more than a game," said Eric Tetreault, co-founder and creative director. "It is a performing art that helps people tell stories, build confidence, and connect through shared creativity."  Myth has hosted events with more than 250 participants, making it one of the largest live-action role-playing communities in New England. Nearly 100 players and supporting cast are expected for the upcoming Adventure Weekend season opener, March 27–29, 2026, in Pomfret.  Myth supports inclusion across its community, welcoming participants from all backgrounds and experience levels. Registration covers lodging, meals, and use of on-site facilities, creating a shared experience where players can focus fully on storytelling and collaboration.  To support long-term growth, Myth is transitioning into a nonprofit organization. A volunteer board of directors is being established in preparation for 501(c)(3) status to ensure transparency, sustainability, and shared community leadership.  "Our mission is to help people see themselves as heroes in their own stories," Tetreault said. "Turning Myth into a community-driven nonprofit will keep that mission alive for years to come."  New and returning players can register or explore volunteer opportunities at mythlarp.com. First-time participants receive orientation and mentorship through the Guide Program, which helps newcomers step confidently into the world of Hyraeth.
