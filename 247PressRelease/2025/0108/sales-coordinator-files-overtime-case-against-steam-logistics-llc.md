# Sales Coordinator Files Overtime Case Against Steam Logistics, LLC

MINNEAPOLIS, MN, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On December 19, 2024, a Sales Coordinator filed an overtime lawsuit against Steam Logistics, LLC ("Defendant".) The named plaintiff asserts individual claims and claims on behalf of other similarly situated Sales Coordinators, and employees in other job titles performing similar duties. The Complaint alleges that as a Sales Coordinator, the plaintiff's primary job duty was to perform non-exempt work, which included selling and providing Defendant's freight brokerage services. The complaint further alleges that Steam Logistics required Sales Coordinators to work overtime in order to complete all of their work, but misclassified them as exempt, improperly denying them overtime pay when they worked over forty (40) hours per week.  The plaintiff brought the case as a putative collective action under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") seeking to recover unpaid overtime compensation, liquidated (double) damages, and other statutorily-permitted relief for herself and other Sales Coordinators.   Reena I. Desai, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, stated, "We believe that misclassification of employees is a common practice in the logistics industry. Employees who primarily perform non-exempt work like the Sales Coordinators included in this case should be paid overtime even if they are paid by salary. We hope to help them recover the pay that has been withheld from them."   The case is titled Shelton, et al. v. Steam Logistics, LLC, Case No. 1:24-cv-393 (Eastern District of Tennessee). Plaintiff is represented by Reena I. Desai and Caitlin L. Opperman of Nichols Kaster, PLLP, which has offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and San Francisco, California.
