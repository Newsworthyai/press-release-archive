SAN ANTONIO, TX, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Baltisse-Ackerman Commercial Development has sold Doerr Lane Logistics Center, a 307,000-square-foot, Class A distribution center in Schertz, Texas in the northeast San Antonio MSA. The buyer of the property, which is 100% leased, is a private investor from California.   Trent Agnew, Kyle Mueller and Witt Westbrook of JLL represented seller Baltisse-Ackerman in the transaction. Located at 9870 Doerr Lane, the logistics center provides convenient access to I-35, Loop 1604 and I-10.   "When we first saw this site, it stood out as a great opportunity for a new development to meet the rising demand for Class A distribution space in this important logistics corridor," said Jeff Bryant, Principal and Senior Vice President for Ackerman & Co. in Texas. "We appreciate the support the City of Schertz provided us throughout this project."   The tenants in the fully leased property are MEI Rigging & Crating (191,297 SF) and Quality Custom Distribution (115,703 SF). John Colglazier Jr. and Kyle Kennan of Partners completed the leases on behalf of ownership.   Under Bryant's leadership in Texas, Ackerman & Co. continues to pursue Class A industrial development and acquisitions, with a focus on the major Texas MSAs in the fast-growing Texas Triangle. Ackerman & Co.'s completed and ongoing projects in Texas total more than 3 million square feet of Class A development.   Two new projects in Texas continue the Baltisse-Ackerman partnership's investment in Class A distribution projects: Corporate Drive Industrial Park, a recently completed logistics park featuring two buildings of 274,000 square feet and 237,000 square feet in Selma, and TriPoint Logistics Center, a project that will include buildings of 1 million square feet and 500,000 square feet in Seguin.  Ackerman & Co. is also developing 20 East Logistics Park, a project that will include two Class A buildings of 172,000 square feet and 162,000 square feet in Terrell, east of Downtown Dallas. Also in Dallas, Ackerman acquired a six-building infill portfolio of six buildings totaling 276,920 square feet.
