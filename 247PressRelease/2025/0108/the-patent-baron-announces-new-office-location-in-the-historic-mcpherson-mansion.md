# The Patent Baron Announces New Office Location In The Historic McPherson Mansion

HOWELL, MI, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Patent Baron is a boutique law firm that focuses on helping intellectual property owners preserve the rights to their creations. Our attorneys can help you register a trademark, protect trade secrets, license your copyrighted material, and initiate legal action if your intellectual property rights are infringed upon. Recently, we moved locations to new professional offices, as part of our brand expansion initiative.  Firm founder and lead attorney J. Baron Lesperance discusses the move: "As a local law firm, we believe in reinvesting in our community. Preserving the historic McPherson Mansion is important to remembering the history of Howell, and as professional tenants in the building, we're doing our part to help maintain this iconic building."  The Patent Baron firm is a team of Howell intellectual property protection attorneys who help clients register their inventions, lines of code, logos and branding initiatives, and works of art. Our firm has a long history, going back more than two decades, of fostering creativity by ensuring that inventors' rights are respected. Firm founder Mr. Lesperance is himself an inventor and patent holder, so he understands just how valuable intellectual property is to small business owners.  The McPherson Mansion is one of the oldest landmarks in Howell. Built in 1915, it was the former home of prominent Howell businessman Robert Bruce McPherson. The property was originally a mint farm for perfumeries and still retains a light scent of mint in the air. Many Howell natives swear that the mansion is haunted, and stories of buried treasure, including silver dollars dating from the 1700s in the pond, abound.  The mansion now houses a suite of professional offices, including The Patent Baron who is now accepting consultation requests. The ribbon cutting on November 12, 2024, was attended by about 40 people, including members of the Hartland, Huron Valley, and Howell Chambers of Commerce. Attendees were treated to a full tour of the historic mansion, including the haunted parts, and enjoyed an afternoon learning more about the rich history of Howell.
