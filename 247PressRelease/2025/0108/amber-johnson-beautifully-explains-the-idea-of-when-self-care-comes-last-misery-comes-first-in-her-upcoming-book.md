# Amber Johnson Beautifully Explains the Idea Of "When Self-Care Comes Last, Misery Comes First" In her Upcoming Book

LOS ANGELES, CA, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Amber herself once overlooked self-care and misunderstood self-love as selfishness. Her perspective shifted dramatically when she reached the lowest point in her life. Misunderstood, unloved, and betrayed by those she cherished most, Amber found herself trapped in a cycle of misery.  "True strength isn't found in standing aloneâ€”it's discovered in the connections that help you rise, heal, and grow." The quote from her book is the essence of her healing journey." She also wrote in her book, "There's no shame in mental illness; the shame lies in a society that stigmatizes it."  This turning point made her realize that something needed to change. Determined to transform her life, she chose healing for herself. She sought therapy, took medication, explored spirituality, and relied on accountability partners. Over the course of three years, Amber's dedication began to bear fruit, enabling her to live at a level of fulfillment she had never imagined.  Inspired by her transformation, Amber decided to share her journey in her book, Sar Shalom Dynasty. Unlike many self-help books on the market, Sar Shalom Dynasty offers raw, tested, and personal insights. She has written about methods and strategies she has personally experienced, making her work both relatable and practical.  Her vision for the book is clear: to reach out to those who are silently struggling. Written in accessible, easy-to-understand language, Sar Shalom Dynasty is an ideal companion for individuals battling mental health challenges, recovering from betrayal, or seeking non-traditional approaches to healing.
