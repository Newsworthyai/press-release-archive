# Who Knew Geese Could Be Role Models? Jeanell Pete Holmes Shows Us How!

NEW ORLEANS, LA, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This book introduces the goose, an often-overlooked animal, and shows how its behaviors teach important lessons about teamwork, loyalty, and resilience.  After surviving Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Jeanell Pete decided to focus on wildlife in her children's writing instead of fictional superheroes. She wanted to teach kids that real-life heroes don't need superpowers to make a difference. In Geese, she shows how these birds, with no magical abilities, protect their flocks, stay together in hard times, and help each other succeed.  Geese explore how young geese learn to fly by watching their parents and flock mates, much like how children learn by observing those around them. It highlights how these birds never leave behind the weakest member of their group, staying with them until they can fly or pass away. These are real-life actions children can followâ€”there are no magical powers involved, just love, care, and dedication.  With simple vocabulary, beautiful illustrations, and real facts, Geese is an inspiring and easy-to-read book for children aged 7 to 11. It's available soon at all your favorite stores. This book is a must-read for young minds ready to discover the heroes of the real world.  As a Katrina survivor, Jeanell's creative thoughts flowed after experiencing the individual and family impact of this life-changing event. When one has a strong connection to family combined with a social neighborhood community built on the structure of caring, coming together, and being resilient.
