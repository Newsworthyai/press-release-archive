# Financial Institutions Can Now Convert Transaction Data into Precise Revenue Opportunities with the Power of AI

HUNTSVILLE, AL, January 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Community banks and credit unions can now increase their understanding to better serve their customers' needs through a new partnership between DeepTarget Inc. and FinGoal. By combining FinGoal's advanced transaction analysis and DeepTarget, financial institutions can transform routine transaction data into actionable insights that power highly personalized product recommendations and offers. This partnership helps enhance the solution for a widespread yet difficult challenge for financial institutions: getting the right offers in front of the right customers at the right time.  Every purchase, deposit, and transfer tell a story about what your accountholders need next. This partnership combines FinGoal's transaction intelligence with DeepTarget's AI-driven engagement platform to decode those stories and turn them into opportunities and results. Financial institutions can now spot which homeowners might need a little extra cash for home improvement or debt consolidation, identify small business owners ready to expand through their cash flow patterns, or recognize when growing families might need college savings accounts. By delivering precisely timed, relevant offers based on real customer behavior, banks and credit unions can drive deeper relationships, increase product adoption, and grow revenue while giving customers the financial solutions they actually need, when they need them.  "Banks and credit unions know they need to compete on personalization, but they've been missing the tools to do it effectively," said David Nohe, CEO of FinGoal. "Our partnership with DeepTarget bridges that gap. We turn complex transaction data into clear growth opportunities with existing customers, and DeepTarget turns those insights into targeted campaigns that drive results. Together, we're helping financial institutions deliver the kind of personalized experience that builds lasting customer relationships and sustainable growth."  The key benefits of FinGoal for DeepTarget include: •	Turning Raw Transactions into Revenue Opportunities: The integration analyzes individual spending patterns, life events, and financial behaviors to identify perfect-timing opportunities for relevant product offers.  •	Delivering Deep Personalization at Scale: Moving beyond demographic segmentation by using real transaction data to power AI-driven campaigns that are personally tailored to accountholders' current needs and financial journey.  •	Identifying Hidden Sales Opportunities: Uncovering patterns in transaction data that signal key life moments and financial needs - from those starting businesses to planning for retirement - before your competitors do.  •	Automating the Targeting & Personalization Process: The use of transaction data for intelligent campaigns can be a complex process. FinGoal for DeepTarget goes a long way towards automating this process and continuously analyzes accountholder behavior to trigger personalized offers at the right moment through digital channels.  •	Measuring beyond Vanity Metrics to Optimize Results: Continuous tracking of deep performance metrics to improve targeting which translates into higher response rates, increased product adoption, and revenue growth while continuously refining campaign performance.  "Financial institutions are sitting on a goldmine of transaction data, but most can't turn that data into actionable customer insights," said Preetha Pulusani, CEO of DeepTarget. "By combining FinGoal's advanced transaction intelligence with our AI-driven engagement platform, we're giving banks and credit unions the power to spot opportunities in everyday transactions and automatically turn those insights into personalized offers that drive real revenue growth. This isn't just about better marketing – it's about fundamentally transforming how financial institutions understand and serve their customers."
