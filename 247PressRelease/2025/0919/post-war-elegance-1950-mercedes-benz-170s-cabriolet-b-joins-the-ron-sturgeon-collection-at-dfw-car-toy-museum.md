# Post-War Elegance: 1950 Mercedes-Benz 170S Cabriolet B Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, September 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to unveil a rare find in the Ron Sturgeon Collection: the 1950 Mercedes-Benz 170S Cabriolet B. Unveiled just four years after the end of World War II, the 170S was a pivotal model for Mercedes-Benz, signaling the marque's return to prestige and innovation in the postwar automotive landscape.  Riding on a modified version of the earlier 170 V chassis, the 170S combined modern mechanical upgrades with timeless styling rooted in pre-war luxury design. This cabriolet variant, offered in both two- and four-seat formats, features the flowing body lines and generous interior that echoed the elegance of the 1930s Mercedes-Benz 230. Under the hood, the 1,767cc M136 inline-four engine—an enhanced version of its predecessor—delivers 52 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque, complemented by a Solex downdraft carburetor and aluminum cylinder head.  Paired with a fully synchromesh four-speed manual transmission and a 4.375:1 rear swing axle, the 170S also benefits from a sophisticated suspension setup for its time: double wishbones and coil springs with telescopic shock absorbers in the front, matched by a similarly refined rear configuration.  "This vehicle represents more than just technical excellence—it symbolizes Mercedes-Benz's rebirth after the war and the enduring value of craftsmanship," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "Its graceful lines and engineering brilliance make it a standout in any era, and we're proud to display it for our guests."  The 1950 Mercedes-Benz 170S Cabriolet B is now on display at the museum alongside more than 200 classic vehicles and 3,000 rare toys and collectibles.
