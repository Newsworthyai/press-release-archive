# Teamsters Demand Fair Deal at Ralphs

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, September 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Southern California Teamsters are calling on Ralphs Grocery Company—owned by Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket chain—to negotiate a fair contract that reflects the value of the workers who keep shelves stocked, families fed, and communities moving. After more than two months of bargaining, negotiations are at a critical point with the contract set to expire on Sunday, September 21, 2025.  "Our members are the backbone of Ralphs' supply chain," said Lou Villalvazo, grocery chairman of Teamsters Joint Council 42. "They deserve wages that keep up with the high cost of living, strong health and retirement benefits, and above all, job security in the face of corporate automation threats. Kroger is making billions—there's no excuse for shortchanging the workers who make those profits possible."  Key Issues at Stake: • Protecting Jobs from Automation – Teamsters oppose the use of autonomous semi-trucks without a qualified commercial driver, citing serious safety risks to the public and the communities they serve. • Fair Pay – Wages that reflect the soaring cost of living in Southern California. • Healthcare Benefits – Maintaining and improving healthcare coverage for members and their families. • Retirement Security – Strengthening pensions to ensure dignity after decades of service.  The Teamsters emphasized that this fight is not only about protecting good union jobs but also about safeguarding community safety and the future of working families across Southern California.  "Kroger cannot balance its profits on the backs of workers and put the public at risk with unsafe automation," said Chris Griswold, president of Teamsters Joint Council 42. "Ralphs runs because of Teamster drivers, warehouse, and distribution workers. Unless the company reaches a fair deal by September 21, our members are ready to act."  Teamsters Joint Council 42, representing 22 local unions and nearly 250,000 active and retired members across Southern California, Southern Nevada, Hawaii, and Guam.
