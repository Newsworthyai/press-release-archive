# Bulqit Launches World's First Home Service Group-Buying Platform

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bulqit soft-launched the world's first home service bulking platform last week, starting in select neighborhoods in Los Angeles, California. Single-family homeowners can now join neighborhood clusters, called Bulqit Blocks. By doing so, it's able to radically cut costs on recurring outdoor services.  By aggregating demand and organizing neighbors into Bulqit Blocks, the company is introducing a model that is expected to deliver approximately 30% in savings on most recurring home services, compared to what customers typically pay when contracting individually. All of this functionality is powered by a centralized communication and billing platform that keeps things simple for both homeowners and home service partners.   Why the Home Services Market Remains Broken  Over the past decade, countless companies have attempted to "fix" home services. Fixer (which closed earlier this year), Honey Homes, PreFix, Lawn Love, GreenPal, Blueberry Home, Thumbtack, Angi, and TaskRabbit all tried different approaches with varying degrees of success - marketplaces, subscription models, on-demand apps. All have shared the same challenges that Bulqit has solved:  Transactional Focus: Most platforms facilitate one-off tasks instead of long-term, recurring, relationship-based services. By doing this, the inefficiency compounds with more and more customers spread out geographically, leading to a significant amount of company time being consumed by driving, especially in major markets.   Markup Layers: All of these companies, one way or another, insert themselves as middlemen, charging homeowners significantly more than what they pay their workers (either 1099 or W2). In each case, the platform expects the customer to pay for the technology and ease created by the application. As an example, Fixer charged approximately $90/hour while paying workers $50/hour.   Freelancers & Gig Workers: Too often, vendors are uninsured, unverified individuals rather than professional, local companies. Bulqit only works with established companies who have the ability and willingness to scale. Once a vendor is awarded a Bulqit Block, that vendor has exclusive rights over that Block while standards remain high. Similar to how Uber and Lyft rely on ratings by its riders to weed out lower quality drivers, Bulqit does the same with its vendors. If you're a top-rated vendor in a major metropolitan area in the United States, you can apply here.   Vendor Inefficiency: Service providers drive across entire metro areas to service a few homes, wasting time, fuel, and increasing costs. In the swimming pool or lawn care space, where the average service visit may only be 30 minutes, this inefficiency leads to nearly 30% of the laborers' day being drive time. Then, layer on the expense and time of lead generation, the quoting process, billing, collections and contracting (i.e. paperwork) and even top-tier vendors find minimal incentive to participate in these other platforms or do so at a loss. Bulqit provides all of these back office and administrative services so the vendor can stay focused on providing services.   THE RESULT: homeowners overpay, vendors struggle to scale, and neighborhoods stay fragmented.  How Bulqit Is Different  Bulqit brings true economies of scale to outdoor home services - think Groupon's group-buying power, but actually sustainable. Groupon asked businesses to slash prices in the hope of future sales. Bulqit flips the script by eliminating vendor drive time, which allows the vendor to complete more jobs per day and earns more profit, even at a reduced price per home. The result is a simple, scalable model that works for everyone:  Neighborhood Clusters (Bulqit Blocks): Homeowners join Bulqit Blocks (clusters defined by Bulqit) to pool demand. More homes in a Block mean stronger pricing leverage, better scheduling, and more reliability with those vendors. Homeowners pay nothing extra...just less. Roughly 60% of vendor referrals already come from neighbors; Bulqit formalizes and rewards that behavior.  Single Allocation Method (SAM): Bulqit's platform uses a pricing strategy that it developed called SAM to fairly allocate bulk pricing across each home in a Block, similar to how an HOA or condo association assigns shared expenses, but voluntary and without the headaches. For example, pool service is allocated by pool square footage and lawn care is allocated by lot square footage. Vendors skip time-consuming quotes and bids as pricing is pre-calculated and transparent.  Professional Vendors Only: Every Bulqit vendor is a legitimate, top-rated (defined by Google and Yelp reviews, references, background checks and more), insured company — not a freelancer or a one-off contractor. Bulqit focuses on identifying and engaging companies that have the desire and capability of scaling since the vendor who wins the bulk contract also has an exclusive right to the balance of the Bulqit Block, which is typically 1,000 homes. This ensures higher quality, accountability, and protection for homeowners.  Recurring First: Bulqit focuses exclusively on recurring outdoor services including lawn care, pool cleaning, window washing, pest control, trash bin cleaning, and exterior cleaning, positioning itself as a full neighborhood services marketplace. Once subscribed, homeowners can also access one-time add-on services like tree planting or add other, more custom, recurring services to their base package. The company intends to launch more and more services over time, which could include property neighborhood security, Internet service or even koi pond cleaning.   Environmental Benefit: By grouping homeowners into efficient Bulqit Blocks, the home service marketplace eliminates redundant trips and wasted fuel, cutting costs and emissions at the same time. Vendors service multiple homes in one Block at once, dramatically cutting drive time and emissions. In traffic-heavy Los Angeles, this is both cost-saving and eco-friendly. With 2,000 customers across dense Blocks in Encino and Sherman Oaks, Bulqit is projected to eliminate up to 120,000 vehicle miles annually, saving about 8,000 gallons of fuel and preventing more than 70 metric tons of CO₂ emissions. This translates to tens of thousands of dollars in fuel savings while creating cleaner, greener neighborhoods through smarter service routing.  Bulqit doesn't just save homeowners money - it builds stronger neighborhoods, creates healthier margins for vendors, and makes outdoor services cleaner, greener, and far less painful.  The Platform Advantage  Beyond cost savings, Bulqit's platform creates convenience and control for both homeowners and vendors:  One Platform for All Services: From pool cleaning to lawn care, all outdoor services are organized in a single dashboard, with many more to come.   One Credit Card, One Bill: Homeowners pay for all services through Bulqit, automatically - no juggling multiple invoices or payment apps.  Centralized Communication: A single platform to message, schedule, or update service preferences across vendors.  Vendor POV: Bulqit delivers real customers, not just leads. Vendors skip marketing, proposals, invoicing, collections, and contracts - freeing them to focus on service and growth.  Bulqit as a Fiduciary: Acting like "PayPal for home services," Bulqit holds vendors accountable. If an issue arises with a vendor, Bulqit steps in to resolve it, protecting both homeowners and vendors.  This combination of simplicity, accountability, and efficiency makes Bulqit the first truly scalable platform for bulked recurring outdoor services.  Why Los Angeles First  Los Angeles offers year-round demand for outdoor services. Unlike markets where lawn care gives way to snow removal in winter, L.A. homeowners need consistent lawn, pool, and pest control throughout the year. That stability makes Bulqit's pricing model stronger, operations smoother, and vendor routes far more efficient. Starting in Encino, Sherman Oaks, Beverlywood, and Porter Ranch, Bulqit will expand city by city - bringing the Block model to neighborhoods nationwide.  Quote from the Founder  "Every other platform we studied added layers, raised prices, or relied on freelancers who lacked accountability. Bulqit flips this outdated model to benefit both homeowners and vendors. We organize neighbors into Bulqit Blocks, our neighborhood clusters, apply our Single Allocation Method to fairly distribute costs with transparent bulk pricing, and deliver recurring outdoor services at up to 70% less than if you engaged individually. Think of it like a voluntary HOA, without the Karens and the headaches, but with all the benefits of consistency, fairness, and community." — Keegan J.

About Bulqit  Bulqit is the world's first home service marketplace with bulk pricing, founded by Keegan J. Bonebrake and Tom Vranas. The model builds on Bonebrake's track record disrupting the Internet service industry in Chicago. His company, Everywhere Wireless, organized buildings to bulk-purchase broadband and break free from overpriced legacy providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Spectrum. After rapid growth and multiple acquisitions, that company is now Zentro Internet, one of the nation's largest ISPs. It all started with bulking. Bulqit applies the same principle to home services: organize demand, create economies of scale, and use technology to lower costs, strengthen vendor reliability, and build cleaner, greener neighborhoods.
