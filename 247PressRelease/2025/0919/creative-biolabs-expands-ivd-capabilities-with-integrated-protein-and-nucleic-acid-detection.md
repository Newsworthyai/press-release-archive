# Creative Biolabs Expands IVD Capabilities with Integrated Protein and Nucleic Acid Detection

SHIRLEY, NY, September 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the last few years, IVD has come a long way from traditional morphological observation to focusing at the molecular level with the advancements of molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. The values of protein- and nucleic acid-based biomarkers will continue to rapidly become more prominent, especially for early disease detection.  Protein-Level Detection Proteins act as direct mediators of both physiological and pathological processes in living organisms, offering a more intuitive reflection of cellular activity. This makes them indispensable targets in disease diagnostics and drug development. Drawing on extensive project experience, Creative Biolabs provides systematic protein-level detection services, enabling researchers to obtain reliable data even from limited sample volumes.  A Creative Biolabs expert noted, "Protein level studies, unlike genetic testing, tend to track a disease's onset and development at a much faster pace. With the help of our protein level testing, we guarantee that researchers can obtain stable and reproducible results with our high-sensitivity technology platforms, even from limited sample volumes."  Focus on Protein Biomarker Detection Protein biomarker detection plays a pivotal role in early diagnosis. Creative Biolabs utilizes advanced technology platforms to provide a full range of flexible protein biomarker detection services. These services apply multiple disciplines, from ELISA and multiplex assays to mass spectrometry and protein arrays.  Services are employed for quantitative detection of specific targets, as well as proteomics on a larger scale. For example, in research into cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and infectious disease, Creative Biolabs has supported clients in demonstrating reliable, established biomarker detection processes.  "We appreciate the standard to which researchers hold their data quality and detection sensitivity," added the expert. "That's why we rigorously control every step—from sample preparation to data interpretation—so that we can deliver reliable, high-quality data."  Innovative Exploration of Combined Nucleic Acid and Protein Detection A single biomarker often cannot fully capture the complexity of a disease. In response, Creative Biolabs has developed combined nucleic acid and protein detection services, which allow the protein and nucleic acid signals in a single assay to be analyzed simultaneously. This combined approach saves sample volume and time, revealing cross-level molecular interactions, thus enhancing the rationale for early disease detection and clinical assessment.  In studies on pancreatic cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other complex conditions, the advantages of combined detection have already been established. The expert emphasized, "The earlier and more accurately researchers can identify disease patterns, the more benefit will be derived from integrated protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. This could very well be the future of IVD."  About Creative Biolabs As a major global CRO, Creative Biolabs aims to provide responsive, modifiable, and high-value services to all customers. Whether the research focus is on a single protein target or on multi-dimensional combined detection, the team carefully designs experimental strategies to balance client needs with maximum scientific rigor and practical outcomes.
