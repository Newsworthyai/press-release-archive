# Reimagining Royalty: Ferrari 250 GT Red Special Spyder Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, June 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A bold reinterpretation of a Ferrari legend, this 1970 Ferrari 250 GT Red Special Spyder is a handcrafted tribute to one of the rarest and most elegant Italian designs in history. Inspired by the 1957 Berlinetta Speciale created by Pinin Farina For Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, this recreation reflects the styling and spirit of a true one-off masterpiece.  Beneath its sculpted long bonnet lies a high-revving powerplant fed by triple Weber carburetors, delivering an estimated 320 horsepower. A five-speed manual transmission sends that power to the rear wheels, while ventilated disc brakes and a quad-exit exhaust system enhance performance and presence.  Riding on 15" Borrani wire wheels, the Spyder captures classic Ferrari flair with distinctive elements: an oval grille, independent front bumperettes, sculpted fender vents, and curved tailfins with taillights perched on top—mirroring the original's 4.9 Superfast-inspired design.  Inside, the wood-rimmed steering wheel—adorned with the iconic prancing horse—fronts Veglia Borletti gauges, including a 180-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer, flanked by additional instrumentation housed elegantly above the center stack.  "This car is an homage to one of Ferrari's most exclusive commissions," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It may be a recreation, but the craftsmanship and character are unmistakably Maranello."  From its royal lineage to its roaring tribute, the Ferrari 250 GT Red Special Spyder stands as a shining symbol of timeless Italian design.
