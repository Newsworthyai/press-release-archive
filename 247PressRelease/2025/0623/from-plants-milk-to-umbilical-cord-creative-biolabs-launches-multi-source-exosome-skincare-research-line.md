# From Plants, Milk, to Umbilical Cord: Creative Biolabs Launches Multi-source Exosome Skincare Research Line

SHIRLEY, NY, June 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Once tucked inside cell biology labs, exosomes are now the hot new ingredient in the skincare industry. Creative Biolabs develops dedicated exosome products for skincare, covering three major categories: exosomes from umbilical cord, milk-derived exosomes, and plant-derived exosomes. Such a one-stop lineup streamlines the research-to-product process and keeps projects moving.  Exosomes from Umbilical Cord Among various exosome research directions, exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSC) have undoubtedly become the industry's focal point. Thanks to their outstanding regenerative and anti-aging properties, these exosomes are regarded as a significant breakthrough in high-end skincare and hair care markets.  Creative Biolabs applies advanced freeze-drying technology to process these exosomes, greatly enhancing their stability and preservation of bioactivity. This provides cosmetic companies with a novel approach for developing efficacy-driven products.  "The clinical potential of umbilical cord-derived exosomes has opened a new window for skincare innovation. Through precise delivery, they effectively promote skin regeneration, improve complexion and texture, and even show promising applications in hair growth," said an exosome research expert from Creative Biolabs in an interview.  Currently, Creative Biolabs offers freeze-dried umbilical cord-derived exosome products, ensuring high stability and activity during storage, thereby providing reliable material support for research teams.  Milk-Derived Exosomes Beyond regenerative care breakthroughs, milk-derived exosomes are gradually becoming a "star ingredient" in skincare R&D. Creative Biolabs' milk exosome products originate from premium milk and are rich in proteins, lipids, and various bioactive factors, exhibiting excellent permeability and stability.  "Consumers are increasingly interested in the scientific stories behind skincare formulations. Milk-derived exosomes perfectly combine scientific rigor with gentle skincare philosophy, making them a cutting-edge ingredient that developers should prioritize," said the expert.  Plant-Derived Exosomes Amid the growing demand for natural skincare, plant exosomes have become an important addition to product portfolios. Unlike traditional plant extracts, plant exosomes exist as nanoscale vesicles that deliver natural active compounds from plants more efficiently.  "We provide plant-derived exosomes, such as those from aloe, coconut, and ginseng, which not only offer multifunctional benefits like antioxidant, anti-aging, and soothing effects but also drive natural skincare into an era of precise delivery, giving formulators more innovative differentiation options."   In addition to supplying high-quality raw materials, Creative Biolabs offers customized services to skincare development teams, including ingredient screening, freeze-drying technology consultation, activity testing, and microneedle delivery solutions to facilitate successful research outcomes.
