CHICAGO, IL, June 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The United Negro College Fund's 25th Annual "A Mind Is…"® (AMI) Gala returned to its original Black and White theme at their annual scholarship fundraiser recently held at The Geraghty! Crisp white shirts, black tuxedos, and a variety of sequined and sparkly gowns filled the room with nostalgic glamour. Emcees for the night were Anita Blanton, journalist and anchor of Good Day Chicago on FOX TV 32, and nationally-syndicated radio personality Trey White from WGCI-FM.   Lisa Rollins, UNCF Regional Development Director, said, "Thanks to generous contributions from our supporters, we raised $1,005,600. This remarkable achievement will help us continue to provide essential support for the students we serve." Gala Chair Sherina Edwards, an alumna of both Howard University and Spelman College, played a vital role in elevating the event's impact during this milestone year.  Honorary Chairs for the gala, Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton and Toni Preckwinkle, Cook County Board President, sent video messages. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was present and delivered welcome remarks to the more than 500 guests.  UNCF Chicago recognized two extraordinary supporters, presenting Ariel Investments with the "A Mind Is…" Corporate Award. Nadia Rawlinson, Co-owner and Operating Chair, The Chicago Sky, received the "A Mind Is…" Trailblazer Award. Recipients both received praises and thank yous for their tireless dedication, working to ensure that students not only enter, but graduate college.  "Looking at the meaning behind our 81st year, these honorees uphold the mission of UNCF of investing in Better Futures through our students," said Rollins. "It is appropriately so that we proudly recognize them. They help make a difference in the lives of deserving students. We are so grateful for their level of support and to have them as best allies."  Additionally, auctioneer Gee Scott led a paddle raise and live auction. Auction items included a Timeless Tuscany Escape, seven-night stay in the heart of Italy; L'Escape Paris, a five-night stay for five guests in Paris's Le Marais neighborhood; Los Arcos Sights, a cliffside villa for eight guests, four nights, overlooking the sea; a Private Island Retreat, five-night stay, private island on the shore of Lake Nicaragua; Bella Espana, a romantic getaway for two in Extremadura, Spain; and Tulum Allure Getaway, an exclusive designer villa in the Aldea Zama community, four nights, six guests.

Moving testimonials were given by Cori' Anne White, Spelman College and Morehouse College graduate Jamal D. Chambers. From 2022 to 2023, UNCF awarded 541 college scholarships to students in Illinois.  Gala Chair Sherina Edwards said, "As an alum of two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Howard University and Spelman College, I feel honored to serve as the Gala Chair. It is such a worthy calling. In these times of the new administration's cuts to funding in education, schools and universities, I saw the necessity …for we must work harder, dig deeper in our pockets to help the next generation of young people to get to college, to have resources while in college, and to graduate."   Entertainment for the evening was the R&B group After 7. The group was formed in 1987 by the older brothers of the songwriter and singer, Babyface, and originally consisted of Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, along with a third member, Keith Mitchell. Present group members are Kevon Edmonds, Wil Robinson and Jeremy Keith. They performed many of their platinum-selling hits, such as "Heat of the Moment," "Ready or Not" and "Cant Stop".   UNCF's iconic motto, now revised, still rings true…a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but a wonderful thing to invest in™.
