# BHS, Inc. Introduces Modular Charging Infrastructure for Electric Industrial Vehicles

ST. LOUIS, MO, June 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BHS, Inc., a leading manufacturer of custom material handling equipment, announces the release of new modular solutions for industrial vehicle charging stations.   The product family centers on the Universal Forklift Charger Stand (CSU), supporting them with configurable cable management tools: Cable Retractor Reel Mounts (CSU-PX) and heavy duty Cable Retractor Reels (CRR).   "As electric fleets grow, charging infrastructure grows with them," said Trent Boothe, Inside Sales Manager of BHS. "A one-size-fits-all solution won't always work. That's why we developed modular charger infrastructure that's configurable to task."   Universal Forklift Charger Stands feature shelves or horizontal mounts, so they'll support battery chargers of virtually any design. With up to two shelves or four horizontal mounts, a single stand can power multiple industrial trucks at once â€” and that includes more than forklifts.   "Our goal is to make charging stations as flexible as fleets themselves," Boothe said. "You might have forklifts in one zone and automated guided vehicles in another. With our modular system, you can charge them all without redesigning the entire floor plan."   This versatility also applies to charger cables. Cable Retractor Reel Mounts include multiple articulating arms, so you can guide cables safely to any charging position. Add Cable Retractor Reels to complete an automatic cable management system for cables of virtually any size and weight.   All three products are available now, and reflect BHS' broader mission to support electrification everywhere. While they're ideal for forklift fleets, the CSU, CSU-PX, and CRR also create compact, efficient charging stations for electric equipment across industries: warehousing and logistics, air travel, manufacturing, or any facility transitioning to electric vehicle fleets.
