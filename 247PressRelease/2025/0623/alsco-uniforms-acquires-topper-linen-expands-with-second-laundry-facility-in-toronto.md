SALT LAKE CITY, UT, June 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alsco Uniforms, a global leader in uniform and linen laundry services headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, has announced the acquisition of Topper Linen, strengthening its service capabilities and expanding its footprint in the Greater Toronto Area.   "This acquisition marks an exciting step forward in our continued growth," said Bob Steiner, CEO of Alsco Uniforms. "We're proud to welcome the employees and customers of Topper Linen to Alsco Uniforms. As a 135-year-old, family-owned company with deep Canadian roots, we understand the value of long-standing relationships and appreciate the trust Topper has built in the Toronto community. We look forward to building on that legacy and delivering reliable, consistent, and exceptional service."  "We are confident our customers will be excited that Alsco Uniforms brings the same values of service and partnership that Topper always upheld," said Tim Topornicki, President of Topper Linen and Uniform Service, who has spent 46 years committed to service excellence in the Toronto market.
