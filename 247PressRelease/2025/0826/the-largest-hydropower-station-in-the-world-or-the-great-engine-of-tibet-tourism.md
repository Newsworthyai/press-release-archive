# The largest hydropower station in the world, or the great engine of Tibet tourism?

LHASA, CHINA, August 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In July 2025, the groundbreaking ceremony of the Yarlung Zangbo River downstream hydropower project was grandly held in Nyingchi, Tibet. This project, with a total investment of approximately 1.2 trillion yuan, is set to construct five cascade power stations. Once completed, it will not only play a significant role in the energy landscape but also have far-reaching impacts on Tibet tourism. For those planning a tibet tour, these developments will undoubtedly shape new experiences in Tibet area.​  The Magnitude of Investment and Its Significance​  The Yarlung Zangbo River downstream hydropower project is a colossal undertaking, poised to be recognized as the world biggest hydropower Station complex upon completion. The 1.2-trillion-yuan investment is a clear indication of the Chinese government's determination and long-term vision. This substantial investment will not only drive the construction of the power stations themselves but also have a multiplier effect on the local economy.​  During the construction period, it will directly create a large number of job opportunities. It is estimated that tens of thousands of workers will be attracted to participate in the construction, including engineers, technicians, construction workers, and support staff. These job opportunities will not only provide income for local residents but also attract labor from other regions, promoting population flow and cultural exchange.​  Moreover, the investment will stimulate the development of related industries. For example, the construction materials industry, such as cement, steel, and building aggregates, will experience a significant boost in demand. The transportation industry will also benefit, as large-scale transportation of construction materials and equipment is required. In addition, the service industry, including catering, accommodation, and logistics, will thrive to meet the needs of the construction personnel, many of whom arrive via the convenient train to tibet routes that connect major cities to the region.​  The Geological Wonders of the Himalayas and the Project Site​  The project is located in the region of the Yarlung Zangbo River's "Great Bend" in Nyingchi, Tibet. This area is adjacent to the majestic Himalayas, which are not only the world's highest mountain range but also a geological wonder. The Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, resulting in extremely complex geological structures.​  The Yarlung Zangbo River has cut through the Himalayas, creating the world-famous Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon. The natural drop of the river in this section reaches up to 2,350 meters, making it a world-class hydropower "rich mine." The construction team needs to drill tunnels through the Himalayan foothills, dealing with issues such as high-intensity earthquake activities, plateau canyons, and landslides. But with advanced technology and rich experience, they are gradually overcoming these difficulties.​  Transportation Improvements​  The construction of the hydropower project has also promoted the improvement of transportation in Nyingchi. The number of flights to Nyingchi has increased. Airlines have added more routes and flights to meet the growing demand for transportation, whether it is for construction personnel or tourists. In addition, the train to tibet can reach Lhasa, and the Nyingchi to Lhasa train journey takes about 4 hours, offering a scenic and comfortable way to travel between these two important Tibetan cities. This convenient transportation network makes it easier for tourists to travel to Nyingchi and explore the surrounding scenic spots, boosting Nyingchi tour.​  Tibet Tours, including Nyingchi, Are Booming​  Since the ceremony of the Yarlung Zangbo River downstream hydropower project was held in Nyingchi, Tibet, the search volume of Tibet tour, Nyingchi tour, Tibet flights, Nyingchi flights and related tourism topics have increased significantly. The search volume of keywords including the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, Basum Tso lake, and Laigu Glacier has increased by 40% year on year. The search volume of "summer tourism" has soared by nearly 200% month on month. The help posts of the social platform "Recommending a cool city" have soared. As the location of the Yarlung Zangbo River downstream hydropower Station, Nyingchi has become one of the core summer destinations due to the cool climate of the average summer temperature of 17 ℃ – 26 ℃. Lhasa ranks among the top 2 summer destinations in China. Although Tibet, where Nyingchi is located, is not listed separately, as the core area of summer resort, the demand for flights rises synchronously, and the passenger flow from Kunming to Nyingchi increases significantly. The combination of summer vacation needs and engineering topics has made Nyingchi a dark horse in western tourism this summer. Experts predict that with the continuous spread of topics related to Tibet tours such as Nyingchi tour and Laigu glacier tour, the number of tourists in Tibet, including Laigu glacier tour and Mt. Everest tour, will increase by more than 20% year on year this winter.  According to Deepseek's prediction, the passenger flow growth rate at Nyingchi will exceed 30% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025; In the fourth quarter, under the influence of the superposition effect of winter policies and engineering hotspots, winter tourists who have been mainly demanding glacier tours and Everest tours increased by 80% year on year, hotel occupancy is expected to increase from 35% in the off-season to 60%, and the total number of tourists in Tibet is expected to increase by 15% – 20% year on year in 2025, even higher. Finding reliable travel agencies like Guide Tibet will help travelers lock in the best itinerary and route in advance.​  Scenic Spots in Nyingchi​  Basum Tso Lake: This beautiful lake is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and lush forests.

The huge ice masses, with their blue-white luster, are extremely spectacular. Tourists can get close to the glaciers, feel the cold air from the ice, and appreciate the magic of nature.​  Ranwu Lake: It is a lake formed by a landslide. The lake water changes color with the seasons and weather, sometimes blue, sometimes green. The surrounding scenery, including snow-capped mountains, forests, and grasslands, makes it a favorite spot for photographers.​  The hydropower project itself will also become a new tourist attraction. The large-scale construction sites, the majestic power station buildings, and the advanced hydropower facilities will attract many tourists who are interested in engineering wonders. In the future, industrial tourism and eco-tourism combining the project and the natural scenery of southeastern Tibet may emerge, further enriching the local tourism products available to those on a tibet tour.​  As reported, the peak period of this project will attract 200000 construction personnel and their families to stay on site, with an average annual derived tourism consumption demand of over 3 billion yuan. The Yarlung Zangbo River downstream hydropower station is not only the largest hydropower station in the world, but also the great engine of Tibet tourism!
