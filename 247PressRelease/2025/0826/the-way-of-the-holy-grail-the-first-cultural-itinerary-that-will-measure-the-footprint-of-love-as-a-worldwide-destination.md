# THE WAY OF THE HOLY GRAIL, THE FIRST CULTURAL ITINERARY THAT WILL MEASURE THE FOOTPRINT OF LOVE AS A WORLDWIDE DESTINATION

VALENCIA, SPAIN, August 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On August 14 and 15, 2025, the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco (Mexico) hosted the XI International Scientific-Professional Congress on Cultural Tourism, one of the most prestigious academic meetings regarding tourism, culture and sustainability worldwide. In this framework, the World Network of Solidarity, Smart, Regenerative and Circular Routes, developed by Dr. Fernando Molina Pons, was presented for the first time in academic circles, as well as the innovative metric of the "Love Footprint in Destination", created by Dr. Ana Mafé García, president of the International Association Cultural Itinerary The Way of the Holy Grail in Europe: https://elcaminodelsantogrial.eu/  The proposal was extremely well-received by the international scientific and academic community, as it proposed a new way of measuring the positive impact of tourism. In the same way that the CO₂ Footprint is quantified, this new concept allows for the evaluation of travellers' ethical, supportive, and transformative contributions to destinations.  A congress of the highest international level The meeting was attended by an exceptional Honorary Committee, composed of His Excellency Mr. Javier May Rodríguez, Governor of the State of Tabasco, Mexico, Rector Magnificent Dr. Guillermo Narváez Osorio of the Autonomous Juárez University of Tabasco in Mexico and Rector Magnificus Dr. Fabio Gómez Estern of Loyola University in Spain.  Also participating were prominent members of the Organizing Committee such as Dr. Mª Genoveva Millán Vázquez de la Torre, from Loyola University Andalusia in Spain, Dr. José Juan Paz Reyes, director of the Academic Division of Economic and Administrative Sciences (DACEA), Dr. Ana Bertha Vidal Focil, from the Juárez Autonomous University of Tabasco in Mexico, Dr. Mª Genoveva Dancausa Millán, from the University of Córdoba in Spain and Secretary of the Congress.  Also present from across the Atlantic were Dr. Víctor Roque from Portugal, Dr. Aziz Sair from Morocco, and Ms. Esther Santillana Reinoso, who supports 'The Way of the Holy Grail' from Spain through the cultural programme she runs at the Losan Clinical Optical Center #verysentirlacultura: https://opticaclinicalosan.es/servicios-optica-valencia/  Present on behalf of the International Scientific Commission for the Study of the Holy Grail: https://comisioncientificainternacionaldeestudiosdelsantogrial.com/ were Dr. Amada Torres González, an expert in Didactics and professor at the National Technological Institute of Mexico's Sierra region campus, and Dr. Katya Meredith García Quevedo, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who works at the Center for Research in Environmental Geography.  As stated on the official congress website: https://www.congresointernacionalturismoculturalcitc.com/ this forum has established itself over its eleven editions as a global benchmark, bringing together researchers, managers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers in the cultural tourism sector, with a clear commitment to sustainability and innovation.  A new vision: purpose-driven tourism in Aragon and the Valencian Community The Global Network of Solidarity, Smart, Regenerative, and Circular Routes proposes a global itinerary model that integrates heritage, sustainability, technological innovation, and solidarity. Under this vision, tourists become solidarity travellers, capable of leaving a positive mark on the destination, beyond their simple economic impact.  In this context, the Destination Love Footprint represents a pioneering metric for objectively quantifying how visitors contribute to the social, cultural, and environmental well-being of the communities that host them.  "We need tourism with a purpose, capable of leaving a footprint of love at the destination, at the same level as we measure the CO₂ footprint," Dr. Ana Mafé García emphasized during her presentation.  The CUBES: levers to accelerate the regenerative transition The implementation of this academic and practical vision is articulated within the fractal structure of the World Wide Web, whose central axis is the RegenEra Tur IA CUBE model. This model already has notable support in the DTI CUBES of Benidorm, Altea and La Nucía (scheduled for launch on September 12 ), as well as in the RUTA CUBES, which integrates pioneering initiatives such as The Way of the Holy Grail —from Masamagrell—and the Biosilk Route in Buñol.  The CUBES are emerging as new levers for accelerating the transition toward regenerative and circular tourism, offering a living, replicable architecture that connects destinations, routes, and communities with sustainable and supportive innovation.  A novel contribution to tourism The brilliant reception at the 11th International Scientific-Professional Congress on Cultural Tourism demonstrates that the future of tourism lies in integrating regenerative and supportive metrics and consolidating innovative governance models such as the CUBES.  With these contributions, the Global Network led by Dr. Molina and the metrics created by Dr. Mafé are consolidated as international milestones destined to transform the way we understand and practice tourism in the 21st century.
