# What is an IP Superscript?

NEW YORK, NY, April 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The IP Superscript is the unique certification mark created and owned by Instant IP™. Its use signifies that the corresponding expression (words, phrases, chart, graph, etc.) has been protected by Instant IP™ via smart contract. Instant IP™ is designed with the patented smart contract solution (US Patent: 11,928,748) which creates an immutable time-stamped first layer and fast layer identifying the moment in time an idea is filed on the blockchain. This solution can be used in defending intellectual property protection. Infringing upon the respective intellectual property i.e. IP is subject to and punishable in a court of law. Please see Terms and Conditions for additional information.  Instant IP™ was founded by Dr. Kary Oberbrunner, a Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestselling author of more than a dozen books. As CEO of Igniting Souls® and Instant IP™, he helps abundant-minded and coachable-competent entrepreneurs publish, protect, and promote their intellectual property and turn it into 18 streams of income so they can change the world. Dr. Oberbrunner has been featured in major media outlets such as Entrepreneur, Forbes, CBS, and Fox News. His TEDx talk on blockchain and intellectual property protection has garnered over 1 million views. He also serves as the Berry Chair of Entrepreneurship at Cedarville University, where he teaches on entrepreneurship and digital marketing.  Traditional methods of protecting intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks, are often time-consuming and costly. Instant IP™ addresses this challenge by providing immediate, affordable protection through its patented blockchain-based solution. By creating an immutable, time-stamped record of an idea, Instant IP™ establishes a first-to-use or first-to-file event, offering a first and fast layer of defense for creators and entrepreneurs.  It's important to note that Instant IP™ does not replace traditional patents or trademarks. Instead, it serves as an initial protective measure, allowing innovators to safeguard their ideas instantly and affordably while pursuing more comprehensive protections.  For entrepreneurs, Instant IP™ democratizes access to intellectual property protection, enabling them to secure their innovations promptly without the prohibitive costs and delays associated with traditional methods. This empowerment fosters a more dynamic and innovative business environment, encouraging the development and sharing of new ideas.
