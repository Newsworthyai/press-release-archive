# Bestselling Author Jody Sharpe Announces New Article, Bestselling Status For '20 Moon Road'

WILMINGTON, NC, April 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today's headlines are filled with turmoil and conflict. Something seems to be missing. Is this ongoing tension and discord the future we want for our children? If not, what can we do to change it?  When children experience love, they are more likely to develop strong social skills, empathy, and a positive self-image. This naturally leads to healthier relationships, reduced conflict, and a greater sense of community. Love inspires acts of kindness and generosity, which can ripple outwards, creating a more harmonious and supportive world. By instilling these values, we ensure that future generations are equipped to handle life's challenges.  In a recent article titled "The Angels Inspire My Words," Sharpe wrote in part:  In our world where turmoil persists, the inspirations from the angels have led me to write the following. In one hundred years from now all that will matter to many of us human beings on earth is that we tried to pass our love to our children and grandchildren. We are all watching how the bullies of the world try to break peace and the promise of a harmonious future.  On our fragile God's green earth each of us can make a difference. Passing the love on will be for me a message of hope for a future for my loved ones. The greedy, the narcissists clearly don't understand what they are missing and that as bullies they will never win.  We must pray for our world, pass the love around to our family and friends with kindness toward all others. Love is more powerful than hate.  The full text of the article is available at https://jodysharpe.com/blog.  Sharpe also announced that the ebook version of book 6 in the Mystic Bay Series, '20 Moon Rd., An Angel's Tale' recently achieved bestseller status. The book took First Place nationally in the novella category in the 2023 in the NFPW Professional Communication Contest.  In '20 Moon Rd., the bully never wins.

With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away.
