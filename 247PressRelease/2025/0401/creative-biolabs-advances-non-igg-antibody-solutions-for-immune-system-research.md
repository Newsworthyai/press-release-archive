# Creative Biolabs Advances Non-IgG Antibody Solutions for Immune System Research

SHIRLEY, NY, April 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the past several years, non-IgG antibodies have shown potential benefits in the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and inflammation and have become crucial for biopharmaceutics and antibody development. Creative Biolabs has been dedicated to ensuring professional non-IgG antibody production and purification services to international clients, including the production of IgE, IgA, and IgM antibodies, thus fostering non-IgG antibody innovations.  IgE: Emerging Immunotherapy Following market trends, Creative Biolabs has focused on IgE recently, as it has distinctive immune activator functions that give IgE the tantalizing potential in the development of pharmaceutical antiglobulin preparations. Armed with proprietary recombinant DNA technology and expression system platforms, Creative Biolabs has progressively increased the efficiency and stability with which high-quality IgE antibodies are produced for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.  "We have optimized the expression system for IgE, including CHO and HEK293 cells, to ensure high expression levels and stability," said an antibody development expert at Creative Biolabs. "In purification, we use a combination of strategies such as affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography to overcome the purification challenges of IgE, ensuring high purity and potency of the final product."  IgM and Its Relation to Prolific Research Demands IgM is an antibody that plays significant roles in the primary immune response and immune surveillance. Creative Biolabs has effective methods for IgM antibody production utilizing CHO, HEK293, and myeloma cell lines and can further adjust the structures of produced pentameric or hexameric IgMs to ensure optimal biological activity per the customer's requirements.   "Due to its large molecular weight, IgM purification is more complicated. We have some methods like three-step CHT/AIX/CIX, two-step PEG/AIX, and SXC that offer a good balance of high recovery rates and purity, thereby allowing the product to meet preclinical study standards," shared the expert.   IgA: Advancing Mucosal Immunity Antibody Development IgA is gaining attention for its role in mucosal immunity and its potential in targeted therapy. Creative Biolabs focuses on developing monomeric and dimeric IgA from CHO, myeloma, and BHK cell expression systems to ensure optimal production of IgA antibodies for fundamental studies as well as in the field of medicinal products.  To help with IgA purification, Creative Biolabs implements multiple techniques, which include lectin chromatography, peptide M affinity chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. Of these, peptide M affinity chromatography is the most notable due to its high selectivity and ability to produce considerable amounts of purified IgA, making it ideal for downstream distinct applications.  "We are dedicated to providing non-IgG antibody solutions that are high quality and scalable to meet the growing needs in the field of antibody research. Our development and purification platforms are suitable for meeting the demands of different stages of research and preclinical work for immunotherapy."
