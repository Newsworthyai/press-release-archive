# Kansas City Native, Allen Brooks Releases New Country Music Video

KANSAS CITY, MO, March 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Allen Brooks proudly announces the official release of the music video for his latest single, "Dreams Of Make Believe." This long-awaited video premiered on March 19, 2025, and is now available for viewing on his main website and YouTube channel. Written years ago, the song was finally recorded in 2023 with the help of top studio musicians from around the world. It blends contemporary country elements with a melodic twist, delivering a crisp and modern sound that highlights the classic spirit of the genre, while updating it to fresh contemporary standards seamlessly.   "Dreams Of Make Believe" reflects Brooks's journey as a professional musician in the American Midwest. The music video follows the life of a local songwriter, played by Brooks himself, who holds on tightly to hope, hard work, and the power of faith in his craft. The video's storyline captures the ups and downs of a performer striving for success while staying true to his roots. Viewers witness the camaraderie of friends, the comfort of an ice-cold beer, and the freedom of the open road. Lyrics such as "Living On Dreams Of Make Believe" and "They Sent Me An Angel" add emotional depth, inviting listeners to imagine their own paths and triumphs.   Ultimately, this is a true ode to following dreams and working hard to make them happen! For this reason, the imagery of the music video, as well as the song lyrics, will immediately resonate with fans who appreciate heartfelt storytelling. Brooks has a unique way of telling stories, reminiscent of legendary artists like Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, and Glen Campbell. Modern audiences who enjoy Jelly Roll or Dwight Yoakam will also find inspiration in Brooks's fresh approach and authentic vibe.   Allen Brooks is sending a powerful message to his audience: a strong reminder that dreams beg to be followed!   "Dreams Of Make Believe," is a testament to determination and love, and how these forces can indeed make the impossible seem real. By sharing his story through memorable melodies and down-to-earth themes, Brooks continues to honor the country tradition while forging a modern path of his own.  I grew up in Grandview, Missouri and after serving in the US Navy (1980-1984), I toured America as a professional musician most of my adult life. Here are some of the bands that I have been an official member of: 'Fianc√©', 'Bishop Steel', 'Roxx Gang', 'Mojo Gurus', 'Walter', 'The Blessed Virgin Larry', 'Hagas', 'Satisfaction' (Rolling Stones Tribute Band), 'Armure De Ruisseaux', 'Brick Top Social Club', 'Jett Blakk', 'A Circle Of Faith' and Psychodelic Caravan. While performing with the above-mentioned bands, I made incredible friendships while sharing stages coast to coast with many artists including Dr. Hook, The Kentucky Headhunters, Steppenwolf, Lou Gramm's Foreigner, Head East, George Lynch, Black Oak Arkansas, Ratt, Molly Hatchet, Silento, Jimmie VanZandt, Killer Dwarfs, Bernie Williams (NY Yankees), Henry Lee Summer, Spread Eagle, Scatterbrain, Daisy Berkowitz and Jackyl.
