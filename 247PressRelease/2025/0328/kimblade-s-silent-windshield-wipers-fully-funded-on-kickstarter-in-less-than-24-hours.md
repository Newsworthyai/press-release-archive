SACRAMENTO, CA, March 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Kimblade, the innovative leader in automotive wiper technology, has done it again. The company's latest breakthrough, Kimblade X, launched on Kickstarter on March 17, 2025, and surpassed its funding goal in just hours—marking Kimblade's fifth successfully funded Kickstarter campaign and reinforcing its reputation for high-performance, game-changing wiper solutions.  Silent, Superior Wiping Kimblade X isn't just another wiper—it's a premium upgrade designed to enhance any vehicle. Say goodbye to chattering, squeaking, and disruptive reversal thuds. Engineered for truly noise-free operation, Kimblade X delivers an unmatched smooth and quiet wiping experience.  Revolutionary Design for Long-Lasting Performance Traditional wipers fail due to their outdated inverted triangular design, which causes blade tips to deform over time, leading to streaks and poor performance. Kimblade X solves this with a rectangular blade structure that maintains its shape, ensuring consistent, streak-free wiping. Made from premium silicone, Kimblade X resists corrosion and wear, outlasting conventional wipers.  Replace and Forget – A Long-Term Investment Unlike standard wipers that require frequent replacements, Kimblade X is built to last significantly longer, saving drivers money over time. With durable materials and precision engineering, Kimblade X ensures optimal visibility and safety without the hassle of constant upkeep.  Universal Compatibility No matter the make or model of your vehicle, Kimblade X is designed for seamless compatibility. Kimblade has done the research so backers can pledge with confidence, knowing these wipers will fit their cars perfectly.
