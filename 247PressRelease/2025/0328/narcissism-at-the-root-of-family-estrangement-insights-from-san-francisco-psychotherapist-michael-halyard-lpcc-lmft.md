# Narcissism at the Root of Family Estrangement: Insights from San Francisco psychotherapist Michael Halyard, LPCC, LMFT

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, March 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a compelling series of articles on family dynamics, Michael Halyard, LPCC, LMFT, reveals that narcissism is at the heart of nearly all cases of family estrangement. According to Halyard, the toxic patterns often emerge from two distinct yet equally damaging scenarios: narcissists devaluing and ultimately severing ties with family members, or the survivors of narcissistic abuse reaching a point where they can no longer tolerate the emotional harm caused by a narcissistic family member.

"In many situations, the narcissist initiates the rift by systematically devaluing the family scapegoat, stripping away their sense of worth. By the time they are cut out of the family system by estrangement, they have endured years of emotional abuse and neglect by the other family members," says San Francisco therapist Michael Halyard.  "Yet in other cases, family estrangement is not merely a breakdown in communication—it's a defense mechanism that arises in response to ongoing narcissistic behaviors," explains Halyard. In these cases, it is the victim who, after enduring relentless emotional abuse, must choose to disengage in order to preserve their own mental health."   Halyard runs the Facebook pages https://www.facebook.com/estrangement.project and https://www.facebook.com/NarcissisticAbuseTherapy. His website is https://sanfrancisco-psychotherapy.com/  Drawing on years of clinical experience and observation, Halyard emphasizes that narcissism, whether overt or subtle, creates an environment where healthy relationships are undermined by manipulation and self-centered behavior. He notes that understanding these dynamics is crucial for families seeking to rebuild or redefine their relationships in healthier, more supportive ways.  "Narcissists don't realize they are narcissists, and they are the ones causing the problems. Their defense mechanisms prevent them from realizing that anything is wrong with them. As a result, they deflect blame, and hold other people responsible for any family dysfunction."  For example, a narcissistic parent may gaslight their adult child, completely lying about something they said when both parties were present. When the adult child reacts with anger, the narcissistic parent becomes dumbfounded, plays the victim, and blames the adult child for becoming "emotionally volatile."  In another scenario, the narcissistic parent may be criticized for their extremely self-centered behavior. The narcissist is incapable of seeing any faults in themselves, and erupts in a "narcissistic rage," feeling that they are being attacked. The narcissist themselves lacked "good enough parenting" in their own childhood that would allow them to withstand any criticism, instead criticism acts as a "narcissistic wound" piercing their defenses, often bringing forth feelings of shame and inadequacy.  "Recognizing the patterns of narcissistic abuse in family relationships is the first step towards healing," Halyard adds. "It is important for both those who have been targeted by narcissistic behavior and those who may be unwittingly complicit in these dynamics to seek guidance and professional support. Healing often begins with setting boundaries, including internal boundaries and reclaiming one's sense of self."  Halyard's insights offer a transformative perspective for families struggling with estrangement, challenging the notion that such separations are merely the result of miscommunication or differing life paths. Instead, he posits that narcissistic dynamics create a pervasive atmosphere of toxicity that ultimately forces a choice—whether to perpetuate the abuse or to break free for the sake of one's well-being.
