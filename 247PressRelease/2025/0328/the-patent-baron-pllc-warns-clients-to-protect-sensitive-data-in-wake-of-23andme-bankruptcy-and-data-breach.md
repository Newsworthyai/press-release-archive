# The Patent Baron PLLC Warns Clients to Protect Sensitive Data in Wake of 23andMe Bankruptcy and Data Breach

DETROIT, MI, March 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In light of recent developments involving the bankruptcy of genetic testing company 23andMe and the prior data breach exposing the information of nearly seven million Americans, The Patent Baron PLLC is urging its clients to take immediate steps to safeguard not only their personal data—but also their intellectual property.  "As patent and IP professionals, we understand how sensitive personal data and intellectual property can be permanently intertwined," said a spokesperson for The Patent Baron. "When your genetic information is compromised, it's not just your health data—it's information that can implicate family lineage, inheritance, and even IP-related discoveries in biotech and diagnostics. These are all data points that can be used, misused, or monetized without your consent."  On March 23, 2025, 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a move that raises serious questions about how consumer data—particularly genetic data—will be handled moving forward. While the company claims operations will continue as usual, the Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has strongly advised users to consider deleting their accounts and requesting the destruction of stored data and DNA samples.  The Patent Baron encourages all clients—especially inventors, scientists, and entrepreneurs in the biotech and health-related sectors—to evaluate whether they have used 23andMe or similar platforms and take the following actions immediately:  1. Delete Your 23andMe Data Log in to your account, navigate to "Settings," scroll to "23andMe Data," and click "Permanently Delete Data." Confirm your request via the follow-up email.  2. Destroy Stored DNA Samples Update your preferences in the "Settings" section under "Preferences" to request the destruction of your physical DNA sample.  3. Revoke Research Consent Withdraw any previous consent allowing your data to be shared with third-party researchers through "Research and Product Consents" in your account settings.  For full details, visit 23andMe's official support site.  "Our clients trust us to protect their ideas—and that means raising the alarm when systems meant to keep sensitive data secure are at risk," the firm stated. "Don't wait until your personal or genetic information becomes an IP liability."  Clients with questions about how data breaches may impact their existing or future IP protections are encouraged to contact The Patent Baron PLLC directly for a confidential consultation.
