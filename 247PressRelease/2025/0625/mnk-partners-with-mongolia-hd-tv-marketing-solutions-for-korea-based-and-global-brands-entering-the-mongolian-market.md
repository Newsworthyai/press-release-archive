# MNK Partners with Mongolia HD TV: Marketing Solutions for Korea-Based and Global Brands Entering the Mongolian Market

NEW YORK, NY, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As part of its mission to strengthen global business ties and create new pathways for Korean companies abroad, MNK has announced a strategic collaboration with Mongolia HD TV, the country's top broadcasting network. The partnership was formalized during a high-level meeting in Ulaanbaatar between Kim Jin-soo, Executive Director of Global Marketing at MNK, and Khureltulga, CEO of Mongolia HD TV.  A New Generation of Mongolian Broadcasting Leadership  Khureltulga, who assumed the role of CEO at the young age of 31, is at the forefront of one of Mongolia's most dynamic and fastest-growing industries: content media. Since taking the helm, he has driven significant innovation and transformation within Mongolia HD TV, positioning the network as a leader in delivering high-quality, engaging programming tailored to local audiences.  Under his visionary leadership, Mongolia HD TV has successfully acquired, localized, and broadcast internationally acclaimed formats such as Shark Tank, The Voice, and the popular legal drama Suits. These adaptations have not only introduced Mongolian viewers to world-class entertainment but also achieved remarkable ratings and audience engagement, reflecting the network's deep understanding of local tastes and cultural nuances. Khureltulga's strategic direction emphasizes blending global content trends with Mongolia's unique cultural identity, thereby strengthening the network's competitive edge and expanding its influence both domestically and regionally.  A Focused Approach to Content Creation and Distribution  Dedicated exclusively to content production and distribution, Mongolia HD TV has carved out a strong niche in the media landscape by focusing on multiple platforms including traditional television, OTT (over-the-top) streaming services, and its own in-house production studios. This multi-channel approach enables the network to deliver diverse and high-quality content tailored to various audience preferences, ensuring accessibility whether viewers watch on broadcast TV or online streaming platforms.  Mongolia HD TV's official YouTube channel, MongoliaTV, exemplifies its digital outreach success, boasting over 349,000 subscribers—a remarkable figure that represents nearly 10% of Mongolia's total population. The channel offers a wide range of content, from entertainment and lifestyle shows to news and cultural programming, engaging viewers both within the country and among the Mongolian diaspora globally. This strong digital presence not only enhances viewer engagement but also opens up new revenue streams and partnership opportunities for the network.  Cross-Border Content Collaboration Through Influencer Partnerships  During the meeting, MNK put forward an exciting proposal to launch collaborative content projects that bring together influential creators from both Korea and Mongolia. This initiative aims to leverage the unique strengths and cultural perspectives of influencers from both countries, creating innovative content that resonates deeply with audiences on a cultural level. By blending diverse storytelling styles and creative approaches, the partnership seeks to produce engaging media that appeals not only locally but also to a broader global audience.  Kim Jin-soo emphasized the strategic potential of this collaboration, stating, "By combining creative talent from both markets, we believe this partnership can generate culturally resonant content with global appeal." Through these joint projects, MNK aims to significantly expand its presence and influence not only within Mongolia but throughout the larger Asian region. This cross-border cooperation is expected to open up new opportunities for content distribution, brand growth, and audience engagement, fostering stronger cultural and business ties between the two nations.  Fueling the Korean Wave: A Strategic Bridge Between Korea and Mongolia  MNK also intends to collaborate closely with leading Korean production studios to deliver premium-quality content tailored specifically for the Mongolian market. By bringing Korea's rich creative expertise and cutting-edge production capabilities into the partnership, MNK aims to offer diverse programming that not only entertains but also reflects the evolving tastes and cultural interests of Mongolian audiences. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to deepen the reach of the Korean Wave (Hallyu) throughout Central Asia, enhancing the visibility and influence of Korean culture via compelling digital storytelling.  Beyond content creation, the partnership is poised to unlock significant synergistic opportunities by bridging MNK's extensive network of over 2,300 client companies with Mongolia HD TV's robust and wide-ranging media infrastructure. This connection will facilitate new collaborations, marketing ventures, and distribution channels that benefit both parties. Through these combined strengths, MNK and Mongolia HD TV envision fostering a vibrant ecosystem of cultural exchange and commercial growth, ultimately strengthening ties between Korea and Mongolia on multiple fronts.
