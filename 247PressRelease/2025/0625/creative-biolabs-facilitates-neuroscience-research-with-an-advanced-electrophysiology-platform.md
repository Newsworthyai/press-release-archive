# Creative Biolabs Facilitates Neuroscience Research with an Advanced Electrophysiology Platform

SHIRLEY, NY, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Electrode chip technology and calcium signaling play central roles in advancing neuroscience research by enabling precise monitoring and stimulation of neuronal activity. Their applications include neural interfaces, brain-machine interactions, and disease modeling, advancing neurotherapeutic breakthroughs. Creative Biolabs aims to provide researchers with high-performance tools to explore neuronal activity and therapeutic development solutions.  "Calcium assays are valuable tools for measuring pharmacological agents and their effects on calcium signaling pathways," said a scientist at Creative Biolabs. "Our calcium assay can handle many types of samples, including cultured neurons, brain slices, and purified cells from different regions of the nervous system. We can also handle samples derived from animal models or human cell lines."  Creative Biolabs possesses an advanced electrophysiology platform, enabling recording of neuronal electrophysiological activity in real time for extended periods of time, used for drug efficacy analysis, high-throughput drug screening, and research of the neural cell network.  "We utilize the newest system, enabling researchers to obtain stable and consistent electrophysiological results. In addition, our customizable processes ensure experimental accuracy and flexibility, meeting certain requirements of research," described the scientist.  Other than electrophysiology, our electrode chip platform integrates advanced microfluidic techniques to facilitate neuroscience research. These include: • Cell Capture and Sorting: Electric fields are utilized to control, capture, sort, and purify cells directly, facilitating efficient experimental protocols. • Organ Chips: Through the integration of metal electrodes and customized microfluidic components, our organ chips replicate the microenvironment of living organisms and facilitate the culture and study of cells, tissues, and organs within physiologically relevant conditions.  Creative Biolabs remains committed to its mission of delivering specialized solutions to the evolving needs of neuroscience scientists. Our innovative technologies empower the tools for paradigm-shifting discoveries in neuropharmacology.
