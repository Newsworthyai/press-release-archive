SAN FRANCISCO, CA, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lake Tahoe boating accident lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been handling boating accidents and other serious accidents & injuries for over 30 years. Their experienced personal injury attorneys have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for boating accidents victims and other types of accident and injury victims. The boating accident that occurred on 06/21/2025 may have been preventable but the details are unclear at this time. Storm conditions including high winds estimated to be around 30 knots and wind waves between 6- 8 feet came up very quickly leaving many boaters on the water and unprepared for the severity of the storm. These types of conditions can happen faster than people think and the waves can grow in size and intensity within minutes.   Wrongful death attorneys at The Wagner Law Group report that on Tuesday 06/24/25 authorities released the names of the victims of people who were onboard the 27' Chris Craft power boat at approximately 3 p.m. on Saturday. One of the victims was Joshua Antony Pickles, 37 years old, from San Francisco, he was a Door Dash Executive. Door Dash issued a statement that says in part, "Josh loved his team and was an inspiration to everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. During his nearly seven years at DoorDash, he brought a contagious spirit that lifted those around him. The loss of Josh is immeasurable. We miss him deeply and will carry his memory with us always."  This tragedy involved someone who was easily recognizable through a simple Google search but also involved 7 other human beings with a large network of friends and loved ones who are affected by this terrible loss. Joshua was with both of his parents and his uncle. Here is a list of the deceased individuals:  • Joshua Antony Pickles, 37 years old, from San Francisco • Paula Bozinovich, 71 years old, from Redwood City • Terry Pickles, 73 years old, from Redwood City • Peter Bayes, 72 years old, from Lincoln • Timothy O'Leary, 71 years old, from Auburn • Theresa Giullari, 66 years old, from Honeoye, NY • James Guck, 69 years old, from Honeoye, NY • Stephen Lindsay, 63 years old, from Springwater, NY  "This is a tragedy, like all tragedies it is important to examine the facts and determine how this could have been avoided. It is equally important to make certain that if someone else is responsible for the loss of life, property damage or injuries that they are held accountable," says Buth Wagner, Personal Injury Lawyer & Founder of The Wagner Law Group.  Boating and brain injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have collected hundreds of millions of dollars for accident victims including boating incidents. This particular incident involved a 27-foot Chris Craft vessel. Authorities have yet to release the condition of the 2 survivors who were pulled from the water after a multi-agency response was initiated which was triggered by a 911 call.   "We still don't know the fall out from this severe weather phenomenon. There could be other capsized boats and other people hurt or killed that weren't visible to witnesses. The property damage associated with all of the boats colliding or washing up on shore is still yet to be determined. It will take time to sort out how this tragedy could have been minimized and who may be to blame for any unsafe or irresponsible behavior," says Wagner. Butch and his team have opened up their Personal Injury Lawyer Hotline to anybody affected by this severe storm.
