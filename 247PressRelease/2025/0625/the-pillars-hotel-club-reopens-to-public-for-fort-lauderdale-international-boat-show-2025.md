# The Pillars Hotel &amp; Club Reopens to Public for Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show 2025

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After several years of exclusive use by one of the world's leading custom superyacht builders during the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show (FLIBS), The Pillars Hotel & Club is pleased to announce that it will once again welcome individual reservations for the 2025 show, taking place October 29 – November 2, 2025.  Ideally situated just steps from the North Entrance of FLIBS, The Pillars Hotel & Club has long been a sought-after destination for yachting enthusiasts, marine industry executives, and luxury travelers. In recent years, the entire property was reserved exclusively for a major superyacht brand and its VIP clientele, leading to the misconception that the hotel was closed to the public during show dates.  For FLIBS 2025, The Pillars returns to its roots of boutique hospitality—offering a rare opportunity for individual guests to stay at one of Fort Lauderdale's most iconic hideaways during the world's leading yachting event.  "We're thrilled to reopen our doors to discerning travelers and boat show guests from around the globe," said the hotel's General Manager. "Our location—just minutes from the North Entrance—combined with personalized service and serene ambiance makes The Pillars the perfect retreat for those seeking both luxury and convenience during FLIBS."  What Guests Can Expect at The Pillars Hotel & Club:  Unrivaled Location – Among the closest accommodations to the FLIBS North Entrance, allowing guests seamless access to the show.  Boutique Comfort – 24 individually styled rooms and suites, outfitted with Frette linens, pillowtop mattresses, and picturesque views of the Intracoastal Waterway or lush gardens.  Exceptional Dining – The Secret Garden, the hotel's exclusive restaurant, offers nightly gourmet dinners with alfresco, waterside seating.  Peaceful Setting – Enjoy tranquil gardens, dockside cocktails, and a relaxed atmosphere, just far enough from the bustle of the show.  Beachside Access – Just a short stroll to Fort Lauderdale Beach and the vibrant Las Olas Boulevard.  Limited Availability – Book Early!  Rooms during FLIBS week (October 29 – November 2, 2025) are expected to sell out quickly. Reserve now to secure your stay at Fort Lauderdale's most exclusive boutique hotel, steps from the action.

A proud member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World, The Pillars Hotel & Club has been recognized as the "Best Small & Exclusive Hotel in North and South America" by Condé Nast Johansens 2025. The hotel is renowned for its personalized service, elegant accommodations, and prime waterfront location in the heart of Fort Lauderdale.
