# Kavalan Wins Whisky of the Year at 2025 International Whisky Competition

LAS VEGAS, NV, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The International Whisky Competition Committee is proud to announce the official results of its 16th edition, held in Louisville, Kentucky. This year's event took place at two iconic venues—the Evan Williams Bourbon Experience and the Louisville Thoroughbred Society—bringing together the world's finest whiskies for a rigorous and impartial judging process.  Since its reformatting in 2015, the International Whisky Competition (IWC) has become a definitive benchmark for whisky excellence. All entries were evaluated using a strict double-blind tasting format, with no information provided about origin, category, or ABV.  Top Honors and Recognitions: The coveted Golden Barrel Trophy for Whisky of the Year was awarded to Kavalan Distillery for Kavalan Solist Fino Sherry Single Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky, which achieved an outstanding score of 97.04 points.  Produced in Yilan County, Taiwan, this marks the first time a non-Scottish distillery has claimed the competition's highest honor—further cementing Kavalan's position as a global leader in whisky craftsmanship.  "This award reaffirms Taiwan's place in the whisky world," said Mr. Yu-Ting Lee, Chairman of King Car Kavalan. "It's a testament to our innovation and commitment to quality."  "Kavalan's Solist Fino Sherry stunned the panel with its balance and complexity," added Max A. Solano, IWC Competition Director. "A world-class expression that stood out from the rest."  Tasting notes by Adam Edmonsond, Master of Whisky: "On the nose, it bursts with mango, apricot, and grilled pineapple, layered with almonds, dried figs, and oak spice. The palate offers rich plum, brandied cherries, dark chocolate, and the dry finesse of fino sherry. The finish lingers with coffee, sandalwood, and dried citrus."
