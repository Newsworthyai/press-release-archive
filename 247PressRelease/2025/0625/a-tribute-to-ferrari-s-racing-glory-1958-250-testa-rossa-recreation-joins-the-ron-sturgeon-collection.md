# A Tribute to Ferrari's Racing Glory: 1958 250 Testa Rossa Recreation Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa stands as one of the most celebrated racing machines in motorsport history—an icon of speed, beauty, and championship pedigree. Now, an exquisite recreation of the 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Ross has joined the Ron Sturgeon Collection, offering enthusiasts a breathtaking tribute to Ferrari's golden era.  Originally developed in response to new FIA regulations in late 1957, the 250 TR succeeded the 500 TRC with a more aggressive design and a Colombo Tipo 128 V-12 engine, featuring six twin-choke carburetors. The model went on to help Ferrari secure the 1958 Manufacturers' World Championship—cementing its place among racing legends. With fewer than 35 authentic examples ever built, collectors have sought to revive its spirit through faithful recreations like the one now on display.  This particular tribute is built on a 1982 Ferrari 400i chassis, extensively modified and fitted with hand-shaped aluminum bodywork. Design details include classic pontoon-style fenders, a rear fairing behind the driver's seat, and a period-correct stance that exudes vintage performance. Power comes from a Dino-sourced V6 engine paired with a five-speed manual transmission, ensuring an engaging and visceral driving experience.  "This recreation captures everything enthusiasts love about the original Testa Rossa—the raw elegance, the championship soul, and the daring design," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a stirring homage to Ferrari's racing mastery."  The Ferrari 250 TR recreation is not just a car—it's a reverent nod to history, sculpted in aluminum and steeped in passion.
