# Shifa Therapy Launches Global Muslim Therapist Platform

MISSISSAUGA, ON, June 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With the launch of its website, Shifa Therapy provides a simple, secure way for Muslims around the world to connect with qualified Muslim therapists for online counseling sessions. The platform is designed to provide faith-based counseling services that align with Islamic beliefs.  For many Muslims seeking mental health support, finding a therapist who truly understands their cultural and spiritual values can be a challenge. Language barriers, stigma, cost, and a lack of culturally competent care often prevent individuals and families from getting the help they need.  This gap leaves many silently struggling with issues like anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, trauma, or spiritual distress without access to support that feels safe or aligned with their beliefs.  In countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and across the world, many Muslims face unique challenges in accessing mental health services. Mainstream therapy models often fail to acknowledge or understand Islamic frameworks, leaving Muslim clients feeling judged, alienated, or misunderstood by providers unfamiliar with their cultural or religious contexts.  For Muslim immigrants and first-generation individuals, these barriers are compounded by identity struggles, cultural expectations, and sometimes trauma related to migration or systemic discrimination.  Shifa Therapy, an emerging mental health platform for Muslims, was created to change that.  "Our aim is to create a space where people feel understood not just clinically, but spiritually and culturally," said Ibrahim Hamid, CEO of Shifa Therapy. "The website is a step toward making support more available and less intimidating for those who've felt overlooked by traditional mental health services."  Shifa Therapy offers a global directory of Muslim therapists, flexible scheduling, multilingual options, affordable therapy plans, and support for individuals, couples, and families.  Every session is confidential and delivered by licensed Muslim therapy providers who are trained to approach mental health through both a clinical and faith-sensitive lens.  Affordability is a key pillar of Shifa Therapy's mission. Understanding that cost is often a major barrier to accessing quality mental health care, especially within underserved communities, Shifa Therapy has designed its pricing to be as inclusive as possible.  Therapy sessions on the platform start from just $57, making it one of the most accessible options for Muslims seeking professional, faith-sensitive support. By offering flexible plans and competitive rates, Shifa Therapy ensures that individuals and families don't have to choose between financial stability and emotional well-being.  Shifa Therapy offers a supportive environment for these clients, offering nonjudgmental, affirming care rooted in cultural understanding and clinical expertise.  Whether it's a Muslim student in London coping with campus Islamophobia, a Canadian mother navigating postpartum depression, or a professional in New York seeking identity-affirming care, Shifa Therapy ensures access to therapists who truly "get it."  Shifa Therapy provides Muslim counselling services in multiple languages and time zones, with flexible, affordable plans, making mental wellness more globally accessible than ever before.  To book a therapy session, users can visit the Shifa Therapy website and receive mental health support conveniently from the comfort of their homes.
