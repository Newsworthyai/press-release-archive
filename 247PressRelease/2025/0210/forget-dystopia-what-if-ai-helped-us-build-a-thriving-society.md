SPAIN, February 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  Forget dystopia-what if AI helped us build a thriving society?  New Sci-Fi Novel: Waking Up - A Journey Towards a New Dawn for Humanity  New Sci-Fi Novel Waking Up Offers a Bold Vision: AI as Humanity's Greatest Ally, Not Its Enemy.  As AI development accelerates worldwide, acclaimed filmmaker and author Harald Neslein Sandø presents an optimistic future where AI empowers humanity instead of replacing it.  While most science fiction paints artificial intelligence as a looming threat, the new novel Waking Up challenges this dystopian narrative by offering a radically hopeful vision of AI's potential. Written by Harald Neslein Sandø, Waking Up tells the story of Benjamin Michaels, a man who wakes up from cryonic freezing into a future where AI has helped humanity build a sustainable, thriving society.  "In today's world, AI is often framed as a danger to humanity, but what if it could be our greatest tool for transformation?" says Sandø. "We're at a crossroads where AI can either divide us or unite us. Waking Up explores a future where we get it right."  A Different Kind of AI Story  Unlike traditional sci-fi narratives where AI is the antagonist, Waking Up presents an advanced Global AI that collaborates with humanity, guiding us toward a world free from scarcity, exploitation, and environmental destruction. Through an evolved economic and social system, the novel envisions a society where technology serves as a partner rather than a ruler.  "AI doesn't have to mean control, surveillance, or job loss—it can mean abundance, freedom, and harmony," Sandø explains. "This book is about waking up to new possibilities."  Timely and Relevant  With AI advancements making headlines daily, Waking Up arrives at the perfect time, sparking conversations about the future we truly want. The novel appeals to sci-fi enthusiasts, futurists, and anyone intrigued by the intersection of technology and human potential.
