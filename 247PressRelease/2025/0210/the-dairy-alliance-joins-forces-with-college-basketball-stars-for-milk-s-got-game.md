# The Dairy Alliance Joins Forces with College Basketball Stars for Milk's Got Game

ATLANTA, GA, February 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dunk into better performance this season with Milk's Got Game! The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, is taking to the courts with collegiate basketball superstars to show how dairy milk is the ultimate MVP for your everyday routine. The Spring Hand-Off of Milk's Got Game features basketball players Zamareya "Zam" Jones of North Carolina State, Jaxson Robinson of the University of Kentucky, and Zakai Zeigler of the University of Tennessee. The campaign also spotlights Cory Robbins, a dairy farm manager from Siler City, North Carolina, and Chris Huffman, a dairy farmer from Center, Kentucky.   Through the social media campaign, these athletes will "hand off" to one another by highlighting and educating why dairy milk is a key part of sports nutrition. Packed with natural electrolytes, carbohydrates, and high-quality protein, they'll spotlight how dairy milk powers their performance and encourage their fans to fuel up in the same way.   "North Carolina has a long history of producing great basketball talent and great local dairy products, and we are excited the latest student-athlete and milk partnership with Zam Jones celebrates both," said Steve Troxler, North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture. "We are proud to join with the Dairy Alliance to support North Carolina's dairy industry and women's basketball. Go Pack!"   "We are delighted to partner with these talented college athletes to expand the Milk's Got Game campaign across the Southeast and connect with an even broader student sports community," said Geri Berdak, Chief Executive Officer of The Dairy Alliance. "This campaign provides a unique opportunity to engage with the Gen Z audience through these influential athletes, educating them on the powerful nutritional benefits of dairy milk. Our goal is to empower people of all ages to make more informed nutrition choices while sharing the mission and values of The Dairy Alliance."   Why Choose Dairy Milk?  According to The Dairy Alliance, the performance power of dairy milk stands out because it provides:   1. Complete, High-Quality Protein: Unlike most alternatives, dairy milk offers 8 grams of protein per serving to help build and repair muscles.  2. Superior Hydration: Dairy milk naturally contains electrolytes to help rehydrate after a tough game or workout. Did you know it's more hydrating than water?  3. Essential Nutrients: Packed with calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, milk supports overall health and energy.  4. Options for All: For those who are lactose-intolerant, choose lactose-free dairy milk! Athletes of all levels can enjoy the same delicious taste and high-quality protein, just without the discomfort of cramping and bloating.   Whether you're hitting the gym, the court, or managing a busy day, dairy milk is your MVP. Don't miss the chance to follow the campaign this season as Zam, Jaxson, and Zakai show how to unlock your full athletic potential with the ultimate nutrition powerhouse.
