# A New View In Valencia

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, February 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Home shopper checklists for FivePoint Valencia show remarkable similarities. While those with kids may scrutinize schools, and while community gatherings are more important to some than just stepping outside at sunset, all buyers share the paramount goal—finding a quality new home in an inviting new place.   New Homes—First, your new home. Offered in a wide range of designs and pricing, Valencia's fresh, easy-living homes include single- and multi-level layouts, in detached and attached formats that optimize privacy, indoor/outdoor livability and view opportunities.   Patios, decks and courtyards enhance outdoor entertaining and leisure. Interior social spaces are inviting, kitchens are sleek and high-function and retreats are luxurious. Flex spaces optimize versatility now and as your household changes over time.	  "I have always wanted to live in a home where I was the first owner, and this design works really well for us," said one homeowner. "It has room for a home office, and we have 4 bedrooms, with suite layouts upstairs and down and two full baths for the two upstairs bedrooms, so everyone can enjoy their privacy and comfort. Plus, our spaces for hosting family and friends are great!"  Some Particulars—Valencia's selection of new home choices is in 8 collections, some with quick move-in opportunities. Homes are priced from the low $400,000s to over $1.5 million, in plan sizes of 1,018 to 4,273 square feet. Start with an online check at www.valencia.com and plan your personal visit. Take the Magic Mountain Parkway exit from the I-5 and head up the hill to Navigation Avenue. Check postings before heading for your model tours.   Contact Valencia builders for their latest.

Life Is Different Here—Valencia's new home choices attract young singles and couples, growing families, empty nesters and multi-gen households. This diversity combines with a thoughtfully planned pedestrian network to promote the neighborly dynamics of a small town.  You can enjoy your new life—and new views—without driving. Sidewalks, seating niches, small parks and trails serve pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals. Valencia's panoramic hillside site adds to walking pleasures, with vista views from many spots. Site planning also weaves open spaces with amenities, and the indoor/outdoor community fabric optimizes open space and protected trees and natural vegetation.   Leisure At Home—Award-winning Confluence Park adds to the pleasures of home ownership, combining a spacious and versatile clubhouse with outdoor expanses, a pool complex and easy connectivity to many other community points. Nearby is the Community Garden and Garden Home. And at Adventure Playground kids and parents can enjoy many outdoor options.   Activity choices for homeowners, friends and visitors are rich and varied year around. Earth Day festivities highlighted spring offerings, while summer featured "Friday Night Happenings" that combined live music with food and drinks. In October, "Fallencia" offered casual fun and refreshments tied to the changing season, and the holiday season featured delightful celebrations for all.   Next up are the special treats in store for the March 2 Sunday market. The theme is Mardi Gras and shoppers will find Mardi Gras desserts from Sisi Cakes available for purchase, plus live music and tarot card readings. Joyce with Tatum & Charlie will have Mardi Gras beads, a bracelet-making activity and keychain-making activity (while supplies last) for all ages.  More activities are always in store, so check www.valencia.com and www.Facebook.com/ValenciaCalifornia for the latest doings.  Connectivity—You can get there from here—and back again. In the heart of Los Angeles County's Santa Clarita Valley, the community is close to retail, dining options and leisure choices. Adjacency to I-5 puts area job centers within easy reach, as well as Cal Arts, College of the Canyons and Henry Mayo Hospital. Connectivity also includes nearby access to Metrolink, freeways and airports. And you may meet new neighbors who are self-employed, offering various services you can tap without freeway travel.  "It's easy to hop on and off the freeways to get to places, and to get home," said a homeowner. "We like to take a walk when we get home from work, and on weekends, we hang out in the common areas and just relax."   Well-ranked schools enhance the attractions of ownership at Valencia. The William S. Hart District serves junior high and high school students, while elementary school children will be part of the Newhall School District or the Saugus School District.   "We did not want to compromise on this aspect of picking a place to live," said Nithin and Sneha Gridhallaru. "With our home in Valencia, we have secured excellent educational opportunities for our son and for the sisters or brothers he may have someday!"  Eating Fresh—At Valencia's Community Garden and Garden Home, locally sourced food is a special highlight for many homeowners. The HOA's resident-operated Gardening Club provides homeowners the opportunity to grow and enjoy some of their own food, to hone their gardening skills, and to help their children learn to garden and enjoy fresh produce, as everyone joins together in urban gardening pursuits.   And every Sunday, the Valencia Farmers Market offers fresh, organic produce and artisan fare, providing residents and visitors with expanded choices for freshly harvested produce. Managed by California Farm Direct Markets' Larry McClements, Valencia's Farmers Market draws from surrounding areas for food products and ready to eat foods, with offerings sold by the growers.   "I was so happy to see so many awesome vendors and having the ability to connect with neighbors and local businesses is truly special," said one homeowner. "This is the perfect add-on to our community!"  Sustainability—At Valencia, eyes are also on the planet's future, and all design/build teams support FivePoint's commitment to sustainable development. Energy efficiency is key in every home. Among per plan features are low-E windows, upgraded insulation, rooftop solar and tankless water heaters with closed loop systems. Some homes provide flow meters at main water lines, and solar data that can help owners monitor water usage and energy production.
