With businesses abandoning traditional media and pouring billions of dollars into digital-first advertising strategies on Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and beyond, litigation is growing. In trademark infringement, false advertising, and click fraud cases, attorneys often need to rely on an expert who can explain large volumes of technical data via straightforward and comprehensible evidence for judges and juries. When an attorney does not thoroughly understand digital advertising platforms or the facts, it might become a hazardous way to proceed. A fact-based witness, as the new content explains, is a guide not just to the facts but to a fact-based strategy.  FACT-BASED PERSPECTIVES ON BEING AN EXPERT WITNESS  In some cases, attorneys may initially believe that an expert witness can or will testify to whatever they want. They can mistakenly look to expert witnesses as "hired guns" who have no integrity. This is not only unethical but also ineffective. The legal system tends to bring out the actual facts, and the side that truly understands them (as positioned via a fact-based expert witness) actually has an advantage over the side that unscrupulously might seek either to obscure them or just have willful ignorance of them. This is especially true in the very complex areas of Google advertising (https://www.jasonmcdonald.org/adwords/), social media (https://www.jasonmcdonald.org/seo-consultant/social-media-expert-witness/), and SEO (https://www.jasonmcdonald.org/seo-consultant/).

This field has evolved over time, and Dr. McDonald is of the "first generation" of practitioners who have been there literally since the beginning. His fact-based approach, as the new content explains, is not only ethical but also efficacious.
