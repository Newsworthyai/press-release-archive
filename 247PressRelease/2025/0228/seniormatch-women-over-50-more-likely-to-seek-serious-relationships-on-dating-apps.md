# SeniorMatch: Women Over 50 More Likely to Seek Serious Relationships on Dating Apps

LOS ANGELES, CA, February 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As a premium community designed for mature singles aged 50 and above, SeniorMatch recently conducted a survey of 548 users, revealing significant differences in social needs between men and women on dating platforms, particularly regarding their attitudes toward relationships.  The survey showed that female users have a more serious and clearer attitude toward relationships. 75% of female respondents stated that their goal on dating platforms is to find a serious relationship rather than a casual one. These women are more inclined to seek deep emotional connections, valuing mutual respect and long-term commitment with their partners.  In contrast, male users have relatively lower expectations for long-term relationships. The results indicated that men are less anxious about whether they can find a lasting relationship and are typically more focused on immediate interactions with potential partners, without the urgency to seek deep emotional bonds. This difference highlights the contrasting needs and psychological expectations of men and women when choosing partners and forming relationships.  Dani Johnson, a SeniorMatch spokesperson stated, "For women, serious and high-quality relationships are the top priority, while men may focus more on immediate interactions with their partners and are less eager for long-term commitment. We remain committed to enhancing our platform, optimizing features to provide a social experience and interaction methods that cater to the varying needs of our users."
