"I want to set an example to the African American community and to other races. No one should feel ashamed to learn and write about other cultures outside their own race. We are all made under the same God so shall we learn from that." Continued Broady. "I have a voice and with my voice, I believe can enlighten the world."   Broady's beautiful work has been given praise by book reviewers as a stunning and moving journey. She is the first African American to have taken a brave step into writing Asian dramas.
