Lead attorney at The Villarreal Law Firm, Javier Villarreal, said, "After a car accident, we know how overwhelming it can be. And that is why we wrote our posts, to help people understand the basics of what to do — to care for themselves, to document important evidence, and to know they can reach out to 'The Law Champ' to fight for them every step of the way.  Here is background on this release and the recommended steps to take. The first and most important thing an injury victim needs to always take care of their health and safety and that of their fellow travelers, including people in the other vehicles. Health and safety come first. The posts explain that clients should concentrate on healing first because more complex issues can be dealt with later.  Second, the posts highlight the importance of documenting the scene of the accident. Victims should collect all available evidence, preferably at the scene, such as photos of the cars, license plates, driver's license information, and damage to cars. Having the facts and evidence when filing an insurance claim is key to strengthening the claim and guaranteeing a good resolution.  Third, the posts show the effect that accidents can have on the lives of victims. This includes lost days of work, having to rent cars, and pain and suffering due to physical injury, all things for which the defendant must pay for if the case is successful. The Brownsville-based law firm highlights that these issues, even if physical, financial, or emotional, must not be ignored and that each detail should be fought for in a court of law if necessary.  Finally, even though the lawyers at the firm strive to be the best accident lawyers in Brownsville, they do not "go it alone." Rather, they value the client in the decision process. Clients are encouraged to keep in contact with the firm's lawyers and make the best decisions, including going to trial if necessary. The law firm appreciates its clients' feedback and ensures they participate to the extent they want in all decisions, major and minor.  The posts also list helpful tips that may decrease the risk of an accident, including following the speed limit, remaining patient when in a vehicle, and refraining from driving under the influence. Anyone injured in a car accident in Brownsville or the surrounding areas is advised to contact the Villarreal Law Firm for free consultation on any injury accident. However, with the help of the process outlined in the blog posts, victims can find confidence in knowing they are not alone and have a team ready to fight for them.
