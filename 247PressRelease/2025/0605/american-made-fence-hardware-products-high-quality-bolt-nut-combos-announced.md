EAST TROY, WI, June 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Modern Fence Technology proudly announces its line of American-made fence hardware and accessories, offering contractors, retailers, distributors, and DIY enthusiasts top-quality products designed to ensure fence projects are durable and visually appealing.  Further details can be found at https://mftfence.com/  Recent studies show that over 70% of American consumers prefer purchasing products made in the USA, associating them with superior craftsmanship and quality assurance. This growing preference highlights the importance of supporting domestic manufacturing and choosing products that are built to last. As demand for American-made goods continues to rise, Modern Fence Technology stands at the forefront of the movement by manufacturing reliable, high-grade hardware that meets the highest standards.  "We specialize in manufacturing a wide range of essential fence components, including gate hinges, gate latches, fence brackets, PVC post caps, and other gate accessories," explains a spokesperson. While posts and panels often capture attention in fence construction, the company emphasizes that small finishing pieces like caps, bolts, and nuts play a critical role in maintaining fence strength and aesthetics.  Among the standout products in their collection is the 5" x 5" New England Cap, a decorative and protective post cap that adds a classic, polished finish while shielding fence posts from weather damage.  Another key item is the Bolt & Nut Combo, engineered for secure, long-lasting connections that keep gates, brackets, and hinges firmly in place. The 2.25" x 3.5" External Apex Cap offers a sleek design to protect rectangular fence rails and posts, efficiently shedding rainwater and extending the lifespan of the fence.  Olen J., a satisfied customer, shares his experience: "This is American made fence hardware - top quality, good prices, great customer service. This is the kind of hardware that you buy once and it will last generations. Not only that, the people at MFT are the salt of the earth. They care about community, family, God, and their customers.
