# Triad RF Systems Launches TA1165 Amplifier, Enhancing X-Band Downlink Capabilities for CubeSat Missions

EAST BRUNSWICK, NJ, June 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Triad RF Systems, a leading provider of advanced RF and microwave amplifiers and integrated radio systems, today announced the release of its new TA1165 solid-state power amplifier. Specifically engineered for CubeSat and SmallSat missions operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the TA1165 provides powerful and reliable RF amplification from 5.5 - 8.5 GHz, covering the critical 7.9 to 8.4 GHz X-Band downlink frequency.  Designed to integrate seamlessly with popular CubeSat Software Defined Radios (SDRs) on the market today and forward-compatible with future radios and waveforms, the TA1165 delivers up to 20 watts (43 dBm) of saturated RF power. This significantly improves satellite communication links, enhancing the effective range, data rate, and reliability required for successful mission operations.  "The TA1165 amplifier addresses the demands of satellite vehicle integrators and systems engineers in this downlink band. They seek robust, compact, and efficient RF amplifiers with flight heritage, not just COTS products that meet the RF power and frequency range requirements," stated Dean Handrinos, CTO of Triad RF Systems. "It has been designed for the rigors of Low Earth Orbit, and has already been deployed on customer vehicles in LEO. The TA1165's ability to achieve higher downlink power for CubeSat and SmallSat radio systems provides several advantages, including increased throughput and more compact ground terminals. It is built for use with many X-Band transmitters, such as those offered by EnduroSat, GOMSpace, IQ Spacecom, and AAC Clyde Space."  The TA1165 leverages Triad RF's design legacy with more than 20 years of accumulated LEO flight time for delivered RF payloads to date. Their proven Class AB GaN technology architecture ensures high linearity, efficiency, and thermal performance, all of which are essential for satellite operation. Its lightweight, low SWaP (size, weight, and power) footprint makes it particularly attractive for CubeSat platforms, where space and mass constraints are critical.  By providing coverage from 5,500 to 8,500 MHz, the TA1165 supports key satellite applications, including Earth observation, high-speed data transmission, and inter-satellite communications,  making it an ideal choice for integrators looking to enhance satellite data throughput and reliability.
