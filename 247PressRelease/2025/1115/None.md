# New Christian Book Inspires Believers to Leave a Lasting Legacy of Faith

CRYSTAL CITY, TX, November 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a world increasingly focused on the fleeting and the immediate, Pass It On: Cultivating Future Generations by Rev. Doris Loida Espinoza delivers a timeless and deeply personal call to action: to live intentionally, mentor faithfully, and leave behind a spiritual inheritance that endures for generations.  Drawing from more than five decades in ministry, Rev. Espinoza shares biblical insights and heartfelt stories that illuminate the sacred responsibility of passing on the "baton of service," the "mantle of anointing," the "shield of faith," and the "torch of Pentecost." Through powerful examples, from the mentorship of Paul and Timothy to her own journey as a pastor, educator, and District Girls Ministries Director, Rev. Espinoza reveals how faith, wisdom, and love can be transferred from one generation to the next with purpose and grace.  Part devotional, part leadership guide, Pass It On invites readers to reflect, engage, and take up their role as mentors and spiritual guides. Each chapter includes questions for personal reflection and group discussion, making it an invaluable resource for churches, ministry teams, and families committed to cultivating faith in the next generation.  Her ministry legacy spanning over fifty years across the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa continues to empower men, women, and youth to live lives of faith, service, and intentional influence.  Pass It On: Cultivating Future Generations is more than a book. It's a movement to preserve the flame of faith and keep it burning brightly for those who follow.  Available now wherever Christian books are sold; also available in Spanish as Pásalo: Cultivando las Futuras Generaciones.
