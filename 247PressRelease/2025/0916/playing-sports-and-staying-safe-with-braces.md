# Playing Sports and Staying Safe with Braces

VANCOUVER, BC, September 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Wearing braces shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying sports or an active lifestyle. Whether it's soccer, hockey, gymnastics, or martial arts, staying active is a big part of a healthy lifestyle—and Innova Orthodontics in Port Coquitlam is here to support that. Their certified orthodontic specialists know how important it is to keep orthodontic treatments on track while protecting teeth and braces during physical activity.

In fact, many of the patients at Innova Orthodontics in Port Coquitlam are student-athletes or adults who participate in recreational and competitive sports. However, it's essential to take precautions. Braces and contact sports don't always mix. Without the proper protection, accidental hits to the face can lead to injuries, discomfort, or even damage to braces. That's why wearing a mouthguard is essential.  The Importance of Mouthguards During Orthodontic Treatment  A mouthguard acts as the first line of defence when playing sports with braces. It helps protect not just teeth and gums, but also brackets and wires from impacts that could cause injuries, setting back orthodontic progress. The American Association of Orthodontists recommends wearing a mouthguard for sports like basketball, football, hockey, boxing, lacrosse, rugby, martial arts, volleyball, skateboarding, and even track and field.  Not all mouthguards are created equal. For patients with braces, the best option is a prefabricated orthodontic mouthguard. These models allow room for brackets and tooth movement, making them more suitable than "boil-and-bite" or custom-fitted mouthguards that might interfere with treatment. When selecting a mouthguard, make sure it's tear-resistant, breathable, easy to clean, and fits comfortably without restricting speech or airflow.  How to Take Care of a Mouthguard  Proper maintenance of a mouthguard is just as essential as wearing it. After each use, gently brush the mouthguard with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Store it in a ventilated case, not in a sealed container, which can trap moisture and create odour. Keep the mouthguard away from direct sunlight or hot water, as these can cause it to warp. Optimally, replace the mouthguard at the start of each sports season, or sooner if it becomes worn or no longer fits properly.  What to Do in Case of a Sports Injury  Accidents happen, even with the best precautions. If an accident damages teeth, brackets, or wires, contact Innova Orthodontics immediately. In many cases, it's possible to apply orthodontic wax to any irritated spots and rinse with warm salt water to reduce discomfort. The team at Innova Orthodontics is always available to help patients manage emergencies and get back on track as soon as possible.  Braces, Invisalign, and Active Lifestyles  For some patients, especially teens and adults in non-contact sports, Invisalign in Port Coquitlam may be an alternative worth exploring. Invisalign aligners are removable, which makes them easy to remove during physical activity (as long as it's safe and appropriate to do so). However, this flexibility also requires discipline—Invisalign aligners must be worn for the recommended 20 to 22 hours per day to keep the treatment progressing.  Orthodontists to Count On  The team at Innova Orthodontics can work with patients, assessing activity level, lifestyle, and orthodontic goals to recommend the best treatment plan. Whether it's traditional braces or Invisalign, trust the Port Coquilam orthodontists at Innova to provide care that offers support—not limits—for active lifestyles.
