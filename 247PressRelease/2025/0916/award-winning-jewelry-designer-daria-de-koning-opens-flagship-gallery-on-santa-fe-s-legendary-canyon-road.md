# Award-Winning Jewelry Designer Daria de Koning Opens Flagship Gallery on Santa Fe's Legendary Canyon Road

SANTA FE, NM, September 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acclaimed jewelry designer and gemologist Daria de Koning has opened her first flagship gallery in Santa Fe's iconic Canyon Road arts district, marking both a new chapter for the designer and her relocation from Los Angeles to New Mexico's celebrated arts capital.  The Daria de Koning Gallery, located at 821 Canyon Road, Suite 4, officially opened this summer in the heart of one of the country's most concentrated fine art destinations. The upstairs gallery space invites visitors to "sit, dream, collaborate" and "immerse yourself in an artful world of jewels," reflecting de Koning's philosophy that gemstones serve as her canvas and jewelry as her art.  "I don't see myself as a 'brand' â€“ a phraseology which feels very third-person in a world-conqueror kind of way," said de Koning. "I'm an artist and a designer whose work is wearable, which is very personal, very one-on-one."  De Koning, often called the "Gem Whisperer," has built a devoted following through her distinctive approach to fine jewelry creation. The designer's work begins not with sketches, but within what she calls "the inner world of matrix-rich gemstones that speak to her". Her pieces feature cabochon-cut stones in unexpected combinations, creating wearable landscapes that reflect both femininity and confidence.  The Santa Fe gallery represents a long-held dream for de Koning, whose work has been featured in national publications including Elle Decor, Veranda, Martha Stewart Weddings, and Town & Country Magazine. The daughter of an artistic Dutch immigrant and fifth-generation American, de Koning spent childhood summers traveling between New York City and the Netherlands, experiences that continue to influence her aesthetic.  "Her process and vision follow a profoundly personal trajectory," according to her biographical materials. "Deeply influenced by heritage and family history, the women in her family were dazzling by both day and night".  De Koning's formal training includes a degree in graphic design from Washington University in St. Louis and a Graduate Gemologist certification from the Gemological Institute of America. She began her career creating custom engagement rings before expanding into her current collection of refined jewelry featuring unusual gemstones and sophisticated metalwork.  The Canyon Road location places de Koning among more than 80 galleries in Santa Fe's premier arts district, which attracts major collectors and art enthusiasts from around the world. Canyon Road is home to the highest concentration of galleries in the country, with establishments known for their reputations among collectors, major art fairs, and museums nationwide.  "I love to take materials that are considered off the beaten path and make them into something elevated and evocative," de Koning explained during a previous exhibition. "I believe that all women need color. Color is flattering, uplifting and makes you memorable."  The gallery is open Thursday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 4 p.m., and by appointment Monday through Wednesday. Visitors can schedule appointments by calling or texting 505-603-3466.  De Koning's work has been recognized with numerous accolades, including the 2021 Accessories Council Design Excellence Award for Fine Jewelry. Her pieces are available through select retailers nationwide and at her new Santa Fe location.
