# Blue Faery's Love Your Liver Program Hosts Free Spanish-Language Workshops for Hispanic Heritage Month

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Blue Faery: The Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association will spotlight its Love Your Liver program this Hispanic Heritage Month with two free online workshops in Spanish. The events will take place on Tuesday, September 24, at 7 p.m. ET and Thursday, October 9, at 8 p.m. ET.  These workshops are in Spanish, giving participants access to two distinguished physicians. Dr. Andrés Gómez-Aldana, gastroenterologist and liver cancer researcher, and Dr. María Rita Lepe-Suastegui, gastroenterologist and transplant hepatologist, will deliver expert presentations on preventing, diagnosing, and treating liver disease and liver cancer.  Each session includes a live Q&A, allowing patients, caregivers, and community members to ask direct questions and receive practical guidance from the speakers.  Hispanic Americans face a higher risk of liver disease and liver cancer compared to other groups. Language and cultural barriers often block access to critical health information. Blue Faery's Love Your Liver program helps bridge those gaps by delivering culturally relevant education in Spanish, empowering participants to take proactive steps toward protecting their liver health.  The workshops are free, but registration is required. To learn more, visit: Love Your Liver.  Blue Faery's mission is to prevent, treat, and cure primary liver cancer through research, education, and advocacy. Blue Faery hosts an online Liver Cancer Community for patients and caregivers.
