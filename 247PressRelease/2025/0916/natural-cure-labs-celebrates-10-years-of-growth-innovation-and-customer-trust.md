ST. PETERSBURG, FL, September 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Natural Cure Labs, a trusted U.S. manufacturer of research-backed dietary supplements, proudly announces its 10-year anniversary. Founded in 2015 with the mission to bring transparency, quality, and scientific integrity to the supplement industry, the company has grown from a single immune health product into an award-winning portfolio trusted by more than 180,000 customers worldwide.   "Reaching our 10-year anniversary is both humbling and inspiring," said Damon Sununtnasuk, Founder & CEO of Natural Cure Labs. "Statistics suggest that nearly 65% of businesses don't make it this far, so this milestone is not just about survival - it's about proving that putting quality, transparency, and customers first leads to sustainable growth."   Natural Cure Labs began with Monolaurin, a coconut-derived immune support ingredient that quickly became the company's flagship. Over the years, the brand has expanded into Immune Support blends, Andrographis, Biofilm Defense, and Level Off for metabolic support, earning more than 40 industry awards, including 9 Stevie Awards for product innovation, customer experience, and corporate excellence.   Highlights from the company's first decade include:  - Launching industry leading formulas such as 800mg Extra Strength Monolaurin  - Expanding distribution to meet customers where they want to buy including Amazon, Walmart, TikTok Shop, and Target Plus  - Maintaining 100% US-based manufacturing across GMP-certified facilities in New York, New Jersey, and California  - Earning a place on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list, ranking among the top third of fastest-growing private companies in the USA   "From our first capsule in 2015 to serving more than 180,000 customers today, the journey has been nothing short of incredible," Sununtnasuk added. "We've built trust by committing to clean labels, rigorous third-party testing, and research-backed formulas - all while creating American jobs and supporting the U.S. economy."   Looking ahead, Natural Cure Labs plans to expand its product line into new form factors such as gummies and topicals while continuing to serve its global customer base with uncompromising quality.   "This anniversary is not just about what we've achieved as a company," said Sununtnasuk. "It's about the people - our customers, partners, and communities - who have supported us for the last 10 years. Together, we're just getting started."
