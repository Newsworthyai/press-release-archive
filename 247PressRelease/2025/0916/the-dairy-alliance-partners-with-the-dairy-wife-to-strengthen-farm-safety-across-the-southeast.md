# The Dairy Alliance Partners with "The Dairy Wife" to Strengthen Farm Safety Across the Southeast

ATLANTA, GA, September 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, joins forces with Katie Hammock, known as "The Dairy Wife," to provide farm families with essential tools, safety education, and hands-on support for on-farm preparedness. Through this partnership, more than 1,000 Farm Emergency Kits will reach dairy farmers within The Dairy Alliance region, while workshops and social media campaigns deliver practical tips and real-world guidance to prevent injuries in one of the nation's most dangerous industries.   "Katie brings unmatched expertise as both an ER nurse and a farm wife," said Farrah Newberry, CEO of The Dairy Alliance. "Together, we are empowering farm families with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to protect their loved ones and encouraging safe farming practices. Preparing for emergencies ensures families, farms, and communities thrive for generations to come."   Hammock created her farm-specific emergency kits after witnessing preventable farm tragedies and realizing that standard first aid kits did not meet the unique needs of agricultural injuries. The collaboration with The Dairy Alliance distributes these kits directly to farm families and highlights the importance of readiness during harvest season.   Farm families and the broader community can also follow Katie's journey on Instagram and Facebook, where she shares real-life farm safety stories, tips, and insights from her years as a nurse and farm wife. Her content makes learning about farm safety approachable, practical, and relatable for everyone.   The campaign comes right in time to highlight Farm Safety Week (Sept. 21â€“27) as a central moment to reinforce the importance of agricultural safety and promote preparedness across dairy farms in the Southeast.
