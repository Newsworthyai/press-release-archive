# DapperTails Mobile Pet Grooming Franchising - The Hottest Franchise To Watch As A Fast-scaling Brand Making Major National Moves In The $160B Pet Care Sector

LONG ISLAND, NY / WEST PALM BEACH, FL, July 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DapperTails Mobile Pet Grooming, the hip boutique-style mobile dog grooming brand known for its luxury service and wag-worthy customer experience, proudly announces the national launch of its franchise model following a show-stopping debut in Orlando and New York City. The franchise is already drawing serious attention from prospective owners eager to join one of the most exciting brands in pet services today.  These high-energy events mark a major milestone in DapperTails' bold expansion strategy. With a business model rooted in convenience, quality, and innovation, the company is scaling rapidly both nationally and internationally. Franchise demand has surged thanks to DapperTails' groomer-led structure, its commitment to best-in-class service and support for franchisees, and its sharp brand identity.  "We're building something truly special here," said Chris Elias, Co-Founder of DapperTails. "Being a native Long Islander, I'm proud to showcase our company across America. It signals that DapperTails is ready to scale with serious partners who want to lead the next wave of pet care innovation in this $160B dollar industry. We're canvassing to meet the right people who want to build something meaningful and long-term, with many who have already entered second-phase meetings to discuss fast-start incentives, including the potential waiver of a portion of the franchise fee. The response in Orlando showed us how ready the market is, and New York took us to the next level. Join us and create generational wealth with us."  "The energy in Orlando was incredible," added Emily Elias, Co-Founder and COO. "It confirmed that our mission to deliver truly world-class mobile grooming to pet owners is resonating with entrepreneurs looking for a meaningful and scalable business. It's time to invest in a business that aligns passion with profit ... and one that is groomer-led, which is the biggest and best difference."  In just under a month since the official launch, DapperTails' expansion is already underway. The first new franchisee is ramping up in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Simultaneously, twenty-one corporate-owned vans are serving high-demand markets under the leadership of the Long Island operations team. Additional territories in North Carolina, Dallas-Fort Worth, West Palm Beach, Port St. Lucie and Scottsdale AZ are now open for purchase. International expansion discussions have also begun, with interest from The Bahamas and Trinidad.  Each DapperTails franchisee receives hands-on training, territory exclusivity, and ongoing support spanning operations, marketing, and elite grooming standards. The Franchise Command Dashboard, a proprietary operating system, provides real-time access to booking, team management, brand materials, and performance data all designed to help franchisees thrive from day one.  The strength of the model is powered by DapperTails' expansive network of over 4,500 professional groomers, ready to support new franchisees in staff recruitment and onboarding. Co-founder Emily Elias' proprietary training program ensures every mobile unit delivers consistent, high-quality care and maintains rigorous safety standards.
