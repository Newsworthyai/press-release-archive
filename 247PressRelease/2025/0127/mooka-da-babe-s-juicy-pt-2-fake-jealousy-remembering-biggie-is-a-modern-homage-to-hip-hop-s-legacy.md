# Mooka da Babe's "Juicy Pt. 2: Fake & Jealousy Remembering Biggie" is a Modern Homage to Hip-Hop's Legacy

NEW YORK, NY, January 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Rap music is the only vital form of music introduced since punk rock." - Kurt Cobain American Musician  The original idea for the expression of abstract vocal art known as rap as well as hip-hop was to provide an opportunity for impoverished communities to financially become self-sufficient without the help of reparations, and in doing so provide an inheritance to children for future generations to thrive in prosperity.  In an era of uncertain outcomes for Americans that had no forum to express their concerns about the conditions of neighborhoods, and how those conditions may cause severe consequences for childrens' unruly behavioral actions.   On July 15, 1986, for the first time a rap song performed by the group Run-D.M.C earned the platinum earning status.   This was a major milestone in the new era of rap music. According to Shannon Power, a pop culture, and entertainment reporter from Newsweek Media company rap music has started to decline among its listeners. A rap icon known to many as Nas has stated that currently in the hip-hop music genre there is not enough creativity.  But there are some rappers that are still fighting for the resurgence of the original creativity in developing rap music like an upcoming rapper called Mooka da Babe, his latest single, "Juicy Pt. 2: Fake & Jealousy Remembering Biggie," serves as both a tribute to the rap legend, and a commentary on the challenges of navigating fame using the expression of abstract vocal art. Through his raw lyricism, and authenticity, Mooka da Babe continues to build on this mission, using his music as a tool for progress, and leaving an inheritance for future generations to thrive.  "I cleaned up my act, and I made this rap thing work for me. I thought people would respect me for that. But instead, it's, 'Oh, he's sold all these records, and now he thinks he's all that." - Notorious B.I.G.  http://youtu.be/r9LG5KHY0oU?si=kdRArITk-3auVJtf  https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mooka-da-babe/1777598621  DME Music  The idea is to carry on the legacy of capturing those that led the way in music's past.
