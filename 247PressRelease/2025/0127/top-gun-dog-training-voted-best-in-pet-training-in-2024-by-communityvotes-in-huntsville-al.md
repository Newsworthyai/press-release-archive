My dog is a one year old golden doodle and we had already been through a board and train training company that was extremely disappointing. Because of this I was hesitant to try again. I am SO glad I did! Dale is truly a "dog whisperer". His approach is comprehensive and effective and I could not be happier. My dog has improved in all areas- loose leash walking, improved reactivity and overall improved behavior. Dale is extremely flexible and professional. Starting with our home visits and ending with our trips out in public, the entire experience and results are better than I had hoped for. 100% recommended for anyone who wants guaranteed outcomes for their dog. FIVE STARS for sure!" Stephanie B. - Huntsville  "Working with Dale has been one of the best decisions for Piper and I! Don't think twice about working with him! Piper is a very high energy breed/rescue with a strong independent spirit. It was our goal to manage her energy so that she would be able to walk in a pack, meet dogs socially in public without incessant barking, and be able to eventually go shopping in public places. Dale approached Piper's training with individualized attention and guidance, and offered clear direction to me as her owner. He is confident, direct, and professional. I am proud to share that Piper achieved each of her goals during training and am relieved to now have the tools that I need to care for her well!" Jenny G. - Madison, AL  In addition to winning this award, Dale has been featured on the local news numerous times, published three top-selling puppy training books, hosted over 112 Puppy Talk Podcast episodes, and successfully trained over 1,300 puppies. All of Dale's work has been well-received, with glowing reviews.
