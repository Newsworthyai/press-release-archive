# National Fireproofing Supply Company Expands Product Line With Dek Gard Fire Retardant Additive for Wood Stains

PORTER, IN, January 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- National Fireproofing Supply Company, a trusted name in fireproofing, is excited to introduce a groundbreaking innovation: a wood stain fire retardant additive. The Dek Gard Fire Retardant Additive is the extra layer of protection that's designed to make indoor and outdoor wood surfaces much safer from fire.   The last thing anyone would want is for their favorite work desk to become a potential fire hazard, but this is the unfortunate reality with traditional wood stains. Many traditional wood stains often lack crucial fire resistance, leaving homeowners, businesses, and public spaces vulnerable.   Oil-based stains, for instance, are highly flammable due to their petroleum-based ingredients. These stains easily catch fire, especially during application and drying. The danger doesn't stop there. Spontaneous combustion can occur when oil-soaked rags are improperly discarded, sometimes leading to devastating fires.   In fact, at least 7 fires were attributed to the spontaneous combustion of stain or oil-soaked rags in 2023 alone. USFA reports that a house catches fire every 87 seconds in the US, with residential fires accounting for 77.3% of all fire fatalities. A fire-resistant wood stain could've easily prevented a lot of these incidents.   According to National Fireproofing Supply Company, their new fire retardant additive for wood stains was tested for a Class A Fire Rating. Plus, it meets CSFM 12-7A-4.8 Part B for the WUI Code, allowing users to stay compliant and safe at the same time. When added to oil or water-based stains, the additive improves any wood stain's ability to resist fire.   Untreated wood typically has a Flame Spread Index ranging from 90 to 160. In contrast, well-treated wood with flame-retardant stains can achieve an FSI of less than 25, which is much safer for homes. The fire retardant additive is also pretty versatile and works with all kinds of interior and exterior stains. According to Natfire, "Each 12oz bottle is capable of treating one gallon of stain."   The Dek Gard Fire Retardant Additive for wood stains is also designed to be minimally invasive, ensuring that the natural beauty of the grain is preserved. It can be easily mixed with most oil or water-based stains without any special application techniques. Once applied, the fire retardant properties of the stain provide long-lasting protection.  This wood stain fire retardant additive isn't just for preventing house fires or spontaneous combustion. It also protects wooden surfaces from daily wear and tear. For instance, it may protect wooden decks from flying embers, spilled BBQs, and fireworks. It's also worth noting that even the State Fire Marshall (CSFM) has recognized the effectiveness of Dek Gard FRT and has approved it for this specific purpose.  National Fireproofing Supply Company claims that the Dek Gard FRT is "4x more stringent than the CSFM class B standard," so users can rest assured that their wooden structures are safe and sound. Those who live in high-risk fire zones and WUI (wildland-urban interface) areas may benefit from this product since it protects wooden structures that are vulnerable to wildfire embers.
