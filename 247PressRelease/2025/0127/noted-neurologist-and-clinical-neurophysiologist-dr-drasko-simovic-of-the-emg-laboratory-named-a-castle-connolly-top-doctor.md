# Noted neurologist and clinical neurophysiologist Dr. Drasko Simovic of the EMG Laboratory named a Castle Connolly Top Doctor

LAWRENCE, MA and HYANNIS, MA, January 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Drasko Simovic, MD, has been recognized as a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors for their specialties.  Dr. Simovic, an eminent neurologist and clinical neurophysiologist, leads EMG Laboratory, the state-of-the-art practice he founded in 1997.   EMG Laboratory has locations in Hyannis and Lawrence, Mass. EMG Laboratory has earned the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine's highest level of recognition, Accreditation with Exemplary Status, along with many other professional and consumer recognitions.  Using sophisticated electromyography (EMG) technology and nerve-conduction studies (NCS), Dr. Simovic is able to measure and evaluate the electrical activity and function of the muscles and nerves.  This information helps him accurately diagnose, monitor, and inform the precise treatment of a wide array of diagnosed or suspected muscle and nerve disorders — from neck and back pain; injured nerve roots; and neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to sciatica; neuropathy; Guillain-Barré syndrome; and carpal tunnel syndrome.  "EMG and NCS tests help us determine if muscles are responding properly to the electrical signals they receive from the nerves and/or if there is nerve disease or damage," Dr. Simovic says. "The results help doctors determine the types and severity of conditions and choose the most appropriate treatment for their patients."  Watch a video of an EMG test.  Dr. Simovic is certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in both neurology and clinical neurophysiology, as well as by the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine and the American Board of Disability Analysts.  He is also one of fewer than 100 doctors nationwide to have earned the Neuromuscular Ultrasound Certificate of Added Qualification (CAQ) from the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine.   Neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS) is an evolving neurodiagnostic tool that allows nerves, muscles, and soft tissues to be visualized in real time — providing detailed anatomical insights, says Dr. Simovic.  "When combined with electromyography, it fuses structural imaging with functional assessment, merging physiology and anatomy in a way that elevates diagnostic precision to new heights," he explains.  "This unified approach is particularly useful in conditions like focal entrapments and nerve injuries. It enhances diagnostic accuracy, paving the way for more effective and personalized treatment plans.  As this knowledge and technology continue to evolve, we at EMG Laboratory are excited to be at the forefront in offering these latest advancements in neurodiagnostics."  Dr. Simovic earned his medical degree at University of Belgrade Medical School in Yugoslavia. He completed a neurology residency at Boston Medical Center/Boston University and a two-year clinical neurophysiology and electrodiagnostic medicine fellowship at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center/Tufts University.  In addition to his work at EMG Laboratory, he is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Tufts University School of Medicine. He is affiliated with St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston, Lawrence General Hospital, and Cape Cod Hospital.  His clinical and research achievements have been featured in national and international scientiﬁc and popular media, including Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Popular Science, Reuters Health, and others.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications. Nominations are open to all board-certified MDs, DOs, and DPMs. The Castle Connolly team chooses honorees based on nominee criteria that includes their medical education, training, hospital appointments, and disciplinary histories.  Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected as a Castle Connolly Top Doctor.
