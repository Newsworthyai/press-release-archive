# MyBioSource Added Validated anti-CALB2 Antibody for Advanced Research

SAN DIEGO, CA, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MyBioSource, a leader in delivering highly validated life science reagents, added Sheep anti-Rat Calretinin Polyclonal antibody in their catalog for advanced research applications in their vast catalog (MBS502148).   The antibody is designed for researchers who are studying calretinin (CALB2). This antibody is a vital calcium-binding protein and has widespread significance in the field of neurobiology and cellular calcium signaling.   Calretinin (molecular weight: 29kDa) is a protein that is predominantly expressed in nerve cells (neurons) throughout the CNS, retina, and other tissues. Its role in buffering intracellular calcium and cellular homeostasis, as well as its contribution to neuroprotection, makes it essential for researchers to study.   The anti-CALB2 antibody designed and supplied by MyBioSource recognizes the rat catretinin protein. Due to 100% sequence homology, it provides potential cross-reactivity with mouse, human, and non-human primate calretinin.   Key Features and Research Applications of anti-CALB2 Antibody  Here is the list of key features of the antibody:   • Host & Clonality: Sheep pAbs. • Specificity: Targets catretinin protein at ~29 kDa and is confirmed by Western blot of rat brain lysate. • Immunogen: Purified guinea pig calretinin protein.  Here is the list of major applications of the antibody:   • Validated Techniques: Western Blot (WB), Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin or paraformaldehyde perfused rat brain tissues, and Immunofluorescence (IF). • Purification: Protein A is purified for high specificity and low background noise.  Other crucial factors:  • Storage: The antibody is stable at -20°C. Precautions that need to be taken care of are to avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles. • Research Specific: The antibody from MyBioSource is designed for neuroscience research involving neurodegeneration, calcium signaling, cellular mechanisms involving calcium buffering, as well as for auditory neuron studies.  • Cross-Species Reactivity: The antibody is anticipated to perform well in research with mouse, human, and non-human primate samples due to sequence homology.  • Life Science Relevance: Calretinin is important in neuroprotective roles as well as serves as a marker in neurological studies, such as analysis of calcium dynamics and neuronal resistance to excitotoxicity.  NOTE: The anti-CALB2 antibody is integral for academicians and researchers who are focused on elucidating the mechanisms of calcium regulation, neuronal function, and related biological pathways, while also supporting studies and literature review in neurodegeneration, auditory neuroscience, and developmental biology.  The anti-CALB2 antibody is intended for research use only and is not suitable for diagnostic, therapeutic, or clinical applications. Researchers should follow appropriate laboratory safety guidelines and validate antibody performance under their experimental conditions.
