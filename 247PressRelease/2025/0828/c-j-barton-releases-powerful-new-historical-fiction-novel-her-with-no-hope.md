NEBRASKA CITY, NE, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Accomplished storyteller and Midwest native C.J. Barton has released his highly anticipated historical fiction novel, Her With No Hope. Set in the late 1800s, this compelling story follows the harrowing journey of Mary Janes, a young girl captured by a Native American tribe and forced to adapt to a life of hardship, loss, and resilience.  The novel opens with Mary's fierce capture by the tribe led by the brutal Red Hawk, immediately immersing readers in a narrative of cultural conflict, trauma, and survival.

His personal struggles with loss and setbacks, as well as his dedication to his wife Donna Jean Barton, bring emotional depth and authenticity to the narrative.  "Her With No Hope is a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit and the bonds that hold us together. It is a story of love, survival, and the courage to keep moving forward, no matter how dark the road may seem," says C.J. Barton.  Early readers have praised the novel for its raw emotion and unforgettable storytelling, calling it a powerful journey of hope, survival, and perseverance.
