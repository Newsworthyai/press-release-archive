# From Clan Heritage to College Football: Mike MacQuarrie Launches Bias-Free Strength of Schedule Index

DANIEL ISLAND, SC, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a sport where passion runs deep but bias runs even deeper, one man is changing the way college football measures greatness. Mike MacQuarrie, historian, author of 15 sports books, and proud descendant of the ancient Scottish Clan MacQuarrie, is introducing a groundbreaking solution to one of football's oldest problems: how to fairly determine strength of schedule.  The MacQuarrie Strength of Schedule (SoS) Index is not about hype, headlines, or hometown favoritism—it's about math. Every week throughout the 2025 college football season, the Index will deliver updated, bias-free rankings determined solely by performance on the field and the quality of opponents faced.  No more coaches quietly voting for their own team. No more AP writers rushing to file stories before West Coast games finish. Just a clear, objective, mathematical measure of who truly belongs at the top.  "Collaboration is not about politics or preference—it's about performance," said MacQuarrie. "With this Index, the teams that earn it on the field will rise to the top. Period."  The End of Bias in College Football  In the current system, human voters in the Coaches Poll and AP rankings often bring bias to the process—intentionally or not. Coaches protect their own programs. Writers juggle deadlines and narratives. The result? Teams with weaker schedules sometimes leapfrog more deserving opponents.  The MacQuarrie Index aims to end that. By ranking the five highest-ranked conference champions and the next seven best-performing teams based strictly on math, the Index ensures the National Championship Playoff always includes the best 12 teams, not just the most famous.  Tradition Meets Transformation  MacQuarrie's passion for fairness traces back to his heritage. Clan MacQuarrie, one of Scotland's oldest Highland clans, descends from the 9th-century kings of the Picts and Dal Riata.  In Scotland's Highland Games, bias was unthinkable—strength, endurance, and skill spoke louder than opinion. MacQuarrie brings that same principle to college football: let performance—not politics—decide.  More Than Rankings: A New Football Experience  Beyond weekly rankings, the MacQuarrie Index will also highlight the traditions and culture that make college football great. Fans can expect features such as:  • Player of the Week and Coach of the Year selections by an advisory council of former players and coaches • Lists of the Toughest Stadiums, Largest Crowds, and Most Storied Rivalries • Insights into mascots, marching bands, tailgates, and the traditions that define Saturdays in the fall • Blog posts and fan discussions that keep the spirit of the game alive all season long  "Our goal is not just to fix bias—it's to enrich the fan experience," MacQuarrie explained. "We want this to be the place where fans debate, celebrate, and connect with the true heart of college football."  About Mike MacQuarrie  Mike MacQuarrie has authored 15 books on golf, sporting clays, and football, including deep dives into Michigan, Notre Dame, Clemson, Ohio State, the Heisman Trophy, and the legendary Ohio State–Michigan rivalry.  With his Scottish heritage and lifelong devotion to the game, MacQuarrie blends tradition with innovation to bring fans a fairer, fuller way to experience college football.  About the MacQuarrie Strength of Schedule Index  The MacQuarrie SoS Index mathematically evaluates team schedules without bias or pre-season hype. Rankings update weekly based on actual results and the strength of opponents, ensuring the top 12 playoff teams represent the best of college football.
