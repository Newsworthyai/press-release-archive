# Eaton Fire Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Announce Insurance Bad Faith Hotline at (833) 200-7111

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Eaton Fire Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been handling wildfire cases and other personal injury and employment law matters for over 3 decades. Recent developments for the Eaton Fire include local legislators pushing for immediate reforms due to State Farm and other insurers causing undue harm by refusing to handle legitimate claims in an expedient and professional manner.  Eaton Fire Attorneys agree with local legislators that State Farm and other insurance carriers are doing undue harm by forcing unavoidable hardships caused by insurance delays, denials and underpayments. "These legislators are definitely on the right track. Instead of helping their customers State Farm and other insurance carriers are doing everything they can to delay the rebuilding process," says Butch Wagner, Founder of The Wagner Law Group.  Personal injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have seen this type of activity from State Farm and other insurance companies many times in the past. "This type of insurance bad faith isn't uncommon. Unfortunately, State Farm is usually one of the worst companies for the insured to deal with. The customers pay their premiums for years without missing any payments and are routinely denied for claims they file," says Wagner. Assemblyman John Harabedian (D-Pasadena), and others are urging Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to crack down on alleged misconduct by insurers and to halt any rate increase for State Farm General which has already been approved.  Wrongful death lawyers at The Wagner Law Group agree with legislators, California State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez (D-Alhambra) and Fifth District Supervisor Kathryn Barger that have singled out State Farm General. They are California's largest home insurance provider and they are asking for a rate hike of 11% on top of an emergency rate hike of 17% that Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara approved in May.  California Wild Fire Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are also very supportive of the Pasadena City Councils decision to cut the red tape as much as they can by reducing fees associated with the rebuilding process. City Council member voted unanimously to waive fees because of a recommendation from the city's Economic Development and Technology Committee. They recommended reducing or eliminating a wide range of plan check, building permit, refuse, inspection, and utility service fees for eligible single-family and condominium properties affected by the Eaton Fire.  "The decision by the Pasadena City Council is very encouraging and it really shows that they understand that there is a problem and they doing whatever they can to help expedite the rebuilding process. Victims of the Eaton Fire and other fires that occurred in January need all of the help they can get, that is why we have launched the Insurance Bad Faith Hotline at (833) 200-7111, the insured and other victims can call the hotline to get no cost legal advice to determine whether or not we can help them get compensation," says Aaron of The Wagner Law Group.
