# Holistic Wellness Leader ArcticCollagen To Showcase Innovative Formulation at ECRM This September

BOCA RATON, FL, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Following multiple national launches, including on retail giant Amazon.com, as well as a national TV appearance on The Donna Drake Show, South Florida based ArcticCollagen has announced the next step of its expansion- the presentation of its innovative, sweet-tasting formula blending 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin C at this September's ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.   "We are excited for the opportunity to showcase our modernized, consumer-friendly collagen on a much larger stage, one that will place ArcticCollagen at the forefront of the industry and lead to powerful relationships with health-conscious businesses and consumers alike," said ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist. "As we expand our newfound reach, these connections will be essential for continued success."   Taking place September 7th through 10th at the PGA National Resort & Spa, the ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session specializes in connecting top-rated product manufacturers with retail buyers through private, one-on-one meetings, sparking long-term business connections and success. During the event, attendees, such as GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, and other major retailers, will have the opportunity to learn about ArcticCollagen's unique design and promise of quality compared to alternatives on the market.   Made from the sustainably sourced skin of wild caught, Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon, as well as hydrolyzed in Norway, ArcticCollagen is a one-a-day honey-like substance that significantly boosts the body's natural collagen levels, improving a variety of health issues especially as collagen levels deplete with age. Available in both strawberry and lemon varieties, ArcticCollagen's design allows it to be easily added to everyday breakfast foods and snacks for maximum comfort, as well as easily taken on the go for consumer convenience.   According to Healthline, collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, being the main component of connective tissue in tendons, ligaments, skin, and muscles. Additionally, collagen provides skin with structure as well as bone strength across the board. Supplements like ArcticCollagen target these parts of the body, helping slow skin aging (including dryness and wrinkles), relieve joint pain, lower inflammation, improve muscle mass, and even help heart, gut, and brain health.   "This year has truly been record-breaking for our team, and we could not be more grateful," added Winqvist. "Our attendance at this year's ECRM is a symbol of our current success, and we look forward to the new industry bonds we will forge in the near future."   ArcticCollagen is available for purchase on OneLavi.com, Medpaid Market, and Amazon.com, with a debut coming soon to Walmart.com. A pack of 14 single-use, tear-top sachets retails for $47.99.
