# When Women Lead, Organizations Thrive: Pegine Echevarria Honored with Legends Award

WASHINGTON, DC, August 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pegine Echevarria, MSW, CSP, international keynote speaker, bestselling author, and powerhouse leadership strategist, has been honored with the prestigious Legends of the Platform Award at the 2025 Legends Banquet.  The Legends Award, established in 2000 at the Veteran Speakers Retreat, has recognized only 138 top speakers worldwide, including icons such as Zig Ziglar, Jeanne Robertson, and Dan Burrus. This year, Pegine joined fellow honorees Mark LeBlanc, Ruby Newell, John Molidor, and Glenna Salsbury (posthumously) in a celebration hosted by Eileen McDargh. The evening was filled with heartfelt video tributes, standing ovations, and unforgettable speeches celebrating the extraordinary impact a powerful voice can have.  For Pegine, this recognition is more than personal—it's a call to action for organizations: when women leaders are bold, brave, seen, heard, and paid well, organizations thrive.  In her acceptance speech, Pegine shared: "Legends aren't born—they're forged. Forged in the fire of rejection, of starting over, of being told you're too much or not enough—and showing up anyway. This award is a reminder that women leaders must answer the call to lead. When they do, they influence, impact, and inspire entire organizations to rise."  The results are clear:  Women with MBAs see 55–65% pay increases within five years, with four out of five reporting stronger career opportunities.  73% of women MBA graduates say business school prepared them for leadership, and 79% reported promotions to higher-level roles.  Companies with at least 30% women in leadership can be 15% more profitable, while leadership teams with strong female representation make better decisions 87% of the time, leading to 60% stronger results.  In 2024, women reached a record high in Fortune 500 CEO roles, nearly half of whom hold MBAs.  Pegine embodies these truths. She is one of only a handful of Latinas in the Motivational Speakers Hall of Fame, a graduate of Leadership Florida and Leadership Jacksonville, and founder of Power Women Worldwide, a global community of speakers, experts, and coaches committed to amplifying women's leadership. She has been featured in Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, HR Magazine, and more.
