For those not familiar with TIP, they are an instrumental non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that those who are emotionally traumatized in emergency situations in Orange County receive the immediate assistance they need. TIP is comprised of over 100 specially trained and screened volunteers available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. TIP crisis volunteers are called by law enforcement, fire and hospital personnel to assist victims, families, friends, witnesses and bystanders by providing emotional support and practical resources.  Survivors of tragedy get a higher level of care because TIP is involved. TIP contributes more than 60,000 hours of volunteer time per year to the community. Having TIP on a scene lowers the stress level of emergency workers and helps them focus on the details of their job. TIP's volunteers provide emotional first aid to survivors of tragedy in order to ease their immediate suffering and facilitate their healing and long-term recovery.  Trauma Intervention Program of Orange County is a 501 C (3) tax exempt organization. Services are provided to survivors and their families free of charge and are made possible through sponsorship from local governments and agencies, gifts from individuals and businesses, foundations and through fundraising efforts.
