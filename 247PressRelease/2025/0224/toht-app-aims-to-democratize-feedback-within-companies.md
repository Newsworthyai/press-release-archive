# TOHT App aims to democratize feedback within companies

SAO PAULO, BRAZIL, February 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to a report by Spherical Insights & Consulting, as published by Globe News Wire, the global Human Resources technology market is projected to grow from USD 37.43 billion in 2023 to USD 88.38 billion by 2033. Covering areas such as human capital management, payroll processing, employee feedback, and performance evaluation, HR technology tools help streamline people management activities and processes, offering a wide range of software and hardware solutions.  One Brazilian company catering to this market, TOHT App, was founded in 2024 and has since provided various solutions for continuous and anonymous feedback through its technology platform.  Vanessa Kadissi, Marketing Director at TOHT App, explains that while many companies adopt performance evaluation practices, these processes are often bureaucratic and focused solely on the direct manager's perspective, which can limit employees' growth potential.  "Feedback is often given in isolation, without considering the multiple interactions an employee has across different departments. This creates an incomplete perception of their competencies. 360-degree feedback addresses this by incorporating perspectives from colleagues and leaders from various areas," she emphasizes.  Vanessa also highlights that employee feedback fosters open and transparent communication within organizations. "Research shows that teams receiving continuous and constructive feedback are more productive than those that do not. This happens because feedback creates a constant learning cycle, enabling employees to recognize their strengths, work on their development areas, and ultimately feel more valued and motivated," she explains.  Frequency and Engagement  A recent study by Gallup and Workhuman revealed that the frequency of feedback desired by employees does not always align with the optimal frequency for engagement. The findings highlight the need for leaders and managers to provide feedback that is meaningful to employees.  According to the study, among employees who receive both feedback and recognition from their manager at least once a week, 61% are engaged. Vanessa reinforces that continuous feedback is a key factor in employee development, as it fosters a continuous learning cycle that allows for quick adjustments and immediate recognition of achievements.  "With this in mind, TOHT offers 360-degree feedback twice a year, providing a broader perspective on development over time. Additionally, we provide continuous feedback, which can be used whenever necessaryâ€”after a meeting, a presentation, or any relevant interaction. This approach encourages ongoing development and helps employees identify areas for improvement in their daily activities."  Implementation Challenges  According to Vanessa, one of the biggest challenges companies face when creating a feedback culture is employees' reluctance to participate, whether in giving or receiving feedback. This hesitation often stems from fear of retaliation, lack of trust in the system, or negative past experiences.  "TOHT aims to overcome these challenges by offering a platform with tutorials and guides to help users give and receive feedback effectively. Moreover, the anonymous format encourages open and honest communication, especially in organizations where hierarchy may hinder sincere exchanges," she explains.  Another key feature of the platform, highlighted by Vanessa, is self-awareness assessments, such as the Big Five Personality Test offered by TOHT. "These tests help users better understand their behavioral traits, which is crucial for personal development. They provide practical insights on how to handle challenges, improve communication, and enhance skills," she emphasizes.  The Impact of a Feedback Culture  Vanessa also outlines the positive impact of a feedback culture in the workplace:  Engagement: Teams that receive continuous feedback tend to have higher engagement levels;  Organizational Climate: A strong feedback culture fosters a more collaborative work environment;  Personal and Professional Development: Continuous feedback provides employees with a clear path for growth, helping them gain a realistic understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement;  Reduced Turnover: Companies with a well-established feedback culture experience lower turnover rates, as employees feel they are growing and being recognized.  According to her, effective feedback is specific, constructive, and development-oriented, focusing on observable behaviors within the company while providing clear and practical improvement suggestions.  "On the other hand, poorly delivered feedback tends to be generic, unfoundedly critical, or presented in an inappropriate manner. This can lead to demotivation, misunderstandings, and even conflicts within the team," she concludes.
