# Assisted Living: What You Need To Know Before You Make A Decision - Is It A Retirement Home Or A Community Asks Frances Fuller, Author Of Bestselling Book On Aging, 'Helping Yourself Grow Old'

WILMINGTON, NC, January 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exploring the path that leads to the perfect place for one's retirement years can be both exciting and daunting. It's not just about selecting a "retirement home" or avoiding a "nursing home"; it's about discovering a place where we can belong and thrive. What we are really seeking is community - something that goes beyond mere bricks and mortar. A place where we can continue to grow, learn, and make meaningful connections, even as we enter this new chapter of our lives. How can we find that?  Frances Fuller, author of the best-selling book on aging, 'Helping Yourself Grow Old," recently published a blog post titled, "Signs It Is A Community" in which she presented a list of important attributes that tell us what a community looks like. In that post she stated in part:  When choosing a place to spend the final years of your life, you want to know: Is it just a place to retire or is it a community?  Signs it is a community:  Residents propose to the administration changes they think they would like, and the administration listens.  Residents organize interest groups: book clubs, gardens, hikes, wood-working projects.  Residents run the library, the rummage sale, the puzzle contest, and they decorate the Christmas tree together.  Residents hold community meetings to talk about common issues.  Residents tell the kitchen what they like and don't.  Residents have all rights to their apartments; they have the keys, can lock the doors, choose the décor, invite guests or not.  Residents welcome newcomers and help them find their way around.  The full post is available at https://www.inborrowedhouseslebanon.com/signs-it-is-a-community/  In 'Helping Yourself Grow Old, Things I Said To Myself When I Was Almost Ninety', Frances provides readers with a closeup view of what it means to age well.  Unable to find a guidebook for aging, Fuller decided that she must figure out for herself how to live wisely through the puzzles and possibilities of aging, and while she learned she wrote. The result is thirty-eight personal essays, most of them resolves, promises she is making to herself and her family. In them she deals with such issues as grief, loneliness, physical limitations, fears, duties, and with the significance of her own life story. Guided always by her Christian faith, she tries to make sense of her own past and to understand her responsibility to younger generations. In the process she shares her daily life, enriched with memories from her fascinating experiences. Her stories and her voice---fresh, honest, irresistible---keep the reader eager for more. Her questions are universal. Her answers create a map through the challenging terrain of old age.  Frances Fuller's book is unique among the many books on aging, because it is personal, while most such books are written from an academic point of view. Most are penned by sociologists, doctors, gerontologists, even the CEO of AARP, and one by a Catholic nun, Joan Chittister. Chittister's book, 'The Gift of Years' is beautifully written, focusing on spiritual values and finding meaning in life. Chittister admits in the preface that she was only 70, which is the front edge of aging, and her book is somewhat abstract.  Atul Gawande's book, 'On Being Mortal', relates medicine and old age, It enjoys high Amazon rankings, in the category of "the sociology of aging." It contains a great deal of valuable scientific information and shows understanding of the physical and emotional needs of the elderly.  Frances Fuller's book, 'Helping Yourself Grow Old, Things I Said To Myself When I Was Almost Ninety', is an up-close and very personal encounter with aging. It is an uncontrived and firsthand look at her own daily experiences: wrestling with physical limitations, grief, loneliness, fears, and the decisions she has made about how to cope with these and keep becoming a better person. She faces regrets and the need to forgive herself and others and is determined to live in a way that blesses her children and grandchildren.  Frances deals with many common, universal but sometimes private issues in an open, conversational tone. Her confessions and decisions invite self-searching and discussion. She tries to make sense of her own past and to understand her responsibility to younger generations. In the process she shares her daily life, enriched with memories from her fascinating experiences. Her stories and her voice — fresh, honest, irresistible — keep the reader eager for more. The end result is a book that helps create a detailed map through the challenging terrain of old age.  The result of this intimate narrative is that readers laugh, cry and identify with her mistakes and problems. Reviewers have called the book, "unique," "honest," "witty," "poignant," "challenging" and "life-changing."  For these reasons it is a book unlike any other book on aging you will ever read. The book can serve as a primer on what lies in store for all of us, from someone who is working through many of these issues. While the book is a perfect fit for book clubs, there are many other individuals and groups who could benefit from the information and ideas in the book:  Those approaching retirement People who are currently retired Children of aging parents Those who have lost a spouse Retirement community discussion groups Counselors Educators Life coaches Church groups (men and women)  and a host of others. For group discussions, Fuller has made a set of discussion questions available at her website at http://www.FrancesFullerAuthor.com.  Readers have lavished praise on the new book.
