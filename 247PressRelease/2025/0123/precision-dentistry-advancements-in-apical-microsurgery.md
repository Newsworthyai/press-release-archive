# Precision dentistry: advancements in apical microsurgery

KNOXVILLE, TN, January 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new expert consensus on apical microsurgery has been released, offering a comprehensive guide to this highly effective, minimally invasive dental procedure. With a success rate exceeding 90%, apical microsurgery represents a significant leap forward in the treatment of periapical diseases. The consensus aims to fill a critical gap in understanding and awareness among dental professionals, striving to standardize clinical practices and improve treatment outcomes. By doing so, it ensures that more patients benefit from this precise and less traumatic approach to root canal complications.  Root canal therapy is a common treatment for periapical diseases, boasting a success rate of over 80%. However, due to the complexities of the root canal system and the occurrence of true cysts, some cases still require surgical intervention. Apical microsurgery, developed in the 1990s, offers a more targeted, minimally invasive alternative. Despite its proven advantages, many dental professionals remain unaware of the procedure's full potential, leading to underutilization and suboptimal treatment outcomes. These challenges underscore the pressing need for research, awareness, and standardization in apical microsurgery practices.  On January 2, 2025, the International Journal of Oral Science published (DOI: 10.1038/s41368-024-00334-8) an expert consensus that provides a detailed guide to apical microsurgery. This groundbreaking document, developed by leading dental experts, aims to improve clinical practice and expand the application of this highly effective but often overlooked procedure.  The consensus offers a comprehensive framework for the practice of apical microsurgery, covering every aspect from preoperative assessment to postoperative care. It emphasizes the importance of advanced imaging techniques, such as Cone Beam CT (CBCT), for precise preoperative planning. These imaging tools enable surgeons to map the surgical site with great accuracy and anticipate potential challenges. The document meticulously outlines the surgical procedure itself, with a particular focus on the use of dental microscopes to enhance visualization. This technology is crucial for the accurate identification and resection of the root apex, ensuring optimal outcomes. The consensus also provides guidance on flap design, recommending techniques that minimize tissue trauma and promote faster healing. In addition, it addresses root-end preparation and the selection of filling materials, stressing the importance of biocompatibility and sealing effectiveness. By tackling these technical details, the consensus aims to standardize the procedure, set new benchmarks for safety, and significantly improve the success rates of apical microsurgery.  Dr. Qin Yu, a leading author of the consensus and a renowned expert in dental surgery, underscored the transformative potential of this initiative. "Apical microsurgery has proven to be a highly effective procedure for treating periapical diseases, yet its full potential has been hampered by a lack of awareness among dental professionals," said Dr. Yu. "This consensus represents a major advancement. It provides a clear, evidence-based guide that will empower dentists to perform this procedure with greater precision and confidence, leading to improved patient outcomes and the preservation of natural teeth. We believe this will set a new standard in dental care."  The adoption of this expert consensus is expected to revolutionize the treatment of periapical diseases in dentistry. By offering a standardized, evidence-based approach to apical microsurgery, it equips dental professionals with the tools necessary to execute this minimally invasive procedure effectively. This will not only improve the success rates of treatments but also contribute to the preservation of natural teeth, an important advancement in patient care. With its emphasis on precision and minimal invasiveness, the consensus is poised to reduce complications and enhance patient satisfaction, establishing a new benchmark for the management of complex root canal cases and advancing the standard of dental health care worldwide.
