MADRID, SPAIN, January 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- During the opening of the FITUR 2025 fair at IFEMA Madrid, His Majesty King Felipe VI visited the stand of the Valencian Community, where he had the opportunity to learn about 'The Way of the Holy Grail' from Dr. Ana Mafé García, president of the Cultural Itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail'. This meeting shows a clear recognition of the work of cultural and tourist promotion of this important historical itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail.'  On this first day of FITUR, the team from 'The Way of the Holy Grail' conducted interviews for the programme they host weekly on Play Radio Valencia (107.7 FM), highlighting the importance of tourism agents in promoting this itinerary.  The interviews gave visibility to various initiatives related to The Way of the Holy Grail. Esther Valero, from Socarrat Studio, discussed the celebration of World Paella Day on 20 September, strengthening the connection between gastronomy and cultural tourism.  José Manuel Palanca, councillor of Culture of Massamagrell, also highlighted the success of the 3rd International Congress of Dissemination and Journalism 'The Way of the Holy Grail', held last November in his municipality. The results of this congress are reflected in the annual magazine CCIESG that the association is distributing to those who show interest in the itinerary.  The initiative of Carmen Calvente, from Mundo Marino, is to develop 'El Camino del Santo Graal: Ruta de Salvamento' (The Way of the Holy Grail: Path of Peace) in collaboration with the municipality of Denia and the Asociación El Camino del Santo Graal.  Pepe Cotaina, from the Asociación Gastronomía Cultural Amics de les Coques de Oliva, proposed joint participation in the next international coques competition in Oliva, promoting the presence of The Way of the Holy Grail.  Alejandro Noguera, from the Museo de l'Iber, presented its cultural offer and proposed future collaborations on the occasion of the next Jubilee.  Also present at the event were members of the Italian team of 'The Way of the Holy Grail' represented by Davide Grasso and Francesco Vincenzo Laurato of the Se Viaja agency. Their work consists of presenting the itinerary to young people from Europe who are taking part in the ERAMUS + programme in Valencia. This work helps to internationalise 'The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, Path of Peace' among students from all over Europe.  The Spanish team of 'The Way of the Holy Grail', composed of Dr. Ana Mafé García, Liubov Daniel Alvariño, Carmen Gromaz Armenteros, Jesús Gimeno Péris and José Cuñat reaffirms its commitment to the promotion and development of the itinerary as a key resource for cultural and spiritual tourism in the Valencian Community, Aragon and Europe.
