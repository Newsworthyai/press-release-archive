# Document Scanning Success from One Little Sheet

VANCOUVER, BC, May 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To increase the success of various document scanning projects, the team at Micro Com Systems adopted a simple innovation–when it's patch coded, a bar-coded separator sheet makes a big difference. For more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/question-how-can-one-piece-of-paper-make-such-a-big-difference/  When scanning business records started gaining significant traction decades ago, savvy developers began responding to requests for efficiency on multiple levels. Many of these were/are fundamentally simple, but that didn't limit their impact.  The patch code is a great place to start, for example. Scanner manufacturers started building the capability to read patch codes into products in the 1980s. This series of horizontal lines instructs the scanner to do many things, but in this case, Micro Com Systems uses it to tell the scanner to create a new document. The scanner will add new pages to the newly created document until it sees another patch code. It's a simple solution to minimize human intervention, lowering costs and increasing efficiency, making it a win for clients.  Introducing the Bar Code Separator  The next feature of the Separator is the bar code, which can be used to trigger events, name batches/documents and pull validation data from external sources. In other words:  1.	The bar code can effectively create an audit trail to ensure every file expected to be processed actually was. 2.	The bar code can set a document type without operator involvement. 3.	The bar code can create values that can be used to reach out to canvas external databases to locate matching data to prefill index/validation fields, thus negating expensive operator keystrokes and eliminating typing mistakes before they happen.  In addition to the background operations described above, the team at Micro Com can also place a significant amount of human-readable information on the Separator sheet, so it can be matched to the correct file when the documents are prepared for scanning.  However, the best feature of the Separator might be how it disappears at the conclusion of all document scanning projects. After scanning, quality control, and human validation of document type and indexing data, the Separator is automatically discarded electronically as the digital files are exported to the format requested by the client.  One piece of paper–and a little innovation–can make a big difference!  About the Company  Since 1975, Micro Com Systems has been providing local businesses with Document Management Solutions.
