# VOTE NOW: Michigan's Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park Is Competing for the Top Spot in USA TODAY's 10Best State Parks

IRON MOUNTAIN, MI, May 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- USA TODAY recently announced its 20 nominees for the 2025 10Best State Parks. Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is vying with parks from across the country for the top spot in the Readers' Choice contest that ends May 12.  "We are excited that USA TODAY editors and a panel of travel experts have recognized Michigan's largest state park as one of the most remarkable in the nation," said Tom Nemacheck, executive director of the Upper Peninsula Travel and Recreation Association. "The Porkies represent the last great wilderness in the Midwest. It's a place of beauty and boundless adventure."  Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park stands out from other nominees on many levels. This wild, mountainous landscape spans nearly 60,000 acres in the western Upper Peninsula and could take days to explore fully. Its signature mountain range rises abruptly above Lake Superior to an elevation of 1,958 feet. These ancient rounded, forested mountains are some of the oldest on the planet!   Visitors can encounter the wilderness on over 90 miles of hiking trails, chase over 70 waterfalls, paddle along miles of scenic rivers and streams and take in sweeping vistas of Lake Superior's rugged shoreline. The park also protects 35,000 acres of untamed old-growth forest and abundant wildlife â€” one of the largest wilderness areas in the Midwest. Unforgettable experiences await, from the breathtaking Lake of the Clouds Overlook, Summit Peak Observation Tower to Copper Peak, where clear skies reveal a rare, three-state view of parts of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Nemacheck said this four-season outdoor playground offers something for everyone from weekend wanderers to die-hard explorers. It is a popular destination for hikers, off-the-grid backpackers, anglers, kayakers, fall color seekers, snowmobilers, downhill and cross-country skiers and snowshoers.   "It's now our turn to vote every day and let America know the Porkies are the best of the best."  USA TODAY readers will determine the top 10 state parks by voting for their favorite among the 20 nominees posted online. The contest is open now and ends May 12 at noon ET. Readers can vote once per day until the poll closes. USA TODAY will announce the final rankings of the top 10 winners on May 21.   Cast daily votes at the U.P.
