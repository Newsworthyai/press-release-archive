LINCOLN, CA, May 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Club Cruise™, one of the largest and most trusted travel agencies on the West Coast, proudly announces the launch of its dedicated Club Cruise Viking River & Ocean Department, an elite concierge service specifically created to serve Viking Cruise travelers with expert guidance, insider access, and white-glove service.  At the helm of this groundbreaking department is Heather Faith Huber, affectionately known by clients as "Heather Viking." Recently named a 30 Under 30 Luxury Travel Advisor's Rising Star by Top Travel Magazine, Heather brings not only passion and drive but an unrivaled understanding of Viking's river and ocean cruise offerings. Her reputation as a top sales producer and marketing strategist has positioned her as one of the most sought-after Viking Cruise experts in the country.  Over the past several years, Heather has personally managed and sold top volume dollars in Viking River and Ocean cruise bookings, including extended journeys and high-value suite accommodations. With an industry-leading repeat guest return rate and a referral base that continues to grow organically, she has demonstrated the high-impact potential of one-to-one luxury consultation. Her clients are not just passengers—they are long-term relationships that she nurtures with deep cruise knowledge and concierge-level service.  Club Cruise has seen a dramatic surge in Viking Cruise bookings over the last 18 months, reporting a 44% increase in Viking River Cruises and a 61% increase in Viking Ocean Cruises sales compared to the previous period. Heather's department has played a critical role in this growth, with her team capturing high-end clientele and transforming first-time Viking passengers into lifelong travelers. With more than 90% of 2025 inventory already sold out, Heather and her team are helping clients uncover remaining space, secure free airfare, and leverage exclusive offers.  "I wanted to create a space where both seasoned Viking guests and first-time explorers feel seen, heard, and expertly taken care of," says Heather Huber. "We designed this department to give guests access to everything from free airfare promos and shipboard credits to custom pre- and post-cruise experiences—and we do it all with care."
