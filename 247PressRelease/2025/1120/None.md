A New Kind of Art Drop More than an art show, this is a full-scale creative experiment blending digital-world aesthetics, physical craftsmanship, and a theatrical live performance. The event serves as Low Poly Farms' first public gallery appearance ahead of the brand's upcoming quarterly drops.  "Low Poly Farms is about building a world — part Minecraft nostalgia, part Midwestern myth, part futuristic art toy culture," said creator and sculptor Austin Horton. "This event is the first time the public will experience that world in person."  Low Poly Farms produces museum-quality voxel-art sculptures inspired by gaming culture and handcrafted using long-lasting archival materials. Every piece is created by the artist who sculpted iconic props for the Minecraft Movie premiere. With limited runs and quarterly drops, Low Poly Farms blends fine art, nostalgia, and collectible culture into a new aesthetic niche.  Website: https://lowpolyfarms.com
