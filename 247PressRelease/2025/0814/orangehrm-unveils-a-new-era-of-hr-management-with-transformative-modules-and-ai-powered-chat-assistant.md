# OrangeHRM Unveils a New Era of HR Management with Transformative Modules and AI-Powered Chat Assistant

SECAUCUS, NJ, August 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- OrangeHRM, a leading global provider of human resource management solutions, announces the release of four major new additions to its platform: comprehensive Surveys, dynamic Roster, a robust Grievances module, and Citra, an advanced AI-powered chat assistant.   This groundbreaking expansion marks a significant leap forward in empowering businesses to build more connected, efficient, and empathetic workplaces. The new modules are designed to provide a holistic and integrated approach to employee engagement, operational efficiency, and workplace fairness, reinforcing OrangeHRM's commitment to delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of the modern workforce management.  This launch is the culmination of extensive research and development aimed at addressing some of the most pressing challenges faced by HR departments today. In an increasingly competitive global talent landscape, attracting and retaining top talent requires more than just a competitive salary. It demands a culture of continuous feedback, transparent communication, operational flexibility, and fair resolution of conflicts. The new modules are meticulously crafted to support these pillars, enabling HR professionals to move from reactive administrative tasks to proactive strategic initiatives.  The Surveys Module: Capturing the Voice of the Workforce  The new Surveys module represents a powerful tool for organizations seeking to genuinely understand their employees. Unlike generic survey tools, the OrangeHRM Surveys module is deeply integrated into the core HR platform, allowing for more targeted, meaningful, and actionable data collection. HR professionals can now create, deploy, and analyze a wide range of surveys. The module's intuitive drag-and-drop interface makes building custom surveys a seamless process, while a library of professionally designed templates for common HR scenarios ensures that businesses can start gathering insights immediately.  Key features of the Surveys module include creating a more personalized and relevant experience for the employee. The module also supports anonymous submissions, which is crucial for fostering an environment of trust and encouraging honest feedback on sensitive topics. Once data is collected, a suite of powerful analytics and reporting tools transforms raw responses into actionable insights. HR can uncover pain points and measure the impact of new initiatives. This capability allows leaders to move beyond anecdotal evidence and make data-driven decisions that directly improve employee satisfaction and retention. By giving employees a platform to voice their opinions and demonstrating that their feedback is valued, organizations can significantly boost morale and create a more inclusive and responsive culture. The Surveys module is not just a tool for collecting data; it is a mechanism for dialogue, change, and continuous improvement.  The Roster Module: Optimizing Schedules with Unprecedented Flexibility  For industries with shift-based work, such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and hospitality, effective scheduling is paramount to operational efficiency and employee satisfaction. The new OrangeHRM Roster module provides a sophisticated solution that moves beyond static spreadsheets and rigid systems. It empowers managers to create, manage, and optimize employee schedules with unprecedented flexibility and intelligence. The module's intuitive calendar-based interface provides a clear, visual overview of the entire workforce, allowing managers to easily assign shifts, manage absences, and ensure adequate staffing levels at all times.  The Roster module incorporates smart features designed to prevent common scheduling errors and compliance issues. This proactive approach helps reduce administrative burden and mitigates legal risks. Employees are also empowered through the module's self-service capabilities. This level of transparency and control not only improves work-life balance for employees but also reduces the number of time-consuming requests and communications that HR and managers have to handle. Moreover, the Roster module's powerful reporting tools provide valuable insights into staffing trends. Businesses can analyze historical data to forecast future staffing needs more accurately, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately, drive down operational costs while improving service delivery. It transforms the often-chaotic process of shift management into a streamlined, efficient, and collaborative function.  The Grievances Module: Fostering Fairness and Accountability  A fair and just workplace is the foundation of a healthy and productive organization. The new OrangeHRM Grievances module is specifically designed to provide a structured, transparent, and confidential system for managing employee grievances and formal complaints. The module establishes a clear, standardized process for employees to raise concerns, ensuring that every issue is logged, tracked, and addressed in a timely manner. This not only protects employees but also protects the organization by ensuring that all procedures are followed consistently and fairly.  The module provides a secure and confidential channel for employees to submit grievances, with options for anonymity where appropriate. The system provides a complete audit trail of every action taken, from the initial submission to the final resolution, including all communication and attached documents. This detailed record is invaluable for maintaining legal compliance and defending against potential disputes. Furthermore, the module includes a comprehensive workflow management system that guides HR through the entire grievance process, from initial investigation and witness interviews to mediation and resolution. It ensures that no step is missed and that all internal policies and legal requirements are met. The reporting features of the Grievances module provide valuable insights into common workplace issues, allowing HR to identify systemic problems and implement proactive measures to prevent future incidents. By fostering a culture of accountability and providing a trusted platform for resolution, the Grievances module strengthens employee trust and demonstrates a company's commitment to fairness and integrity.  Citra: The AI-Powered HR Chat Assistant  In an age where speed and accessibility are paramount, OrangeHRM introduces Citra, an AI-powered chat assistant designed to revolutionize how employees and HR interact with the platform. Citra is integrated directly into the OrangeHRM portal, providing instant, 24/7 support for a wide range of HR inquiries.

For HR, Citra acts as a powerful knowledge base and support tool, capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous queries and providing consistent, accurate information every time. This technology is a game-changer for large organizations and those with a global workforce, where employees in different time zones can get immediate answers without having to wait for a human HR representative. Citra is not just a chatbot; it is the embodiment of OrangeHRM's vision for a more intelligent, responsive, and user-centric HR platform.
