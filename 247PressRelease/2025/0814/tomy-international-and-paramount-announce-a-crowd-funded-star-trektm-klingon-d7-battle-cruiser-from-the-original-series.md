# TOMY INTERNATIONAL AND PARAMOUNT ANNOUNCE A CROWD-FUNDED STAR TREK™ Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser FROM THE ORIGINAL SERIES

OAK BROOK, IL, August 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TOMY announced a large-scale crowd-funded Star Trek Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser will be available for pre-order starting August 6, 2025, through September 5, 2025. Based on the Battle Cruiser from The Original Series, this offering for Star Trek fans creates a unique opportunity to own the definitive version of an enemy ship. The crowd-funded project, culminating in the creation of the highly detailed 1:350 scale premium die-cast Klingon D7, is the third collaboration for the partners.  "This TOMY Plus crowd-funded Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser will be a great addition, and long awaited, feature piece of any avid Star Trek fan's collection," said Morgan Weyl, Managing Director of Licensing and Global Development at TOMY International. "We have never done an enemy ship in the Star Trek fleet before, so it will be exciting to give the fans something new. We can't wait to see the response when we launch the campaign at the Las Vegas fan convention in early August!"  TOMY continues to work with renowned Star Trek experts, such as Gary Kerr, Karl Tate, Glen Swanson and Matthew Cushman to ensure this replica is as accurate as possible. This is also the first time TOMY will be offering two color options for their product offering, both of which are highly collectible and represent genuine pieces of Star Trek history. The Original Concept Design, which was the original concept for the ship, is a two-tone gray and green replica. The second version is the Original TV Series Screen Model, which was what was used in filming. Kerr explains, "Matt Jefferies, art director of the original Star Trek series and designer of the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon D7, once said:  'Even though it is not dangerous, I think a lot of people think the manta ray has a very vicious look to it, yet when it swims it is very graceful. I was trying to get all of that in there. Then the coloration came directly from a shark- it's a grayish-green on top and a lighter gray underneath.'   While it's unclear if Jefferies was describing the D7's final colors or recalling inspiration, he clearly intended a two-tone scheme. Jefferies had both models painted with the two-tone paint scheme, but it's unclear whether a repainted model was filmed. Fan interpretations based on how the ship looked on 1960s TVs are not reliable; otherwise, the Enterprise might have ended up white or pale blue."  Exciting features include: • 1:350 scale, 26" x 17.88" x 11.08" in dimension (with display stand) • Two different variants to collect: the Original Two-Tone Concept Design and the Original TV Gray Series Screen Model featuring a die-cast metal base, Command Pod, Access Boom, and Main Hull • Three different light modes and includes remote control ("no lights" Classic TV mode, Mode 2 and Mode 3), which light up an array of features including the Impulse Drive, Nacelles, Disruptors, and Weaponized Main Sensor • Two Klingon Shuttlecraft • Display base with Type-C USB power plug in (no cable included) • Specifically designed Klingon D7 Collectible Cutaway Poster illustrated by Matthew Cushman  • Premium collector packaging  The TOMY Star Trek Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser will weigh approximately 12lbs and be priced at $699 USD (United States, Canada and United Kingdom) and production will begin in the fall after the combined goal of 3,000 pieces is met. TOMY is supporting the announcement of the limited-time, crowd-funded Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser offering with a robust digital campaign targeting U.S., Canada, and U.K. Star Trek fans and will also promote the preview on startrek-signup.tomy.com/d7.
