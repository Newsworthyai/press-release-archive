Marc Whitehead & Associates' 2025 Frances & Earl Perry Memorial Veterans Scholarship goes to Mah-Kayla Joseph, a pre-law track student at Louisiana State University.

Mah-Kayla hopes to translate her experience working with military families and other communities in need into a career in law. She looks forward to one day making her legal services available to underserved communities and hopes to offer pro bono services to those in the most need of assistance.  Ava Deakin stands to receive Marc Whitehead & Associates' 2025 Flora Marie Jenkins Memorial Disability Scholarship.
