# Long Jewelers Celebrates Industry Connections, Local Recognition, and Exciting Pre-Owned Watch Opportunities

VIRGINIA BEACH, VA, August 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This summer, Deanna, Renee, and Jon of Long Jewelers attended the prestigious Independent Jewelers Organization (IJO) Conference in Indianapolis. The event offered an invaluable opportunity to meet with trusted suppliers, explore new trends, and gain insight from industry leaders. One highlight was the keynote presentation by Derek Daly, celebrated Formula 1 and IndyCar Champion. Coincidentally, the Long Jewelers team's visit aligned with the WNBA All-Star Weekend, allowing them to enjoy the electrifying game and its surrounding festivities.  In addition to expanding their professional network, Long Jewelers is honored to announce that they have once again been named Best of the Beach in Virginia Beach; a title they have proudly held nearly every year for the past three decades with only a single second-place finish in that time. This enduring recognition speaks to the trust and loyalty they have earned from their community.  Adding to the excitement, Long Jewelers invites timepiece enthusiasts to explore their exceptional selection of pre-owned luxury watches. These carefully curated pieces offer outstanding value and timeless appeal.
