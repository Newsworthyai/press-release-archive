WILMINGTON, NC, January 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Richard McMaster has announced that his bestselling WWII novel, 'Aaron's War', will be available at no charge in ebook form on January 28, 2025 at Amazon.  Even today, in the year 2025, World War II holds a special place in the minds of millions of Americans. We are enthralled with stories about this time period. WWII movies such as 'Schindler's List', 'Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line' have raked in millions of dollars from audiences, always eager for more.  Unlike these cinematic achievements however, books have the unique ability to transport us deeply into the MINDS of characters, allowing us to fully understand their thoughts, feelings, and motivations. The ability to craft this level of intimacy and insight creates a deeper connection between the reader and the characters. We can hear the characters' internal monologues, understand their thought processes, and see the world from their perspective.  Bestselling author Richard McMaster is a master of that craft.  'Aaron's War' is a gripping coming-of-age story that takes readers on a journey through the harsh realities of World War II. The protagonist, Aaron Vanko, an innocent Iowa farm boy, faces the ultimate test of humanity - the willingness to kill in the name of duty.  But Aaron's journey takes a shocking turn when he discovers that he is Jewish, a revelation that adds a new layer of complexity to his journey overseas. He must now grapple with his allegiance to his country, his personal beliefs, and his newfound identity while battling the enemy forces that threaten his very existence.  'Aaron's War'is not just a historical narrative, but a powerful exploration of the enduring challenges that have persisted across generations. From the ethical dilemmas that soldiers face on the battlefield to the personal struggles that veterans confront upon their return home, this story offers a poignant examination of the human condition.  This captivating tale sheds light on the timeless issues of antisemitism, PTSD, and substance abuse, making its exploration of these issues all the more relevant and compelling.  USA TODAY Best-Selling Author Holly S. Roberts says 'Aaron's War' is "A coming of age story that grips your soul and takes you on a thought-provoking journey."  Richard McMaster is making the ebook available at no charge January 28 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-McMaster/author/B01LDIJ2QU.  Readers and reviewers have praised 'Aaron's War'. Tom Porter, author of All I Need To Know About Business I Learned From A Duck stated, "An engaging, informative and thought-provoking tale of survival, love and faith. Make room for Richard McMaster on your list of up-and-coming authors." Lynn M. Safris said, "The descriptions and details given throughout this author's writing draw the reader into each page, making Aaron's journey feel like their own. I believe this book would appeal to a wide audience of readers. I truly enjoyed reading Aaron's War and I highly recommend this book."  Richard McMaster is also the author of 'A Love Divided By Time', described as "one part The Notebook, one part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter, and find peace by joining her in the ever after.  A Writer's Digest critique stated, "This book is exemplary in its voice and writing style. It has a unique voice, and the writing style is consistent throughout."  In McMaster's latest book, 'Voyage Of Life', the life journey of Sean Buchanan is detailed through metaphoric depictions of the four stages of life in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings, childhood, youth, manhood, and Old Age. The painting's depictions are a metaphor for his life—the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood become turbulent in youth, and early in manhood the shores turn rocky when he faces one obstacle after another. Secrets that live in darkness can take a lifetime to see the light of day and the secret that has hovered over him since Youth is revealed late in his life.
