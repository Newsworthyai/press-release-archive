# Vehicle-Mounted Stand for 18-inch Laptops – Caro STAND & TABLE Launching on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CAOMOBI, a leading company specializing in automotive accessories, is launching the Caro STAND & TABLE on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. It is designed for those who use their car as a private office or relaxation space. It consists of a STAND that can be used independently and a TABLE that can be used in combination.  The Caro STAND attaches securely to the car's steering wheel, providing a stable platform for laptops, tablets, and keyboards. It supports 13-inch and 15-inch laptops, as well as a dual-monitor setup with a laptop and a tablet. Thanks to its weight-distributing structure, it can even accommodate laptops up to 18 inches—a standout feature among existing car mounts.  The stand features an adjustable clamp mechanism for horizontal and vertical positioning, allowing users to set it to their preferred angle. Once adjusted, there's no need for further readjustments, making repeated use hassle-free. Additionally, non-slip padding ensures a secure grip while protecting both the steering wheel and the laptop.  Unlike many car mounts that make getting in and out of the vehicle difficult after installation, Caro STAND folds downward toward the steering wheel, allowing easy entry and exit without removal—a key advantage over other products.  The Caro TABLE, which attaches to the Caro STAND, is a foldable two-tier table designed for users who need extra space for their belongings. It also features a seven-level adjustable angle system, allowing users to position their laptops at the ideal viewing height for comfort and convenience.  With a maximum weight capacity of 33 lbs(15kg), Caro STAND & TABLE provides exceptional stability. Its compact, foldable design allows for easy storage in the glove box or side door compartments, and at only 14.46 oz (approx. 400g), it's lightweight and highly portable.  Caro STAND & TABLE by CAOMOBI will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting April 1, 2025. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751778625/caro-stand-and-table-work-and-rest-in-your-car?ref=9vr8fq
