# The Mission Driven Bank Fund backs innovative community lender

CLEVELAND, OH, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Mission Driven Bank Fund (MDBF) today announced an investment in American Bancorp Inc., the bank holding company for American Pride Bank, a Minority-Depository Institution (MDI) providing financial services to underserved communities in Georgia and across the U.S. The investment adds to the Fund's growing portfolio of mission-aligned banks receiving capital and technical services tailored to their needs.  American Pride Bank plans to use the capital to expand homeownership and small business opportunities in low- and moderate-income communities. This includes launching a mortgage division specializing in innovative products, while also expanding its real estate, small business, and consumer lending activities. Currently, most of the bank's loans are to businesses in low- and moderate-income communities, with nearly three-quarters going to members of racial or ethnic minority groups.  "We can't wait to put this capital to work in neighborhoods across America," said Dominik Mjartan, CEO of American Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiary, American Pride Bank. "Our goal is to ensure everyone has access to the products and services they need to achieve their American Dream. Too often, ambitious, high-potential people and places are overlooked and underserved. We're grateful to the Fund for their partnership in closing those gaps."*  The investment marks the eighth deployment for MDBF. The Fund is raising capital through May 2025, and will continue to invest in mission-aligned banks for years to come.  "The Fund is pleased to partner with American Pride Bank to support their recent receipt of the MDI designation," said Paul Welch, portfolio manager of the Fund. This investment is another example of how the Fund's commitment to building long-term bank partnerships contributes to a more inclusive banking system."
