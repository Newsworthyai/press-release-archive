# Akash Network Integrates Packet (PKT) Network Infrastructure

NEW YORK, NY, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Packet (PKT) has successfully integrated with Akash Network, simplifying the deployment of on-demand PKT infrastructure to power its media network of the future. This new integration enables one-click deployments, simplifying the launch of Cjdns nodes which support the Packet Network and earn daily PKT rewards.  The Packet Network is a globally accessible media network. It is designed with its own domain name system (PKT DNS), which offers free-for-life domains that are accessible from any browser worldwide without requiring special software. Packet breaks down geofencing barriers while empowering creators with global distribution and transparent, on-chain revenue. Built on Coinbase's blockchain, Base, Packet has launched a stake-to-earn protocol that rewards users in daily PKT rewards for deploying and maintaining its network infrastructure.  The successful integration with Akash Network, an open-source marketplace for cloud computing, enables easy deployment of network infrastructure to support Packet's growing decentralized network. This integration streamlines Packet Network users' infrastructure requirements, without complicated setups. Users can connect their PKT stake with infrastructure deployed through Akash's extensive global network of datacenter-grade computing resources and start earning daily PKT rewards.  "Akash Networks has quickly become one of the most powerful decentralized infrastructure providers in the world. It is fitting for the Packet community to work with Akash to deliver the necessary resources to grow Packet's media network worldwide. The result is a global media distribution network powered by the people. This opens the door to, and is the foundation for, fair and transparent media distribution for creators around the world," said Jesse Berger, a Packet founding community member.  About Packet:  Packet is a decentralized media network ecosystem powered by the people. Built as a decentralized physical infrastructure project (DePIN), Packet's Stake-to-Earn protocol on Base rewards people in the native cryptocurrency PKT to power the Packet Network worldwide. The network is designed so that anyone can list media platforms and content for global discovery across entertainment, gaming, music, and more.  Packet's technology stack includes free-for-life websites (PKT DNS), open internet access, and decentralized media platform called Packet Hub.
