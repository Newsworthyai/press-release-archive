NEW YORK, NY, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sonimedi (SONIMEDI), operating under the Bio Cell Fusion Science Institute and a leading name in K-Bio beauty, has made a significant impact on the European beauty industry by winning the 'Best Hair Product' Award at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2025, the world's largest beauty trade show.  The award-winning product, OVACO ProBio 6 Melanocell Shampoo, represents a breakthrough in hair care innovation, formulated with Sonimedi's proprietary Quadruple Multi-Function Fusion Technology. This advanced system works by balancing the scalp microbiome using a six-strain probiotic complex, protecting against UV-induced scalp damage through melanocyte activation, providing clinically certified anti-hair loss functionality, and delivering intensive repair for damaged hair.  This cutting-edge approach to scalp and hair health reflects Sonimedi's dedication to combining biotechnology with consumer needs, creating products that are both functional and future-forward.  Originally introduced in high-end aesthetic salons across Spain, OVACO gained popularity for its visible results. Without large-scale marketing, the product quickly grew in demand across Europe. Its word-of-mouth success has become a case study in product-driven brand growth. Many in the industry now refer to OVACO as a "brand that speaks for itself."  A Sonimedi spokesperson commented, "Our research is rooted in humanity, life, and the intrinsic value of existence. This award affirms that our commitment to authenticity and innovation is resonating globally. We're proud to lead the evolution of K-Bio beauty."  As K-beauty enters a new phase, Sonimedi is positioning K-Bio beauty as its scientific successorâ€”focusing not only on skincare but also on holistic cellular health.  Beyond cosmetics, Sonimedi has expanded into home-use beauty devices, including focused ultrasound, radiofrequency, and galvanic systems. These high-performance tools, developed through years of in-house R&D, are already being adopted in dermatology clinics and salons worldwide.  The company's dedication to user-friendly, medically inspired skincare technology reflects growing global demand for professional-grade results at home.  Looking ahead, Sonimedi is actively developing next-generation applied biocell beauty solutions. This includes innovation in stem cells, iPS cells, exosomes, peptides, and biomaterials, aimed at enhancing skin regeneration and anti-aging outcomes. The company's biocell technologies are designed to support both cosmetic efficacy and long-term skin health.  With a solid foundation in global partnerships, Sonimedi is rapidly expanding across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, strengthening its presence in both retail and professional channels.  By aligning cutting-edge science with sustainability and transparency, Sonimedi continues to build trust with global consumers.
