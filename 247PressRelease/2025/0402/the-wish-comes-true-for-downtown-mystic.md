# The Wish Comes True For DownTown Mystic

NEW YORK, NY, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sha-La Music, Inc. announces the worldwide release of the new digital album The Wish by US Roots Rocker DownTown Mystic. The album will be released to all streaming services worldwide via The Orchard/Sony Music on April 11 and impacts Radio on April 15. Brandon Day/Tinderbox Music will handle radio promotion. The new video for The Wish is the 3rd AI video created by Joshua Elyashiv for DTM, with Jon Delange/Tinderbox Music handling video promotion.  The Wish album will have 12 songs in total, including 2 bonus tracks. The success of the Better Day and One More Chance singles, released in advance of the album, set the bar high. The positive vibes that flow throughout the album are evident from the opening title track to the sublime closer Some Day. DownTown Mystic writer/producer Robert Allen comments, "Given all the turmoil and anxiety in the world, I wanted the album to have an overall positive vibe and these songs deliver that." The album also showcases the evolving RnR sound and style that's unique to DownTown Mystic, featuring some of the artist's best work to date. A big part of that is due to the ace rhythm section of drummer Steve Holley (Paul McCartney, Ian Hunter) and bassist Paul Page (Ian Hunter, Dion).   In fact, it was Steve Holley who had a hand in changing the direction of The Wish during the recording. Robert recalls, "I'd been playing around with the song for years and finally decided to record it. We were working on the basic track, which was more up-tempo, and Steve said he heard the song as a cross between Neil Young and Pearl Jam. Intrigued, I said I would love to hear that and we proceeded to work on Steve's idea, which slowed the tempo down and gave it a much stronger groove." The result is a gem that also features the excellent guitar work of guest artist Stephen DeAcutis aka Stevie D, who also mixed the track and most of the album. Mastering guru Leon Zervos (Crowded House, Pink), helped give the album his sonic boost.  Having established a wide-reaching global fan base, thanks to significant international radio airplay in over 50 countries, DownTown Mystic continues to build on the momentum created from the 3 singles, 2 EPs and 2 albums released in 2024. In the world of Influencers, Music Supervisors have made DownTown Mystic a top sync-licensed artist with music in over 250 TV shows and films. The artist has sync-licensed songs in the upcoming films, Sovereign with Dennis Quaid & Nick Offerman and Everything's Going to Be Great starring Bryan Cranston & Allison Janney. Stay tuned!  "Robert Allen (and hence DownTown Mystic) is one of the finest independent rock'n'roll singer-songwriters we've ever been privileged to hear." Jamsphere Magazine  "Given his exemplary backing band, the music bristles with an energy and electricity that rarely subsides." American Songwriter  "The music has a classic stomp of a groove in every case, balancing delicacy and energy quite faultlessly, and the subject matter is both original and relatable as it pours through the airwaves with soulful distinction."
