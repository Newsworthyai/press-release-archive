FORT WORTH, TX, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to announce the arrival of a truly unique and historic racing machine—the 1930 Austin 7 Wood Boat Tail Race Car—now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. This one-of-a-kind vehicle carries a rich motorsport legacy, having competed at Bridgehampton Raceway in Sag Harbor, New York, before spending decades as a dedicated training race car.  With its custom wood and aluminum boattail speedster bodywork, this vintage racer exudes timeless elegance and racing spirit. Powering the Austin 7 is a 750cc inline-four engine, rated at approximately 15 horsepower when new, paired with a three-speed manual transmission.  Designed for lightweight agility, the car rides on a 75-inch wheelbase with a transverse leaf spring up front and quarter-elliptic longitudinal units at the rear, ensuring remarkable handling for its time. Stopping power is provided by mechanical drum brakes at all four corners, while yellow-painted disc wheels add to its striking appearance. Additional period-correct details include an eight-volt electrical system, a plexiglass windscreen, and a black-upholstered bench seat. The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a dash panel featuring a passenger-side grab handle, switchgear, and a combination gauge for battery charge and coolant temperature.  With over 200 cars on display, the museum provides an unforgettable experience for automotive enthusiasts, history buffs, and families alike.
