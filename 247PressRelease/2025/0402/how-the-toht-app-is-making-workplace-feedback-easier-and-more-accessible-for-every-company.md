# How the TOHT app is making workplace feedback easier and more accessible for every company

SAO PAULO, BRAZIL, April 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a time when businesses of all sizes are rethinking how to keep employees engaged and motivated, a new tool is quietly gaining attention. TOHT, a free app focused on feedback, development, and engagement, is offering a refreshing, straightforward way to build stronger teams — and it's completely cost-free.  The platform brings together everything from 360-degree feedback to mood tracking and learning groups, all in one easy-to-use app. While most HR tools with similar features are costly and built for large corporations, TOHT aims to level the playing field — making these resources available to startups, SMEs, and fast-growing teams without the need for a large budget or a dedicated HR department.  Why companies are turning to feedback-first tools Employee engagement, retention, and wellbeing have become top priorities for many businesses, especially in the face of rising burnout and staff turnover. However, traditional feedback systems often fall short — they're slow, formal, and disconnected from everyday work life.  TOHT offers a more modern and approachable alternative. It helps organisations check in more regularly with their people, spot potential issues early, and create a culture where feedback isn't something to dread — it's part of the everyday.  And perhaps most importantly, it's completely free to use.  What the TOHT app actually does TOHT is designed to make ongoing feedback feel natural and useful, not just another task on someone's to-do list. Everything is available through a mobile-first experience, so employees and managers can engage with it on the go — whether they're in the office, working remotely, or somewhere in between.  Here's a quick overview of its key features: 360-degree feedback: Employees receive structured, anonymous feedback from peers, managers, and team members twice a year. Real-time Continuous feedback: Quick reviews after meetings or projects help identify what went well and what could improve — while it's still fresh. Exit interviews: Departing staff can share honest thoughts about their experience, giving leaders clearer insights into why people leave. Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS): A quick way to measure team sentiment and engagement over time. Mood tracking: Daily, anonymous check-ins to monitor employee wellbeing and spot early signs of stress or burnout. Self-assessments: Employees can explore their personality traits, emotional intelligence, and burnout levels to better understand themselves. Anonymous company reviews: Staff can leave feedback without putting their names to it, while businesses can publicly respond — adding transparency to internal dialogue.  Together, these features allow companies to build a more transparent and connected workplace culture — one where people feel heard and supported, and where feedback actually leads to growth.  Introducing Tribes: learning through shared goals One of TOHT's more unique offerings is something called Tribes — internal communities focused on specific topics like leadership, productivity, or innovation. Within these groups, employees can learn, share experiences, and grow together.  This approach encourages peer learning and professional development in a way that feels natural — and far more engaging than traditional training modules or top-down instruction.  For example, a team might start a Tribe to improve communication across departments. Another might focus on developing future leaders. These small, focused groups can drive big cultural shifts over time.  Designed for small teams, useful for all While TOHT's tools could easily be seen in large corporations, the platform is clearly built with small and mid-sized companies in mind. Businesses that often don't have the budget for expensive HR software can now access the same level of insight and support — without any financial barrier.  And it's not just cost-effective. The interface is intentionally simple, making it easy for busy teams to adopt and stick with. There's no complicated setup process or need for training — just download the app and start using it.  Available now — and free forever TOHT is available to download from both Google Play and the Apple App Store, with no paid tier or hidden fees. Whether you're leading a team of five or managing a growing organization, the app gives you access to professional-grade feedback and development tools — without the usual costs.

For companies looking to build a more open, thoughtful, and connected workplace, TOHT may be one of the simplest — and most affordable — ways to start.

Founded in 2024, TOHT empowers organizations with continuous and anonymous feedback solutions, including 360-degree reviews, self-assessments, and real-time evaluations.
