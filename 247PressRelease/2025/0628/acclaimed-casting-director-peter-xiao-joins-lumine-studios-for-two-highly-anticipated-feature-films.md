NEW YORK, NY, June 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lumine Studios proudly announces the addition of renowned casting director Peter Xiao to the creative teams of two of its most exciting upcoming feature films: HOPE YOU'VE BEEN WELL and SNAFU.  HOPE YOU'VE BEEN WELL  HOPE YOU'VE BEEN WELL is a sharp, dark comedy exploring capitalism, codependency, and the emotional acrobatics of the modern job market. The film follows a young, unemployed woman who, in a desperate bid for employment, begins emotionally mirroring a tech CEO—blurring the lines between manipulation and genuine connection.  Director Bryan Yanbing Lee is a rising star in the independent film world, celebrated for his genre-bending, award-winning shorts, including "The American," which premiered at the Oscar-qualifying Cinequest Film Festival. Lee's work has been featured in Forbes and has garnered viral acclaim online, making him a distinctive voice in Asian-American cinema.  As casting director, Peter Xiao has been instrumental from the earliest stages, helping define the film's unique tone by assembling a cast capable of balancing satire with sincerity. "The humor in 'Hope You've Been Well' lives in the tension between awkwardness and truth," Xiao notes. "My mission has been to find performers who can ground the absurdity in real emotion, ensuring every beat of ambition, heartbreak, and manipulation resonates authentically."  SNAFU  SNAFU is a high-octane action-drama that follows Ben Ding, a stubborn long-haul trucker whose life spirals into chaos after he inadvertently saves the former Teamster President from a mafia hit. The film, adapted from Xing's acclaimed short of the same name, promises a gripping blend of survival, trust, and family loyalty.  Director Jackie Shijie Xing is an NYU Film & TV graduate whose narrative shorts and music videos have screened at top-tier festivals worldwide, including HollyShorts, Oberhausen, and Rhode Island. Xing's work is celebrated for its emotional range and cinematic intensity.  For SNAFU, Peter Xiao's casting approach is rooted in authenticity and emotional grit. "This isn't just a crime thriller—it's a character-driven journey," Xiao explains. "Finding the right Ben means searching for someone who can embody both stubborn resilience and deep vulnerability. Every role in 'SNAFU' demands truth and urgency, and I'm excited to help bring this world to life."
