# Art in the Landscape: When Sculpture and Space Come Together

SAN JOSE, CA, June 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- At Opulands Landscape Design & Construction, they believe that landscapes are more than outdoor spaces—they are open-air galleries, where sculpture and setting come together to tell a compelling story. With a deep appreciation for how form and environment interact, their team has helped Bay Area homeowners transform ordinary yards into immersive works of art.  Whether incorporating a graceful bronze sculpture into a perennial garden or installing a commanding piece that requires engineered footings and crane coordination, Opulands approaches each project with technical precision and creative vision. Their placement of artwork considers every detail—sightlines, light play, plant contrast, and hardscape integration. Even small-scale features like urns or fountains are curated with care, framed by thoughtful planting and surrounded by balance and flow.  Large-scale installations demand more than design—they require logistics. Opulands brings experience navigating complex site conditions, structural engineering, scheduling, and coordination with artists, designers, and fabricators. From feasibility studies to final placement, they handle every step with professionalism and artistry.  Founder Steven van Dongen's passion for art—shaped by years spent studying European gardens and American sculpture parks—continues to influence Opulands' unique design ethos. Today, that legacy lives on in their work, where every installation becomes a dialogue between sculpture, soul, and space.
