# The 2025 Housing Market Slowdown

ARLINGTON, VA, June 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- While the U.S. housing market appears active on the surface, many sellers are facing growing frustration as rising inventory levels and reduced buyer demand stall home sales. According to Redfin, 2,058,065 homes were listed for sale nationwide in May 2025 - a 14.1% increase from earlier this year and a 17.8% jump compared to May 2024-marking the highest inventory levels since the Great Recession.  Despite the influx of listings, homes are not selling quickly, and many are falling short of price expectations. With mortgage rates still elevated and affordability stretched, buyer activity has cooled significantly. A Redfin survey highlighted by Inman revealed that 71% of real estate agents did not close a single deal in 2024. As of 2025, over half of homes (53.5%) are selling below asking price, further pressuring sellers to accept lower offers or endure extended time on the market.  "Today's sellers are dealing with more competition, slower offers, and greater uncertainty," said Elana Newman, co-founder of 3 Step Home Sale. "Traditional methods require agent fees, repairs, open houses, and weeks or months of waiting-it's just not working for a lot of people right now."  Founded in 2009, 3 Step Home Sale has grown from a small family-run venture into one of the most trusted home-buying companies on the East Coast. Serving homeowners in Virginia, Maryland, the D.C. Metro area, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina, the company specializes in as-is cash offers, allowing sellers to skip costly repairs, agent commissions, and the stress of traditional listings.  The company's proprietary 3-step process delivers a cash offer in as little as 30 minutes and enables closings in as few as 7 days.  "Whether it's a vacant property, an inherited home, or a looming foreclosure, our goal is to provide certainty and flexibility when people need it most," Newman added.  To further ease the burden on homeowners, 3 Step Home Sale introduced its 7-Day Flex Stayâ„¢- a unique program that allows sellers to remain in their home for up to one week after closing. This gives families valuable time to pack, move out, and settle final matters without feeling rushed.  "In traditional sales, many people don't have access to their sale proceeds until the transaction closes. That delay can make it difficult to coordinate moving into a new home," said Newman. "Our Flex Stay program was created to solve that real-world problem."  Founded in 2009, 3 Step Home Sale helps homeowners sell their properties fast, as-is, and without hassle. With a presence in six states and a reputation for transparency and trust, the company has helped thousands of homeowners move forward on their terms. Services include no commissions, no repairs, and a closing timeline as quick as 7 days. For more information, visit https://www.3stephomesale.com.
