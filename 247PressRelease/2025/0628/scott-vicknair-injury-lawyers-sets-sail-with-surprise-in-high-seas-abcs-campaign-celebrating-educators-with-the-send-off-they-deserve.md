# Scott Vicknair Injury Lawyers Sets Sail with Surprise in "High Seas &amp; ABCs" Campaign Celebrating Educators with the Send-Off They Deserve

NEW ORLEANS, LA, June 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Scott Vicknair Personal Injury Lawyers has officially wrapped its 2025 "High Seas & ABCs" charity giveaway with an unforgettable moment where we presented Cindy LeBeouf of St. Charles Elementary with tickets for a fully paid-for cruise to the destination of her choice!  After more than 30 years of tireless dedication in the classroom, LeBeouf is retiring from teaching. We were delighted to help her school celebrate her service and achievements by awarding her this complimentary cruise. Known for her compassion, leadership, and lifelong impact on students and colleagues alike, she embodies everything we set out to honor when we create this charity giveaway.  "We were honored to surprise Ms. LeBeouf with the big news," said David Vicknair, lead attorney at Scott Vicknair Injury Lawyers. "She's a shining example of the kind of educator who changes lives, not just in the classroom, but in the community. It's our privilege to give her a thank-you that's as big as her heart."  The "High Seas & ABCs" charity giveaway was launched to recognize outstanding educators across Southeastern Louisiana by gifting one incredible educator with a well-earned, all-expenses-paid vacation. With dozens of heartfelt nominations and stories that moved the entire team, having just one winner isn't easy.  Now that the giveaway is done, Scott Vicknair Injury Lawyers will continue to building meaningful programs that spotlight local heroes and leave lasting impacts on the local community.
