# CD BioSciences Unveils Customization of Aging Mouse Model for Drug Discovery

NEW YORK, NY, May 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Recently, CD BioSciences launched its fully customizable aging mouse models for drug development. By leveraging its expertise in precision biology and translational research, CD BioSciences further positions it as a leader in tailored preclinical solutions for pharmaceutical and biotech partners in the aging research space.  Mouse models are important experimental tools in aging research due to their genetic similarity to humans, relatively short lifespan, and ability to manipulate their genes for experimental investigation of age-related processes. Universal mouse models of aging research involve D-galactose-induced senescence models, total body irradiation (TBI) models, ozone-induced senescence models, and genetically engineered models, each with their unique characteristics and research application potential. Through the integration of these models in aging research, researchers will be able to investigate the processes of aging and age-related diseases, identify biomarkers for age-related disease onset, as well as assess the efficacy and safety of potential anti-aging drugs and therapies.  CD BioSciences leverages its deep background in aging disease modeling to offer turnkey solutions for overseas clients. Its skilled experts enable researchers to delve into the complexities of aging, revealing age-related disease mechanisms and developing potential anti-aging therapies. With a wide range of mouse strains from C57BL/6, BALB/c, to gene-modified models, CD BioSciences can provide proper options based on specific research needs.  Why CD BioSciences Stands Out? • Precision-Driven Customization: CD BioSciences offers aging mouse models with gene-editing flexibility, enabling clients to simulate specific aging pathways, metabolic disorders, or neurodegenerative conditions. Their platform integrates CRISPR-Cas9 technology and advanced phenotyping to mirror human aging pathologies with reliable accuracy. • Accelerated Drug Development Timelines: By providing models that replicate age-related comorbidities (e.g., sarcopenia, osteoarthritis, or chronic kidney disease), CD BioSciences aims to help researchers bypass years of trial-and-error experiments. This aligns with industry demands for faster validation of therapeutic targets, such as those in oncology, immunology, and metabolic diseases. • End-to-End Support: From model design to data interpretation, CD BioSciences provides comprehensive services, including biomarker analysis and AI-driven metabolic profiling. Clients benefit from seamless collaboration, expediting research on longevity and age-specific diseases.  For pharmaceutical companies aiming to de-risk aging-related drug discovery, CD BioSciences offers a strategic edge. Their aging models are scalable, compliant with global regulatory standards, and supported by 24/7 technical assistance.
