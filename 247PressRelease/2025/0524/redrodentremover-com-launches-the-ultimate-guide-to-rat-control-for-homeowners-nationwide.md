# RedRodentRemover.com Launches the Ultimate Guide to Rat Control for Homeowners Nationwide

PORTLAND, OR, May 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As rat infestations surge in U.S. cities and suburbs, homeowners are searching for reliable, actionable information to protect their homes. Enter RedRodentRemover.com, a new affiliate-powered resource site that today unveiled its flagship article: "The Ultimate Guide to Rat Control." Designed for homeowners facing rodent problems, the guide is equal parts educational and empowering—covering everything from identifying rat species and spotting infestations, to DIY solutions, sanitation strategies, and when to call the pros.  "Most people wait until they see a rat scurry across the kitchen floor," said Thomas Fitzpatrick, the guide's author and founder of RedRodentRemover.com. "But by then, the infestation is often well-established. Our goal is to help people act fast, act smart, and ideally, never deal with rats again."  The guide breaks down key differences between Norway rats, roof rats, and pack rats, then walks users through step-by-step elimination techniques using traps, baits, and preventative sealing tactics. It also includes a printable checklist, product recommendations, and a direct phone number—+1 (212) 377-6740—to connect homeowners with local exterminators instantly.  Unlike many pest control blogs, the site's goal isn't just content—it's Customers. Visitors who prefer not to DIY can call directly for same-day rodent control through the platform's nationwide call network.
