# Supporting Community Development: CAHEC New Markets' Investment Breaks Ground

RALEIGH, NC, May 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CAHEC New Markets is proud to announce the groundbreaking of a New Markets Tax Credit investment. Raleigh Rescue Mission's The Garden, a new campus in Knightdale serving situationally homeless women and children in the Triangle region, broke ground on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. This visionary project marks a major step in addressing the root causes of situational homelessness while providing comprehensive, wraparound support for families striving for stability and independence.   While Raleigh Rescue Mission's current building only has room to support 60 women and 40 men per night, The Garden will feature 60 rooms for families and 41 rooms for individuals, accommodating up to 300 – 350 women and children annually, all who are experiencing situational homelessness. Upon completion of The Garden next year, the original downtown location will transition into exclusively serving situationally homeless men at a higher capacity. At its core is a commitment to holistic recovery: housing, education, wellness, and dignity. Beyond temporary housing, Raleigh Rescue Mission provides its residents with job training, mental and physical health services, and financial literacy classes as part of its New Life Plan. When an individual completes the New Life Plan, they will leave with Raleigh Rescue Mission with a living wage job, reliable car, and stable housing.   Key Features of The Garden Include: •	101 Rooms: 60 for families and 41 for individuals •	Nightly Impact: 300-350 women and children per night •	Children's Learning Center: Capacity for 150 children •	Meal Services: 182,500 meals served annually  "This is more than a shelter. The Garden will be a living, breathing community built to empower women and children who are ready to begin a new chapter," said Brian Oxford, Director, Community Capital of CAHEC. "CAHEC New Markets uses its New Markets Tax Credit allocations to invest in transformative developments and organizations that help communities stabilize, advance, and thrive and The Garden will do that for years to come. We're planting hope here and look forward to watching it grow."  Future phases of the development will introduce transitional housing apartments and a gymnasium to enhance the continuum of care further. In parallel, adjacent parcels are in development for market-rate single-family homes developed by Lennar, as well as a future commercial hub, underscoring the project's potential to create an integrated, mixed-income neighborhood rooted in inclusion and opportunity.
