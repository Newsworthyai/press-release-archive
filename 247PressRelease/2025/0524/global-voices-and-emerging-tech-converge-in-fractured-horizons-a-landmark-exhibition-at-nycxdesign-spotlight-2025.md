# Global Voices and Emerging Tech Converge in "Fractured Horizons," a Landmark Exhibition at NYCxDesign Spotlight 2025

NEW YORK, NY, May 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fractured Horizons: The Future of Heritage & Innovation, a landmark international exhibition exploring the convergence of cultural heritage and emerging technologies, concluded its celebrated run as an official International Spotlight Program of the NYCxDesign Festival 2025. Organized by VSDesign, partnered by WorldArtExchange and hosted by PI Art Center across its New York and New Jersey campuses, the weeklong summit brought together over 50k online and onsite visitors from around the world.  Designed to foster cross-cultural dialogue, the summit connected designers, artists, and tech pioneers from Asia, North America, and beyond. From AI-generated art and interactive installations to sustainable design and immersive scenography, Fractured Horizons embodied a bold reimagining of artistic traditions in the digital age, reflecting the global expansion of Chinese creativity and cultural identity through design.  The opening ceremony on May 15 drew diplomats, scholars, artists, and cultural leaders. The distinguished guests included Consuls from the Cultural Affairs Office of the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in New York, and John Hwang, President of PI Art Center. Notable speakers included Dominic Terlizzi, Chenlin Cai, Bethany Altschwager, and Leonard Yang, with welcome messages delivered virtually by Eric Moed, Guangming Zheng, Renjie Lu, and Qin Zhao.  "When the echoes of industrial glory meet the silence of urban decline, we ask not how the past ends, but how the future begins," said the curatorial team. "This is not a spectacle of answers, but an orchestration of questions."  The exhibition underwent a rigorous six-month preparation phase following a global open call that garnered 500+ submissions from 21 countries. Juried by a panel of acclaimed artists and designers—Dominic Terlizzi, Qin Zhao, Jiayuan Wang, and Yiwei Lin— selected over 100 works by 72 artists. These pieces span three categories—Renowned Artists, Professional Artists, and New Talent—and represent voices from 9 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.
