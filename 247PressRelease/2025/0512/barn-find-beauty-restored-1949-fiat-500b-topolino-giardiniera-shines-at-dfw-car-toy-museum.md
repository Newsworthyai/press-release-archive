# Barn-Find Beauty Restored: 1949 Fiat 500B Topolino Giardiniera Shines at DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum invites guests to experience the charm and craftsmanship of post-war Italian motoring with the fully restored 1949 Fiat 500B Topolino Giardiniera, proudly displayed as part of the renowned Ron Sturgeon Collection. This rare and delightful example of automotive history was pulled from a barn in 1996 and brought back to life through a meticulous body-off restoration.  The extensive refurbishment included a full repaint in a rich red finish, the installation of elegant replacement wood panels, and a completely refreshed interior wrapped in warm tan upholstery. The transformation also included a comprehensive engine overhaul, ensuring this iconic Italian wagon runs as good as it looks.  Inside the cabin, comfort meets classic design with front bucket seats, a flat-folding rear bench, and a suite of vintage details including a heater, sliding side windows, and woven kick panels. Black rubber floor linings lend a utilitarian charm, while a two-spoke steering wheel frames the central instrument panel featuring a 110-km/h speedometer and a combination gauge for oil pressure and fuel level. When more cargo space is needed, the rear bench conveniently folds down to create a flat load floor.  Powering the Giardiniera is a 569cc overhead-valve inline-four engine, mounted ahead of the front axle and equipped with a single Weber carburetor. Factory-rated at 16.5 horsepower, the engine sends power to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Suspension duties are handled by an independent front setup with telescopic shocks and semi-elliptical rear leaf springs, while stopping power comes courtesy of four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes.  This 1949 Fiat 500B Topolino Giardiniera isn't just a carâ€”it's a testament to European ingenuity and the enduring appeal of thoughtful restoration. Don't miss your chance to view this charming wagon, along with over 200 cars and 3,000 collectibles on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum.
