# "Fill Your Cup" Healing Retreat at RIT for HSPs, Empaths, Caretakers, Practitioners, Service Industry

ROCHESTER, NY, May 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Those known as "givers" will often fall under the category of "highly sensitive persons" or HSPs.   Empaths and HSPs feel the emotional state of others and will often gravitate to a service-based career such as health care, teaching, nursing, law enforcement, or working with disabled or special needs populations. Tending to the needs of others personally or professionally is demanding and often draining.   Spiritual leader Suzy Woo, professional energy healer, medical intuitive, astrologer and medium will be providing a full day of uplifting support and fun, providing education to empower the empath, tools to arm the sensitive person when facing adversity, and time-saving tips to help buy back time for self-care.  Woo will lead interactive exercises how to regulate the nervous system, how to self-soothe, breathwork, how to utilize the talents and gifts of the HSP, psychic protection, how to support one's self when under tight time constraints and stiff demands.  Attendees can create their own medicine bags including crystals and personalized mantras to bring home, valued over $50.   One of the event highlights is a sound healing journey, where Woo plays her three large gongs and other sound healing tools, while channeling potent energy healing messages, attendees will feel deep release from inner child woundedness, and potentially even past life traumas. "It will be moving, with tears of release followed by tears of joy. It's very powerful."  Woo explains, "It will be a day of self-understanding for better self-actualization, because those who care for us don't understand our needs as a sensitive. We are so misunderstood that it often causes us to withdraw, leading to isolation. This is to bring these people together and share in our challenges so that we can feel seen, heard, validated and then uplifted to face the world again, renewed and recharged. We need that connection."  "This is exactly the nature of the HSP, the empath, the eternal giver," says Suzy Woo. "We are the black sheep of the family, who cry easily, who were outcasted or otherwise on the Island of Misfits. This event is to say I see you, I understand you. Allow me to fill your cup."  To encourage those too bashful to sign up, because givers normally feel guilty about taking time or spending money on theirself, those who register this week ending May 17 can bring a second person for free. This ticket can be gifted to a stranger as a pay it forward option. No promotional code is needed.   The event will be cordial and casual, no prior knowledge or experience required. A VIP Option is available at $455 or a GA ticket is $399. All materials, journals, food, souvenirs, make-and-take medicine bag, gifts and take-home "goody bags" included. "This event will inspire you, boost your confidence, and recharge your batteries."
