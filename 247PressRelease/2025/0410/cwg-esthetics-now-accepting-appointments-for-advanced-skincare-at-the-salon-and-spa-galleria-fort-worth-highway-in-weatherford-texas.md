# CWG Esthetics Now Accepting Appointments for Advanced Skincare at the Salon and Spa Galleria Fort Worth Highway in Weatherford, Texas

WEATHERFORD, TX, April 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Licensed Esthetician Christian Garcia is quite familiar with skin issues, especially acne. After encountering skin breakouts as a teen, Garcia took steps to learn proper skin care.  "My journey began at a young age when I struggled with persistent acne," Garcia said. "After trying isotretinoin and multiple dermatologist-prescribed medications, I became frustrated. I realized how difficult it is to navigate skincare without the right guidance," he added.  That's why Garcia decided at the age of 17 to attend esthetician school and turn that into his career: helping others with similar skin issues. Garcia recently opened CWG Esthetics in the Salon and Spa Galleria Weatherford, and is ready to share what he's learned on his own path to clearer skin.  "My goal is to help others achieve healthy skin and, most importantly, confidence," Garcia said. "I am deeply passionate about this industry and take a results-driven approach to skincare, ensuring that each treatment is tailored to my clients' unique concerns."  Located in the Salon and Spa Galleria in Weatherford, CWG Esthetics features several types of facials, which are designed to address each client's specific concerns. This ensures optimal results and a radiant complexion, according to Garcia.  "Customer satisfaction is my top priority," Garcia said. "I focus on delivering visible improvements through customized treatments and effective routines. My goal is to help each client achieve long-term skin health, not just quick fixes," he added.  Garcia offers a broad selection of treatments, including dew drop, dermaplane, clear canvas, and custom. The dew drop is perfect for dry skin, and includes moisturizing serums and a hydrating mask to restore balance, leaving skin feeling soft and nourished. The clear canvas facial is a deep-cleaning treatment that targets acne-prone skin, reducing inflammation and preventing future breakouts.  In addition to facials, Garcia performs bacial treatments for the back. Targeting breakouts, dryness and congestion, this treatment includes deep cleansing, exfoliation, extractions and hydration.
