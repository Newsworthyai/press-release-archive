# Run Seal Beach 2025: Over $2 Million in Cumulative Grants Awarded Since Inception

SEAL BEACH, CA, April 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 2025 Run Seal Beach brought together runners, volunteers, and community members for another inspiring day of fitness and philanthropy. Known as "the little run with a big heart," this beloved tradition continues to grow in impact, with over $2,039,410 in cumulative grants awarded to date in support of local wellness, fitness, and recreation programs.   Now more than five decades strong, Run Seal Beach is a fully volunteer-run nonprofit organization. Since formally becoming a 501(c)(3) in 1999, every dollar raised has been reinvested back into the communities of Seal Beach, Rossmoor, and Los Alamitos, funding programs that enrich the lives of local residents across all ages.   This year's event was made possible through the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and the support of dedicated sponsors, including Faustino "Tino" Bernadett, recognized as a Platinum Sponsor for the 2025 race. A longtime supporter of Run Seal Beach, Dr. Bernadett has been proud to contribute to the event over the years both personally and through the Bernadett Family's continued involvement.   At the 2025 event, Dr. Bernadett once again went beyond sponsorship by attending in person and distributing books to young participants, underscoring his ongoing commitment to youth literacy and education. The Bernadett Family's involvement reflects a broader mission to support access to learning and health initiatives that make a tangible difference in the lives of children and families.   As Run Seal Beach continues to grow, the dedication of community members, the City of Seal Beach, and supporters like Faustino Bernadett helps ensure that the event remains a powerful force for good year after year.
