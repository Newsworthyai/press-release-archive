# Fractured Nation Syndrome Is Shredding America's Psyche

SAN DIEGO, CA, April 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Our country's Collective American Psyche (CAP) is fracturing daily. Dr. David Gruder, 50-year veteran psychologist and "America's Integrity Expert," names this crisis Fractured Nation Syndrome (FNS)—an ongoing trauma shredding trust and unity with 12 brutal symptoms, from "Tribal Tongue Lashing" to "Trust Torpedo."  The stats scream collapse: 6 in 10 feel betrayed by government and business, 7 in 10 say leaders lie (Edelman Trust Barometer 2025). Work disengagement festers at 70% (Gallup 2024), chronic stress grips 75%, with 77% fearing for America's future (Stress in America 2024). "FNS is gridlock on steroids, cultural wars gone nuclear," Gruder warns. "Our collective psyche is bleeding—but it's mendable."  His fix? Constitutional 'Psychotherapy'—bold CPR for our nation's soul, resetting us stronger through four pillars: - FREEsponsibility—Liberty With Backbone: Integrity that holds. - Grounded Inside, Influential Outside—Strength Synergized: Resilience meets impact. - Soar With Vision, Spark Synergy—Leading That Lifts: Leadership that heals. - Verify Then Trust—Accountability Restored: Trust earned.  "FNS wounds us daily—vilifying, gaslighting, doomscrolling—but the fix is in," says Gruder, a Societal Psychotherapist with 12 diverse awards spanning leadership, social change, business, health & wellness, mental health, and more. "Constitutional 'Psychotherapy' has a triple focus that fuses personal sovereignty with national character." His 12 symptoms—like "Gaslighting Blowup" (reality twisted 'til sanity cracks) and "Doomscroll Dementia" (fear porn fraying minds)—are buzzing, with one outlet already reprinting his "Fractured Nation Syndrome" Substack article.
