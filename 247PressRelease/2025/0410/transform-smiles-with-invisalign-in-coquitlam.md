# Transform Smiles with Invisalign in Coquitlam

VANCOUVER, BC, April 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Faster treatment times and no mouthful of metal, Coquitlam orthodontists Dr. Cheng Lun Wang, Dr. Kevin Lee, and Dr. Yan Liu offer Invisalign, a clear aligner system backed by 20 years of clinical research and more than 5 million cases. For more, go to https://www.innovaortho.com/invisalign/  Invisalign offers distinct advantages compared to other teeth-straightening options. It works for both simple and complex cases, with proprietary SmartForce features and SmartTrack that make it possible for a doctor to move teeth more precisely. As a removeable option, no foods are off-limit—and Invisalign are covered by many orthodontic insurance plans.  Reasons to choose Invisalign:  •	Potentially faster treatment times (with weekly aligner changes to achieve the beautiful smile you want even faster) •	Proven Results – SmartTrack® material and SmartForce® features are clinically proven to achieve 75% more predictable tooth movement. •	Better fit, better comfort •	Aligners made from SmartTrack material are more comfortable, better fitting, and easier to put on and take off.  Invisalign works to address the same problems treatable by conventional braces: overcrowding, gaps, underbite, overbite, and crossbite. As a series of custom-made aligning trays, orthodontists change trays over several weeks to gradually move and fix tooth configuration.  As a comfortable and nearly invisible system, the Invisalign treatment begins with capturing a three-dimensional digital image of the entire jaw. Multiangle views allow the orthodontist to assess how the teeth should move to achieve the desired aesthetic.  Connect with Innova Orthodontics   The path to a confident, more beautiful smile begins with a consultation.
