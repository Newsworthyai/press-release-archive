# Why Calgary Homeowners Trust Trademark Renovations: Over 35 Years of Proven Results, Awards, and Unmatched Transparency

CALGARY, AB, August 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When you're investing $100,000 or more into a home renovation, trust is everything. Whether it's a luxury kitchen remodel, a basement transformation, or a full-home renovation, Calgary homeowners consistently turn to one company: Trademark Renovations. For over three decades, this design-build firm has delivered award-winning results with integrity, predictability, and care — and the numbers back it up.  "CAN I TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH MY HOME?" This is the question every renovating homeowner should ask.  In Calgary's competitive renovation market, flashy websites and bold claims are common. But few companies can support those claims with a long-standing local presence, national recognition, and a track record of satisfied clients.  WHAT SETS TRADEMARK RENOVATIONS APART 1. OVER THREE DECADES OF CONSISTENCY Founded in 1990, Trademark Renovations has remained an independent, Calgary-based company under the same leadership. That stability gives clients confidence: they know who they're working with — and who will still be there after the work is done.  2. A+ RATING WITH BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU Accredited since 2002, the firm has upheld an A+ BBB rating, a reflection of its strong ethical practices and client accountability.  3. FIXED PRICING, NO SURPRISES Every project begins with a clear, fixed-price contract. No vague "estimates," no hidden fees — just total clarity from day one.  4. FIVE-YEAR WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY Trademark offers a five-year workmanship warranty, far exceeding industry norms and giving homeowners peace of mind well beyond completion.

"Calgary homeowners deserve nothing less than exceptional craftsmanship and uncompromising transparency," says Blair Foisy. "Our five-year warranty and fixed-price approach are built to ensure every client feels confident — and supported — from start to finish."  TRUST BACKED BY RESULTS Over 70% of new projects come from direct client referrals — a powerful sign of long-term satisfaction and reputation.  "The process was clear from day one. No surprises. Our budget was respected, and our home turned out even better than expected." – Client review on Houzz  "We've recommended them to four other families — all had great experiences." – Google Review, 2024  Calgary has seen a rise in renovation demand in recent years — and, with it, a surge of underqualified contractors and unresolved disputes. According to local consumer data, renovation-related complaints rose 22% last year alone. In this landscape, working with a proven firm isn't just reassuring — it's essential.  In an industry where promises often fall short, Trademark Renovations delivers on every detail. With decades of experience, a clear and ethical process, and results backed by industry awards and client trust, the firm has become a benchmark for renovation excellence in Calgary.
