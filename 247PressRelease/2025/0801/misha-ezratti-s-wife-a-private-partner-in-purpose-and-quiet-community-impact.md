# Misha Ezratti's Wife: A Private Partner in Purpose and Quiet Community Impact

SUNRISE, FL, August 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- While Misha Ezratti is widely recognized as the president of GL Homes, one of Florida's leading real estate developers, his wife, Jessica Ezratti, plays a quieter but no less meaningful role in supporting the family's shared commitment to philanthropy and community impact. Jessica's influence is subtle yet powerful, reflecting the values that shape both the Ezratti family and GL Homes' giving initiatives.  Under Misha Ezratti's leadership, GL Homes has established itself as a company deeply dedicated to thoughtful philanthropy, not only real estate. The company focuses its efforts on three key areas: breaking the cycle of homelessness, combating hunger, and supporting children and youth throughout Florida. These initiatives are not just corporate programs. They are personal priorities shared by Misha Ezratti's wife, Jessica Ezratti, and reflect the core values behind GL Homes philanthropy.  One notable example is the "Make a House a Home" initiative, through which GL Homes donates surplus furnishings, cabinetry, and appliances to nonprofit organizations helping families in need. This effort transforms empty houses into welcoming homes, providing families with comfort and dignity. The program aligns closely with Jessica's values of compassion and community care.  GL Homes also partners with several organizations dedicated to hunger relief. Through collaborations with groups like The Lord's Place and Feeding South Florida, the company helps deliver thousands of nutritious meals to individuals and families facing food insecurity. The Meal Mobile, fully funded by GL Homes, brings hot meals and social services directly to those in need. This reflects a commitment that Misha Ezratti's wife, Jessica, fully supports.  Supporting youth is another cornerstone of GL Homes philanthropy. Longstanding partnerships with the Boys & Girls Clubs and Youth Haven provide safe spaces, mentorship, and educational opportunities for young people across the state. This focus on children and youth resonates with Jessica and her belief in investing in future generations.  Though Misha Ezratti's wife takes a quiet and understated approach to these philanthropic avenues, her support is vital to the ongoing success of GL Homes' commitment to giving back. Her influence reminds us that meaningful leadership often happens behind the scenes, grounded in empathy and quiet purpose.  Together, Misha Ezratti and his wife Jessica Ezratti ensure that GL Homes' growth as a real estate leader is matched by its positive contributions to communities across Florida.
