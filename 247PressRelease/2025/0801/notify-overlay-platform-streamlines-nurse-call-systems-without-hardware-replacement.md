# Notify Overlay Platform Streamlines Nurse Call Systems Without Hardware Replacement

MINNETONKA, MN, August 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Senior living operators managing multiple communities often struggle with incompatible nurse call systems from different manufacturers. This fragmentation creates operational inefficiencies, forces caregivers to juggle various devices, and complicates training, particularly after new community acquisitions.   Notify, a Minnesota-based software company, has developed Overlay, a software platform designed to address these challenges without requiring costly hardware replacements. Overlay integrates alerts from more than 25 existing nurse call system manufacturers, life safety systems, and sensor alerts into a unified smartphone-based application, allowing caregivers to manage alerts more efficiently while giving community leaders greater operational visibility.   Traditional system replacements can often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per community. In contrast, Overlay installs within hours and is offered at a flat monthly fee of $350 per building, including analytics and unlimited user access.   "Operators have long navigated a patchwork of nurse call systems with limited options for standardization," said Craig Patnode, CEO of Notify. "Overlay is the only solution that standardizes fragmented nurse call systems without the expense and disruption of replacing existing hardware. The platform delivers consistent alerts, clear communication, and actionable operational insights across all communities, enabling better care delivery while improving caregiver satisfaction."   Platform Deployed Across 700+ Communities   Overlay is already in use at more than 700 senior living communities nationwide, including those operated by Ebenezer, Great Lakes Management, Ecumen, Charter, and Cassia. Communities adopting Overlay have reported significant improvements, with some experiencing up to a 50% reduction in response times compared to pager-based systems.   "Being able to get away from pagers was a huge step for us," said Gabrielle Ross, RN Executive Director of AL Clinical Services at Country Manor & Woodcrest Of Country Manor. "The staff bought right into it as it was easier and more user-friendly than the way we were doing business ."   Amanda Runnoe, Chief Nursing Officer at Heritage Senior Living, adds: "There were so many unexpected benefits from using the Notify platform. Every data point and report provides valuable learning about each person, staffing opportunities, and each building. The reports tell a story while providing big-picture insight into our organization."   Pilot Program Available   Notify is currently offering a pilot program that allows senior living operators to test the Overlay platform's integration capabilities and assess its impact before committing to a full rollout.
