# HTI Contractors Finds Power &amp; Efficiency in pVault®

BATON ROUGE, LA, August 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Founded in 1970, HTI Contractors is a trusted construction partner in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C., regions.  With over 20,000 projects under its belt and an annual revenue of $30M, HTI prides itself on combining old-school work ethic with cutting-edge solutions. So when it came to modernizing accounting operations, they turned to pVault® — and never looked back.  PROBLEM  HTI's document-heavy workflows were slowing them down. Invoices came by mail or email, were printed, coded, and then manually entered — a time-intensive and costly process. With four accountants managing paperwork, the system wasn't scalable.  SOLUTION  Enter pVault®. Tasked with modernizing the department, HTI's executive took the lead on implementing the document management platform — her third successful pVault® rollout. Despite expected resistance to giving up paper, the onboarding was smooth, thanks to excellent training and planning.  WHY pVault®?  "pVault® has evolved a lot over the past 10 years by staying ahead of the competition and offering a better product." "Beware of those that sell themselves to be at the level that pVault® is at," she warns. "pVault® products and the Paperless team are unmatched." - Heather Rankin, HTI Executive  About Paperless Environments  Paperless Environments is a leader in document management and automation solutions for the construction industry.
