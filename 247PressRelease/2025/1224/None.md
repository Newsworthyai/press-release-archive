# Japan-America Society of Dallas/Fort Worth Celebrates Culture, Community, and Connection with a Dynamic Weekend of Events

DALLAS/FORT WORTH, TX, December 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Japan-America Society of Dallas/Fort Worth (JASDFW) wrapped up several extraordinary events in December marked by record-breaking engagement, cultural exchange, and community celebration across three signature events: Anime Frontier, the inaugural Pickleball Social & Bonenkai Year-End Celebration, and a special welcome and reunion tied to the BMW Dallas Marathon. Click for Photos  Anime Frontier: Anime Meets Culture Held December 12–14 at the Fort Worth Convention Center, Anime Frontier drew approximately 50,000 attendees over the weekend, creating a powerful platform for JASDFW to introduce Japanese culture beyond anime and manga.  Thanks to a complimentary booth, JASDFW volunteers engaged thousands of attendees with information about the organization, Japanese language classes, and upcoming cultural programs—including the popular Mochitsuki New Year celebration. A dot-survey invited visitors to share what most excites them about Japan; the overwhelming response highlighted culture, language, and food as top interests.  A standout feature of the booth was the display of a 200-year-old Ukiyo-e woodblock print book, offering a fascinating historical precursor to modern manga. Visitors also participated in a hands-on printmaking activity inspired by traditional woodblock techniques, connecting past and present through art and storytelling.  "Anime Frontier gave us an incredible opportunity to meet people where their passion already lives and invite them to explore deeper cultural experiences," said Grant Ogata, President JASDFW. "The enthusiasm and curiosity we saw throughout the weekend were truly inspiring."  Inaugural Pickleball Social & Bonenkai Year-End Celebration On December 12, JASDFW members and friends gathered at RYSE Energy StarCenter Multisport for the organization's first-ever Pickleball Social & Bonenkai (year-end celebration).  The evening blended fun, food, and friendship, featuring Japanese izakaya-style dishes from Yama Izakaya & Sushi, along with sake, beer, wine, and other beverages. Guests enjoyed friendly pickleball play—no experience required—while celebrating the close of 2025 and the strong relationships formed throughout the year.  The event reflected JASDFW's mission in action: bringing people together through shared experiences that foster cultural understanding and lasting connections.  International Friendship Through Sport: BMW Dallas Marathon Welcome & Reunion JASDFW also proudly supported international exchange through athletics by welcoming two elite runners from Sendai, Japan—Shiho Endo and Satoshi Tanaka—invited by the BMW Dallas Marathon with support from JASDFW and the City of Dallas, an International Friendship City of Sendai.  Joined by two Sendai city officials, the runners participated in JASDFW's Bonenkai and were honored at a post-race reunion luncheon following the marathon. The luncheon brought together local runners who have participated in the Sendai Half-Marathon over the years through programs sponsored by JASDFW, Japan Airlines, and community partners.  Despite freezing race-day temperatures, both athletes delivered outstanding performances. Shiho Endo placed 4th overall among all female marathon runners and 2nd in her age division, a remarkable achievement celebrated by the entire JASDFW community.  Looking Ahead From pop culture conventions to year-end celebrations and international athletic exchanges, the December weekend showcased the breadth of JASDFW's impact and the community's growing interest in Japanese culture, language, and friendship.  JASDFW extends heartfelt thanks to its volunteers, partners, and everyone who participated in these events and looks forward to welcoming new faces to upcomingmprograms in 2026. As the year comes to a close, the Japan-America Society of Dallas/Fort Worth wishes everyone a joyous holiday season filled with peace, connection, and celebration. We look forward to continuing to build cross-cultural understanding in the year ahead.
