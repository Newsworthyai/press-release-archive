# U.S. Global Mail Expands National Footprint with New Delaware Location

WILMINGTON, DE, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- U.S. Global Mail, a leader in secure virtual mail management and digital address infrastructure, is proud to announce the launch of a new fully-owned and operated facility in the state of Delaware. This expansion marks a major milestone in the company's growing national footprint to support enterprise and B2B clients with industry-grade infrastructure and compliance.  Unlike channel partner operated mail centers, the Delaware location will be wholly owned and operated by U.S. Global Mail, ensuring complete adherence to the company's strict internal standards. With this launch, U.S. Global Mail now directly operates multiple locations nationwide, offering a unique advantage to enterprise clients who demand robust security, reliability, and regulatory compliance.  "Delaware has long been the state of choice for businesses — from Fortune 500s to fast-growing startups," said Tashi Nibber, CEO of U.S. Global Mail. "Opening a fully compliant facility here provides secure, scalable infrastructure for enterprise clients, giving them an address in their incorporated state and total control over their physical mail — digitized, centralized, and always at their fingertips."  The new Delaware hub will serve as a high-throughput mail intake and scanning center enhancing data protection for sensitive communications. It is especially well-suited to industries such as legal, healthcare, financial services, and distributed enterprise teams, offering a seamless, compliant solution for managing business mail remotely.  Key Benefits of the New Delaware Location:  • Fully owned and operated by parent company  • Secure, compliant operations  • Built for high-security B2B and enterprise use cases  • Located in a business-friendly state with privacy-focused legal infrastructure  • Powered by USGM's secure, cloud-based virtual mailbox platform  This launch reflects U.S. Global Mail's evolution from a virtual mailbox provider to a national mail infrastructure partner — empowering modern, distributed businesses to manage sensitive mail with confidence and compliance at scale.  "This is not just a new address — it's a new standard," adds Nibber.  U.S. Global Mail is the industry leader in secure virtual mailboxes and digital address infrastructure, serving businesses, remote teams, and individuals across more than 200 countries. Since 1999, the company has helped clients eliminate outdated mailrooms by digitizing physical mail- offering instant access, scanning, forwarding, and check deposit services through a cloud-based platform.  With 30+ locations, including a growing number of fully owned, secure and compliant facilities, U.S. Global Mail provides enterprise-grade mail management trusted by Fortune 500s, law firms, healthcare organizations, and government contractors.  US Global Mail's vision : We envision a world where every interaction, transaction, and delivery once tied to physical addresses is instantly manageable, globally accessible, and fully virtual.
