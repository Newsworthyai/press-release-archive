# Attention Writers: If Your Character Has Gone Rogue—or Worse, Gone Flat—It's Time for a New Approach

NEW YORK, NY, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- If your protagonist's choices don't make emotional sense, no amount of editing will fix your story.  Coaching the Character™ helps fiction writers and memoirists uncover the deeper psychological layers driving—or derailing—their characters' arcs.  Developed by certified life and leadership coach Rebecca Babcock and her team at The Babcock Method™, this one-of-a-kind session uses proven human-centered coaching tools to explore fictional characters as if they were real clients. The goal isn't to fix your writing process—it's to get under the skin of your characters.  "It's not therapy for the writer," Babcock says. "It's coaching for the character."  Where It Started The method was born during a visit from bestselling author Courtney Maum (Before and After the Book Deal, The Year of the Horses), who was blocked on a character in her forthcoming novel. The two longtime friends sat down and tried something new: applying Rebecca's coaching framework to a fictional person.  "In the space of an hour, Rebecca helped me bash down walls and preconceptions I'd erected around my characters," Maum wrote in her Substack. "I've already started weaving the insights into my manuscript—it's moving in fresher, truer directions."  She now calls Babcock "the go-to coach for emotionally stuck writers."  What Coaching the Character™ Delivers These aren't critique sessions. This is character therapy.  Each session is designed to: – Uncover unconscious blocks or contradictions in a character – Reveal the emotional logic behind plot decisions – Deepen inner arcs and strengthen narrative momentum – Provide insight that accelerates revision and restores creative confidence  What Writers Are Saying Writers describe the experience as clarifying, energizing, and transformative: "I was seeing my novel—and my characters—completely differently." "It saved me so much time trying to figure out what was off." "All the pieces fell into place. Plus, it was fun." "Handled my characters with the dignity and care they deserve." "I can easily imagine doing this every time I'm starting a book."  Who It's For – Authors in revision whose characters feel inconsistent or flat – Memoirists exploring unresolved emotional arcs – Screenwriters struggling with motivation or stakes – MFA students over-intellectualizing character work – Agents and editors referring writers who need depth, not polish  About Rebecca Babcock & The Babcock Method™ Rebecca Babcock is a trauma-informed, ICF-certified life and leadership coach known for helping high-achievers move through perfectionism, fear, and internal resistance. Her holistic framework, The Babcock Method™, integrates psychological safety, emotional clarity, and bold reinvention.
