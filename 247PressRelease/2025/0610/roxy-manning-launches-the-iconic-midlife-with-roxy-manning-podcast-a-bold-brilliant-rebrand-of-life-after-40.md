# Roxy Manning Launches The Iconic Midlife with Roxy Manning Podcast: A Bold, Brilliant Rebrand of Life After 40

LOS ANGELES, CA, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Veteran red carpet reporter and media personality Roxy Manning is redefining what it means to be a woman in her 40s, 50s, and beyond with the launch of her highly anticipated new podcast, The Iconic Midlife with Roxy Manning. Officially debuting June 10, the podcast promises no clichés, no shame—just unfiltered, intelligent conversations about power, aging, reinvention, and visibility in a culture that often sidelines midlife women.  This isn't a quiet era. It's the main event—and The Iconic Midlife with Roxy Manning is claiming the mic.  Each week, Roxy brings her signature wit, warmth, and insider access to conversations with powerhouse guests—from global change-makers to under-the-radar disruptors you'll be glad you met here first. Launch week features real estate mogul and Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles star Tracy Tutor, women's health trailblazer Dr. Louise Newson, and dynamic entrepreneur Lora Peterson. The premiere also includes a solo episode in which Roxy shares the personal story behind launching the show and why she's calling bullsh*t on midlife invisibility.  "Midlife isn't a crisis—it's a catalyst," says Manning. "I created this show for women who aren't done dreaming, building, exploring, or shaking things up. Whether you're navigating menopause, chasing reinvention, or learning to love your laugh lines—or your filters—this space is for you."*  Listeners can expect weekly episodes covering everything from hormonal health and dating over 40, to style, purpose, friendship, finance, and ambition at every age. The show offers a mix of raw solo episodes, expert interviews, and powerful storytelling—always grounded in humor, honesty, and sisterhood.
