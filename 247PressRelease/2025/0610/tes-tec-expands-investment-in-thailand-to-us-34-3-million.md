# TES Tec Expands Investment in Thailand to US$34.3 Million

TAIPEI, TAIWAN, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- TES TEC, a leading innovator in intelligent touch display devices, today announced to further expand its manufacturing capabilities in Thailand with an additional investment of $17.8 Million. Building upon its existing $16.5 million investment in its Phase 1 manufacturing site in Chonburi, Thailand, this expansion will bring TES TEC's total investment in the country to US$34.3 million. Construction is slated for completion, with production expected to commence in March 2026. The expansion plans include the addition of one Monitor/AIO line, three panel PC lines, and two lamination lines, marking this project as TES TEC's largest single foreign direct investment this year.  TES TEC's established Phase 1 factory, a 1,200 m² facility in Chonburi, Thailand, has been in volume production since late 2024, currently operating with a capacity of up to 13,000 units per month per shift. Strategically situated within Thailand's thriving Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), Chonburi offers excellent connectivity, approximately 1.5 hours (113 km) by car from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport and just 1 hour (70 km) by road from the significant Laem Chabang sea port, facilitating efficient trade and transportation. The planning for the new Phase II manufacturing base will comprehensively consider various factors from the Phase I factory, such as its location advantages, production capacity planning, construction costs, and supporting facilities, to significantly enhance overall manufacturing capabilities.  The initial phase of assembly operations at the expanded factory will include one ≤24" monitor/AIO production line, one panel PC production line, and one SMT line, with a combined capacity of 30,000 units per month per shift. Looking ahead, TES TEC plans for further expansion to enhance its manufacturing capabilities in Thailand, reserving space for two additional production lines and two lamination areas, which could potentially increase the total assembly capacity to 60,000 units per month per shift.  "Through this expansion, TES TEC anticipates creating approximately 700 local job opportunities over the next two years and generating millions of dollars in value through our intelligent touch display devices and other cutting-edge applications." Said Kevin Lee, TES TEC CEO "With established manufacturing plants in China, Taiwan, and now Thailand, we are strategically positioned to ensure fast and flexible support for our customers worldwide. This initiative underscores TES TEC's ongoing commitment to sustained growth and our proactive approach to meeting increasing global demand within a dynamic international trade environment."  The new Thailand factory will integrate advanced technologies, including an intelligent factory monitoring system to optimize operational efficiency. Additionally, the facility will be equipped with solar panels designed to supply an estimated 3% to 4% of the factory's electricity needs, demonstrating TES TEC's dedication to sustainable practices. The testing area will feature an XY-axis robotic arm and camera-based automated product yield inspection to ensure the highest standards of quality control.
