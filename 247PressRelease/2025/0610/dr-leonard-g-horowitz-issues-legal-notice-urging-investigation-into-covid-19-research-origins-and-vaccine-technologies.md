# Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz Issues Legal Notice Urging Investigation into COVID-19 Research Origins and Vaccine Technologies

LAS VEGAS, NV, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, a Harvard-trained researcher in emerging diseases and Editor-in-Chief of Medical Veritas International Inc., has issued a formal legal "Notice and Demand" addressed to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The notice calls for further examination of the origins of COVID-19 and the technologies used in response efforts, including vaccine delivery systems.  According to Dr. Horowitz, the notice outlines concerns about the possible role of international gain-of-function research in the emergence of COVID-19, referencing collaborative efforts between U.S. and Chinese institutions. It highlights figures such as Dr. Ralph Baric (UNC), Dr. Charles Lieber (Harvard), Dr. Robert Langer (MIT), and former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci as individuals of interest for review. The document raises questions about whether certain research and public health responses warrant independent investigation.  Among the topics addressed in the notice are the use of novel nanotechnologies in vaccine delivery—including mRNA platforms and hydrogel components. Dr. Horowitz asserts that some of these systems may be linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurological, cardiovascular, and immunological complications, and recommends further scientific review of these claims.  The document also critiques the U.S. government's handling of related oversight, including a recent Executive Order on biological research safety. Dr. Horowitz contends that current federal guidelines may not go far enough in addressing risks from domestic programs.  "This notice is meant to encourage transparency, accountability, and a science-based review of evidence," said Dr. Horowitz. "We believe the public deserves a fair and open discussion about the origins of COVID-19, the technologies used to address it, and the regulatory processes involved."  Medical Veritas International Inc., a nonprofit organization, has made the notice, supporting exhibits, and a summary video available to the public at MedicalVeritas.org. Dr. Horowitz, author of the book Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola—Nature, Accident or Intentional?, invites scientists, policymakers, and independent media to evaluate the materials and contribute to a constructive, fact-based dialogue.
