Once completed, Intelligent Office Troy will boast 31 offices and four conferences rooms total, with an array of other amenities including two different areas for coworking and a breakroom.  Intelligent Office Troy has served the local business community for over 20 years, originally opening in 2003. Dr. Haakonstad acquired the business in 2015 and moved it to its current site in 2018. The location has sustained 100% occupancy, precipitating the need for expansion.  "As the demand for flexible, community-driven workspaces continues to grow, I'm proud to reveal our beautiful new space that enables us to offer so much more of what our members need and what we do best," Dr. Haakonstad said. "This expansion allows us to welcome even more entrepreneurs, remote workers, and small businesses into an environment designed to foster connection, collaboration, productivity, and growth."  In addition to its on-site solutions, Intelligent Office Troy has a robust phone answering and admin support side of the business. Seven full-time staff provide comprehensive and customizable virtual assistant services for Intelligent Office members, including scheduling, correspondence, data entry, and customer service. All are HIPAA-certified and trained to carefully handle confidential information.  "Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for businesses' big infrastructure needs, including business address, office space, meeting space, phone answering, and more," added Dr. Haakonstad. "Our virtual solutions make up a significant portion of our business and we're seeing increased demand from trade professionals like plumbers and roofers. It's a source of pride to hear someone say to me, 'I had no idea I was talking to one of your employees when I called so-and-so company' because we aim to be a seamless extension of our members' business."  Born in Philadelphia, Dr. Haakonstad grew up in Tucson and, after marrying, moved to Las Vegas. She worked as a psychiatrist in crisis intervention before becoming a licensed real estate broker and owning her own brokerage as well as a financial services company. While in Las Vegas, she was an Intelligent Office client and liked it so much that she decided to purchase one of its franchises. Dr. Haakonstad owns another Intelligent Office franchise in Bloomington, Minnesota, as well as two D-BAT Baseball and Softball training facilities in Michigan. She is also on the Board of Directors for the Troy Chamber of Commerce and recently won the Troy Chamber's Business Excellence Award for Leadership.
