# Pastor Stephen Brown teams up with Bart Orr II for new single

MEMPHIS, TN, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pastor Stephen Brown is set to release his highly anticipated new single, "By Friday," June 20,2025 — a powerful gospel anthem that blends soul-stirring lyrics with a timeless sound.  The song was birthed during one of Pastor Brown's impactful crusade services. Though he initially had only the hook, he knew the message needed more. He reached out to renowned gospel singer and composer MarQuez Curtis, who co-wrote the single and will also be featured alongside Pastor Brown on the track.  Once the song was fully arranged, Pastor Brown enlisted the talents of Bart Orr II, an award-winning and Billboard-charting producer, to bring the vision to life. Orr's signature production style gave the track a rich, soulful sound, aligning perfectly with Pastor Brown's desire to create music that uplifts the spirit and encourages the people of God.  "It doesn't take God long to do what He's going to do. Whatever you need from God, it can happen by Friday," says Pastor Brown. The single carries a message of hope, faith, and divine timing — something Pastor Brown says the world needs now more than ever.  "By Friday" will mark Pastor Brown's third official single, following the success of Fresh Oil (2014) and Blessed Man (2018). With this new release, he is preparing to usher in a new era of music and ministry with more collaborations and a forthcoming album currently in development.  Stay tuned for more details and updates.
