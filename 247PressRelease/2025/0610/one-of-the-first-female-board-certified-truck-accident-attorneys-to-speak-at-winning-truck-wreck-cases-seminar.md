# One of the first female board-certified truck accident attorneys to speak at "Winning Truck Wreck Cases" seminar

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christy Crowe Childers is one of the first women in the United States to be board-certified in trucking accident law. And at this year's "Winning Truck Wreck Cases" seminar, she'll share her strategies with her peers, focusing on a new damages model she developed to help judges, jurors and clients better understand less tangible damages.  The event is hosted by David W. Craig and Scott A. Faultless and presented by the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association and will be held on August 4, 2025 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Embassy Suites Noblesville Indianapolis Conference Center. Registration for the seminar is available at the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association website.  During her seminar session, titled "Big Rig + Big Damages = Big Rig Damages House", Childers will delve into Damages Houseâ€”a damages model that asks clients to categorize and associate intangible damages using the rooms of a house. This model helps clients combine storytelling and visualization to create a clear and powerful testimony that is relatable and impactful for judges and jurors.  Childers is also a co-founder of Sisterhood of the 8, a non-profit for women trial lawyers and women in the trucking and transportation industry to connect with each other, access helpful resources and add more voices to the mission of creating safer roads. The organization prides itself on helping women in the field achieve 8-figure verdicts, in addition to hosting the annual Mother Truckers Rally, where female attorneys come together to expand their legal education and participate in educational and adrenaline-fueled activities.  This is the second year David W. Craig and Scott A. Faultless will be organizing the "Winning Truck Wreck Cases" seminar. Both attorneys are board-certified in truck accident law and serve on the Board of Regents of the Academy of Truck Accident Attorneys. They have been named Top 100 Indiana Trial Lawyers by The National Trial Lawyers.
