# American Clown – A Bold New Documentary Unmasks the Soul of a Vanishing Art

HOLLYWOOD, CA, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What happens when the laughter fades and the greasepaint runs? In a world where the circus has packed up its tent and Ronald McDonald has disappeared from the birthday circuit, one man sets out to find out what's left of America's once-beloved clown.  American Clown is a riveting, emotionally charged documentary that follows Guilford Adams — a real, working clown — as he navigates a rapidly shifting cultural landscape. With the closure of Barnum and Bailey, the quiet retirement of Ronald McDonald, and Hollywood's recent obsession with terrifying clown portrayals, Adams finds himself asking a question that feels more urgent than ever: Is there still room for joy in the red nose?  Featuring intimate, thought-provoking interviews with iconic performers including John C. Reilly, David Arquette, David Howard Thornton, Bill Irwin, and Steve-O, American Clown isn't just about clowns — it's about identity, resilience, and the enduring power of performance.  Directed by Guilford Adams & Casey Pinkston, and produced by Gingerkid Productions' Bill Parks and Sallee Pictures' Jason Sallee, this film is both a love letter to the art of clowning and a wake-up call about the disappearing joy in our cultural imagination.  American Clown will make its world premiere on June 23rd at the historic Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood as part of the prestigious Dances With Films festival.  Tickets are available now.
