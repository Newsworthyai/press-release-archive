# Wondering if a lawyer is legit? Read this book

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Attorney advertising is everywhere. On billboards and buses. In public restrooms. Throughout your Facebook feed.  Most of us glance at these ads and ignore them. But, in 2019, two-thirds of Americans said they'd experienced a legal issue in the previous two years, a study reported. Trial attorney David W. Craig's new book, It's Never Been Easier to Hire the Wrong Attorney, bridges the gap between lawyers and clients.  If you find yourself scrambling for legal representation — for personal injury, divorce, insurance claims, estate planning — it is vital that you know what to look for.   It's Never Been Easier to Hire the Wrong Attorney arms readers with tactics to separate good attorneys from the bad. However, even a great attorney might be the wrong one for your case, author David Craig emphasizes. Even the best real estate lawyer is wrong for a truck accident case.  Prospective clients must know what matters when searching for an attorney.  The book, available for purchase June 3, discusses:  • Red flags and other hallmarks of shady law firms or lawyers • Interviewing an attorney before hiring them (and what to ask) • What happens when clients choose the wrong lawyer • How to tell if an attorney's credentials are legitimate • Why legal marketing shouldn't be taken at face value  David Craig, a personal injury and wrongful death attorney of more than 35 years, has seen injured victims accept meager settlements — instead of the multi-million-dollar award they could have secured — because they chose an inexperienced attorney.   His goal is to help clients identify lawyers who are respectful, experienced, qualified, dedicated and empathetic. Hiring an attorney can be a life-altering decision. Do it right.
