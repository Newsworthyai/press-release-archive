# Jonathan Herman Speaks to International Law Students, Providing Insights on Tech Disruption and Opportunities for Legal Innovation

MIAMI, FL, June 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jonathan Herman, Founder of Strong Interactive and a top-ranked Web3 innovator, recently participated in a dynamic alumni panel discussion hosted by Northeastern University School of Law (NUSL) for its international LLM students. Held at the university's new Miami campus, the session brought together forward-thinking professionals to explore the evolving legal landscape and the role of emerging technologies in shaping its future.  Herman, a Northeastern Law alumnus known globally for his contributions to blockchain, mixed reality and artificial intelligence, shared his unconventional journey from law into entrepreneurship. During the panel, he described how his legal education provided a foundation for understanding complex systems — a skill he now leverages to develop cutting-edge tools that redefine consumer engagement and professional workflows.  "Just as contracts are structured to mitigate risk and clarify expectations, AI and blockchain technologies now allow us to bring similar structures to digital environments," Herman explained. "This is already transforming legal practice. For example, I was recently asked by a law firm to build a GPT that could replicate the work product typically assigned to first-year associates."  The conversation also touched on the intellectual property rights involved in creating and commercializing content in today's market, beyond NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) and where human expertise can intersect blockchain transactions as commercial transactions become automated. Herman emphasized that attorneys who understand and embrace these disruptive tools will be best positioned for future success.  As a Crunchbase-ranked top professional in Web3 and AI Startups (Seed Stage), Herman continues to serve as a key voice at the intersection of law, technology, and innovation.  The panel concluded with advice for aspiring attorneys. "It's an exciting time to help shape what the legal profession will become. Understanding how technology is changing client expectations will be a key differentiator in your career," Herman advised.
