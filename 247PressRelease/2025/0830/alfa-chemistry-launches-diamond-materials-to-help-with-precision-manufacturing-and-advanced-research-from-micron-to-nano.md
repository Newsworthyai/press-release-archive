# Alfa Chemistry Launches Diamond Materials to Help with Precision Manufacturing and Advanced Research — From Micron to Nano

NEW YORK, NY, August 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Alfa Chemistry, a global Contract Research Organization (CRO) that focuses on organic, material, and medicinal chemistry, stated today that it is adding more advanced diamond materials to its product line. These include diamond micron powder, nanodiamond powder, and diamond lapping products. The portfolio meets the rising needs for sub-micron surface control, nanostructured coatings, and precision polishing in semiconductor production, optical engineering, aerospace components, and biomedical research.  There are different grades of micron-sized powders, such as polycrystalline, monocrystalline, and other specialized formulations. The particles range from 1 to 50 μm in size. These powders allow precise control over abrasive removal rates and surface finish, which is very important for polishing semiconductor wafers and planarizing optical lenses, where the surface roughness (Ra) must stay within nanoscale tolerances. Nanodiamond powders have a narrow range of particle sizes, high surface functionalization capacity, and a controlled dispersion to prevent agglomeration. These traits are necessary for ultrafine polishing, thin-film coatings, and changing the surface of biomedical devices or high-performance composites.  Lapping products, such as slurries, pastes, and gels, are made using different carriers, both organic and aqueous, to keep their viscosity, chemical compatibility, and dispersion stability consistent. This lets you adjust to different polishing techniques and substrates, giving you exact control over how much material is removed and how smooth the surface is.  A Senior Scientist of Material Chemistry at Alfa Chemistry noted, "Keeping surface precision below a micron while controlling coating uniformity is a big problem in both research and industry." "Our materials are designed to work the same way every time under certain process conditions." Engineers and researchers can get the right surface roughness, planarization rates, and coating thickness without extensive trial-and-error adjustments by changing the particle size distribution, carrier chemistry, and dispersion stability.  Controlled micron powders make it possible to precisely planarize wafers in semiconductor manufacture. Nanodiamond dispersions, on the other hand, improve the homogeneity of thin films for optical and medicinal uses. Lapping products with customizable formulas help labs get the same results on different surfaces, like glass, metals, and polymers. These materials help with high-precision workflows and repeatable experimental settings by matching the qualities of materials with specific processing needs.
