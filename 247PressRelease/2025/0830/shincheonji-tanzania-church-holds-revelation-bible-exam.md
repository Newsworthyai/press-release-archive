# Shincheonji Tanzania Church Holds Revelation Bible Exam

NEW YORK, NY, August 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, held a Bible exam on the Book of Revelation on August 18th in major cities in Tanzania, including Dar es Salaam. A total of 138 participants gathered for the test, including 40 Shincheonji Church members and 98 local Protestant pastors.  The exam consisted of 10 main questions and 33 sub-questions, all centered around the Book of Revelation.   The exam results showed major differences in average scores between the two groups. Shincheonji Church members averaged 95 points on the exam, while Protestant pastors averaged just 7 points. The purpose of the exam was not to determine superiority, but to provide an opportunity for each person to examine their faith and draw closer to God.  "Watching Shincheonji members confidently write down the correct answers today made me reflect on my own faith and my calling as a pastor," said one pastor. "From now on, I will study Revelation through the Shincheonji Zion Christian Mission Center, guide my church members to God's path, and properly teach them so that they may enter heaven."  Shincheonji Church of Jesus Chairman Lee Man-hee has long emphasized Revelation 22:18â€“19, stating, "To enter heaven, one must not add to or subtract from the words of Revelation but must fully understand and keep them."  Chairman Lee has also continually stressed that, "The standard for discerning truth from falsehood, orthodoxy from heresy, is not human tradition or doctrine, but solely the word of the Bible."  Shincheonji Church also held a Bible exam in Korea in 2024. At that time, out of 313 total participants, only one church pastor joined.  "This Bible exam is not just about testing knowledge, but about confirming whether one's faith is truly based on the word of God," said a Shincheonji Church representative. "We are thankful that pastors at home and abroad are gradually participating. We hope more churches and believers will continue to unite through Bible-centered fellowship."  Since its establishment in 2018, Shincheonji Tanzania Church has continued to grow. As of August 2025, the church has a total of 2,440 members and is striving to spread Bible-centered faith through fellowship with local pastors.
