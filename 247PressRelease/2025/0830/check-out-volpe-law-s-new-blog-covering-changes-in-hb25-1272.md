# Check Out Volpe Law's New Blog Covering Changes in HB25-1272

DENVER, CO, August 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Read Volpe Law founder and lead attorney Ben Volpe's take on HB25-1272, which made sweeping changes to the state's construction defect tort laws. His blog, featured on the firm website, evaluates the changes presented in the bill (soon to be signed into law). Developers, homeowners, and real estate attorneys may all need to adjust their professional strategies, taking into account these changes.  The new law increases protections for homeowners and incentivizes builders and developers to come to the table to negotiate solutions to construction defect disputes. The law introduces a more robust dispute resolution process, and while builders may see an increase in the need for legal representation (and potentially higher legal fees) in the short term, in the long term, the changes in the law may reduce the chances that construction disputes will end up in litigation.  HB25-1272 also affects Homeowners Associations, reducing the likelihood of disputes going to litigation and refocusing on addressing the issues between the two parties. Homebuyers perhaps benefit the most from the changes in this law. Now, with mandatory inspections, there's a much better chance of catching defects before the purchase. However, the new law has tightened up pre-litigation and pleading requirements.  Construction litigation lawyers, developers, builders, and potential homebuyers should all review the new statute and compare it with the pre-existing CDARA statute, according to Ben.
