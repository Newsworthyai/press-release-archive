# Hunky's Cedar Springs Hosts Art Show and Auction Featuring Local Celebrities on September 17, 2025

DALLAS, TX, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hunky's Cedar Springs is proud to announce its Art Show & Auction on Wednesday, September 17, 2025, a vibrant celebration of art, community, and local culture. The event, held during Pride in Dallas Week (September 14–21, 2025), will bring together neighborhood personalities, artists, and supporters for an unforgettable evening.  The highlight of the event will be a series of custom portraits by Texas artist Becca Waugh, who has created whimsical, one-of-a-kind artworks inspired by classic Hunky's menu items.
