# "Search for the Signet" Introduces the Orion Labauve Series About a Young Man Raised by Ghosts and Born to Wield Voodoo Magic

MORRISON, CO, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Orion Labauve's very conception was the product of magical manipulations unknown to him for many years. Orion's life had been intertwined with spirits at the L'Enfant Haven plantation in Louisiana since he was three years old. The ghosts were bound to the property by an old curse which gave them abilities most ghosts lacked. As Orion grew he learned the stories of their lives and deaths and how they were woven with his family and his own life.  But being able to see hear, and speak to the ghosts was merely the beginning of his power. Orion's life drastically changed after his twenty-fifth birthday in 1982, when he became aware of the extent of his talents enhanced by a Voodoo Spirit God called 'The Duke' who has his own agendas.   In Search for the Signet Orion also discovered the grandmother he never knew is the powerful Voodoo Imperatrice. When she tried to use him to wield the power of the Labauve Signet to control the spirits, Orion realized he must find the Signet and possibly destroy all he holds dear to stop her.  Search for the Signet is currently available from online booksellers and brick and mortar bookstores worldwide. Spectral Promises, the second in the Orion Labauve series, is due to be released before the end of September.   L. L. Blacke, Colorado author of "Search for the Signet," will be at Milehicon (www.milehicon.org) October 31, and November 1st and 2nd.   L.L. Blacke has been an avid fan and voracious reader of fantasy, science fiction, and horror from an early age. She has over thirty years of experience in the science fiction and fantasy community, playing significant roles in organizing conventions. The Orion Labauve series reflects her lifelong love for the fantastical and the eerie, with its richly woven narratives that challenge the boundaries of reality.
