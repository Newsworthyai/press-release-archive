# Neuroscience Discovery: Longevity Scientists Dr. Berenika Maciejewicz Unlocks New Pathways to Understanding Human Consciousness

MIAMI, FL, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A breakthrough in the field of neuroscience is making headlines. Dr. Berenika Maciejewicz, an accomplished neuroscientist and longevity doctor, has unveiled pioneering research that sheds new light on one of humanity's greatest mysteries: consciousness. Her work, published in the prestigious International Brain Research journal, is being hailed as a forward-thinking leap in the study of the human mind.  Dr. Maciejewicz, often referred to as a "triple doctor", holds two PhDs, one in Biomedical Engineering from the Einstein Medical Institute and another in Neuroscience from London Metropolitan University, along with her medical degree. She oversees a biotechnology unicorn startup in the longevity space, 600and1.com, with an aim to bioengineer lifespan and health-span extension. During her doctoral studies in London, she broke new ground by investigating lucid dreaming as a window into conscious awareness. By studying how the brain signals during these rare states of dreaming, Dr. Maciejewicz was able to develop new approaches for identifying consciousness in conditions previously thought to obscure awareness.  Her most recent work, Neuroscience of Consciousness in the Locked-In Syndrome: Prognostic and Diagnostic Review, dives into the little-understood world of patients who are aware but unable to move or communicate due to severe brainstem injuries. These individuals, often misdiagnosed, live in a silent prison of their own bodies. Dr. Maciejewicz's research provides a new diagnostic framework and offers hope for improved communication through brain-computer interfaces.  "Locked-in syndrome shows us that consciousness does not fully disappear even when the paralyzed body may suggest otherwise," said Dr. Maciejewicz. "The challenge is finding ways to detect and connect with that inner awareness. Lucidity research shows there are patterns we can study, opening new doors for patient care and, ultimately, for redefining how to measure consciousness."  This discovery has profound implications for the future of AI technology, brain-computer interfaces, and neuroscience itself. The ability to reliably detect consciousness could reshape how we approach disorders of awareness, bioethics, and even the merging of human cognition with advanced technologies like Elon Musk's Neuralink device. By bridging neuroscience with cutting-edge engineering, Dr. Maciejewicz's work points toward a future where the human brain could communicate directly with computers, potentially transforming healthcare, accessibility, and human-machine symbiosis.  Beyond her pioneering research, Dr. Maciejewicz has pursued extensive training at world-renowned institutions. She holds a Certificate of Achievement in Genetics and Genomics from Stanford Medicine, and she has completed advanced oncology-immunology programs through Harvard Medical School. Her combination of medical, engineering, and neuroscience expertise positions her uniquely at the crossroads of medicine, consciousness research, and emerging brain technologies.  Dr. Maciejewicz's work challenges traditional definitions of awareness and provides practical diagnostic tools for physicians who care for patients with rare neurological disorders. Importantly, it inspires global conversations about the essence of identity, consciousness, and the potential for future technologies to extend the boundaries of human capacities. Dr. Maciejewicz's voice is becoming one of the most forward-looking in the field. Her message is clear: the mind locked in a brain-injured body is often more awake and aware than we realize.
