We are so excited to roll out our first version of eMAM Next with a perpetual free license for all of our new customers for the rest of the year." The AI will leverage open-source LLMs and work on affordable HP Z2 workstations to provide speech-to-text, summarization, and title generation for organizations to use securely in their local infrastructure. Over time, EMAM will add new tools and features to eMAM Next.
