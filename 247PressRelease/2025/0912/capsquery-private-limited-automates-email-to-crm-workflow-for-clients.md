# Capsquery Private Limited Automates Email-to-CRM Workflow for Clients

HOUSTON, TX, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Capsquery Private Limited is a leading Custom Web development company and have successfully designed and deployed a smart automation solution that connects email data directly to a client's CRM, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual entry. Automating: From Email Overload to Seamless Integration  The Challenge -  Client leads are receiving an increasing amount of data in emails every day, including bids, proposals, and more. Manually reading each email and entering the essential information into their CRM portal were the only ways to get their CRM up and running.  There were a lot of errors, and it was extremely boring. As they already had a PHP-WordPress-driven legacy site from several years ago, it wasn't possible to automate it unless they rewrote it from scratch.  Our Solution -  The Capsquery team had an idea for a more intelligent way to automate the process that would not disrupt the existing infrastructure. By using the IMAP library the following things were achieved:  1. Client's mailbox gets directly linked.  2. Each email received gets automatically scanned.  3. Data such as the amount of a bid or proposal gets extracted.  4. CRM portal data kept up-to-date in real time.  To make it easier to manage, Capsquery tech team defined a cron job to run the procedure every X minutes.  Results:  Huge Time Gains - Hours of work are now reduced to minutes per day. Fewer Errors - The automated extraction method eliminated the need for manual keying No Infrastructure Overhaul - Capsquery design solution that adapts to PHP/WordPress settings automatically.
