# Ultra-Low Mileage 1983 Mazda RX-7 GSL Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly welcomes an exceptionally preserved 1983 Mazda RX-7 GSL to its growing lineup of iconic vehicles. Part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, this stunning brown RX-7 GSL offers visitors a rare opportunity to view one of the finest examples of Mazda's celebrated rotary-powered sports car — with fewer than 4,000 original miles on the odometer.  Launched in 1978, the first-generation Mazda RX-7 captivated drivers with its lightweight chassis, timeless styling, and innovative rotary engine. The GSL trim, introduced in the early 1980s, further elevated the RX-7's appeal with premium equipment and enhanced performance.  At its heart is Mazda's legendary 1.1-liter 12A rotary engine, factory rated at 100 horsepower, paired with a five-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential — delivering a thrilling and unique driving experience. Disc brakes at all four corners, included with the GSL package, provide confident stopping power.  This beautifully preserved example is equipped with signature pop-up headlights, a sunroof, electric windows, cruise control, air conditioning, and a factory cassette stereo complete with a graphic equalizer and balancer — state-of-the-art features for its time.  The driver-focused interior features a leather-wrapped steering wheel framing a central 7,000-rpm redline tachometer, a 130-mph speedometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer confirms its remarkable condition — showing just under 4,000 miles from new.  "The first-generation RX-7 captured the spirit of the true driver's car — light, agile, and endlessly fun," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "Finding an original example with such incredibly low mileage is extraordinary. We are thrilled to share this gem with our visitors."  The 1983 Mazda RX-7 GSL is now on display among more than 200 collector vehicles and 3,000 vintage toys and memorabilia at the DFW Car & Toy Museum — a must-visit destination for automotive enthusiasts of all ages.
