# Tracy Miller Expands Inventive Sleep® With the Wedge Collection: Pillows Designed to Fit the Way You Sleep

NAPERVILLE, IL, September 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tracy Miller, the inventor and sleep innovator behind Inventive Sleep®, announces the launch of the Inventive Sleep® Wedge Collection, a suite of four purpose-driven designs created to solve the overlooked challenges of everyday rest and relaxation.  Building on her success at Pottery Barn, where Inventive Sleep® debuted with decorative-meets-functional upholstered pillows, Miller now shifts the focus to performance-driven wedges engineered purely for functional sleep support. With each design offering a targeted solution — from eliminating bed gaps to relieving side-sleeper pressure — the collection gives retailers fresh ways to connect with wellness-focused consumers seeking smarter comfort solutions.  "Every wedge in this collection was designed with purpose — to solve a real frustration that disrupts rest," said Tracy Miller, Sleep Innovator and founder of Inventive Sleep®. "So many people struggle with specialty sleep needs — whether it's side sleepers battling shoulder pain, stomach sleepers searching for comfort that doesn't strain their neck, or people who stack pillows every night just to find support. These are the overlooked details that make or break good sleep. By focusing on these challenges, we've created products that feel inventive, personal, and essential — both for better sleep and for better living."  The Tracy Miller® Inventive Sleep® Wedge Collection:  No-Gap Stacker Wedge More than a finishing touch, the No-Gap™ Stacker Support Wedge enhances both sleep comfort and bed styling. It eliminates the space between the mattress and headboard for a seamless, tailored look while doubling as a supportive base for decorative pillows.  For sleepers who stack pillows to get the right height and firmness, this wedge provides a smarter solution. The supportive foam core acts as the firm foundation stackers usually create with a bottom pillow — simply add a favorite soft pillow on top, and the result is lasting comfort without the nightly reshuffling. Adjustable side pockets and optional angled heights add convenience and flexibility.  Side Sleeper Wedge and Bonus Contour Personal Pillow Purpose-built for side sleepers, the Side Sleeper Wedge features a U-shaped contour that cradles the head and neck while creating space for the arm — reducing shoulder compression and relieving the uncomfortable arm pressure that disrupts rest. Its dual-foam construction pairs a durable high-density base with adaptive slow-rebound memory foam, helping side sleepers wake up aligned, supported, and restored. Each Side Sleeper Wedge also includes a personal-sized memory foam pillow with a five-sided contoured shape and 3" gusset for added neck and shoulder support. Perfectly sized for travel, this bonus pillow offers extra comfort on planes, in cars, or anywhere at home.  Adjustable Back Rest Wedge A versatile wedge designed for total-body comfort, the Adjustable Backrest Wedge features a detachable neck roll with an adjustable elastic strap for customizable positioning. Use it with the wedge for ergonomic back, neck, or leg support, or take the neck roll alone for extra comfort while working, traveling, or relaxing anywhere. Crafted with supportive foam construction, it adapts to multiple positions — easing back tension, elevating legs, or supporting upright rest — making it one of the most flexible comfort solutions in the collection.  Stomach Sleeper Comfort Wedge Engineered for one of the most overlooked sleep styles, the Stomach Sleeper Comfort Wedge is a two-piece design that relieves pressure on the skin and neck while providing stable, lasting support. The Support Wedge, built with a 5" tapered edge and an armrest and face cutout, creates ergonomic positioning with firm foam that resists shifting. Layered on top, the Comfort Layer mirrors the cutout while adding a soft, plush surface to cradle the head, neck, and shoulders. Covered in a breathable bamboo-blend knit, this wedge delivers the rare combination of pressure relief, comfort, and stability — equally ideal for stomach sleepers, post-treatment recovery, spa services, or mid-day desk naps.  Innovation With Purpose For retailers, the Tracy Miller® Inventive Sleep® Wedge Collection creates an opportunity to diversify assortments with products that are function-first and solution-driven. Unlike traditional pillows, each wedge is engineered to address a specific need — expanding the definition of sleep wellness and offering consumers smarter ways to sleep, relax, and recharge.  Beyond the consumer marketplace, the Wedge Collection also creates opportunities in healthcare, institutional, and spa settings. With their specialty comfort focus, the wedges naturally extend into chiropractic offices, physical therapy clinics, hospital recovery programs, and spa treatments — bridging the gap between clinical support, restorative wellness, and everyday comfort.  The collection debuts this market season, offering retailers fresh opportunities in the growing specialty sleep and wellness category.
