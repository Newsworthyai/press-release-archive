It's heartfelt, adventurous, and unapologetically real—an honest account of a life well-lived. Inspiring without being preachy, it made me reflect on my own life and what it means to really go after your dreams." – Naia  •	"Such a badass story. As one of the first female pilots, Bliss Knight faced so many hurdles in a male-dominated world and still managed to crush it. Her journey is a solid reminder that pushing boundaries and breaking barriers is never easy, but it's so worth it. This memoir is inspiring, empowering, and couldn't be more relevant right now." – Veronica Adams  More about Bliss Knight Bliss Knight is a retired airline pilot, FAA Designated Pilot Examiner, and sailor with a passion for storytelling.
