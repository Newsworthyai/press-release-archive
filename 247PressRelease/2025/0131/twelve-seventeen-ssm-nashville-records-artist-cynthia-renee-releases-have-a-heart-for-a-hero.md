NASHVILLE, TN, January 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Twelve-Seventeen/SSM recording artist, Cynthia Renee is set to release the music video for her new single "Have a Heart for a Hero" on Friday, January 31st. The single will be out to radio next week and will be available on all streaming platforms on February 28th. The song written by Renee and Dustin James, "paints a picture of the day in the life of a firefighter, police officer, and even a soldier." The single is an upbeat anthem highlighting first responders and the impact they have on the community.   When asked about her inspiration for the song, Renee says that "The song means so much to me because my dad was a deputy sheriff and a veteran as well. I have so much respect for people who are willing to put their lives on the line for us every day. I am thankful there are people around us who sacrifice their safety and comfort for our freedoms. Especially living in California, with the Los Angeles fires that have just ravaged the area, our firefighters are exhausted and still keep on going day in and day out. This song is my thank you to all of those heroes."  Hearts 4 Heroes USA is a non-profit organization founded by first responders for first responders. Their programs provide ongoing support needed to assist in challenging times on the frontline and their members work tirelessly to fundraise, donate time and services, and provide mental health and wellness care. Renee is an ambassador for the organization and had the opportunity to sing the National Anthem in her hometown at the Sacramento Kings Game in December 2023 where the organization was recognized.  Cynthia Renee signed to Twelve-Seventeen/SSM in 2023. Influenced by the styles of Olivia Newton-John and Carrie Underwood, Renee adds her twang to standard country with a soulful sound in her music. Her songwriting is based on the love of her family and first-hand experiences she's had throughout her life.
