# Cybercrime Damages Highlight Need for Scalable Decentralized Infrastructure in Crypto

NEW YORK, NY, January 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The growing concerns over cybercrime in the cryptocurrency space have highlighted the urgent need for scalable decentralized infrastructure to mitigate risks and ensure the security of digital assets. Recent incidents involving fraudulent activities and the increased frequency of cyberattacks have underscored the vulnerability of centralized systems and the need for a shift toward more secure, transparent, and resilient infrastructure solutions.   Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also highlights the need for a more robust decentralized infrastructure to combat these security concerns. Buterin advocates for a more scalable and decentralized approach to building the foundational layers of the crypto ecosystem. He notes that by decentralized infrastructure, the industry can better shield itself from the dangers posed by cybercrime, reducing the opportunities for fraud and manipulation that currently plague centralized platforms.   Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has long championed the transformative potential of decentralized technologies in improving the security and scalability of digital asset systems. Silbert emphasizes that the ongoing damage caused by cybercrime can no longer be dismissed as isolated incidents but instead serves as a clear indication of the systemic flaws in current centralized frameworks. It's not just about innovation it's about creating the infrastructure that can stand up to the pressures of cybercrime.   The risks posed by centralized platforms and exchanges, where sensitive data and assets are stored in a single location, are becoming increasingly apparent. Cybercriminals have targeted these centralized hubs, exploiting their vulnerabilities for financial gain. In contrast, decentralized networks provide greater transparency and security by distributing control across a wide network of participants, minimizing the risks associated with a single point of failure.   While the push for decentralized systems is gaining momentum, it remains clear that the road ahead is not without challenges. Some industry figures have argued that the current centralized models need to "resign" from their positions of dominance, making way for new, more secure, and decentralized alternatives. The debate continues, but one thing is certain: the industry must adapt to the growing cybercrime threat or risk allowing the same vulnerabilities to undermine its progress.  As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the focus must shift toward creating scalable, decentralized infrastructure that can offer better protection against fraud, cybercrime, and other malicious activities. By embracing these technologies, the industry can build a more secure and sustainable future for digital assets, benefiting both users and investors alike.
