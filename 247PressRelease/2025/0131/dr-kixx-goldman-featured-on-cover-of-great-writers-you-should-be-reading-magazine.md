# Dr. Kixx Goldman Featured On Cover Of Great Writers You Should Be Reading Magazine

WILMINGTON, NC, January 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Kixx Goldman was recently featured on the front cover of Great Writers You Should Be Reading Magazine, regarding an interview done on The Authors Show. In that interview she discussed her latest bestselling book, 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard - Stories Of Courage And Healing.'  The source of intuition is somewhat of a mystery. Some research indicates that it is closely tied to our unconscious ability to process information, drawing upon our unique experiences and patterns to make meaningful connections and even predictions. Dr. Kixx Goldman believes it can also be a powerful ally in helping us overcome trauma.  By drawing from the wisdom of our intuition, we can forge our own unique path to healing, overcome challenges, and unlock our full potential.  "Have your ever dreamed of rewriting your own history?" Goldman asked. "Or longed to go back and change something you did – or wished you could speak up and say something you wished you'd said?  "It happened to me.  "When I saw the cover of Great Writers You Should Be Reading with my photo, and listened once again to my interview with Don McCauley, I felt a sense of joy and accomplishment.  "As a child, I'd been known to speak my mind, but as a teenager and adult, speaking from my heart had been drummed out of me by life's lessons.  "After I'd written the stories for my collection and created a title for them, I suddenly realized I was sending myself a message through my writing. It was time to speak out, from my heart --to be heard.  "Through the experience of doing the interview, I felt my dream had been fulfilled. I'd reclaimed the spirited and fearless voice of my youth. And now, it's my fervent wish for my readers to be inspired, to summon their courage, honor their intuition and speak from their hearts about their thoughts and feelings."  In 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard - Stories Of Courage And Healing', Kixx takes readers on a journey that is an illuminating exploration into intuition, resilience, and emotional honesty. Through a collection of eight realistic but fictional stories, she begins to show us key strategies for navigating life's challenges with courage and authenticity. Every one of the stories serves as a compelling testament to the transformative power of honoring one's own inner voice. The key word here is "own". Each form of trauma is unique to the individual, and thus requires a one-of-a-kind approach. The author has a talent that allows her to help guide readers to discover their own paths, without resorting to preaching or promising.  Leslie S. Greenberg, Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus of the Department of Psychology at York University called the book, "A lovely book of short stories touching on many painful issues in life, like abuse —sexual and otherwise-- gender, and deception. What stands out is the author's positive view of human nature. In each story, the characters' resilience is illustrated by how they transform difficult life stories into constructive final narratives. They find the courage to triumph over challenges to heal and they grow. The message of the book: speaking one's truth makes for desired change and healing. An added feature is the behind-the-scenes view of the author's personal experiences-the source of the stories-a treat not often given to readers.  From the struggles of devoted fathers and resilient teachers to the courageous defiance of therapists and survivors, the characters in "Speak from Your Heart" exemplify the resilience of the human spirit and will. Through these stories, readers are reminded of the inherent strength that lies within each of us, inspiring us to heal and reclaim our power. 'Speak from Your Heart And Be Heard' is not just a book—it's a beacon of hope and healing, offering readers real insight for navigating life with grace and resilience.  The eight engaging fictional stories in this collection are personal, drawn from experiences in Dr. Kixx's life and the lives of her clients. The characters are tested by everyday traumas...  • A devoted father and his daughter find hope in rewriting their past. • With remarkable grit, a teacher escapes a surprise attack. • To heal his childhood wounds, a man must conquer his fears. • A therapist defies the establishment to protect her clients. • As she confronts the church, a therapist regains her standing. • A woman learns the risks of not speaking out. • By sharing her story and bonding with peers, a woman overcomes her trauma.  As the characters in these stories find the courage to triumph over their challenges, they heal and grow.  Inspired by real life people, characters show readers how to find the courage to transform difficult and traumatic life experiences, speak their truth and reclaim their power.  In her review, Liz Moulden said, "The short stories from Speak from Your Heart and Be Heard have given me a second chance and a voice, the voice I never had. What's exciting about this book is each main character in these short stories experienced some kind of abuse/ trauma but each finds their inner voice. With help, they're able to heal. Anyone who has ever experienced abuse or trauma as I have will be able to see snapshots of themselves in these stories."
