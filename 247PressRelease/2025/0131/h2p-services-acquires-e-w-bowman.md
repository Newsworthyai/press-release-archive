"This acquisition reflects our dedication to meeting the evolving needs of the annealing industry, where my fellow owners and I each dedicated so many years of our careers, while honoring the legacy of the E.W. Bowman brand that HFT maintained since its acquisition," said Mike Holmes, Co-Owner of H2P Services.  In HFT's support for the transition, it commented, "HFT's management team decided the activity associated with the E.W.
