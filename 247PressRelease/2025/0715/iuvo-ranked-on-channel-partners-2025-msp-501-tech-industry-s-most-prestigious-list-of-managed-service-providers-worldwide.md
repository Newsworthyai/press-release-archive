# iuvo Ranked on Channel Partners 2025 MSP 501—Tech Industry's Most Prestigious List of Managed Service Providers Worldwide

BOSTON, MA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- iuvo has been named as one of the world's top-performing managed service providers in the prestigious 2025 Channel Partners MSP 501 rankings. The annual Channel Partners MSP 501 list, a technology industry benchmark, ranks companies based on a wide range of metrics, including above industry average revenue growth, recurring revenue, high-margin services, and innovation including monetizing AI services.   For the past 18 years, managed service providers around the globe have submitted applications for inclusion on this prestigious and definitive listing. It is a milestone achievement for any managed services organization to be included on the list. The Channel Partners MSP 501 survey uses a quantitative methodology to rank companies based on their annual revenue, profitability measured by EBITDA, and recurring revenue. The methodology has been developed by a Who's-Who in the managed services industry.   "The MSP 501 is more than a ranking—it's a reflection of the innovation, operational excellence, and customer-first mindset that drives the world's top managed service providers forward. Earning a place on this list signals to customers, partners, and the broader tech community that these MSPs are setting the pace for the industry and defining what success looks like in today's complex technology landscape," said Robert DeMarzo, Sr. Director of Informa Channels events and digital content.   MSPs that qualify for the list must also pass a rigorous review conducted by the Channel Partners research team and editors. Channel Partners ranks applicants using a unique methodology that weighs financial performance according to long-term health and viability, commitment to recurring revenue and operational efficiency.   "The MSP 501 is the channel industry's unofficial GPS. Customers use it to navigate the over 300K MSP ecosystem, and vendors use it to find the right partners for their GTM strategy," said Devan Adams, principal analyst at Canalys (now part of Omdia). "Being an MSP 501er puts your business on the map while steering new opportunities to you."   "Ranking in the top 30% of MSPs nationwide is no small achievement. The managed services space is incredibly competitive with hundreds of MSPs just in our small New England region alone, so earning this national recognition is truly meaningful," said Bryon Beilman, President & CEO, iuvo. "For so many businesses, it can be hard to know which IT provider is the right fit when so many offer similar services or sound alike. The MSP 501 provides an objective way to cut through the noise and identify the providers that can genuinely drive impact for their business."  This year's list is one of the most competitive in the survey's history. Winners will be recognized on the Channel Partners and Channel Futures websites and honored during a special ceremony at MSP Summit, Sept 15-17, 2025, in Orlando, Fla.   The MSP 501 represents the best in the technology services industry delivering outstanding vendor and platform neutral advice and value to small, midsized and enterprise customers. This year, the average revenue per MSP 501 is $29.4 million with an average recurring revenue of $16 million. These are truly the best of the best. Many of their services and technology offerings focus on customer needs in the areas of AI, cloud, security, collaboration, networking, help desk and remote monitoring and management. The Channel Partners MSP 501 is responsible for keeping their global customers safe, connected and efficient.   Said Kelly Danziger, Informa Channels GM: "Making the MSP 501 isn't just about performance metrics—it's about leadership, vision, and the ability to drive meaningful outcomes for customers. This recognition places these MSPs among an elite group shaping the future of technology services worldwide."   iuvo's team credits its culture as a driving force behind this achievement."Our culture is the key. It is and has been our secret sauce from the beginning," said Beilman. "We live and breathe our core values. Our collaborative, empowered team culture is what drives every success. We hire experts with deep experience, put them in a collaborative environment, and empower them to solve problems quickly and creatively. When we talk about outcomes like this, it all starts with our people."  iuvo's Approach to AI Innovation Channel Futures emphasizes AI as a key differentiator among top MSPs this year and iuvo has made AI a cornerstone of its strategy.  "Our approach to AI sets us apart from other MSPs," said Beilman. "While many MSP leaders are still trying to figure out AI or are relying on products that claim to be 'AI capable,' iuvo took a different path. We cut through the hype and got to the heart of how AI works. Our engineers dug deep to master it at a fundamental level, and our AI experts trained the entire organization to build company-wide understanding. From that foundation, we developed a Secure AI platform for our customers, help them integrate AI into their businesses through our AI consulting services, and leverage it internally to drive smarter, more efficient growth."
