# Deco Tech Introduces INO M Series High-Precision Screen Printer for Printed Electronics and Delicate Medical Films

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Deco Technology Group, Inc., the exclusive North American distributor for INO Žiri, is pleased to introduce the INO M Series modular screen printing platform—designed for ultra-precise, sheet-fed printing on delicate substrates used in printed electronics, medical sensors, flexible circuits, and touch-sensitive displays.  Engineered for applications that demand tight registration and contamination-free handling, the INO M Series offers production speeds up to 380 sheets per hour and ±20 µm print accuracy. Each model in the lineup (M4, M5, M6, and M8) shares a consistent print architecture, ensuring alignment and repeatability from early-stage prototyping through high-volume production.  The M Series handles sensitive substrates such as PET, PEN, polycarbonate, and specialty foils, thanks to its anti-scratch vacuum transport system, camera-based auto-registration, and intelligent print-length correction. Modular automation options—including feeders, dryers, vision inspection, and stackers—can be integrated at any stage, allowing manufacturers to scale operations without requalifying their process.  Typical applications include printed sensors, film heaters, flexible hybrid circuits, biosensors, wearable diagnostic patches, and optically clear conductive layers. The M Series is already in use at top European manufacturing facilities producing high-precision electronics for automotive, aerospace, and medical markets.  "Many of our customers are working with high-value substrates and precious metal pastes where even the smallest error can result in product loss or failed validation," said Mike Learmouth, President of Deco Technology Group. "The INO M Series combines the accuracy of semiconductor-grade registration with the flexibility of modular screen printing—bringing a future-proof solution to North American electronics manufacturers."  The M Series is also optimized for Industry 4.0 workflows, with OPC-UA/MES integration, full traceability, and data-driven process control. All models feature INO's user-friendly touchscreen HMI and fast-changeover print carriage, reducing setup times and operator dependency.  Manufacturers seeking scalable, high-resolution screen printing solutions can contact Deco Tech to discuss the ideal configuration for their application.  About Deco Technology Group, Inc.
