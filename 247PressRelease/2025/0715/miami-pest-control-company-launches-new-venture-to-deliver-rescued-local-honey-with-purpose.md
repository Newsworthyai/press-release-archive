# Miami Pest Control Company Launches New Venture to Deliver Rescued Local Honey with Purpose

MIAMI, FL, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a world where pollinator populations are dwindling and grocery store shelves are filled with ultra-processed products, one South Florida couple is taking action once again.  Jean Navarro and Ana Angulo Perez have officially launched a new venture: Mega Bee Honey. The new line of 100 percent raw, unfiltered honey is harvested directly from the hives they rescue across Miami-Dade and Broward counties, offering a sweet, sustainable alternative to mass-produced honey.  "We never set out to create a honey brand," said Navarro. "But after years of rescuing bees and educating the public about pollinator health, it felt like the natural next step. People have been asking for it for so long, and it's finally here."  A Mission-Driven Business Built on Bees  The story of Mega Bee began in 2020 when Jean founded Mega Bee Pest Control and Rescues, a Miami bee nest removal company, combining eco-friendly pest control with humane bee hive relocation services.  The new honey venture brings their mission full circle, rescuing bees, giving them a safe home, and sharing the fruits of their labor with the community.  "We believe in doing things differently," said Angulo Perez. "Each jar of honey we sell represents a colony that was rescued, a family that was educated about pollinators, and a community that's becoming more aware of how important bees really are."  From Rescue to Retail  Unlike mass-produced honey that is often blended, heated, or filtered to the point of losing its nutritional value, Mega Bee Honey is the real deal: 100 percent raw, local honey, unfiltered, unpasteurized, and never diluted.  The bees that produce it have been relocated from unsafe or unwanted areas such as walls, soffits, tree hollows, and other structures, and given a second chance in carefully managed apiaries across the region. Once stabilized, these hives contribute to South Florida's ecosystem by pollinating local plants and producing small-batch honey harvested with care. Navarro emphasized that quality and intention are at the core of the product.  "This isn't just honey, it's a story in a jar," he said. "It's the result of hard work, long days of safely removing hives, and nights spent tending to apiaries. Every spoonful reflects our values and our mission."  A Community-Driven Passion Project  For years, customers and supporters of Mega Bee Pest Control and Rescues had asked if the couple ever planned to sell their own honey. The answer was always "maybe one day." That day, it turns out, came sooner than expected.  "As our work rescuing and relocating bees grew, so did our commitment to creating something bigger," said Navarro. "We had more hives, more people reaching out, and more community engagement. Honey became a natural byproduct of that effort."  To the couple, launching Mega Bee Honey is about more than creating a product, it is about creating impact.  "Our goal isn't to compete with large honey brands," Angulo Perez said. "We're here to offer something meaningful, both in quality and in purpose. People want to support local businesses, and they want to know where their food comes from. We're proud to give them that option."  Expanding the Mega Bee Ecosystem  Mega Bee Honey is more than a product. It is a strategic expansion that brings deeper meaning to the couple's existing business ecosystem. Together, Mega Bee Rescues, Mega Bee Pest Control, and now Mega Bee Honey form a holistic approach to pollinator protection and environmental stewardship.  Where one branch rescues bees and another handles pests with care, this newest branch delivers the tangible result of their efforts, a product people can taste, trust, and feel good about.  The couple also plans to use the honey to support future educational programs, community workshops, and school visits to raise awareness about the importance of bees and pollinator conservation.  "Our long-term vision includes more than selling honey," said Navarro. "We want to create a ripple effect, help more bees, educate more people, and show that business can be done with heart and purpose."  Where to Buy  Mega Bee Honey is now available for purchase directly through the company's website and at select farmers markets in Miami and Broward. Initial quantities are limited, with a focus on small-batch quality over mass distribution.  Customers can expect seasonal variations in taste, color, and texture based on the flowers the bees visit, further proof that this is a natural, local product unspoiled by industrial processing.  "We don't interfere with nature," said Angulo Perez. "We honor it, and we're grateful to the bees for everything they give us."  About Mega Bee Pest Control and Rescues  Founded by Jean Navarro, Mega Bee is a South Florida-based, family-owned business focused on pollinator protection, eco-friendly pest solutions, and sustainable beekeeping. What began as a bee rescue service has grown into a multifaceted operation committed to nature, education, and community.
