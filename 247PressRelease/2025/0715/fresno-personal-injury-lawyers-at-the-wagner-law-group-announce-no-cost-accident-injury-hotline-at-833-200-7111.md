FRESNO, CA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fresno personal injury lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been helping accident victims for over 30 years. They now have a No Cost Accident & Injury Hotline at (833) 200-7111. Anyone who wants information about what to do after being injured can call the hotline to learn about how to better understand their legal rights and whether or not there is a path to monetary compensation. "We encourage people to call who have been injured as the result of any type of accident involving cars, trucks, big rigs, motorcycles, bikes, boats, ATV's or any type of accident where it feels like it's somebody else's fault," says Aaron of The Wagner Law Group.  In addition to being a personal injury law firm The Wagner Law Group also has experienced Fresno Auto Accident Lawyers. "We have been representing car accident victims in Fresno, Clovis, Visalia, Merced and surrounding areas for over 30 years. We see a lot of accidents on I-5, HWY 99 and local roadways all the time. In many situations victims go uncompensated when compensation is justified to make the person whole," says Butch Wagner, Founder of The Wagner Law Group.  In some very unfortunate and tragic situations the victim or victims don't survive. The Wagner Law Group has experienced Fresno Wrongful Death attorneys on staff who are available around the clock to answer questions from family members who have suffered a tragic loss and are seeking advice about the legal options available to them. "We advise families who have lost loved ones due to unforeseen circumstances where another party is to blame to call us immediately to get the best advice available from our experienced wrongful death attorneys by calling (833) 200-7111 now," says Aaron.  There are many ways people experience injustices. Personal injury and accidents leading to serious injuries or death is one way but another is sexual misconduct. Whether it's in the workplace or at a business without proper protection or a government building or facility it doesn't matter, people are supposed to be protected from sex abuse. The experienced Sex Abuse Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have won hundreds of millions of dollars for accident and sexual abuse victims. "We are a premier firm when it comes to representing people who have been sexually abused. Our results speak for themselves," says Butch.  One of the most notable sex abuse situations The Wagner Law Group has been involved in is the rampant sexual abuse that occurred in a local federal prison for women. The FCI Dublin Sex Abuse Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been instrumental in helping women receive compensation for the atrocities that occurred at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California. Over 116 million dollars has already been awarded to over 100 women so far and there are likely many more victims.   FCI Dublin Prison Sexual Abuse Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group advise any person who suffered sex abuse at the women's prison in Dublin to call the No Cost Accident & Injury Hotline at (833) 200-7111 now to learn about how they might be able to help. "The FCI Dublin prison was called The Rape Club by many people in the local community, victims, employees of the prison and the media. Given the widespread abuse and punishments going all the way up the ladder to the Warden this is a situation that warrants maximum compensation to victims," says Butch Wagner.  In addition to being injury and sex abuse attorneys The Wagner Law Group is the premier Fire Attorney in California. Wildfires burn more than land—they uproot lives, devastate communities, and leave victims with unfathomable loss. And as the flames of the Eaton Fire in California scorch homes, livelihoods, and hope, it is no exception. You're in the right place if you're looking for answers and support after this disaster. The Wagner Law Group's Eaton fire lawyers can help victims. Call us at (626) 310-3796 or contact us online for a consultation today.
