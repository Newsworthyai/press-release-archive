HONG KONG, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mango AI, a powerful AI video generator developed by Mango Animate, has launched a playful, innovative singing animals tool that brings static pet photos to life. This feature transforms animal images into animated characters that sing in sync with uploaded audio, opening up creative possibilities for content creators in entertainment, social media, and marketing.  Users simply upload a pet photo along with a music file or voice recording, and Mango AI generates a realistic singing animation within minutes. Powered by advanced facial animation and voice synchronization technology, the singing animals tool maps facial points on animal photos and animates mouth movements to match any recorded audio.   An outstanding feature of the tool is the variety of singing styles available, including natural, operatic, innocent, passionate, soulful, and joyful. These styles help give each pet a unique character, mood, and personality. Additionally, pose scale and lip scale controls empower users to adjust body movement and mouth animation, enabling fine-tuning of the animation to match different moods and creative goals.  Since no installation is required, the singing animals tool enables users to create videos directly from a web browser. Its fast creation process, multi-format export options, and user-friendly controls make it accessible to users of all skill levels. Completed videos can be instantly shared across platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and websites.  In addition to singing animals, Mango AI also offers a talking animals tool that makes animals talk naturally and vividly. Users can upload a pet photo and input a text script, and Mango AI generates a lifelike talking animation with the animal speaking the words. This intuitive tool provides a fun and engaging way to create personalized animal videos.
