# ThreeNH Launches YL3160 Non-Contact Spectrophotometer

SHENZHEN, CHINA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A global innovation leader in instruments and optical devices, ThreeNH has announced the launch of YL3160 Non-Contact Spectrophotometer. This non-contact, omnidirectional sensor is designed for industrial purposes, but far outperforms expectations by measuring color in real time with smart manufacturing systems that demand a high level of cleanliness and automation.   Introduction to the Product and the Importance of Its Launch Today's industry trends highlight the problem of overuse, calling for higher rates of automation, tighter quality control, and increased production rates. Issues posed by traditional contact-based color measurement techniques like contamination, sample damage, and time-consuming processing add to this problem. These concerns, along with many others, is what the design goals of the YL3160 aim to solve.   Features integrated into design of YL3160 from the user's perspective provide a myriad of benefits, ensuring user satisfaction.  Reflection spectrum and chromaticity data in real-time ensures that color consistency of the product meets global reflection spectrum data reliability threshold. This enhances competitiveness for any business.   Product Overview Integration of The YL3160 with industrial production lines and robotic systems makes automated, non-invasive seal supervision possible, thus providing inline color measurement technology. Moreover, automated robotic systems enable accurate and automated monitoring of color during the production process. Multiple data output interfaces together with intelligent environmental compensation enhance reliability and device robustness under countless factory conditions.   In addition, YL3160's sleek probe design coupled with IP66 protective rating against water and dust, allows for flexibility in installation making it suitable for rigorous industrial environments.   Key Features and Innovations • 256-Pixel Dual-Array CMOS Image Sensor: Gathers spectral data with high precision.  • UV and Full-Spectrum LED Light Source: Broadens color rendition and reproducibility value.  • Measurement Frequency: Capable of measuring above one million times in 24 hours, with each measurement taking less than fifty milliseconds.  • Optical Resolution: Reflective and color differences are measured with high precision.  • Industrial Protection Level IP66: Protection from dust, water, and other harsh industrial elements. • Humidity and Temperature Compensation: Accuracy in measurement does not depend on external factors.   Advantages of Non-Contact Measurement  • Sample Integrity: With no interaction with the sample, contamination and damage does not occur. • Contact with the sample is safe for a wider range of substances, including soft corrosive fluids, pastes, powders, and even soft solids.  • Avoids cross-contamination for rigid hygiene industries including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food.  • No restrictions on the sample dimension, thickness, or texture of the surface.  Industry Applications With the accuracy of YL3160 and its non-contact technology, it is suitable for many industries, for example: • Supervising real-time tint blending during mixing or applying for the Paints and Coatings industry.  • Manufacturing cosmetics such as creams or powders which are sensitive to contamination.  • In food processing, ensuring consistent color quality in sauces, condiments, and baked goods.  • Monitoring and measuring the color of fabrics during production in the textile and dyeing industries.  • Performing clean and precise tests on tablets and liquids in pharmaceuticals.  • Uniformity of finishes on electronic and plastic components.  • Precise measurement for the safe preservation of delicate or rare cultural materials. The YL3160 provides accurate color measurements seamlessly whether the material is solid, liquid, powder, or irregular.  Executive Quote An executive from ThreeNH remarked, "Our vision was to create a measurement solution that doesn't just keep up with industrial demands but leads the way." Given the precedents we set with the YL3160, barriers of physical contact and contamination no longer exist; hence, it is a smart, high-speed, and reliable system trusted by industries across the globe."   Market Impact and Vision The YL3160 offers smart control and monitoring systems which respond sharply to market demand. As manufacturers strive to modernize their ecosystems to Industry 4.0 standards, the collection of real-time data necessitates limited human contact. Upholding hygiene standards while minimizing human error, the YL3160 excels in fast-paced production environments, cutting waste, improving consistency, and maximizing efficiency.  The YL3160 also aligns with ThreeNH's vision of color measurement technology by making it smarter, cleaner, and more interconnected, thus paving the way for automated quality control spanning entire industries.
