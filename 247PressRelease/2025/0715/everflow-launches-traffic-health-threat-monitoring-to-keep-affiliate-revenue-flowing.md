# Everflow Launches Traffic Health: Threat Monitoring To Keep Affiliate Revenue Flowing

MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Everflow, recently named by mThink as the #1 partner marketing platform for 2025, today announced a major platform advancement with the debut of Traffic Health, the first of its kind domain health and IP blacklists monitoring tool enabling businesses to protect against common security threats that negatively impact affiliate marketing performance.   Backed by Google Threat Intelligence, Traffic Health actively detects domain security issues to ensure website traffic stays safe, visible, and optimized. The robust suite of Traffic Health tools includes ad-blocker list detection, SSL monitoring, and real-time alerts, all accessible through an intuitive dashboard within the Everflow platform, providing a centralized view of domain health alongside regular affiliate traffic data.  "Traffic Health is about protecting what matters most, your revenue and your reputation," said Sam Darawish, CEO and Co-Founder of Everflow. "By combining real-time domain monitoring with Google-scale threat intelligence, we're putting domain health in the customer's hands with the tools they need to spot issues early, act fast, and keep their traffic running without disruption."  The introduction of Traffic Health marks an important step forward in preserving the integrity of tracking, conversion rates, and revenue streams within the Everflow platform. Thoughtfully designed to give businesses direct control over domain health, the intelligent threat monitoring tool represents more than a year of customer research exploring the top pain points around lost traffic, revenue, and partner trust.   In one case, an Everflow customer unknowingly lost 10 days of mobile traffic due to a blocked domain by Verizon USA, an incident Traffic Health would have flagged instantly. In yet another, an advertiser spent days investigating ad blocker-related issues that Traffic Health's EasyList integration could have identified in real time. One top-performing affiliate even paused campaigns for several months after a customer IP was blacklisted, something Traffic Health would have surfaced immediately to preserve momentum and trust.  "This centralized solution provides a single place to manage all your domains, SSL certificates, and IPs," explained Arshi Bhasin, Product Manager at Everflow. "You can see everything at a glance, track domain uptime, and share important information with your team and partners, helping prevent issues before they happen."  Traffic Health reflects Everflow's commitment to digital innovation in an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. With preventative monitoring and proactive alerts, the new tool empowers brands to stay ahead of blacklisting, conversion loss, and partner disruptions, protecting performance and revenue at every level.  Traffic Health joins an expanding lineup of high-value enhancements focused on transparency, automation, and loss prevention, including Everflow Pay and Flowchart Visualization, all inspired by the growing needs of businesses to streamline, simplify, and safeguard affiliate marketing performance.
