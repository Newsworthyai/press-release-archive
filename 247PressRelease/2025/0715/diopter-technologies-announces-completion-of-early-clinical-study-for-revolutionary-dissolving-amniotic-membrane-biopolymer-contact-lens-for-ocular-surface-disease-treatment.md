# Diopter Technologies Announces Completion of Early Clinical Study for Revolutionary Dissolving Amniotic Membrane Biopolymer Contact Lens for Ocular Surface Disease Treatment

CAMBRIDGE, MA, July 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Diopter Technologies today announced the completion of early clinical studies of its innovative dissolving amniotic membrane and biopolymer contact lens, a first-of-its-kind therapeutic device designed to treat ocular surface diseases including dry eye syndrome, corneal trauma injuries, and post-surgical wounds. The biocompatible lens releases growth factors from amniotic-derived materials while gradually dissolving over 48-72 hours, eliminating the need for clinical removal.  Key Technology Features: • Sustained Growth Factor Release: Leverages amniotic membrane components shown to reduce scarring and inflammation while promoting epithelial regeneration  • Self-Dissolving Design: Biopolymer matrix dissolves completely within 2-3 days, avoiding removal procedures that risk disrupting healing tissues  • Enhanced Bioavailability: Both the amnion and co-polymer deliver growth factors to the ocular surface in a synergistic fashion  • Study Results: The initial successful clinical study had no reports of advent events and the device increased patient comfort over the continuous wear period of 48 hours versus standard silicon hydrogel lenses   "Unlike traditional bandage lenses that merely protect the eye, our device actively delivers healing factors exactly where and when they're needed," said Chris Adams, CEO of Diopter Technologies. "By combining amniotic and resorbable biomaterials we're transforming ocular surface rehabilitation from passive coverage to intelligent tissue remodeling."  The device is currently undergoing clinical studies for multiple indications, with preliminary data suggesting promise for the billion-dollar market opportunities: 1. Chemical/thermal injury recovery (reducing neovascularization risk) 2. Post-refractive surgery care (addressing PRK-associated haze) 3. Chronic dry eye management (providing continuous surface hydration)  Diopter plans to launch the product in Q1 2026 following completion of ongoing human trials and submission of FDA 510K application. The technology represents a strategic expansion of the company's ocular drug delivery portfolio, which previously demonstrated nine-day intraocular pressure control from a single 50-hour lens wear period in glaucoma models.  A pioneer in ocular therapeutic delivery systems, Diopter Technologies develops bio integrated solutions that merge advanced materials science with clinical ophthalmology. Founded in 2018 the company holds multiple patents covering biomimetic drug-eluting platforms.
