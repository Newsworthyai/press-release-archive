# Crash to Composure: What to Do After an Auto Accident – Guidance from Maho &amp; Prentice, LLP

SANTA BARBARA, CA, December 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For drivers and passengers, an auto accident can trigger more than just shock—it often ushers in pain, medical bills, insurance complexities, and legal questions. Recognizing the urgency of knowing what to do next, the experienced personal-injury team at Maho & Prentice, LLP is issuing this proactive public guide to help individuals transform confusion into clarity after a collision.  "In the moments following an accident, you're often overwhelmed. Having a clear plan helps protect your health, your rights, and your ability to recover," Founder Tyrone Maho noted.  At Maho & Prentice, the attorneys bring decades of combined litigation experience and a reputation for achieving millions in recoveries for clients across Southern California. Having helped the injured in all varieties of motor vehicle accidents, including pedestrians struck by vehicles, the firm knows how critical the immediate moments and decisions after an accident are for protecting both health and legal rights.  1. Prioritize Safety and Documentation As soon as first responders are dispatched, focus on getting everyone to a safe place and calling for help if anyone is injured. But don't stop there: if you are physically able and it's safe to do so, take photographs and video of the scene—the damage to all vehicles, skid marks, road conditions, signage, and surroundings. Pieces of evidence like this can later help reconstruct how the accident happened and who may be liable.  2. Watch Your Words at the Scene It can be tempting to say "I'm sorry" or assume fault, but words matter. Admitting responsibility or making comments that may be construed as concessions could jeopardize your ability to recover compensation. It's wise to politely state factual information, exchange insurance and contact details, and let your legal team handle further communications with insurers.  3. Seek Medical Attention – Even If You Feel Fine Some injuries don't manifest immediately; whiplash, concussions, spinal trauma, or internal injuries may evolve over hours or days. Visiting a physician promptly establishes a medical record and may protect your rights. Your health is the top priority; your legal case is important too, but don't let recovery wait.  4. Consult a Qualified Auto Accident Attorney Early If another driver's negligence caused the accident—even if you were partially responsible—you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages, vehicle damage, and pain and suffering. Maho & Prentice takes these cases on a contingency-fee basis, so you don't pay unless the firm succeeds. Early engagement lets your attorney collect vital evidence, handle insurers, and help you understand your rights under laws like California's "pure comparative negligence" framework.  5. Understand Your Legal Timeline Time is not endlessly on your side. In most car-accident injury cases in California, you've got two years from the date of the incident to file a lawsuit. For crashes involving governmental entities, deadlines may be shorter. Delaying can jeopardize your claim and recovery prospects.
