# Body Routers Fitness Joins the Fight for Lung Health at the Fight For Air Climb Miami on March 9

MIAMI, FL, March 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Body Routers Fitness is gearing up to climb, breathe, and fight alongside the American Lung Association at the Fight For Air Climb Miami at loanDepot park this Sunday, March 9.   Dedicated to pushing physical and mental limits, Body Routers Fitness is once again at the forefront of this high-energy event, raising critical funds for lifesaving research, lung disease prevention, and advocacy efforts.   A Mission of Strength and Impact  "We're bringing back our energy and passion for a cause that truly matters," said Coach Ray Irizarry, founder of Body Routers Fitness, team captain, and event emcee. "The American Lung Association's mission is personal to me. Every year, we push harder—not just physically, but in fundraising—to support those fighting to breathe."   Body Routers Fitness has consistently ranked among the event's top-performing teams, with members regularly placing in the top three overall. This year's standout climbers include Karina Arredondo-Irizarry, Rebecca Christina, and Josue Lopez, and Coach Ray who both placed top three in their previous climbs. Team Body Routers is making history this year, proudly representing with an impressive 40 climbers—their largest turnout yet and a fundraising record in the making.   This year's climb also features Lt. Jeanette Harrington, a Miami-Dade Fire Rescue firefighter and paramedic who has been a dedicated supporter of the Lung Association for nearly a decade. She began climbing in memory of her best friend's mother, who passed away from emphysema, and has since dedicated each climb to someone affected by lung disease. Now, Lt. Harrington is on a mission to surpass $100,000 in lifetime fundraising, earning her recognition as the Lung Association's top fundraising firefighter in the nation. If you wish to donate to Lt. Harrington's cause, click here.   A Shared Commitment to the Cause  In honor of Harrington's commitment, she has been named an honorary lifetime member of Body Routers Fitness, recognized for exemplifying the values of dedication, resilience, and community service.   "Fighting for air is about more than fundraising—it's about standing with those who struggle to breathe every day," said Irizarry. "Lt. Harrington is a force of nature, and climbing alongside her is an honor."   "This fight is deeply personal," said Lt. Harrington. "Every step I take is for someone who can't, and every dollar raised brings us closer to a future where lung disease no longer steals lives. I'm grateful to have supporters like Coach Ray by my side—we're stronger together."   Fundraising for a Cause  Body Routers Fitness is once again among the top fundraising teams, aiming to raise $10,000—and they're more than halfway there! Supporters can donate here to help them cross the finish line. Climbers who raise $1,000 or more earn a coveted spot in the Summit Club, a testament to their dedication—not only to physical endurance but to the mission behind the climb.   With just one week remaining, climbers still have time to elevate their fundraising. Leading the charge are Veronica Camus, Cristina Gonzalez, Nina Gonzalez, Ashley Ramos, Velia Salgado, and Maggie Espin-Christina, whose efforts are inspiring others to step up and contribute.
