ATLANTA, GA, August 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It's Back To School season, and The Dairy Alliance, a leader in the dairy industry in raising awareness about the nutritional advantages of real dairy, helps families power up for the new academic year with high-protein meals. Working alongside dairy farmers across the Southeast, The Dairy Alliance offers quick, nutritious recipes that keep kids energized throughout the day. These easy-to-make meals cover breakfast, lunch, snack time, and even on-the-go options.   "The school year often creates added stress for families as routines shift and calendars fill up. That's why we provide a variety of delicious, nutrient-rich meals that work for packed lunches or quick breakfasts," Laura Buxenbaum, VP of Health and Wellness at The Dairy Alliance. "When families include real dairy in recipes, kids benefit from a high-protein powerhouse food that fuels their growing and active bodies. Alongside protein, real dairy delivers calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus, which are all key nutrients for strong bones."   The Dairy Alliance website features a variety of recipes that don't require a lot of time or ingredients but are full of flavor. For example, the Chicken Pesto Wrap features just three ingredients, while the Low-Lactose Garden Egg Bites are protein-forward and portable. For fun, engaging kid-friendly snacks, serve up fresh fruit and dip or grand slam snack mix. And don't forget convenient grab-and-go snacks that feature real dairy including favorites like string cheese, yogurt, smoothies, and milk chugs that are available at local grocery and convenience stores.   "There a number of ways to make real dairy milk part of meal time at school, work, or home. Some of our recipes and tips are simple enough that kids can help with the prep, adding to the fun family time in the kitchen," added Buxenbaum.
