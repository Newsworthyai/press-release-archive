SAN DIEGO, CA, August 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mainly Mozart – the San Diego nonprofit behind the highly acclaimed Mainly Mozart All-Star Orchestra Festival – is honored to announce Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA, Professor, President and CEO of La Jolla Institute for Immunology, is the 2025 San Diego Genius Award honoree. Dr. Sapphire will be recognized Oct. 18 at the Genius Awards Dinner at the Westgate Hotel. Tickets are available now at mainlymozart.org/genius.   Since 2015, the Genius Award has celebrated extraordinary individuals whose contributions span science, technology, and the arts, enrich the community, and embody "Genius in the Spirit of Mozart." Saphire joins past recipients Dr. Irwin Jacobs (2015), Dr. Andrew Viterbi (2016), Dr. Walter Munk (2017), Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn (2018), Chancellor Pradeep Khosla (2019), Susan Tousi (2022), Dr. David Brenner (2023), and Dr. Al Pisano (2024). This year's Genius Award Selection Committee members included Martha Dennis (chair), Steve Hart (chair), Irwin Jacobs, Joel Buxbaum, and David Brenner.  Dr. Saphire's pioneering research at La Jolla Institute for Immunology has unraveled the molecular mechanisms by which viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and SARS-CoV-2 infect human cells and evade immune defenses. Under her leadership, teams have solved the high-resolution structures of multiple viral glycoproteins, guided global vaccine design efforts, and spearheaded the collaborative consortia—including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation–supported CoVIC initiative and the NIAID Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium—that united scientists across five continents in life-saving immunotherapeutic research, closing the critical gap between scientific breakthroughs and real-world medical interventions. Recognizing another crucial research gap, Dr. Saphire recently launched a groundbreaking institute-wide initiative focused on uncovering sex-based differences in the immune system.  Dr. Saphire's work has been recognized at the White House with the Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering, with young investigator awards from the International Congress of Antiviral Research, the American Society for Microbiology, the MRC Centre for Virus Research in the United Kingdom, and the California Life Sciences Pantheon Award for Academia and Marion Spencer Fay Award. She has been awarded a Fulbright Global Scholar fellowship from the United States Department of State and a Mercator Fellowship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, to develop international collaborations using cryoelectron microscopy to further global health.  "Erica Saphire's groundbreaking work exemplifies the ingenuity and collaborative ethos that the Genius Award honors," said Mainly Mozart Founding CEO Nancy Laturno. "Her tireless dedication to understanding and combating viral pathogens has not only advanced science but has also had a profound global health impact."
