# Exit Factor Announces Second Quarter Milestones, Launches Affiliate Program and Expands Corporate Team to Support Continued Growth

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, August 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exit Factor, the leading franchise in business value enhancement and exit planning, has announced a series of brand updates that underscore the company's continued momentum and strategic investment in long-term growth. Highlights from the second quarter include new franchise deals, the launch of Exit Factor's highly anticipated affiliate program, and the expansion of its corporate marketing team.  The company, part of the United Franchise Group (UFG) family of affiliated brands and consultants, continues to see strong demand for its services across the U.S. as business owners seek to increase their company's value and plan successful exits.  Exit Factor sold 29 new territories in Q2 2025, with new territories awarded in Indiana, North Carolina, and Ohio, further strengthening its national footprint. The company's Q2 performance follows a robust first quarter and reflects the growing interest in value enhancement and exit planning services.  "As demand continues to rise, we remain focused on delivering best-in-class support and creating multiple pathways for entrepreneurs and advisors to engage with the Exit Factor brand," said Jessica Fialkovich, founder and president of Exit Factor. "Our second-quarter growth highlights the strength of our model and the increasing recognition of our value proposition nationwide."  To further extend its reach and impact, Exit Factor officially launched its affiliate program in Q2. Designed to complement the franchise offering, the program allows professionals in adjacent industries—such as accounting, wealth management, and business brokerage—to earn referral revenue and tap into Exit Factor's training and resources.   In addition to its franchise and affiliate growth, Exit Factor has expanded its corporate marketing team to support its increasing network of franchisees and broader brand-building initiatives. The company recently hired Arielle DoOuteiro, Marketing Coordinator, who will play a key role in digital strategy, content development, and national campaign execution.  Exit Factor's comprehensive suite of services includes business valuation, value enhancement strategies, exit planning, and succession planning. The company's track record of helping business owners increase their company's value and achieve successful exits has made it a trusted name in the industry.
