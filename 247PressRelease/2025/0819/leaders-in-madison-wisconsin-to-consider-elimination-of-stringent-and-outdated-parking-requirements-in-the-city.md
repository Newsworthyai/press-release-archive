# Leaders in Madison, Wisconsin to Consider Elimination of Stringent and Outdated Parking Requirements in the City

HALTOM CITY, TX, August 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Like many other U.S. cities, downtown Madison lays claim to large expanses of parking spaces. Credit for this goes directly to the existence of burdensome zoning regulations containing minimum parking requirements, which city lawmakers are reconsidering this year.  It wasn't always like this; back in the early 20th century when people first started driving cars in cities, parking really wasn't an issue. Fast forward to the 1950s, when more people were driving cars, which meant parking became a consideration by necessity.  Several years ago, the city of Madison removed parking mandates downtown, but left the rest of the city struggling with the old parking requirements. Commercial uses vary; for the most part, the requirements are based on square footage and number of employees. For restaurants, parking requirements are 15 percent of the business's total capacity, so it's essentially based on the number of seats. And most of Madison's residential neighborhoods require one off-street parking spot for every dwelling unit.   If it sounds burdensome, you're right â€“ it is. According to Strong Towns, there are between 800 million and two billion parking places in the United States. Even worse, there are between 3-8 parking spots for every registered vehicle. Parking lots alone cover more than five percent of all urban land in the country, which adds up to an area larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.  When you consider construction costs, the figures are astonishing. A parking garage with an underground level can cost $40,000 or more per space. Even a single-surface parking spot can cost $10,000 to construct. And these figures likely are higher, as they don't include long-term upkeep and maintenance expenses.  If a municipality prioritizes parking by enabling stringent parking requirements, it also serves to encourage driving to that area. There are multiple downfalls to that, including air quality problems due to increased exhaust and pollution, which results in higher carbon emissions. More drivers also translates to a greater number of hazards for pedestrians and cyclists.  Eliminating costly parking mandates would not only save local businesses money, it would help boost the availability of affordable housing. And that's certainly something that Haltom City could benefit from, according to Joe Palmer, communications director for Haltom United Business Alliance.   Palmer believes that like Madison, Haltom City needs to look into eliminating its cumbersome parking mandates, and has worked diligently to explain the myriad reasons why to Haltom City leaders.  "In Haltom City, removing the outdated zoning regulations would help rejuvenate the older parts of the city by reviving development," Palmer said. "These parking mandates are not just preventing development, they're costing the city money, and they're simply unnecessary."  That's why HUBA has recommended that Haltom City leaders establish an "Open Option Parking" system. This would let developers, homeowners and businesses choose the amount of onsite parking they need to provide, based on each individual operation or specific activity. HUBA is urging the city to adopt this setup in certain areas, which would mean eliminating parking minimums in the city's south and central areas, such as Denton Highway, and Carson, Belknap and Northeast 28th streets.  "Parking spots occupy space that could be put to far better use," Palmer said. "Most importantly, eliminating parking mandates would encourage more businesses to return to South and Central Haltom City," he added.  HUBA Founder Ron Sturgeon agrees, and is working diligently to encourage small businesses to return to Haltom City. Sturgeon knows that a thriving business community means greater employment, which translates to easing the tax burden on Haltom City residents. He also knows that burdensome parking regulations are hampering the efforts to bring prosperity back to the area.   "I firmly believe that parking mandates are the number one reason vacant properties can't get a tenant in Haltom City," Sturgeon said.  And it's not just Haltom City that needs to reconsider outdated zoning laws on parking. Across the country, more and more cities are getting rid of outdated and burdensome parking minimums that stand in the way of growth and progress. Just look at Austin, Texas, where city council members approved an amendment eliminating parking minimums for most types of real estate, including homes, apartments, stores and restaurants. That means decisions about the amount of space allocated for parking are left up to owners, not the city.  In 2024, Spokane became the largest city in Washington state to abolish parking mandates. In 2023, the city passed an ordinance that made parking optional for housing located within a half-mile of a public transit stop. According to proponents, the 2024 reforms will serve to better enable transit-based development and walkable neighborhoods, in addition to ensuring new housing availability.  If Haltom City leaders removed existing parking mandates, developers would no longer be required to follow rigid and costly parking space requirements. This would serve to encourage redevelopment, resulting in the return of small businesses to the area.  About Haltom City Haltom City is a diverse, majority working-class city located between Dallas and Fort Worth in Tarrant County, TX. Haltom City is minutes from both the DFW Airport and Downtown Fort Worth with direct access to major highways including I-820 and SH-121. Due to an outdated and restrictive use matrix that discourages new business and deters growth, several areas of Haltom City have seen a decline in small businesses that provided goods and services and were a significant source of jobs, including the once-thriving automotive industry. However, Haltom City can reverse this trend and should prioAbouritize development of inner-city land and vacant buildings, particularly in the major corridors close to the city's center. The city is financially healthy, with a capable manager and staff who would like to see diverse business development occur, and need the support of the Haltom City Council to make it happen.  About Haltom United Business Alliance Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) wants to give members of Haltom City's business community an advocate and to keep those businesses informed about issues that affect them. They want to make sure Haltom City is business friendly and nurtures small business growth, including automotive businesses in the industrial districts, and bring more restaurants including breweries and eventually a major grocery store to the city. New businesses and growth in existing businesses will create a stronger tax base which will allow the city to pay its first responders wages that are competitive with surrounding cities while improving Haltom City's facilities and infrastructure. HUBA believes that the southern and central parts of the city need a revitalization plan, to prevent further degradation in those areas, and wants that to happen before the inner-city experiences increased crime and more blight. As retail and office uses are in decline, it's more critical than ever to attract new businesses. They believe that such a plan requires a strong relationship and support of the business community. Anyone who owns a business in Haltom City is eligible to join HUBA. Dues are $20 annually or $50 for a lifetime membership, and membership is 100% confidential. To join, contact Joe Palmer at (682) 310-0591 or by email at HUBAgrp@gmail.com. Visit the group's Facebook at Haltom United Business Alliance.
