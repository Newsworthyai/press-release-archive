BENBROOK, TX, August 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Licensed Esthetician Samira Sabek proudly announces the opening of Mira Skin & Wax Studio, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Benbrook in Benbrook, Texas.   Sabek picked up her skills in school, from online learning, and while working at a med spa. Becoming an esthetician was a natural choice for Sabek, who has been in the industry for about 18 months and enjoys every minute of her career.  "I went into this business because I love all things beauty," Sabek said. "I love making people feel beautiful and confident in their own skin. That's why I'm passionate about helping my clients look and feel their absolute best," she added.  To provide top-of-the-line service, Sabek makes it her primary goal to understand her clients' unique needs and preferences, and will work with them to create personalized treatment plans that deliver results.  "At Mira Skin and Wax Studio, I believe that beauty comes from within," Sabek said. "I use only the highest quality products and techniques to help my clients achieve their beauty goals."   Sabek offers a wide range of services to help her customers feel and look their best. From facials and body treatments to waxing services, Mira Skin & Wax Studio's services are designed to promote relaxation, rejuvenation, and overall wellness.  The "Glow on the Go" is a 35-minute express facial that provides a deep cleanse. It comes with a choice of exfoliation, light extractions, or mask, depending on skin concerns. The "Classic Skin Reset" is a 60-minute skin reset that includes a deep cleanse, exfoliation, steam, and extractions if needed to clear pores. Enjoy a soothing facial massage and a mask tailored to your skin type. The Dermaplane Facial treatment uses a gentle blade to exfoliate dead skin cells and remove fine facial hair, leaving skin ultra-smooth and radiant. It includes cleansing, dermaplaning, a soothing mask, and hydrating skincare products to calm and nourish skin.  Sabek's Circadia Firming Peptide Mask treatment uses peptides and firming botanicals to tighten, tone, and brighten the skin. This treatment dramatically increases skin elasticity and visibly reduces wrinkles in the very first treatment.  For her waxing clients, Sabek uses gentle, high-quality wax to minimize discomfort and irritation, leaving skin soft and hair-free for weeks. A selection of waxing options is available for a smooth, clean finish, including the Brazilian wax service to remove hair from the bikini area. Other waxing choices include underarms; brows; upper lip; and chin.  Mira Skin & Wax Studio is currently accepting new clients. Appointments are required and can be made by calling or texting Sabek at (817) 559-7408.   To celebrate her studio's grand opening, Sabek is offering a couple of money-saving specials â€“ a free brow wax with any waxing service, and a 20-percent discount on facials for first-time clients.
