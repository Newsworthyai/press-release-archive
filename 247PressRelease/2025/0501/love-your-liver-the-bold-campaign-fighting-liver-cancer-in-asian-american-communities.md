# Love Your Liver: The Bold Campaign Fighting Liver Cancer in Asian American Communities

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This May, Blue Faery: The Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association proudly continues its award-winning Love Your Liver campaign, now in its fifth consecutive year. This life-saving, culturally tailored initiative raises awareness about liver cancer risk factors impacting Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.  Asian Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to be infected with chronic hepatitis B, the leading cause of liver cancer in this population. Foreign-born Asian Americans face even higher risks. The lack of early symptoms, coupled with language, stigma, and access barriers, makes liver cancer one of the most significant health disparities in this community.  "Education and prevention are our strongest tools," said Andrea Wilson Woods, founder of Blue Faery. "With culturally sensitive outreach, we're empowering AAPI individuals to take control of their liver health."  This year's campaign emphasizes prevention through preventive actions, such as hepatitis B vaccination, regular liver screenings, alcohol reduction, and dietary tips. Resources are offered in multiple languages to break down cultural and linguistic barriers.  Blue Faery will host "Love Your Liver Live" on May 8, 2025, at 4 p.m. PT, featuring liver cancer specialist Dr. Daneng Li. This free, online educational event will provide attendees with tools to better understand liver health, screening, and treatment. The event will be presented in both Chinese and English. Register here.  Blue Faery's mission is to prevent, treat, and cure primary liver cancer through research, education, and advocacy. Blue Faery hosts an online Liver Cancer Community for patients and caregivers. Blue Faery provides free comprehensive patient education with its Patient Resource Guides for Liver Cancer. Blue Faery has three public education and awareness programs: Love Your Liver, The Truth About Liver Cancer, and You and Liver Cancer.
