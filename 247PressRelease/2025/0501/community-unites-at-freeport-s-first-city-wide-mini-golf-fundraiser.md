# Community Unites at Freeport's First City-Wide Mini Golf Fundraiser

FREEPORT, IL, May 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Communication and Design Inc., The Freeport Club, and MAS Roofing, Siding and Decking Inc. presented a check for $2,360 to Friends Forever Humane Society, representing proceeds raised during Freeport's first annual Barstool Golf event. The successful community fundraiser, organized by the three local businesses, drew impressive participation from area residents.  The event, held on April 19th, transformed Freeport into a city-wide miniature golf course, attracting nearly 250 registered participants – more than double the anticipated turnout of 100.  "We're thrilled with how the community embraced this wildy fun event," said Ryan Lester, owner of Communication and Design Inc. "What began as a creative way to bring people together for a good cause exceeded our expectations in every way."  Barstool Golf featured nine participating venues across Freeport, each hosting a custom-designed miniature golf hole. Teams of four navigated through local establishments including The Freeport Club, Tony's, Big O's, The Royal Pub, Pretzel City Pub, Morts Bar and Grill, King's Bar and Grill, The Eagles Club, and Lucky Pines.  The day concluded with an after-party at The Freeport Club, where participants enjoyed playoffs, refreshments, and an awards ceremony. All proceeds from the $40 team registration fees directly benefited Friends Forever Humane Society.  "These funds will make a significant difference in our ability to care for animals in need throughout the Freeport area," said Carol, at Friends Forever Humane Society. "We're grateful to the organizers and everyone who participated in this imaginative fundraiser."  The three organizing businesses – Communication and Design Inc., The Freeport Club, and MAS Roofing, Siding and Decking Inc. – collaborated to create an event that highlighted local venues while raising money for an important community cause.  "The enthusiasm we saw from participants and venues alike was remarkable," added Mike Stingley, from MAS Roofing, Siding and Decking. "We're already looking forward to making next year's event even bigger and better."  Following the success of this inaugural event, organizers have announced plans to make Barstool Golf an annual tradition in Freeport, with hopes of increasing participation and fundraising goals in future years.
