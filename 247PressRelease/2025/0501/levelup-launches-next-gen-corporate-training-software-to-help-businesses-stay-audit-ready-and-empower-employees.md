# Levelup launches Next-Gen Corporate Training Software to Help Businesses Stay Audit-Ready and Empower Employees

TORONTO, ON, May 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Levelup, often known as 'world's simplest LMS', has recently announced that they have made significant changes to their platform to make their businesses stay audit-ready and empower employees through enhanced learning experiences.   Speaking about the upgrades, Glorya Cornelius-Aldrin, head of marketing at Levelup stated "At Levelup, it has always been our endeavor to deliver a better corporate training experience to both businesses and their employees. Our recent upgrades are a step forward in that direction and will surely help businesses achieve their learning outcomes.   How Advanced Tracking Will Help Businesses Stay Audit Ready   Businesses often need to track their corporate training performance for both internal and external audits. While most of the LMS training platforms do offer reporting and performance tracking features, they lack reporting features relevant for various auditing processes.   Levelup has tried to address the issue by aligning their tracking and reporting features to align with common auditing methodologies and standards. Their upgraded reporting features will also help administrators focus on KPIs that matter and track individual, team, and program performance in real time.   The company has stated that the new reporting features are currently live on the platform, and they can be used by new and existing users on different plans, including Levelup's ZERO Cost Plan.   How Levelup is Empowering Employees with a Range of New Features   Levelup's new upgrades not only focus on helping businesses achieve their training goals but also empower the trainees to make their training experience more wholesome.   The company announced several upgraded features that will help their trainees make corporate training programs more convenient and engaging for them.   Full Cloud Compatibility to Learn Anytime, Anywhere  Levelup is a completely cloud-based platform, which allows trainees to complete their programs, anytime, anywhere. Corporate trainees often had to take time out of their busy schedules to take part in classes in traditional training methods. Missing one class would have meant staying behind.   However, that is not the case with Levelup. With this platform, corporate trainees can learn at their own pace, setting their own schedules. Since Levelup is a completely cloud-based platform, they don't need advanced systems. This has reduced the cost of learning for both learners and trainees alike.   Introduction of the Levelup Learner App  Levelup has also introduced the learner app which allows learners who are already registered on the platform to access their courses and complete them on time.   Speaking about the app Cornelius-Aldrin said "We wanted to design an app that made corporate training more accessible to the learners, without compromising on quality. With the new learner app, people will get the opportunity to get the same experience that they got on the web platform, in a much more convenient way."   The app is available for iOS and Android devices. Levelup has pointed out that the Learner app can only be used by learners who are already registered. So, trainers and administrators will first need to register the learner on the web platform and then they will be able to use the features of the mobile app.   The company has stated that it is actively working on the feedback received from their existing users and from across the industry and developing new features. Levelup will continue to develop and evolve the platform to meet the learning needs of modern corporate trainees.
