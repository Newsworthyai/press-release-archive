# Seeds, skills, and supports: what determines farmers' climate resilience in South Asia

KNOXVILLE, TN, May 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers across South Asia. In this context, a new study conducted across transboundary regions of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh uncovers the critical factors that influence their ability to adapt. The study reveals that adaptive capacity (AC) depends on a combination of land access, financial resources, and community networks, and knowledge of climate-resilient agricultural practices. The findings show that, while each country faces unique challenges, shared barriers such as unreliable weather information, limited infrastructure, and financial constraints are holding back smallholder farmers. These insights provide a crucial foundation for shaping targeted adaptation policies and improving resilience in vulnerable farming communities.  South Asia, home to some of the vulnerable agricultural regions, is already experiencing the harsh impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures and erratic rainfall are particularly affecting the rain-fed farming systems in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, where over half of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. With unpredictable weather patterns and a steady decline in crop production, the need for effective climate adaptation is critical. However, smallholder farmers often living in remote areas with limited resources are the least equipped to cope with these challenges. Understanding what drives their ability to adapt is essential for developing policies that protect their livelihoods and ensure regional food security.  Published in the Journal of Geographical Sciences in February 2025, this study (DOI: 10.1007/s11442-025-2326-3), brings together researchers from Tribhuvan University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other regional institutions to examine the factors that shape the adaptive capacity (AC) of smallholder farmers in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Led by Prof. Prem Sagar Chapagain and Dr. Linshan Liu, the study offers an in-depth analysis of how farmers across these three countries cope with climate change. Their findings provide valuable insights for policymakers to create effective climate resilience strategies in South Asia.  To uncover what drives smallholder farmers' ability to adapt to climate change, the researchers conducted household surveys, focus groups, and interviews with 633 farming families across Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Using principal component analysis, they identified eight key principal factors (PFs) that together explain the variation in AC across the three countries. In Nepal, AC was strongly influenced by factors such as landholding size, participation in skill-development training, knowledge of improved seed varieties, and social network. In India, access to crop insurance, agricultural-input information, and the flexibility to shift planting schedules were prominent. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's farmers showed higher resilience when they had access to financial institutions, community support, and trustworthy weather forecasts. Common across all countries were barriers like limited access to timely and reliable weather data, inadequate infrastructure, and low participation in training programs. While nearly 90% of farmers in Bangladesh and Nepal reported were experiencing negative climate impacts, few had access to the resources needed to respond effectively. Notably, farmers who diversified their income sources or received remittances from abroad exhibited greater resilience highlighting the importance of financial security and flexibility in managing climate stress. These findings point to the need for targeted policies that address specific barriers, such as improving financial access and enhancing the availability of climate-resilient agricultural inputs.  Prof. Prem Sagar Chapagain, a leading researcher from Central Department of Geography, Tribhuvan University emphasized the importance of understanding the broader socio-economic contexts of farmers' adaptation efforts. This study shows that adaptation isn't just about access to resources, it's about the networks and systems in place to help farmers use those resources effectively. It's clear that farmers need more than just technical knowledge, they need access to financial services, better infrastructure, and reliable weather data, and gender role in framing to make informed decisions. These findings should guide national and regional policies aimed at increasing resilience.  The insights from this study have significant implications for both local and national policymakers. To strengthen farmers' resilience, governments must prioritize improving access to financial services, including crop insurance, and ensure better infrastructure, especially roads and weather stations. Providing farmers with timely, accurate weather data is crucial for effective decision-making, while expanding access to agricultural extension services can boost knowledge of climate-resilient farming practices. Additionally, supporting income diversification through rural development programs and remittances can help buffer the effects of climate shocks. Ultimately, addressing these systemic barriers will be essential for empowering farmers to adapt to the changing climate and secure their futures in the face of growing uncertainty.
