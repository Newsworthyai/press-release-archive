CHICAGO, IL, January 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Allison Perkins-Caldwell, a celebrated advocate for early childhood education, businesswoman, and community leader, is excited to announce the launch of her innovative 14-book children's series, Phat Cat and the Family. Aimed at readers of all ages, the series kicks off with its debut title, Phat Cat and the Family – Liver, Onions, and Apple Pie. Yummy!, now available in Kindle format.  Introducing Allison Perkins-Caldwell and Her Mission  Allison Perkins-Caldwell is the CEO and founder of several nationally accredited childcare centers, including Allison's Infant & Toddler Centers, University Childcare, and Baby Cakes Learning Academy. With over 20 years of experience as a leader in the field of early childhood education, she has devoted her career to fostering growth, advocacy, and development in children and families. Having made a significant impact in underserved communities through her dedication to high-quality education and childcare, Allison now extends her passion for education and child development into the world of children's literature.  Allison's experience as an educator and mother of four has inspired her to create books that not only entertain but also teach. Through her series Phat Cat and the Family, she hopes to encourage young readers to explore new ideas, embrace diversity, and foster a love for learning. The books offer moral lessons presented in a fun, accessible way, allowing children to reflect on life's everyday challenges and triumphs.  About the Series: A New Approach to Storytelling for All Ages  The Phat Cat and the Family series is designed to appeal to a broad range of ages, from early learners to independent readers. It introduces children to engaging narratives that are full of fun, friendship, and heartwarming moments, while also promoting critical thinking and positive values.  A key feature of the series is its adaptability. For younger children, the stories can be broken down into segments, allowing for group discussions, enhanced story retention, and opportunities to predict what might happen next. For independent readers, the series provides a rich, immersive experience that fosters attention and broadens perspectives. Each book concludes with a learning section, prompting reflection on the themes and encouraging young readers to connect the lessons of the stories with their own lives.  Book One: Phat Cat and the Family – Liver, Onions, and Apple Pie. Yummy! Introduces Tolerance and Open-Mindedness   In the debut title of the series, Phat Cat and the Family – Liver, Onions, and Apple Pie. Yummy!, readers join Allie, Phat Cat, and their family on a heartwarming adventure that teaches the importance of tolerance and open-mindedness, particularly when it comes to trying new foods. Allie's best friend, Nicky, is hesitant to step outside her comfort zone, but with a little encouragement from Allie and Phat Cat, she learns the value of being more open to new possibilities.  This first story is more than just about trying unfamiliar foods—it's a lesson about adaptability and adventurousness, qualities that are key to personal growth in all areas of life. The fun-filled narrative, combined with humorous moments of "entertaining mischief," makes it a perfect read for young children who are learning to embrace change and challenge their fears.  Upcoming Releases: Engaging and Inspiring Lessons for Every Reader Following the release of Phat Cat and the Family – Liver, Onions, and Apple Pie. Yummy!, readers can look forward to 13 more exciting adventures in the Phat Cat and the Family series. Each book will explore a new topic or life lesson, keeping the spirit of fun alive while instilling important values in young readers.   Each book in the series will include a unique learning section at the end, filled with questions and prompts to encourage critical thinking, making it an ideal resource for parents, teachers, and caregivers looking to spark conversations with children about the lessons they've learned.  About the Author: A Legacy of Leadership and Advocacy  In addition to being an author, Allison Perkins-Caldwell has built a remarkable career as a Registered Nurse, educator, and advocate for early childhood education. Her childcare centers have received numerous awards and accolades, including the prestigious NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) accreditation and the Gold Rating from the state of Illinois.
