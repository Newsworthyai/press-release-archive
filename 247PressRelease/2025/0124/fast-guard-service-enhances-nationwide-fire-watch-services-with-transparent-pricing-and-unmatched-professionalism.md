# Fast Guard Service Enhances Nationwide Fire Watch Services with Transparent Pricing and Unmatched Professionalism

CHARLOTTE, NC, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fast Guard Service has announced its commitment to providing transparent pricing for fire watch services across all 50 states. Fire watch services can be a complex and stressful responsibility for property managers and business owners to navigate. The process often begins with a fundamental question: What is a fire watch? This is followed by the challenge of identifying a reliable company to provide this critical service in a timely manner. Fast Guard Service recognizes these challenges and strives to simplify the process by offering clear guidance and reliable solutions.  What Is a Fire Watch?  A fire watch is a temporary service in which a licensed and trained professional monitors a building for fire hazards, acting as a human fire alarm and notifying the fire department if a fire is detected. Fire watch services are typically required when a building's fire protection system is non-operational. At Fast Guard Service, these duties are carried out by licensed and trained security guards from an insured and accredited security agency. The guards conduct patrols every 15 minutes and maintain detailed fire watch logs, recording dates, times, initials, and notes on any identified issues.  There is often a misconception that fire watch duties are simpler than those of a standard security guard. In reality, fire watch guards serve as the last line of defense in protecting lives and valuable assets. Any lapse in vigilance can have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, improperly completed fire watch logs can result in significant fines from fire marshals, costing businesses thousands of dollars and delaying necessary repairs.
