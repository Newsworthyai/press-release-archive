SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To find a truly inviting place for a quality lifestyle, make a visit to FivePoint Valencia. Here, thoughtful planning and advantages for all ages combine to create a backdrop for living well. Now, the people who make their homes here infuse Valencia's place-making concepts with the vibrant liveliness that makes a high-value community.  New Homes—Fresh, easy-living designs include single- and multi-level layouts, in detached and attached formats that optimize privacy, indoor/outdoor livability and view opportunities.   Patios, decks and courtyards enhance outdoor living, entertaining and leisure. Interior social spaces are inviting, kitchens are sleek and high-function, retreats are luxurious, and flex spaces optimize versatility now and as your household changes over time.   Offered in a wide range of designs and pricing, Valencia's homes attract young singles and couples, growing families, empty nesters and multi-gen households. This diversity promotes the friendly, neighborly dynamics of a small town, and the pedestrian network makes for a walkable environment that invites outdoor enjoyment.   Surroundings—Valencia's panoramic hillside site features vista views, and site planning weaves open spaces and diverse amenities to create a delightful indoor/outdoor community fabric, with optimized open space and protected trees and natural vegetation.   Exceptional amenities are within easy walking distance of most homes, and seating niches, small parks and trails for pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals invite you to enjoy your community without driving. Enticing lifestyle pleasures include award-winning Confluence Park, which combines outdoor expanses, a pool complex and easy connectivity to many other community points. Adventure Playground is tailored for kids and parents to enjoy.  "This place offers a vision for our children," said Candy and Tony Straight. "They are really enjoying their lives here, and of course that makes our lives better, too."  A culture of connection highlights the community. "When we toured new homes, we saw people out and about with their kids and dogs," noted two homeowners. "That's a happy sign for our son, our dog and any future children we add to the family."  Activity choices are as rich and varied as the homes, with great choices all year around, for homeowners, friends and new visitors. Earth Day festivities highlighted spring offerings and summertime featured "Friday Night Happenings" that combined live music with food and drinks. In October, "Fallencia" offered casual fun and refreshments tied to the changing season, while the holiday season featured delightful gatherings for all ages.   And every Sunday, the Valencia Farmers Market offers fresh, organic produce and artisan fare. Opened in August, the market is managed by California Farm Direct Markets' Larry McClements. Valencia's Farmers Market is held each Sunday and managed by California Farm Direct Markets, which also operates the Saturday Old Town Newhall and Wednesday Canyon Country Farmers Markets. The market draws from Valencia's surrounding areas for food products and ready to eat foods, with offerings sold by the growers, and is run by the company's Santa Clarita Valley-based team.  The market provides area residents with expanded choices for freshly harvested produce. Its grand opening was celebrated in late August, and response was enthusiastic from the start.   "I was so happy to see so many awesome vendors and having the ability to connect with neighbors and local businesses is truly special," said one homeowner. "This is the perfect add-on to our community!"  More activities are always in store, so check www.valencia.com and www.Facebook.com/ValenciaCalifornia for the latest doings.
