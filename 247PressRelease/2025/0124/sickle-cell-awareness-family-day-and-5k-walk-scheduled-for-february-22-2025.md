Understanding Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting red blood cells, causing them to assume a sickle shape. This condition primarily affects African American and Hispanic-American populations and can lead to severe complications, including chronic pain, organ damage, and increased risk of infections.  Research and healthcare advancements for SCD have been historically underfunded, partly due to systemic inequities such as structural racism and implicit bias. Events like the Sickle Cell Awareness Family Day and 5K Walk aim to address this disparity by raising awareness and fostering community action.  Join Us in Making a Difference This event is an opportunity to come together as a community, learn more about SCD, and support those affected by it. More details about the event and sponsors will be available soon at https://charity.pledgeit.org/sicklecellawareness5k.  We look forward to seeing you on February 22, 2025, as we walk, learn, and grow together!
