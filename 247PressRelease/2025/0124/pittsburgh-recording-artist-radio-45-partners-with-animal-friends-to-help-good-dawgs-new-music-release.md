PITTSBURGH, PA, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pittsburgh-based recording artist Radio 45 is set to release their new single, Good Dawg, inspired by the cherished pets many of us consider family. To celebrate the release, the band is teaming up with Pittsburgh's Animal Friends, aiming to help "Good Dawgs" (and other pets) find their forever homes.  This collaboration combines the joy of music with the mission of animal rescue, creating a heartfelt tribute to our furry companions while making a meaningful impact in the community.

His wife playfully sang to their dog, Marshall—a spirited 3-year-old micro-mini Labradoodle—saying, "Are you a good dog, are you a bad dog? Which one are you?"  That simple, spontaneous melody stuck with Greer throughout a half-hour drive, eventually sparking the creation of a song. But as the lyrics took shape, the song turned out not to be about a dog at all—it became a reflection of Greer's own life.  "Good Dawg" took three days—and ten years—to write. It captures a decade of disappointment, hurt, frustration, and resentment, drawn from personal challenges Greer faced during that period.  "Life is what you make of it," Greer explains passionately. "Even though I had (and have) so much to be happy about, I often found myself dwelling on the hurt and the joyless side of my situations. If you don't heal your wounds, you end up bleeding on those around you, especially the ones you love and who love you in return."  At its core, Good Dawg is about the everyday, good-hearted person fighting to stay positive when life becomes overwhelming. It's Greer's story, but it's also everyone's story—a testament to overcoming struggles and refusing to let them define us.  "I am a good dawg. I am a bad dawg. And so are you."  And so is "Marshy The Cute Pup" who you can follow on Instagram. @marshy.the.cute.pup  SINGLE RELEASE EVENTS: JANUARY 31 – FEBRUARY 18  In addition to partnering with Animal Friends, Radio 45 is teaming up with some of Pittsburgh's top rock promoters and venues to celebrate the release of their new single. With the support of regional promoters Fuzion Entertainment, CE Presents, and Drusky Entertainment, the band will host "single release party" events at the following locations:   - **Crafthouse Stage & Grill** – January 31  - **Hard Rock Cafe Pittsburgh** – February 11  - **Jergel's Rhythm Grille** – February 18   These events will feature performances by Radio 45 and their tribute "alter egos," alongside special guests Space Frehley and Noah Guisse.   In partnership with Animal Friends, each event will include a "giving tree" with hearts, photos of adoptable animals, and representatives on-site to answer questions and share adoption information. Don't miss the chance to celebrate great music and support a wonderful cause!  TRAGEDY MADE BETTER BY ANIMAL FRIENDS   Radio 45 founder C. Scott Gilbert endured heartbreak when a beloved kitten his family adopted from Georgia passed away unexpectedly after routine surgery. "I didn't even want to own a cat," Gilbert admitted, "but I fell in love with this charming little orange tabby we named Miss Maisel. She was so loving and had the sweetest disposition."   At just six months old, Miss Maisel tragically died due to complications following a routine spay surgery.  "We were heartbroken," Gilbert shared. "We had reconfigured our home to create a happy space for Miss Maisel—complete with Litter Robots, climbing poles, and 'Space Bubble' observation posts." After her loss, the empty space felt wrong. "It didn't seem right to let such a joyful place remain unused," Gilbert explained. "So, we reached out to Animal Friends to inquire about adopting a new kitty."  AN UNEXPECTED "DOUBLE TWIST"  "Animal Friends was wonderful and incredibly helpful," says Gilbert. Something unexpected then happened during their visit. "We were initially interested in one of two sister kittens we were spending time with at the Animal Friends campus," Gilbert recalls. "But I noticed that when the sisters were separated, one of the kittens seemed stressed and a little lost. Seeing this, I decided to adopt both kittens as a pair—to keep the sisters together."  The reason for the kittens' stress when separated only became clear later. Now named Patches and Emma, it was discovered that Emma has severe hearing loss, making her somewhat reliant on her sister, Patches, who has perfect hearing. Years later, Patches and Emma are thriving in their forever home—a heartwarming happy ending. "It's a fitting tribute to Miss Maisel, who we lost far too soon," says Gilbert. "See you on the other side, Miss Maisel! Rest well."
