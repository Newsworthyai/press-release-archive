# Bone Science Gains Attention for 'Prime Height' Nutrition for Growing Kids

LOS ANGELES, CA, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Global healthcare brand Bone Science has introduced Prime Height, a specialized nutritional supplement for growing children, designed to provide essential nutrients during the formative years and support systematic physical development. The new fourth-generation product, which follows the success of the third-generation version that sold out quickly, especially in the U.S., boasts an upgraded formula.  Prime Height contains the globally recognized Albion® mineral. This ingredient is highly absorbable and stable, playing an important role in skeletal formation and physical development in growing children. The product is also manufactured in an NSF-certified facility in the U.S., meeting global standards for quality and safety.  The product is designed to be easier for children to consume, as it comes in a smaller tablet form compared to its predecessor—a convenience that parents also appreciate—making it a trusted choice for many families. Consumer testimonials, such as, "My child's activity and energy are noticeably better," further validate its effectiveness.  Prime Height provides balanced nutrition, including essential nutrients for growing children, such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D. It supports growth plate health and bone development and is formulated with the optimal ratio of various minerals and vitamins needed for physical development.  Building on its success in the U.S. market, Bone Science is preparing for global expansion. "Prime Height is designed to provide children with a trusted growth solution," said a brand representative. "We look forward to continuing to help families around the world with innovative health solutions."  Prime Height works best when taken with a balanced diet and is positioned to be a reliable companion for healthy development in growing children.  It is available now on the official Bone Science website and at authorized retailers.  [Bonsai Science official website] https://thebonescience.com
