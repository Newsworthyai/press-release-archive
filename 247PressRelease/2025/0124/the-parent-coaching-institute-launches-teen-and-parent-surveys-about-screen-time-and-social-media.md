# The Parent Coaching Institute Launches Teen and Parent Surveys about Screen Time and Social Media

BELLINGHAM, WA, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Parent Coaching Institute (PCI) enthusiastically announces the lift off of a global teen, and parent of teen, survey project. The teen survey, for ages 11-18, seeks to gain information about what teens are doing on and with screens and also what they want regarding their screen use, especially from their parents. The parent survey seeks to learn more about what drives parents' decisions around screen use for their teens and what they do about their concerns.  "There has been a lot of discussion about what overuse of screens and too much time on social media can do to teens' mental health," explains PCI's founder and CEO, Gloria DeGaetano, "but we really don't know much about teen preferences and what makes them resilient to the potential dangers. Also, we don't hear much about what parents of teens do that work for them to keep their kids safe, yet savvy tech users. We anticipate the surveys to shed light on these areas."   The surveys are now available and will remain so until February 28. They are being shared with teens and parents across the United States and Canada, as well as throughout the Middle East and Europe. To receive links to the surveys, please contact PCI administration: info@thepci.org.  Christina Gika, PCI Certified Parent Coach® and PCI Instructor who resides in Kos, Greece, has joined with Ms. DeGaetano to create the surveys and spread the word. Ms. Gika's involvement in the project comes from a heartfelt passion to help both parents and teens. She explains, "During my work with parents of teenagers, I often find that when it comes to technology use, there is a gap in communication and in understanding each other's perspective which makes things really hard in some families with media challenges. With this survey PCI and I are curious to find out what teenagers want their parents to know regarding their screen use. We want this information to hopefully ease the parents' concerns, help them manage media challenges without losing connection with their teens and better understand what is ideal for their unique family."  The results for each survey will be compiled and made available Spring 2025.  The Parent Coaching Institute is committed to growing a global community of like-minded professionals dedicated to supporting parents in these stressful and complex times.
