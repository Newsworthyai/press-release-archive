# Reimagining Blockchains: Moving Beyond Money to Embrace Time as the Core Value

NEW YORK, NY, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, a new perspective is emerging that challenges traditional views about blockchain technology. Rather than viewing blockchains merely as tools for financial transactions, experts are suggesting that we rethink blockchains as systems that primarily track and manage time. This shift in focus has the potential to reshape the way we think about decentralized technologies and their applications in sectors ranging from finance to supply chain management.  Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has been a leading voice in advocating for blockchain's broader potential. Silbert argues that understanding blockchains as time-keeping mechanisms could be the key to unlocking their true value. He highlights that current blockchain models are often viewed through the narrow lens of money and value exchange, but the real opportunity lies in blockchain's ability to track and verify time across a decentralized network, providing transparency and security in ways that traditional systems cannot.  However, as the industry continues to advance, there are growing calls for innovation in governance models to ensure the sustainable growth of blockchain technology. Silbert points out that some industry leaders may need to reconsider their positions, with the ongoing shift in blockchain thinking leading to the idea that certain frameworks may need to "resign" from their outdated models to make way for more forward-thinking structures. These changes could replace old systems that view blockchain only as a financial tool, paving the way for a more holistic approach that benefits various industries.  Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, echoes these sentiments, stressing that blockchain's true potential lies in its capacity to revolutionize industries beyond finance. She emphasizes the importance of evolving blockchain's use cases and governance structures to ensure the technology is used in ways that minimize risks, including fraud, and promote long-term sustainability. Breitman advocates for continued innovation and a rethinking of what blockchains can accomplish, arguing that the technology's future is much broader than anyone initially imagined.  As the blockchain landscape shifts toward a greater understanding of its potential, industry leaders like Silbert and Breitman continue to lead the conversation, urging the community to embrace new ideas and governance models. With time as the central value, blockchain technology can be redefined to serve a wide range of applications, ultimately transforming the way we interact with decentralized systems.
