# Elderly Romspen Investment Corporation Investors Who Suspect They May Be Victims Of Investor Fraud May Be Entitled To Compensation

TORONTO, ON, January 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Elderly Romspen Investment Corporation investors who are convinced they are victims of investor fraud now have a strong ally to help them.   Internationally recognized mortgage fraud investigation website MFI-Miami wants to help elderly victims who feel they may be victims of investor fraud by Romspen Investment Corporation.   These elderly investors invested their retirement accounts and pension into Romspen Investment Corporation real estate projects that never materialized or were doomed from before Romspen lent the money to the borrowers.   MFI-Miami will try to match elderly American and Canadian Romspen Investment Corporation investors with a competent attorney in their area to help them recover their funds.  Investors also want to know why Romspen Investment Corporation has deprived them of their full investor redemption payments for nearly half a decade.  Romspen Investment Corporation's financial filings with the Canadian government show Romspen has posted an 8% profit every year since 2019. Yet, the company has not paid full investor redemptions since before the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020.   Several of these elderly investors say they invested money from their retirement savings into Romspen projects believing the investor redemptions would pay their monthly expenses.   Unfortunately that has not happened. As a result, these elderly investors want answers and/or their money back.  MFI-Miami.com wants to help these poor elderly U.S. and Canadian victims get the justice they deserve.  Headquartered in Asia with an office in the UK, MFI-Miami, LLC is an international leader in investigating mortgage fraud. Since 2008, MFI-Miami has researched appraisal fraud, mortgage compliance, mortgage fraud, mortgage modifications, mortgage payment issues, mortgage securitization and title insurance issues.
