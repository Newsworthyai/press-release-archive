# Whittier Kick Out the Clowns Parade and No Kings Day of Defiance to be Held on June 14th

WHITTIER, CA, June 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On June 14th, the Truth and Democracy Coalition will host our Whittier No Kings Demonsration and Kick Out the Clowns Parade in Uptown Whittier. We will meet at 2 pm at City Hall and then parade up and down Greenleaf Avenue. We will have speakers, performers, people in costumes, and music. We are part of a nationwide action to bring attention to the irony that the leader of the free world, the President of the United States, would hold a military parade similar to the ones held in Russia, China, and North Korea.   On June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation's capital. President Trump's parade was inspired by the authoritarian leaders he admires, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. This action is set to take place during Donald Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14. Instead of allowing this military parade to take center stage, activists will take action everywhere so that the story of America will be front and center that day.   Local organizers, partners, and pro-democracy activists across the country will come together for marches, rallies, and demonstrations to reject corrupt, authoritarian politics in the United States. Donald Trump wants tanks in the streets and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. This spectacle is meant to make him look like a king. But real power isn't staged in Washington — it rises up everywhere else.  "From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we're taking action to reject authoritarianism and show the world what democracy actually looks like: people, united, refusing to be ruled.  June 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the regime's military parade. To meet this moment, The Truth and Democracy Coalition, in coalition with the Women's March, Whittier Indivisible, and a coalition of other groups, will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos divisive propaganda has sown across the country. Together, we'll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as a strongman. We won't stop until we ensure that democracy is safe for future generations.  The No Kings Demonstration and Kick Out the Clowns Parade is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses of the Trump administration. We've watched as the Administration silenced activists, deport an American citizen, and defy court orders. We are concerned that these behaviors are harbingers of what's to come.  Donald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman using public money—we won't stand by while that happens.  Instead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else. The story of America that day will be people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics.  Alongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy movement, we will demonstrate that organized people power outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.  Join us and enjoy the festivities. Bring signs. Wear Costumes. Make noise. Let's have some fun!   Also, be sure to bring hats, sunglasses, costumes appropriate for the weather, and water. It may be hot. Keep yourself hydrated and wear sunscreen.  The Truth and Democracy Coalition works to build a mass movement to save democracy. We confront divisive propaganda and focus on bringing Americans of different religions and ideologies together to defend democracy from the threat of authoritarianism. Our vision is to bring men and women, Republicans and Democrats, radicals and moderates, Socialists, Liberals, and Conservatives together to defend the Constitution and fight for democracy.   We value freedom, truth, and prosperity. Individuals must be free to criticize public policy, advocate for their interests, and decide who should lead them. To this end, citizens must be critical of the information and propaganda they consume. Individuals are the decision makers in a democracy. They need to be educated and informed. Only democracy frees people to speak their truth and advocate for justice and prosperity.
