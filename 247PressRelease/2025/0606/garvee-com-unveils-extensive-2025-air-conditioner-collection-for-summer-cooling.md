This addresses consumer feedback for more effective cooling capabilities, especially in regions experiencing hotter summers.  Improved Design and Aesthetics:  The 2025 collection features sleek, modern designs that integrate more seamlessly into contemporary home aesthetics. This includes more compact portable AC units and subtly designed indoor units for split AC systems, reflecting a consumer desire for appliances that are as visually appealing as they are functional.  New Smart Features:  A significant portion of the new lineup includes enhanced smart capabilities, such as Wi-Fi connectivity, app-based remote control, voice assistant compatibility, and programmable schedules. These features empower users to manage their home climate with greater convenience and precision, optimizing energy consumption and comfort levels remotely.  Enhanced Filtration Systems:  Many new models incorporate advanced air filtration, designed to capture more allergens, dust, and airborne particles. This addresses a growing consumer concern for indoor air quality, providing not just cool air, but cleaner air.
