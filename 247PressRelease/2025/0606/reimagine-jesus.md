# REIMAGINE JESUS

ST. LOUIS, MO, June 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Reimagine Jesus Foundation proudly announces the release of Reimagine Jesus: Gospel for the 21st Century, a provocative and deeply thoughtful spiritual work by Mike Oslance. This groundbreaking book invites readers to explore the life and teachings of Jesus through the lenses of modern science, investigative psychology, and forensic deductionâ€”what the author calls the "TheoPhysics Gospel."  For readers who believe in Jesus but wrestle with traditional doctrines that conflict with reason, equality, and compassion, Reimagine Jesus offers a deeply human and transcendent re-telling of the Gospel. From reimagining the Sermon on the Mount to presenting Mary and Joseph as spiritual revolutionaries, the narrative challenges conventions and calls for a transformative understanding of Jesus' message.  Published on Amazon Kindle, the book is now available worldwide.  Website: https://reimaginejesus.org
