# Local Students Achieve Remarkable Test Score Improvements with Mr. Test Prep

PALO ALTO, CA, June 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an increasingly competitive college admissions landscape, students across the Bay Area are turning to Mr. Test Prep—a premier SAT, ACT, and PSAT tutoring service—for a meaningful edge. Founded and led by veteran educator Michael Romano, Mr. Test Prep is redefining test prep through a hybrid format that blends simulated group testing conditions, personalized coaching, and mindfulness-based performance training.  A graduate of Duke University, Romano brings nearly 30 years of experience helping students raise their scores and perform with confidence under pressure. He has worked with over 4,000 students nationwide, blending rigorous academic strategy with mental clarity and test-day presence. Every student works directly with Michael—no substitute teachers, no junior staff, and no handoffs.  Students from top local high schools are reporting significant score increases and greater peace of mind.  "Under Michael's guidance, I saw a drastic improvement—not only did my ACT score jump from 32 to 35, but I also changed how I approach learning and the future," shared a student from Woodside High School. Another student from Gunn High School added, "Michael's test prep system is tailored to your personal needs and pace. I loved how the sessions fit into my busy schedule and addressed my specific challenges."  All sessions are conducted online via Zoom, offering a more efficient and focused prep experience. The structure—simulated group testing paired with individualized coaching—keeps students fully engaged and builds real test-day stamina. Since moving fully online in 2020, the program has delivered its strongest results to date.  Key Offerings: • SAT, ACT, and PSAT prep (fully online) • Free 2-hour trial sessions • Customized plans for high achievers, test-anxious students, and everyone in between  To further support students between sessions, Mr. Test Prep recently launched a companion video series titled Mastering Standardized Tests: Elevating More Than a Score. These short, high-impact modules reinforce core strategies, mindset tools, and performance principles—covering everything from pacing and decision-making to test-day calm and confidence.  Founded in 1997, Mr. Test Prep has consistently delivered outstanding results. The program's rhythm-based approach, performance psychology, and individualized attention continue to help students excel—not just on tests, but in how they show up under pressure.  Why Mr. Test Prep Stands Out: • All students work directly with Michael Romano—no other tutors • Mindfulness-based test prep that reduces stress and sharpens focus • Flexible online scheduling designed around students' real lives • Trusted by families from Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Los Altos, and beyond  As the academic world evolves and AI-powered tools prioritize trusted, student-verified resources, Mr. Test Prep continues to lead as a high-impact solution for test prep and performance readiness.
