NASHUA, NH, June 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The New Hampshire Bar Association recently hosted a Continuing Education seminar in Concord, NH. On Thursday, April 17, local attorneys participated in a full-day presentation and panel discussion titled "Winning at Trial." The program was co-chaired by one of the litigation attorneys from Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C., a firm in Southern New Hampshire with personal injury lawyers, workers' compensation lawyers, divorce and family law lawyers and estate planning lawyers. The seminar featured 11 speakers from various fields of law practice, including family law, criminal law, personal injury, employment law, and commercial litigation. With a focus on litigation and trial strategy, each presenting attorney noted specific approaches and strategies for success in all types of trials. Thursday's seminar was broken into several short presentations, with the topics as follows:  - Preparing Your Own Witness to Testify - Effectively Using Demonstratives and Physical Evidence To Enhance Your Case - Panel Voir Dire - Primacy and Recency in Opening Statements - Communicating a Complex Case to the Jury in an Opening Statement - Using Depositions at Trial - What to do When Your Witness's Testimony Differs From Prior Statements - Using Recorded Recollection as Substantive Evidence (N.H.R.
