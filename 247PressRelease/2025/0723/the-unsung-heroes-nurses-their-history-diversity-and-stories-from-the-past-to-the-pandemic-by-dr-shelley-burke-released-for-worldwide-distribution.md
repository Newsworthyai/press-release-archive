From the healers of ancient villages to the brave frontline warriors of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have always stood at the heart of healthcare, yet they often go overlooked and underappreciated.

The book is available in hardback, paperback, and Kindle editions.   "Many of the nurses like me are immigrants who pursued their careers in the United States," says Dr. Burke. "Each one made their mark in caring for their patients and providing both comfort and care. The stories that I highlight, like the nurses in the book, are a diverse group just like the nursing profession in the United States is."  "Nurses are not just doctor's assistants or 'bedpan pushers,'" Dr. Burke continues. "They are scientific innovators, advocates for social justice, and global ambassadors of care. This book is both a celebration and a call to recognize the true value of nursing."
