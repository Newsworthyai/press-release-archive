# Illusionist Robby Bennett Is JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE WITH NO PARACHUTE — While His Stage Show Enters a Bold New Era of Fantasy and Spectacle AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING

HOUSTON, TX, July 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Illusionist Robby Bennett has stunned audiences across the country with his razor-sharp wit and mind-bending magic. But in 2026, he's taking things far beyond the stage — and into the skies — as he prepares something that pushes beyond illusion… into legend. If you think you've seen everything, you haven't met Robby Bennett.  Bennett has announced preparations for a death-defying stunt, titled DESCENT: a jump from an aircraft thousands of feet in the air — with no parachute. The details remain a mystery. The outcome? History in the making. A leap into the unknown.  No timeline. No explanation. Only this:  "In 2026… I will jump out of a plane with no parachute. And it will change everything."  No further comment has been offered by Bennett or his team — only confirmation that preparations have begun and that it involves real danger, real altitude, and something the world has never seen before. Fantasy-based story elements will prelude the event, laying the narrative groundwork for what is being described as a LIVE event at an air show like no other.  But while anticipation builds for the stunt, Bennett is already taking his live stage productions to new heights. His acclaimed touring show, The Magic of Robby Bennett, is undergoing a transformation through 2025 — becoming a cinematic journey where High Fantasy meets Modern Wit.  "The illusions remain," says Bennett, "but the world they live in has grown larger, more mythic — more magical. Back into the realm from where they originated."  Audiences can now expect to see Bennett's signature impossible routines wrapped in powerful new stories drawn from ancient myth and timeless legend — including:  The lost realm of Atlantis  The mysteries of Ancient Egypt  The prophecy-laced swordplay of King Arthur  And a ghostly encounter with the Flying Dutchman  These new narrative elements weave seamlessly into Bennett's already engaging and emotionally resonant routines, creating an immersive experience that feels more like stepping into a storybook — or a dream.  "We're not just pulling off tricks anymore," Bennett explains. "We're taking people on a quest through myths they think they know."  TWO EPIC JOURNEYS. ONE PERFORMER. The countdown to the 2026 stunt begins now. The adventure on stage is already underway.  Bennett is not just doing magic — he's rewriting the rules of reality.  He can next be seen at The Hall of State in Dallas, Texas on August 23rd, and regularly at Standing Ovation Theatre in Houston, where he is developing his new material. Performance dates in additional markets are being added.  See the Story. Experience the Magic.
