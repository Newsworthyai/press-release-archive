# New Books Released by Two PCI Certified Parent Coaches

BELLINGHAM, WA, July 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Parent Coaching Institute (PCI) enthusiastically announces the release of two new books by PCI graduates, Lea Stublarec and Tierney Boggs.  Ms. Stublarec has released the first of three books, The Perfect Storm which highlights the challenges mothers of gifted daughters face nurturing female genius. Lea explains, "Because of the quantity of data collected from 106 in-depth interviews (2 interviews with 43 mothers and 20 daughters), the study findings are presented in a trilogy. The second book, to be released in 2026, Conquering the Storm presents the approaches the mothers took to address these challenges, while the third book, Celebration, highlights the wisdom these women wanted to share, as well as how they celebrate what they have achieved, including special moments with their 'all grown up,' gifted daughters." It is expected that the third book will be available 2027.  Gloria DeGaetano, founder and CEO of the Parent Coaching Institute remembers when Lea began this massive project. "This project took Lea over a period of 15 years. She has been so persistent and dedicated to support mothers of gifted daughters, helping them learn from one another by capturing their voices in her unique, and critically important, project. Lea truly believes that because knowledge is power, having an awareness of common obstacles will empower those embarking on a parenting journey with their neurodivergent girls."  The second newly-released book, Becoming the Parent You Like: Reframing How You Think about the Early Years, was written by Tierney Boggs who is a PCI instructor as well as a PCI graduate. Mrs. Boggs is a writer and mother of three who believes the early years of parenting are not just something to survive; they're sacred ground for transformation. She states, "I wrote the book for parents of young children who feel overwhelmed by the pressure to do it all. I hope it helps them uncover the clarity and confidence that was within them all along."  Ms. DeGaetano enthusiastically endorses the book. "It invites parents to remember the joy amid the chaos. It's warm, honest, and often humorous. Tierney deals with the day-to-day challenges, like all PCI-trained coaches, emphasizing the good, the beauty, the resources within—both parents and children, alike. This is what a strength-based coach approach is all about." Becoming the Parent You Like is available through Amazon.
