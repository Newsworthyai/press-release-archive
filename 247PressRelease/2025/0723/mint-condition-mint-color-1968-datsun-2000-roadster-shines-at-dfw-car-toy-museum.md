# Mint Condition, Mint Color: 1968 Datsun 2000 Roadster Shines at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, July 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A vintage gem with timeless flair has rolled into the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The 1968 Datsun 2000 Roadster, finished in a stunning mint green, is now on display as part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection, offering visitors a refreshing take on Japanese sports car heritage.  This beautifully preserved Roadster features a 2.0-liter U20 inline-four engine paired with a five-speed manual gearbox—both reportedly rebuilt by the previous owner's shop. With just 87,000 miles showing on the five-digit odometer, this rare roadster delivers the engaging, analog driving experience that made Datsun a fan favorite among enthusiasts and weekend racers alike.  Inside, the cabin has been refurbished in black, boasting reupholstered seats, new carpeting, a replacement dashboard, fresh door panels, and a functional glove box. A vertically mounted factory push-button radio and analog clock sit in the center stack, adding period-correct charm.  Front and center is a Momo Veloce steering wheel complete with a Datsun horn button, framing a dash full of vintage instrumentation—including a 160-mph speedometer, 7k redline tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, fuel, and amperage.  "The Datsun 2000 Roadster is a classic that helped pave the way for Japan's entry into the sports car world," says Ron Sturgeon. "With its mint green finish and thoughtful restoration, this one is a real head-turner—and a perfect fit for our collection."
