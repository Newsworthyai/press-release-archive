# Brais Law Firm Retained to Represent Hannah Smith in Catastrophic Maritime Injury Case

MIAMI, FL, July 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On May 12, 2025, Hannah Smith, a 22-year-old summa cum laude graduate of Miles College, suffered catastrophic injuries during a shore excursion in Nassau, Bahamas, booked through Carnival Cruise Line's "Pearl Island Beach Escape with Lunch." While disembarking from a catamaran operated by Pearl Investment Management Group, Ltd. and Sun Cay Ltd., Ms. Smith was drawn into the vessel's propellers, which were reportedly running and engaged in reverse, leading to severe injuries. She underwent multiple emergency surgeries in Nassau and was later airlifted to Miami for advanced care, requiring three successive amputations of her right leg, culminating in a hip disarticulation. Ultimately, due to the severity of the injuries, Hannah has now lost both of her legs.   Brais Law Firm, specializing in cruise ship shore excursion accidents, has been retained to represent Ms. Smith and is conducting a thorough investigation into the incident.  Brais Law Firm is conducting a detailed pre-suit investigation into the catastrophic injuries sustained by Ms. Smith during the cruise excursion. Preliminary findings indicate potential lawsuits against Carnival Corporation, operating as Carnival Cruise Line, for promoting, advertising, selling, and processing payments for the excursion, and against Pearl Investment Management Group, Ltd., and Sun Cay Ltd., the reported owners or operators of the excursion vessel. Claims against Carnival include direct negligence for failing to vet, monitor, or ensure the safety of third-party excursions sold under its brand, and vicarious liability, asserting that the excursion operators acted as Carnival's agents. Against the excursion operators, claims focus on negligence due to unsafe practices, notably allowing passenger disembarkation while propulsion engines were running, possibly in reverse, violating basic safety standards.  Carnival is expected to deny liability, claiming it lacked control over the excursion, was unaware of unsafe practices, and that the operators were independent contractors. Brais Law Firm plans to counter these defenses by highlighting Carnival's role in marketing and selling the excursion, establishing apparent agency under maritime law. The firm argues that had the vessel's engines been disengaged and propellers stopped, as industry standards require, Ms. Smith's injuries could have been prevented.  Hannah's family has launched a GoFundMe Campaign to help cover her medical and rehabilitation costs.  Click here to read the full article.
