# NGO uses Claude, Zoom, and Web tools to enhance Fundamental Well-being

CAMBRIDGE, MA, April 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NGO AI Mindset Mastery is building a new online community designed to discover whether AIs like the latest versions of Anthropic's Claude can approach human-level challenges more creatively if users optimize for several key feeling-states. Says community co-founder Amy Chang "People concentrate a lot on learning advanced prompting to find deeper and more meaningful answers from AI. But they rarely think about their affectual conditions. We're finding that the combination of advanced AI with users who have enhanced emotionality leads to better answers, and better lives."  "Many spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about when the Singularity will occur, or when AGI is reached, or when AIs in concert with malign actors will take over the world" says AIMM's Education Coordinator John Toomey. "But we want to ask, how could happier people, which to us means people who can maximize basic feeling states for ultimate contentment, work in concert with AIs like Claude to enhance human and planetary well-being?"  AIMM believes there is something like a Recommended Daily Allowance for peak emotional states, shared by most humans. What they're doing is exploring and refining those experiences for as many people as possible, so that social media, smartphone apps, the Internet, and AI can be net contributors to success and psychological well-being, instead of being soul-sucking happiness detractors as they are for so many nowadays.  The protocols are based on sources as diverse as Gestalt Therapy, Jungian Shadow work, the Stoic thought of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, Energy Healing, Neurodynamic Breathwork, Qi Gong, Kundalini yoga, the latest Generative AI, and the practices of current-day neolithic tribes such as the Hadzabe of Tanzania, the Tau't Batu people from the Philippines, and the Yanomami from the Brazilian Amazon. Zoom sessions are open to all members and are held twice weekly.  For participants, each online session is a new experiment in exploring innovative ways to help others connect with their passions. "It never gets old" says Chang, "because we all thrive when we consistently attain the most sublime emotional experiences, and the best way to optimize these is to share them with others. You can't inspire others without also inspiring yourself."  The current sixth cohort's ventures include:  AWE – Thousands of wonder-inspiring online experiences are scanned monthly via Gigabrain, and the best are 'upvoted' like posts on Reddit. Consistent winners include explore.org, which features 82 live webcam streams of wildlife all over the world, fresh images from the James Webb Space Telescope, and infinite regression video zoomquilt2.com.  BRAINSTORMING – AI-assisted group mind mapping takes place during Zoom calls, using Claude and generateideas.ai. Participants are creating 170 mind maps for each of the UN's sub-targets within the 17 Agenda for Sustainability Goals. Actionable solutions that come out of the sessions are a side benefit. The real success is sharpening both swarm and artificial intelligence.  GRATITUDE – Members in 33 countries celebrate together watching live streams of the very first shared moments between mother and child in the largest maternity hospital in the Philippines, in which a baby is born every 12 minutes.  LAUGHTER – Participants join laughter yoga club meetings on Zoom or Skype in 31 different countries: https://www.laughteryoga.org/club/find-clubs-worldwide  HERO'S JOURNEY Partnering with underground schools for girls in Afghanistan, whose Taliban-led government has made the education of females past primary school illegal, members use Leonardo.ai to create modernized images of ancient Afghan heroines who compete with each other in a virtual 'Sher Jangi' or poetry competition, composed in Dari, Pashto, and Uzbek.
