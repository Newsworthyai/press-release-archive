# Gullwing Wonder: 1992 Autozam AZ-1 in Striking Yellow Now on Display at DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, April 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase one of the most unique and exciting kei cars ever built—the 1992 Autozam AZ-1. This striking yellow, right-hand-drive coupe, known for its futuristic gullwing doors and mid-engine layout, is now on display as part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection.  Produced by Mazda and sold through its Japanese-market Autozam dealership network from 1992 to 1994, the AZ-1 stands out with its lightweight plastic composite body panels, hood scoop, and straked radiator inlets. Originally delivered in Classic Red (SU), this particular example has been refinished in an eye-catching yellow, ensuring it turns heads wherever it goes.  Inside, the AZ-1 maintains its driver-focused, minimalist appeal with crank windows, air conditioning, and a Bluetooth-enabled aftermarket stereo paired with Pioneer-Carrozzeria speakers. The three-spoke steering wheel, positioned on the right-hand side, fronts a 140-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline, and additional gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer records 123,000 kilometers (~76,000 miles), marking this as a well-driven yet meticulously maintained kei sports car. The front trunk houses fluid reservoirs, a spare wheel, and a jack, making it both compact and functional.  Beneath its small but mighty frame, the mid-mounted turbocharged 657cc Suzuki F6A inline-three engine delivers 64 horsepower and 63 lb-ft of torque, all channeled to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. This combination offers an exhilarating driving experience packed into a truly unique design.  Now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, the 1992 Autozam AZ-1 joins a collection of over 200 iconic automobiles, promising an unforgettable visit for car enthusiasts and casual visitors alike.
