# Dill Dinkers Indoor Pickleball Facility Now Open in Atlanta's West End

ATLANTA, GA, April 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A week ago, Atlanta's West End was introduced to a new neighbor: Dill Dinkers' indoor pickleball center. As soon as their giant mural went up, the local community began dropping in to find out more.   April 2nd marked the end of their soft opening "Community Free Week," where over 1,000 people – from those learning pickleball for the first time to advanced players excited for new courts – came together for connection, exercise, fun and competition.   The metro area has long struggled to have enough court space for the rapidly growing sport, with more than 1.1 million players in Atlanta currently, growing at 51.8% year-over-year. The facility, which underwent a major renovation of a warehouse space by Ackerman & Co., represents a significant addition to the local sports and community landscape.  "There's a shortage of courts and lack of structure for skills progression, so players are turning to places like Dill Dinkers. Add to that spring's high pollen counts and pending hot weather, and we knew the demand would be high. What we didn't anticipate was the incredible outpouring of support from the community. From the businesses at next door Lee + White handing out grand opening flyers, to the nearby police precinct adding us to their newsletter, to neighbors stopping in while out for a walk, everyone has welcomed us with great enthusiasm," said Daniel Hardeman, Chosewood resident and regional franchise developer.   The White Street facility will be the first of multiple locations planned for Fulton and surrounding areas, including Dekalb, Cobb, Gwinnett and Cherokee counties, owned by additional local franchisees.   On April 18th, Dill Dinkers will host its ribbon cutting, marking its official grand opening. Meanwhile, play will continue for members and visitors, as well as clinics, lessons, leagues, social events and corporate gatherings.
