# Dr. Zandra D. Harris: Empowering Transformations Through P-NRGY Coaching

LITTLETON, CO, April 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Life is filled with choices—some easy, others challenging. However, the ones that truly matter require us to step into the unknown, take risks, and believe in the power within ourselves. No one understands this better than Dr. Zandra D. Harris, a woman whose transformative journey began with a bold decision in 2004 that changed the course of her life.  After 24 years in a stable career, Dr. Harris made the courageous choice to walk away. She sold her home of 17 years, left the comfort of familiar surroundings, and moved to an unfamiliar place. It was a significant risk—but also the catalyst that led her to academic and professional success, fulfilling her purpose and helping others do the same.  "I realized that sometimes, to grow, you must take a leap of faith, even if it's scary," Dr. Harris reflects. "It's in that space of uncertainty that we discover who we are meant to be."  During her time alone, Dr. Harris not only earned a doctorate in Management and certifications in Professional Coaching and Positive Psychology but also developed a proprietary formula for transformation. This formula, called Awareness, consists of two Es—Emotional and Energy Awareness—and four Cs: Conscious Awareness, Choice, Commitment, and Change. Together, these elements equate to an individual's Energy Potential: E2 + C4 = EP.  The Power of Conscious Choices  Today, through her transformative coaching practice, P-NRGY Coaching, Dr. Harris empowers others to achieve personal growth and self-discovery. Her coaching philosophy is based on the belief that immense power resides within our emotional selves. Conscious awareness of this internal power, combined with intentional thinking, fosters greater self-confidence in making life choices.  "Taking the first step is an essential part of the growth process," says Dr. Harris. "P-NRGY Coaching is designed to partner with you on your journey of self-discovery. It's about helping you embrace and trust your inner strength while taking action toward the life you choose."  Unlike many mainstream coaching practices, Dr. Harris operates in an intimate, individualized manner. Whether working with veterans, church groups, or women's organizations, she provides the personalized attention needed for true transformation. Her coaching does not follow a generic path but instead focuses on understanding each person's unique journey and serving as a trusted guide throughout the process.  What sets Dr. Harris apart is her deep understanding that genuine growth originates from within.   "Our inner self matters," she states. "Everything we do externally stems from what we hold inside first—because that's home." This insight is central to P-NRGY Coaching, helping clients realize that true success lies not only in external achievements but in cultivating inner energy as a source of authentic power.  Coaching That Speaks to the Soul  P-NRGY Coaching is more than setting goals—it's about discovering and connecting with the essence of who you are. Dr. Harris emphasizes, "There is power in consciously choosing to engage with your internal emotional energy, both positive and negative. This energy serves as the foundation for your external behaviors in life."  For Dr. Harris, coaching is profoundly personal. She doesn't seek large audiences or the spotlight. Instead, she devotes her life to working with those who truly need emotional support, offering her skills where they are needed most. Her work with veterans, women's organizations, and underserved communities reflects the core of her mission.  Her unique coaching approach has fostered lasting, intimate relationships with clients, guiding them through the challenging, sometimes painful process of self-reflection and personal growth. Whether helping a woman rediscover her sense of worth or empowering a veteran to transition into civilian life, Dr. Harris walks alongside them every step of the way, providing encouragement, tools, and unwavering support.  Join the P-NRGY Movement  Dr. Zandra D. Harris invites those ready to take control of their lives to make a conscious choice to invest in themselves and embark on a journey of self-discovery and transformation.  "If you're prepared to embrace change, step into the future you've always dreamed of, and take charge of your life, then P-NRGY Coaching is waiting for you," she says.
