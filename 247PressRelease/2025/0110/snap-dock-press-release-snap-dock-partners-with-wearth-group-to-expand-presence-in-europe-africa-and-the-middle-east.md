Through this strategic partnership, Wearth Group will now manufacture Snap Dock products and exclusively distribute them throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. This agreement allows Snap Dock to leverage Wearth Group's extensive experience in the marine industry and its established manufacturing capabilities to accelerate the growth of Snap Dock's innovative product offerings in these rapidly expanding international markets. With production already underway, Snap Dock's modular dock systems and PWC ports are now available to customers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
