Orange Mound: America's Black Community Orange Mound is not just known as the first community in America built for Blacks by Blacks; it is now being recognized as America's 1st 21st Century Afro-Indigenous Community. This shift in narrative, spearheaded by Elmore, underscores the deep historical and cultural connections that make Orange Mound a unique and significant place. Orange Mound is America's Black Community because it uniquely embodies our "Triple Black Heritage": Black African, Black Native American, and Black American.  Historical Erasure and Rediscovery For many years, the rich Afro-Indigenous heritage embedded in the name "Orange Mound" has been overshadowed by more dominant historical narratives. The traditional story attributes the name to Osage Orange Trees planted by a local plantation owner, John Deaderick. However, this interpretation overlooks the profound connections to the Mound Builders and the African navigators who may have reached the Americas centuries before Columbus.  The Mound Builders and African Navigators The Mound Builders, including the Mississippian culture and the builders of Cahokia Mounds, were sophisticated societies with advanced knowledge of engineering, astronomy, and agriculture. Some theories suggest that these cultures may have had contact with African civilizations, such as the Mali Empire, long before European colonization. Mansa Abubakari II's expedition, involving 2,000 ships, is a compelling narrative that speaks to the possibility of early transatlantic voyages and cultural exchanges.  The Olmec Connection The colossal Olmec heads found in Mexico, with their distinctive facial features, further add to the intrigue. While mainstream archaeology attributes these heads to the indigenous Olmec rulers, some theories propose that they may indicate contact with African civilizations. These connections, whether direct or through shared human experiences, enrich the story of Afro-Indigenous heritage.  The Chickasaw Connection The land that would become Orange Mound was once occupied by the Chickasaw Indians, who had their own rich cultural heritage. The Chickasaw were known for their warrior traditions and sophisticated social structures. As part of the broader Mississippian culture, the Chickasaw had established extensive trade networks and political alliances. Despite facing forced removal and displacement due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, some Chickasaw people remained in the region, maintaining their cultural practices and integrating with African descendants. These individuals, often categorized as "Free Black Men" by legal standards, were integral to the area's history. Their presence and contributions are a crucial part of the story of Orange Mound, blending Native and African ancestry.  The Foundation of Orange Mound Orange Mound was officially established in the late 19th century, with the purchase of land by E.E. Meacham. The community quickly grew into a thriving hub for African Americans, offering a rare opportunity for Black homeownership and self-sufficiency during a time of widespread segregation and discrimination. The name "Orange Mound" itself is believed to have been derived from the Osage Orange Trees planted by John Deaderick, a local plantation owner. However, this narrative overlooks the deeper significance of the "Mound" in the community's name, which likely ties back to the Mound Builders and their Afro-Indigenous heritage.  The Legacy of Mt. Moriah Baptist Church One of the cornerstones of Orange Mound's history is the Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, established in 1879 the Church purchase land at its current location in Orange Mound in 1883. This church became a central gathering place for the community, offering spiritual guidance, social support, and a sense of identity. The church's purchase of land predates the formal establishment of Orange Mound, highlighting the deep roots and resilience of the community. The church's role extended beyond religious services; it was a center for education, social activism, and community organization, reflecting the communal values that have sustained Orange Mound through generations.  Reclaiming Afro-Indigenous Heritage Anthony "Amp" Elmore's vision for Orange Mound as "America's Black Community" is revolutionary. By embracing the community's Afro-Indigenous heritage, Elmore aims to provide a more inclusive and accurate narrative of American history. This recognition not only honors the ancestors but also empowers present and future generations to take pride in their rich, multifaceted heritage. The acknowledgment of this heritage challenges the often narrow and exclusionary narratives of American history, offering a more holistic view that celebrates the contributions of Afro-Indigenous people.  The Unique "Triple Black Heritage" What truly sets Orange Mound apart and earns it the title of America's Black Community is its unique "Triple Black Heritage":  Black African Heritage: The rich traditions and cultural practices brought by African ancestors, including those who might have arrived long before the transatlantic slave trade.  Black Native American Heritage: The profound connections with Native American tribes like the Chickasaw, who integrated with African descendants to form a unique cultural identity.  Black American Heritage: The resilience and achievements of the African American community, building a thriving, self-sufficient neighborhood in the face of systemic racism and segregation.  African Cultural Diplomacy In addition to its triple heritage, Orange Mound is also becoming known as the birthplace of African Cultural Diplomacy. Anthony "Amp" Elmore's efforts to build relationships with African nations have fostered a deeper connection between Orange Mound and the broader African diaspora. These relationships help to bridge cultural gaps, promote mutual understanding, and celebrate shared heritage. Elmore's work in this area includes cultural exchanges, educational programs, and community events that highlight the rich and diverse cultural traditions of Africa and their influence on the Afro-Indigenous heritage of Orange Mound.  Education, Enlightenment, and Empowerment Through his video "Orange Mound: America's Black Community," Elmore uses modern technology to tell the story of this unique heritage. The video serves as a platform for education, enlightenment, and empowerment, challenging negative stereotypes and promoting a deeper understanding of the community's history. By highlighting the contributions of Afro-Indigenous people, Elmore's work fosters a sense of pride and identity that transcends the legacy of the Atlantic Slave Trade. This educational initiative aims to connect the community with its roots, offering workshops, historical tours, and cultural events that celebrate the rich heritage of Orange Mound.  Honoring the Ancestors The African proverb, "If lions were historians, hunters would no longer be heroes," captures the essence of Elmore's mission. By reclaiming and retelling the true history of Orange Mound, he honors the ancestors and affirms the community's rightful place in the broader American narrative. The recognition of Orange Mound as an Afro-Indigenous community is a revolutionary act, one that celebrates the complexity and beauty of its heritage and offers a model for other communities to follow.
