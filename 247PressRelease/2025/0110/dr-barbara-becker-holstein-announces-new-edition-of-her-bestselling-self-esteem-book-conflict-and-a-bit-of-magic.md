# Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein Announces New Edition Of Her Bestselling Self-Esteem Book, Conflict And A Bit Of Magic

WILMINGTON, NC, January 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The importance of communication between young people and older parents and grandparents cannot be overstated. With the ever-increasing pace of modern life and the fragmentation of families, it can be difficult for different generations to find common ground and build strong, meaningful relationships. This communication gap can lead to misunderstandings, negative attitudes, and a lack of appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others.  To bridge this gap, it is essential for young people and older adults to make an effort to understand and respect each other's differences. This can be achieved through open and honest communication, as well as through shared experiences and activities. By taking the time to listen to and learn from one another, both young people and older adults can gain a greater appreciation for the unique perspectives and wisdom that each generation has to offer.  Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein's book 'Conflict And A Bit Of Magic' provides a valuable resource for fostering communication and understanding between different generations.
