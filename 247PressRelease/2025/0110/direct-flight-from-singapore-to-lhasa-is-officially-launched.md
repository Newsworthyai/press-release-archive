In Lhasa, visitors can explore the unique Tibetan architecture and immerse themselves in Tibetan Buddhist culture. Whether traveling for tourism, pilgrimage, or business, passengers can enjoy a more efficient and convenient air route.  As the capital of Tibet, Lhasa offers unique natural landscapes and cultural heritage. Travelers can visit world-famous landmarks like the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple, and explore nearby attractions such as Yamdrok Lake, Namtso Lake, and Mount Everest.
