# The Meanness Epidemic: True Strength vs. Unnecessary Rudeness by Donniece Gooden

WASHINGTON, DC, November 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- I usually focus my articles on legal matters or things related to my law firm. However, today I witnessed something that I think reflects on what is currently happening in America on a social level. I am confident I am not the only person that has noticed this. We are currently witnessing a cultural shift where a striking lack of decorum and basic civility has become increasingly commonplace. In digital spaces, public forums, political spaces, and even everyday interactions, there is a perception that being unnecessarily abrasive or aggressively rude is somehow a demonstration of power or conviction. As an attorney and litigator, I am no "snowflake"; frankly, I go hard for what I believe in and I am not easily intimidated. However, even I am taken aback by the utter lack of class and decorum that is on the rise. Indeed, some people are behaving as if they are the beasts of the Serengeti, prioritizing loud, rude, and frankly obnoxious behavior. It is truly disgraceful, leading one to question, not who raised these people, but whether they were raised at all.  Just this morning, I was at my usual coffee spot, a place I frequent precisely because I appreciate the good vibes. I was greeted by a barista who had a bonnet on her head. I am certainly not the hair police, but the lack of care she showed for her appearance while at work was definitely noted. I was not prepared for what happened next. A woman made an order after me and she had food allergies. She was being specific about what needed to be removed from her order. The barista in the bonnet was not just curt, but extremely rude to this woman. I initially dismissed it, thinking perhaps she was having a bad day, but then the rest of the staff joined in. The other employees started yelling and cursing at the poor woman, aggressively demanding she leave the store. When the shocked customer finally reacted to this public humiliation, one of the staff even dramatically jumped over the counter. At that point I knew it was time to go. Fortunately, the woman being berated followed my lead and left as well.   Rudeness is Not Strength; It's a Shield  There is a conflation of rudeness and violence with strength. True strength—the kind born of deep self-respect, conviction, and courage—is quiet and unwavering. It is the ability to be assertive, to stand up for oneself, and to articulate one's beliefs clearly, firmly, and respectfully.  In contrast, unnecessary rudeness is never a sign of strength; it is overwhelmingly indicative of weakness. Hostility often acts as a preemptive shield, thrown up by those who fear honest engagement, self-doubt, or being genuinely seen. When an individual must resort to being cruel, dismissive, or performatively aggressive merely to make a point or feel superior, they reveal an internal deficiency in their character. People with genuine inner strength and character know that being rude simply for rudeness's sake is entirely unnecessary and counterproductive. Assertiveness and self-belief are crucial—it is vital to stand up for yourself, hold boundaries, and defend your position. However, these qualities must be decoupled from the impulse to tear others down. Strength is defining your value; weakness is needing to devalue others to feel it.  Some readers may perceive this commentary as snobbish, but let me assure you, my perspective is grounded in reality. I was born in Gary, Indiana, and raised in Norfolk, Virginia. I have seen a great many things, and my standards are not based on privilege but on principle. It is unfortunate that technology and social media appear to have severely impacted how people engage with one another on a fundamental human level, contributing to this decay. It is past time that more people start to speak up about this issue and demand a return to basic decency.  The Classy Counter-Culture  For those who notice and despair at this decline in civility, the solution is not to join the noise, but to become a consistent counter-force.  You will meet people with absolutely no class; be classy anyway.  Class is not about wealth or status; it is an inherent quality of grace, integrity, and self-control. It means choosing composure over chaos, thoughtfulness over impulse, and respect over retaliation. When faced with a person lacking class, engaging them on their level only validates their behavior. Choosing to maintain your standards—your grace, your precision, and your calm—is the ultimate, most powerful act of control.  In closing, the proliferation of uncouth behavior is undeniable, but people must be careful, as some of these individuals are so utterly lacking in social graces that they can easily pull you out of character. The unfortunate result is that observers see two people acting like buffoons. When you run across someone totally lacking in social graces, I would advise you to let a fool be a fool, but never reduce yourself to the level of depravity and utter lack of class many have devolved into. We all have bad days, but whenever possible, keep it classy.  Related Link: https://www.hierophantlaw.com
