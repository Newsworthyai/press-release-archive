# Edward Kenneth Loyst Unveils Epic Generational Saga in Kennebec Corners

PETERBOROUGH, ON, April 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Edward Kenneth Loyst, accomplished entrepreneur and author, returns to the literary world with his highly anticipated historical novel, Kennebec Corners—a sweeping generational epic that weaves together war, survival, ambition, and an unforgettable twist.  Loyst, a seasoned businessman who founded over 20 companies and once controlled a public firm before transitioning into advisory roles, channels his keen understanding of resilience and enterprise into this compelling narrative. Following his non-fiction debut, Portrait of an Entrepreneur, he now delivers a richly textured tale spanning 250 years, from the battlefields of the American Revolution to the rugged landscapes of modern Canada.  The novel opens with an evocative scene—an old cabin on Big Cedar Lake, bathed in the eerie glow of a midnight television broadcast. A cigarette falls, a spark fades, and a life quietly slips away. This haunting prologue sets the stage for a story where past and present collide, secrets fester, and legacies are forged in blood and toil.  At its heart, Kennebec Corners follows the Thomas family, descendants of Welsh brothers Jacob and William Thomas, who arrive in Boston just as the American Revolution erupts. Forced into service for the British Crown, they emerge on the losing side—only to be granted land in Canada as United Empire Loyalists.  From dirt farming to moonshine distilling, logging to entrepreneurship, each generation carves its own path through hardship and triumph. The modern thread follows Clay Thomas, a rebellious 1950s youth who flees a fractured home, hones his leadership in the wilderness, and later builds a business—and a stone-walled dream home overlooking Big Cedar Lake. But fate has other plans: extortion, murder, and a jaw-dropping finale upend everything.  Loyst's storytelling blends John Irving's intricate family dynamics with Delia Owens's atmospheric depth. Readers will encounter characters they love, despise, and mourn, a testament to Loyst's ability to craft deeply human narratives.  "This isn't just a historical novel; it's a meditation on legacy," says Loyst. "How do ordinary people endure wars, betrayals, and their own flaws to leave something behind? And what happens when the past refuses to stay buried?"  Edward Kenneth Loyst is no stranger to building legacies. A serial entrepreneur, he founded Franchise Bancorp Inc., overseeing 200+ retail franchises before shifting focus to advisory roles. Writing remains his passion, and Kennebec Corners marks his triumphant fiction debut.
