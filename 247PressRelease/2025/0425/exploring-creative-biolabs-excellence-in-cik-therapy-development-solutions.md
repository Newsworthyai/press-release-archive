# Exploring Creative Biolabs' Excellence in CIK Therapy Development Solutions

SHIRLEY, NY, April 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In cancer therapy, cellular therapies have emerged as a promising approach in immunotherapy. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy is one of the new approaches that are intended to use the body's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells. As a leading biotechnology company, Creative Biolabs is committed to innovation in CIK therapy development, offering one-stop solutions from concept to clinic.  "CIK therapy has an advantage over other cancer immunotherapies," said a researcher in this company. It can kill cancer cells by the transfusion of immune cells that are activated and expanded in vitro.  Creative Biolabs fully understands the complexity in developing and working with CIK cell therapies; they offer a full spectrum of services to facilitate CIK therapy development and also offer a CellRapeutics™ one-stop CIK therapy development service for the convenience of these processes. The complete solution covers various stages of CIK cell therapy development so that the customers receive tailored and streamlined assistance throughout the process, including but not limited to:  • CIK isolation and verification Utilizing advanced techniques to isolate CIK cells with high viability and purity. Rigorous confirmation protocols authenticate the identity and function of the cells, forming a strong foundation for downstream applications. • Activation and expansion optimization Utilizing advanced techniques to optimize cell culture conditions with variable media formulations, feeding schedules, and environmental controls to enhance CIK cell expansion, enabling clients to possess large quantities of functional cells. • In vitro and in vivo characterization CIK cells' complete characterization assays enable the assessment of their cytotoxicity and function in preclinical studies, such as but not limited to CIK-tumor cell cytotoxicity assays, CIK cytokine/chemokine assays, and CIK exhaustion assays.  "CIK cell therapy enhancement is a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy," said a manager at Creative Biolabs. "Through the use of strategies such as gene modification and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the development of CIK therapies can potentially offer new hope for the treatment of cancer.  Creative Biolabs is committed to advancing the therapeutic promise of CIK cells through an orderly, innovative, and scientifically driven process.  "We have the confidence to significantly reduce the time and cost of developing CIK cell therapy solutions, which makes it an attractive option for researchers," said the manager.
