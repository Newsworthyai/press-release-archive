# Ocean Flow Inc. Launches AVANTPET 2.0 — An Eco-Friendly Pet Cooling Mat Made with FDA-Approved Food-Grade Ingredients — on Kickstarter

DOVER, DE, April 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ocean Flow Inc., a developer and manufacturer of sustainable pet cooling products, officially announces the global launch of AVANTPET 2.0, a cooling mat made from FDA-approved food-grade ingredients, on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  As extreme heatwaves become more frequent and severe, pets with limited ability to regulate their body temperature are increasingly vulnerable to dehydration, heatstroke, and in severe cases, shock. While air conditioning may seem simple, excessive use can lead to rising electricity bills, energy waste, and respiratory issues in pets caused by sudden indoor temperature shifts. In response, cooling mats have become an essential item for pet owners. These mats help lower the perceived body temperature of pets without drastically reducing indoor temperatures, offering an energy-efficient and sustainable solution that protects both the environment and pet health.  Although widely used, not all pet cooling mats guarantee the same level of safety or quality. Some low-cost gel-based mats contain chemical ingredients that may pose serious health risks if the mat is punctured or ingested by pets. These materials are also prone to mold growth, and may release microplastics when disposed of, posing risks not only to pet health but also to the environment.  To solve these issues, Ocean Flow Inc. has developed its own proprietary, safer cooling gel formula. Backed by U.S. Patent No. 11,895,983 and South Korean Patent No. 10-2292247, AVANTPET 2.0 uses only FDA-approved food-grade ingredients. Even if pets bite into the mat or accidentally ingest the gel inside, the materials are safe (similar to those found in common foods like ice cream or snack products). The mat also features anti-fungal technology specifically designed to inhibit mold growth by up to 99%, helping maintain hygiene and extend longevity.  Based on Ocean Flow Inc.'s self-developed patented technology, AVANTPET 2.0 features the in-house developed AVANT COOLGEL, which provides a cooling effect approximately 40°F (about 4.4°C) lower than ambient temperature. Its high-viscosity thermal conduction helps quickly circulate and dissipate pet body heat, enabling longer and more stable cooling.  Furthermore, AVANTPET 2.0 is the first South Korean pet product to integrate Polygiene® StayFresh™, a patented antibacterial and odor-control technology from Sweden's leading global hygiene innovator. This inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi while adding water resistance for added durability. The mat's outer cover is made of skin-safe microfiber fabric that has passed non-irritation tests, making it ideal for pets with sensitive skin.  Unlike stiff cooling mats, AVANTPET 2.0 maintains a slushy-soft texture even when frozen, so it's comfortable to use immediately. Its foldable structure enhances portability, making it perfect for outdoor activities, car rides, and travel.  Through this Kickstarter launch, AVANTPET will officially debut as a premium, eco-friendly cooling brand for pets, people, and the planet. AVANTPET 2.0 will go live on Kickstarter on April 23, 2025, with Super Early Bird rewards offered in limited quantities at exclusive discounted prices.   This campaign marks the first step in Ocean Flow Inc.'s mission to promote healthy coexistence between pets and the environment, and represents a bold leap toward globalizing its sustainable technology platform.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/594513020/avantpet-20-eco-friendly-pet-cooling-mat?ref=1qagqw
