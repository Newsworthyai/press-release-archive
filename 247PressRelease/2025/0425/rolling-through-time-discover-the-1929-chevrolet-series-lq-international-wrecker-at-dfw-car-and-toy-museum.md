This 1Â½-ton powerhouse, refurbished in 2019, showcases a perfect blend of vintage aesthetics and robust engineering. Powered by a reliable 194ci inline-six engine paired with a three-speed manual transmission, the Chevrolet Series LQ was built to conquer the toughest jobs of its era.  "The 1929 Chevrolet Series LQ Wrecker isn't just a truck; it's a rolling piece of history," said Ron Sturgeon, proud collector and automotive enthusiast. "Every detail tells a story of durability and innovation, making it a must-see for anyone who appreciates classic vehicles."  The wrecker features a rugged wood bed equipped with a fully operational Manley boom, complete with a crank, chains, J-hooks, and a Beebe Bros. five-ton winch. The truck is packed with vintage charm, boasting details like a steel front bumper, running boards, and a Coca-Cola-branded cooler. Even a quirky chicken enclosure finds its place among the period-correct accessories, adding a touch of whimsy to this industrial workhorse. A sign on the truck says "towing 3 cents per mile or 3 chickens".   Step inside the cab, and you'll be transported to another era. The black vinyl bench seat, wood-rimmed steering wheel, and barrel-style speedometer evoke the grit and determination of early drivers. With mechanical drum brakes on all four corners and solid axles with leaf springs, this wrecker demonstrates how vehicles once handled the road's challenges with rugged grace.
