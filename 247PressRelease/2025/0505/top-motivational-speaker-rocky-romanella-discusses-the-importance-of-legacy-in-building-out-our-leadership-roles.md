# Top Motivational Speaker Rocky Romanella Discusses The Importance Of Legacy In Building Out Our Leadership Roles

WILMINGTON, NC, May 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Leadership is a multi-faceted concept. It is not an exclusive trait, reserved for certain individuals in business, government, or civic organizations. Top motivational speaker and author of the bestselling business book, 'Tighten The Lug Nuts' recently posted an article in his newsletter that addressed this topic. In that article, titled 'Always Be Humble And Kind', he wrote in part:  Leadership is something we all have concerns about. Leadership is a concept that is not reserved for or only applies to certain people in business, government, and civic organizations. The reality is that no matter our age, gender, occupation, educational level, each of us touches and influences other lives.  Through this extension, we are all leaders to someone at some time. It can be a person under our supervision or care, a spouse we honor and live with, or a child we nurture, a student we teach, or a player we coach. It could be as simple as a fellow member of our church or religious affiliation, club, league, or association, but it is usually identified by the fact we have made a positive difference through our actions and examples.  With this sense of responsibility and being lifelong learners, we are constantly in pursuit of knowledge, whether written or experienced, of how to be a good leader and how to improve our skills. We take great pride in the books we have read and where they sit on the best-seller list. I often find that some of the best examples and learning experiences come from the stories we tell and the experiences we share. Sometimes they come from the stories we learned as children or read to our children as parents or grandparents, or a song we love to sing.  Leaders must develop emotional intelligence along with their educational intelligence and business acumen. Sometimes a simple story I find can help people see the bigger picture, promote moral and ethical behavior, and maybe, just maybe, not take ourselves so seriously that we lose sight of the fact that it is not always about us and be open to learning in creative and unusual ways.  For me, I just had one of those moments. We all have listened to songs over the years that you love and know the words to. Even though you know the words and story of how and why it was written, ever now and then the song catches you in a vulnerable moment. The song you know and love becomes an AHA moment, a self-reflective moment that challenges your emotional intelligence.  For me, this just happened with a song I love listening to and enjoy the words. It is by Samuel Timothy McGraw "Tim McGraw" (born May 1, 1967), who is an American country singer and actor. He has released 16 studio albums. 10 of those albums have reached number one on the Top Country Albums charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album Not a Moment Too Soon being the top country album of 1994. In total, McGraw's albums have produced 65 singles, 25 of which have reached number one on the Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay charts.  My favorite song of his, and the one I would like to reference is "Humble and Kind." Although I have sung the song more times than I can count and love his work, this time in a quiet moment I thought what a great inventory of a person's leadership style, approach, values, and ethics. We all need that introspective, soul-searching, reflective view of ourselves.  The words are powerful but simple and basic. Here are some of the lyrics that moved me and created my AHA moment.  Hold the door, say please, say thank you Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie I know you got mountains to climb but Always stay humble and kind When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you When the work you put in is realized Let yourself feel the pride but Always stay humble and kind  Don't expect a free ride from no one Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why Bitterness keeps you from flyin' Always stay humble and kind  The central message for me at that AHA moment was Legacy.  What is your Legacy as a Leader?  As a leader, we grow and develop, take on new challenges or simply move into a new phase of our life, we will be faced with complications and adversity that may set us back. Honesty, perseverance, and trustworthiness will become major factors in overcoming these obstacles and creating our personal brand and our legacy. Along the way, you come to a decision point or stage gate. Our choice is simple but profound in each instance, but a decision must be made.  Our choices are LEAD, FOLLOW, or GET OUT OF THE WAY. If you choose to lead, you will need to be an honest and trusted leader to establish your vision, mission, and values so that those in your care or supervision will trust you enough to follow. As a lifelong learner, you are constantly forging a path to transform yourself into a high-character, high-performance leader. You will never be without challenges both in life and business. But if you are focused and ready to face these complex business challenges and personal changes with discipline, determination, honesty of purpose, and in an ethical manner, you will be successful.
