# Step Back in Time with the 1936 Cord 810 Cabriolet – A True Automotive Masterpiece at DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to announce the exhibition of one of the most stunning and revolutionary cars ever created – the 1936 Cord 810 Cabriolet. Currently on display in the museum, this black beauty is a perfect blend of cutting-edge technology and artful design, showcasing the extraordinary work 1of Auburn Automobile Company's Gordon M. Buehrig. Don't miss your chance to experience this one-of-a-kind vehicle that shook the automotive world upon its debut at the 1935 New York Auto Show.  The Cord 810 Cabriolet was a groundbreaking marvel in both style and engineering when it was introduced. A V-8 engine powers the front wheels, an innovative feature at the time, while shifts are achieved via a "key" on the steering column, actuated by pumping the clutch—just one of many advanced features that made this car truly ahead of its time. The car's bodywork was crafted in semi-unitary fashion, with the engine and transmission mounted to a "stub" frame, bolted to a body structure seamlessly integrated with the frame.  The car's design was nothing short of revolutionary. It eliminated the traditional grille in favor of seven sleek louvers that encircle the car's nose, and the door hinges were cleverly hidden. The hood, a one-piece design, opens from the front, while the headlights are hidden, raised, and closed via a small hand crank on the dashboard, further highlighting the car's forward-thinking design.  Gordon Buehrig's design continues to be admired today by automotive historians and curators alike. In fact, the Cord sedan was even featured in the Museum of Modern Art's 1951 exhibit of "Eight Automobiles," where it was praised for its bold, stylish lines, and the way it seemed to "suggest the driving power of a fast fighter plane." The 1936 Cord 810 Cabriolet epitomizes this artistic brilliance, merging form with function in a way that feels decades ahead of its time.  This Cord model also introduced the innovative disappearing convertible top, one of the first of its kind, giving the car an especially sleek and smooth appearance. When closed, the top is hidden under a flush-fitting tonneau behind the seats, further contributing to the car's sleek and streamlined aesthetic.  The 1936 Cord 810 Cabriolet on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum is a rare treasure in automotive history. It retains its original chassis stub frame, correctly numbered, and while the current engine is a correct replacement, the car remains a stunning example of Buehrig's work—beautiful and functional in equal measure.  "This is a rare opportunity to see a true automotive legend up close," said Ron Sturgeon, Museum Owner.. "The Cord 810 Cabriolet is an absolute masterpiece, and we're excited to share it with car enthusiasts and visitors alike. It's a car that not only represents the pinnacle of 1930s design but also remains a thrilling driving experience even today."
