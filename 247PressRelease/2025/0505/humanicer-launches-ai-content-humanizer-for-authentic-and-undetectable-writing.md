# Humanicer Launches AI Content Humanizer for Authentic and Undetectable Writing

LONDON, ENGLAND, May 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hori Systems Limited, a UK-based technology company, has announced the launch of Humanicer, a new AI-powered platform that transforms AI-generated text into authentic human-like writing that can bypass AI detection systems while keeping the original message intact. As AI-generated text becomes increasingly common in education and online media, Humanicer addresses the growing demand for tools that ensure content remains genuinely human in tone.  Key Features and Benefits  • AI Detection & Humanization: Humanicer analyzes content for AI-generated patterns and then rewrites it to produce human-like text that bypasses AI detectors. The transformed text preserves the original meaning but reads as if written by a person, helping it pass AI checkers like Turnitin. • Multilingual Support: The platform supports over 100 languages, preserving each language's natural flow and cultural nuances, which allows content to reach a global audience with an authentic voice. • Originality & Watermark Protection: Humanicer includes a built-in plagiarism checker and removes hidden AI watermarks from text. This ensures the final output is original and free of any detectable AI markers. • Seamless Integration: The platform offers integrations and an API for popular tools such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace. Organisations can easily incorporate Humanicer into their workflows to automatically humanize AI text or detect AI-generated content. • Easy and Secure: Designed for simplicity, Humanicer requires no technical expertise – users can just copy and paste text to get results. The platform protects all data with 256-bit SSL encryption and privacy safeguards. Flexible pricing plans are available, with a 30-day money-back guarantee for all subscriptions.  Target Audience and Use Cases  • Students & Educators: Helps students ensure AI-assisted essays and assignments pass plagiarism and AI-detection checks (e.g. Turnitin), while enabling educators to uphold academic integrity by verifying the originality of student work. • Writers & Marketers: Enables bloggers and marketing teams to refine AI-written drafts into natural, reader-friendly content. The humanized text retains the author's voice and is search engine optimised. • Businesses & Enterprises: Allows companies to integrate AI content filtering into everyday operations, helping organisations maintain authenticity and combat misinformation.  Advanced AI Technology  Humanicer uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Its models continuously learn from the latest AI writing patterns, yielding a success rate of over 95% in evading AI detectors across various platforms.  "We created Humanicer to empower writers and students to use AI tools without fear," said a spokesperson for Hori Systems Limited. "Our mission is to help users maintain their unique voice and credibility, even when leveraging AI-generated content."  Humanicer is an AI content humanization and detection platform developed by Hori Systems Limited. Founded in 2020 in the United Kingdom, Hori Systems Limited specialises in data processing and AI technology. The Humanicer platform embodies the company's mission to transform machine-generated content into truly human-like writing, enabling users to confidently use AI for content creation without compromising authenticity.
