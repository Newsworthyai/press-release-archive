# Together We Rise: Community Comes Together to Help Residents Displaced by Fire

RALEIGH, NC, October 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Sunday, August 31, a fire devastated Adair Place Apartments, one of CAHEC's communities in Goldsboro, NC. The fire displaced 50 residents, many of whom lost most, if not all, of their belongings. "When we hear about a tragedy like this, our team immediately connects with partners to assess the situation and see how we can help," said Stefanie Lee, Community Relations Manager for CAHEC. "The well-being of our residents is always our priority, and we want them to know they are not facing this alone."  Through CAHEC's Disaster Relief Initiative, a program that provides support to residents in times of catastrophic events or crises, we were able to provide immediate assistance to displaced residents. Through the support of Remnant Management, Centrant Community Capital, First Bank, and many individual donors, CAHEC was able to distribute gift cards so families could purchase the items they need most. Because of this collective effort, CAHEC nearly tripled our contribution to the property, ensuring families had greater support during this critical time.   The Goldsboro community also quickly rallied to support those affected. A local church offered to help with temporary housing, while local businesses and community members stepped in to donate food items, clothing, school supplies, and other essentials. "It's been inspiring to see so many people come together to support our residents," shared Teresa Narron, Director of Operations for Pendergraph Management. "The generosity of this community is making a real difference for families who are starting over."  CAHEC is a community development organization that strengthens communities by providing affordable housing and supportive service initiatives to residents in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. CAHEC engages in diverse product areas, including low-income housing tax credits, historic tax credits, new markets tax credits, and renewable energy credits. Additionally, CAHEC offers loan programs, wellness and education initiatives for residents, affordable housing development, and property management services.
