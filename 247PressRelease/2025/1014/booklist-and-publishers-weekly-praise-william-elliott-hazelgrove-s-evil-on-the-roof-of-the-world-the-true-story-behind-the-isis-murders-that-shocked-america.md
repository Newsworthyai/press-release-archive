# Booklist and Publishers Weekly Praise William Elliott Hazelgrove's Evil on the Roof of the World — The True Story Behind the ISIS Murders That Shocked America

CHICAGO, IL, October 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In 2018, the world was horrified when news broke that two young American cyclists, Lauren Geoghegan and Jay Austin, were murdered by ISIS radicals on a remote highway in Tajikistan. The attack made international headlines, symbolizing the collision between youthful idealism and violent extremism. Now, bestselling author William Elliott Hazelgrove reveals the full, untold story in Evil on the Roof of the World (Bloomsbury Academic, Nov. 2025).  Drawing on the couple's journals, blog posts, and extensive interviews with their friends and families, Hazelgrove takes readers beyond the headlines to explore who Lauren and Jay really were—what drove them to leave Washington, D.C. and set out to bike the world, and how their journey of wonder and discovery ended in tragedy on the Pamir Highway, the fabled "roof of the world."  Booklist calls the book "a story of searching humanity," praising Hazelgrove's portrait of "a couple in search of something bigger than the everyday, who became victims of an ideological war." Reviewer Jeff Connelly adds that "fans of Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild will appreciate this story of searching humanity."  Publishers Weekly likewise praises Hazelgrove's "chilling true crime tale," writing that his "utilitarian prose...lets the facts of the case carry the narrative forward" and concluding, "Readers will be aghast." The review highlights Hazelgrove's ability to illuminate the beauty and peril of the couple's global journey, from encounters with elephants in Africa to suspicion and hardship across Europe and Central Asia.  Hazelgrove, a novelist and historian known for Hemingway's Attic and Madam President: The Secret Presidency of Edith Wilson, brings his signature narrative depth to a story that captivated the world—and now finally reveals the truth behind it.
