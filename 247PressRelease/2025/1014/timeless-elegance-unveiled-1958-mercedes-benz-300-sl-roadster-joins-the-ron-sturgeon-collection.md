# Timeless Elegance Unveiled: 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster Joins The Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, October 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase one of the most iconic automobiles ever crafted: the 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster, resplendent in radiant red and proudly part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection. A masterpiece born from the legendary "Gullwing" coupe, the 300 SL Roadster elevated performance, sophistication, and drivability into a realm all its own—captivating enthusiasts, collectors, and celebrities alike for generations.  First revealed at the 1957 Geneva Motor Show, the 300 SL Roadster delivered not only heart-pounding performance with its upgraded 240-horsepower six-cylinder engine but also unparalleled refinement. A redesigned suspension tamed the car's aggressive handling while a sleeker, open-top silhouette offered a driving experience that was as luxurious as it was exhilarating. With lower door sills and superior cabin comfort compared to its predecessor, the Roadster quickly became the ultimate symbol of style, speed, and success.  Production remained exceptionally limited, with just 1,858 Roadsters built between 1957 and 1963—only 324 crafted for the 1958 model year—preserving its aura of exclusivity. Today, the 300 SL Roadster continues to reign supreme as one of the most collectible and desirable vehicles in automotive history, a true testament to Mercedes-Benz's pursuit of engineering excellence and timeless beauty.  "The 300 SL Roadster is everything a car should be—fast, elegant, and exhilarating to drive," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a rolling work of art that's just as breathtaking today as it was over half a century ago. We're honored to share this extraordinary piece of automotive history with our visitors."  The 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster can be admired now at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where it shines as a beacon of design brilliance and mechanical innovation.
