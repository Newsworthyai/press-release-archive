# From Basement to Beacon: François Miglio Builds Art &amp; Education Space in Chimayó, NM

CHIMAYÓ, NM, October 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After decades of perseverance, artist François Miglio is transforming his home in historic Chimayó into a 2,000-square-foot Education & Art Space — a sustainable cultural hub that will become the working base for the Miglio Foundation's exhibitions and educational programs.  Using pumice and adobe, Miglio is personally building the space from the ground up, dedicating eight hours a day to his lifelong vision. The new facility will feature a permanent gallery, rotating exhibitions, and a video room for immersive art and science experiences, while also providing opportunities for students and the community to learn and collaborate. To support the project, Miglio has launched a crowdfunding campaign at https://gofund.me/5b42430e9.  Miglio's journey to this point has been extraordinary. Born in France, he moved to the United States at the age of forty, speaking little English. For 15 years, he lived in a basement without windows or running water while promoting his art. His persistence led to exhibitions and lectures at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Toulouse.  "During my exhibitions and talks at universities and cultural institutions," Miglio says, "I realized that my art could be understood and appreciated by some of the most erudite scholars—whose vast knowledge often lies beyond my own reach. Yet I also discovered that it speaks just as naturally to the innocence of young children, and to anyone who still possesses a sense of wonder and curiosity. That realization inspired me to build, with my own hands, a space where people can experience art directly — a place where imagination and learning meet in real life."  To complete construction, Miglio has launched a personal crowdfunding campaign seeking $80,000. The funds will go toward materials, infrastructure, and equipment for the space.  Miglio has already invested $40,000 of his own savings into the project and has personally committed an additional $30,000. Once completed, the building will serve as the future home of the Miglio Foundation, hosting exhibitions, workshops, and programs that explore the intersections of art, science, and philosophy.  "This foundation isn't just about art — it's about possibility," Miglio says. "It's about showing that creativity and education have the power to transform lives, no matter where you begin".  Situated along the scenic route between Santa Fe and Taos, the Chimayó space will stand as both a cultural destination and a testament to Miglio's decades-long commitment to art, education, and sustainability.
