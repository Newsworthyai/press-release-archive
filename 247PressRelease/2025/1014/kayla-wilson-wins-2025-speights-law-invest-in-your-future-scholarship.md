CANTON, GA, October 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Speights Law is proud to announce that Kayla Wilson, a first-year nursing student at Georgia College & State University, has been selected as the recipient of the 2025 Speights Law Invest in Your Future Scholarship, valued at $2,500.  The financial award is designed to get students thinking about real-world money skills—budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management—and how to apply them in daily life.  Kayla stood out among applicants for her commitment to academic excellence and thoughtful approach to financial planning. She says the scholarship will help her manage the cost of her nursing studies while guiding her to make wise financial choices throughout her life.   She plans to strengthen her budgeting skills, prepare for student loan repayment, and begin building credit, all while learning more about long-term saving and investing through finance courses.  Kayla's commitment to financial planning goes hand in hand with her passion for nursing. She expects to graduate in 2029 with a nursing degree from Georgia College & State University and hopes to specialize in pediatric care. Her career interests include working in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or continuing her education to become a nurse anesthetist.  Kayla embodies service and leadership beyond the classroom. She spent four years in high school sports medicine and is now part of Zeta Tau Alpha sorority, along with campus outreach and Young Life, two groups that provide service opportunities for young people.  Her passion for nursing, commitment to service, and determination to build a strong financial foundation reflect exactly what this scholarship was designed to celebrate.  The Speights Law Invest in Your Future Scholarship will return in 2026, continuing the firm's mission to support ambitious students preparing for academic and financial success.
