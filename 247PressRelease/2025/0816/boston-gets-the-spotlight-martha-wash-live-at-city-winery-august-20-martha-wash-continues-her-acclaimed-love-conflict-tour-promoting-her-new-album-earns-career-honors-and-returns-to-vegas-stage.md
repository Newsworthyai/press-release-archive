Known for her unmatched vocals and decades-long influence in dance, soul, and house music, Martha is bringing Boston a fresh, deeply personal performance that celebrates her legacy while charting bold new creative territory.  Following her August tour dates, Martha will be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award on October 4, 2025, by the St. Louis Blues Museum for her trailblazing contributions to American music. The museum will recognize her expansive career—from her gospel roots and groundbreaking work with Sylvester and The Weather Girls to her powerful solo catalog and industry-changing advocacy for vocal artists' rights.  Then on November 16, Wash joins her legendary peers for a high-powered return to Las Vegas with her First Ladies of Disco Show residency at Myron's at The Smith Center. The high-energy revue features showstopping performances and celebrates the women who shaped the golden era of disco, soul, and dance music — past, present, and future. The show is co-produced by Martha Wash and her longtime manager and business partner, James Washington.  After a brief holiday break, the Love & Conflict Tour will resume in early 2026, with new cities and international dates to be announced.
