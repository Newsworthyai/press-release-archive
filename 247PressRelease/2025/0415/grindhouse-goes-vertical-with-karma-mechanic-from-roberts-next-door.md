# Grindhouse Goes Vertical with Karma Mechanic from Roberts Next Door

LOS ANGELES, CA, April 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- One thing is certain: Robert Christopher Smith (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8314010/) and Robert Banks (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6887165/ ) enjoy going against the grain and taking big chances in their film and episodic entertainment ventures from Roberts Next Door LLC. With "Karma Mechanic" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34718813/), the gritty, experimental 20-chapter vertical series, currently being released across platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, BlueSky, Threads and more, this may be more true than ever. While the mobisode-driven concept of vertical series has taken off like a rocket in the entertainment world, there is an overwhelming sameness to the hundreds– if not thousands – of these series released to this point. All are slickly polished, full of loud music and sound effects with very limited types of cinematography, and stories that generally focus on very wealthy people, very commonly bankers and believe it or not… werewolves. Smith and Banks wanted to develop something darker than most were used to, and wanted the hook of the series to be its "puzzlebox" nature.   Smith says, "I wanted to really lean into what seems to make this sub-genre work, and that is the super-short format. Our goal with 'Karma Mechanic' was to develop something that would appeal to fans of David Lynch movies, or his show Twin Peaks, or the show LOST from a few years ago." Because their production company is so new and their idea so on the fringe, the duo decided to forego even seeking financing and chose to pay for the entire series out of their own pockets personally. "Paying for our project with our own money is just one more way that we sidestep the normal process and really break the rules in Hollywood!" Banks gleefully adds in. While that decision kicks open the doors of creative freedom for "Karma Mechanic", it also severely limits the budget for the production and increases the pressure on Smith, Banks, and Roberts Next Door.  This seems to be the type of pressure that makes them, their projects and their company thrive, though, and it has certainly helped them lock in on their preferred collaborators. For the fourth time, they found themselves reaching out to Stacy Marie Turner who began working with Smith even before Banks came along. Smith explains, "David Ruano and I cast Stacy in 'Vengeance Turns' as Mrs. Paine, one of the biddies. On and off the set, we all really clicked and have developed an incredible working relationship with Stacy. She is one of the family at this point." Stacy was the first call they made, and before they could even explain the pay to her, she was jumping in to accept the gig no matter what it was and no matter the pay. Other repeat offenders on the cast of 'Karma Mechanic' include Erin Anne Gray, the stunning and "worldfamous A.D.A Heather Grey-Kirk" in the vertical series met the Roberts next door in a small but crucial supporting role at the end of upcoming horror thriller 'Succubus Next Door'. She is joined by Jonathan Jacob Pekar, an unforgettable crime-boss in 'Karma Mechanic' who also plays a critical supporting role in 'Succubus Next Door' and has a great easter-egg moment at the end of 'SPREAD: Pigs to Slaughter' currently being entered into film festivals worldwide. While others like Jessica Chaves, who plays the amazing Iris Saxe in the vertical series, may be dipping their toes in the water with this team for the first time, both Smith and Banks have a strong desire to see everyone return for other projects.   Banks makes it very clear. "When you are working on a project like 'Karma Mechanic' that is so different from everything else that is out there, you really need to work with folks who have faith in what we're trying to do. For us, it makes it possible to shoot something more original, edgy, and maybe risky when everyone involved is willing to stand on the ledge with you!" As working actors themselves, Smith and Banks know it is very important for everyone involved on a project to get paid for their work, too. Smith clarifies, "However, since we aren't exactly paying the most competitive rates, it is nice to have a team like this who are as focused on the project itself as we are." In this case, the result is 'Karma Mechanic', perhaps the most original, exciting, and attention-grabbing vertical series ever.  ABOUT "KARMA MECHANIC" "Karma Mechanic" is a hybrid project, being released as both vertical "mobisodes" and as a short feature film from Roberts Next Door LLC. Cofounders, Robert Christopher Smith and Rob Banks, co-wrote the series based on their original one-act play "Killer Session". The team will also co-direct, co-star, co-produce, and release "Karma Mechanic" as a 20-episode vertical series for TikTok and Instagram as well as other social media sites as well as a feature film.
