The track speaks to a new generation while honoring the group's legacy, reminding fans of their empowering message they have spread since the beginning. The band's very first single, "Never Underestimate the Power of a Woman," composed by Cheryl Cooley, secured them their first record deal—proving their message of strength, unity, and womanhood is more relevant than ever.  The 2025 tour will stop in key cities across the country, including: Philadelphia – May 14 Bethesda, MD – May 17 New York – May 18 Las Vegas – May 31  With a loyal fan base spanning generations, Klymaxx featuring Cheryl Cooley continues to prove that their music is timeless.
