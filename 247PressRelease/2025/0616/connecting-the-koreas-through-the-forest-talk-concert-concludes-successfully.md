# Connecting the Koreas Through the Forest Talk Concert Concludes Successfully

DAEGU, KOREA, June 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On June 7, 2025, the peace-themed talk concert, "Connecting the Koreas Through the Forest," was successfully held at the Nakdong River Victory Memorial Hall in Daegu, South Korea, drawing the participation of approximately 400 local citizens.  The event was jointly hosted and organized by the Central Committee of the Korea Forest Protection Association and the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Peace Promotion Committee. Using the symbolic theme of the "forest" — a concept transcending ideologies and political divisions — the event invited citizens and youth to reflect on inter-Korean harmony and cultural solidarity. Like planting a tree, the program aimed to sow the seeds of peace through citizen participation and empathy.  "Trees mirror the cultural health of a society. Through forest cooperation, we can restore the well being of our communities," said Mr. Tae-jo Heo, chairman of the Korea Forest Protection Association, who emphasized the importance and potential of ecological exchanges between North and South Korea.  "Unification is not a political slogan — it begins with efforts to understand and engage with each other," said Mr. Hyung-jun Ahn, former head of the Daegu Chapter of the Korea Vietnam War Veterans Association.  Ms. Seo-young Kim, a North Korean defector who survived three forced repatriations and a nine-year journey to freedom, also shared her thoughts on unification and her testimony drew heartfelt responses from the audience. "Unification is not about politics; it is a deeply human hope to see loved ones again."  In honor of Patriots and Veterans Month in Korea, bouquets of appreciation were presented to Mr. Young-bong Ryu (president of the Korean War Veterans Association, Nam-gu Daegu), Mr. Il-nam Jeon (president of the Vietnam Agent Orange Veterans Association, Nam-gu), Mr. Jae-yeon Choi (Vietnam War veteran), and Mr. Hyung-jun Ahn, honoring their sacrifice and legacy.  During the Q&A session, audience members openly shared personal questions and reflections on unification. The event concluded with a unified shout from the stage: "Connecting the Koreas Through the Forest! We Are One!"  Mr. Heo, the event host, noted, "This concert did not start with a grand political discourse, but with genuine empathy between individuals — and that is where peace begins."
