# Shaina Zazzaro Crowned Mrs. New York American 2025

ROCHESTER, NY, June 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Shaina Zazzaro, the reigning Mrs. Rochester 2025, has officially been crowned Mrs. New York American 2025 following her standout performance at the state pageant held on June 15, 2025. The event took place at the RIT Inn & Conference Center, where Zazzaro earned top honors and will now advance to the national stage to compete in the Mrs. American 2025 Pageant in Las Vegas at the iconic Westgate Resort & Casino.  Zazzaro, a successful entrepreneur, motivational speaker, and mother of two, is the founder and CEO of Effortlessly Healthy, a top 100 company in Rochester and ranked as the #8 fastest-growing Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (MWBE) in 2024. Now a multimillion-dollar company, Effortlessly Healthy is breaking the statistic that only 1.9% of women-owned businesses ever generate $1 million or more in annual revenue. Her story is one of resilience â€” she launched her business during a period of homelessness, lost her sister to a heroin overdose in 2018, and overcame a 60-pound weight loss journey.  Raised by a single mother who worked tirelessly to provide despite overwhelming obstacles, Shaina grew up witnessing firsthand the power of determination and sacrifice. Those early life experiences laid the foundation for the resilience and work ethic she's known for today.  Shaina is also the creator of the widely shared "One More Minute Rule," a mental resilience strategy that encourages individuals to push through tough moments by holding on just one minute longer.  Zazzaro's impact goes beyond the stage. As a breakout facilitator at the 2nd Annual JA Young Women's Leadership Summit, she empowered nearly 80 high-performing high school students with her entrepreneurial journey and practical strategies for resilience. She even went a step further by establishing scholarships for two attendees, opening doors for the next generation of leaders.  She is also scheduled to speak at the Rochester Rotary on June 17, 2025, and has set a bold goal of delivering 100 speaking engagements throughout her reign as Mrs. New York American. Her passion for youth empowerment and her commitment to service make her a role model for young women across the country.  David Mammano of Mammano Ventures called her "a game-changing entrepreneur and an electrifying speaker," praising her unmatched "passion and power" and calling her "the real deal."  EVENT DETAILS: - National Competition: Mrs. American 2025 Pageant - Location: Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino - Date: Fall 2025 (TBD) - Representing: New York  As she prepares for nationals, Zazzaro remains committed to community outreach, mentoring, and promoting her mission to make wellness accessible and purpose-driven leadership the standard. She is also scheduled to speak at the Rochester Rotary on June 17, 2025, where she will share her journey of resilience and leadership with local business and civic leaders.
