# Thousands Attend Whittier No Kings Demonstration

WHITTIER, CA, June 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Thousands of people protested Trump's policies at the No Kings demonstration in Whittier on Saturday. People packed the sidewalks in front of City Hall and on Painter Avenue. They marched up Greenleaf Ave and down Painter St. People held unique homemade signs and screamed as drivers honked in support.   The crowd marched from City Hall down Penn St. and then up Greenleaf Avenue. They took up the entire northbound lane and sidewalk. They turned around as they approached Hadley Street and took up the entire southbound lane as they paraded back to City Hall.   "This action is to parody Trump's military parade and to oppose his authoritarian tactics," said organizer Rich Procida of the Truth and Democracy Coalition. "We don't need the military in the streets. Trump's heavy-handed tactics and divisive rhetoric are tools used by dictators to terrorize their populations and suppress dissent." Trump's divisive rhetoric and name-calling certainly say nothing about the people who came together to fight back.  Organizers intended the "Whittier No Kings/Kick Out the Clowns Parade" to be festive and patriotic. It was Flag Day. People brought American flags. Some hung them upside down, a traditional signal of dire distress and extreme danger.   Many people were fearful after the ICE raids and the prior evening's confrontation with police after an upset city council meeting. "People are afraid because of the tactics ICE is using," said Whittier resident Maggie Moe.   Organizers intended the Whittier No Kings/Kick Out the Clowns Parade to be more like a party than a protest. People brought loudspeakers, and artists played music. They chanted, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go!"  The crowd lingered around City Hall, holding their signs and playing music as cars honked in support and loud vehicles revved their engines. Some stayed in uptown to hold signs and patronize the businesses. Organizers encouraged people to support the businesses. Everyone appeared to enjoy this positive and peaceful action to defend democracy against authoritarianism and state violence.  The Truth and Democracy Coalition works to build a mass movement to save democracy. We confront divisive propaganda and focus on bringing Americans of different religions and ideologies together to defend democracy from the threat of authoritarianism. Our vision is to bring men and women, Republicans and Democrats, radicals and moderates, Socialists, Liberals, and Conservatives together to defend the Constitution and fight for democracy.  We value freedom, truth, and prosperity. Individuals must be free to criticize public policy, advocate for their interests, and decide who should lead them. To this end, citizens must be critical of the information and propaganda they consume. Individuals are the decision makers in a democracy. They need to be educated and informed. Only democracy frees people to speak their truth and advocate for justice and prosperity.
