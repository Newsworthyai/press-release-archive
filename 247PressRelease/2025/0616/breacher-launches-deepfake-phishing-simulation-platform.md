# Breacher Launches Deepfake Phishing Simulation Platform

ORLANDO, FL, June 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, Breacher, a cybersecurity innovator announced the launch of the Breacher Platform: the first agentic, cross-channel deepfake phishing simulator designed for Managed Security Partners, Awareness Training Managers and Consulting Firms, delivering advanced, compliance-ready, and revenue-generating security services.  The Breacher Platform sets a new industry benchmark, using proprietary AI technology to generate realistic, indistinguishable deepfakes across email, phone (voice), SMS, and video. This realism enables Security Practitioners to expose gaps in client defenses and demonstrate resilience against deepfake social engineering threats—exceeding both compliance mandates and client expectations.  "Legacy phishing tools and static templates simply can't keep up with today's AI-driven threat landscape," said Jason Thatcher, Co-founder of Breacher. "Breacher gives partners the edge with deepfake simulations so convincing, even experienced SOC teams struggle to detect them. This is not tomorrow's problem—it's today's demand, for security and compliance alike."  Key features and differentiators of the Breacher Platform include: Unmatched Deepfake Realism: Proprietary AI creates authentic, customizable attacks across all common communication channels—voice, SMS, Video Conferencing and Email. Multi-Channel, Agentic Simulation: Security providers can mirror modern attack campaigns, testing the full breadth of a client's people, process, and technology. Recurring Revenue Engine: Breacher enables partners to offer Deepfake/AI attack simulation as a billable, recurring service—relevant to every account and regulatory cycle. Flexible Delivery Models: The platform is available as self-service, fully managed, or white-labeled—allowing security partners to scale Breacher within their brand and operational model. Compliance-Ready Reporting: Automated reports provide irrefutable proof to clients, regulators, and boards—streamlining both security and compliance workflows. Instant Deployment: Fast setup requires no extensive retraining or integration, making advanced simulation accessible to companies of all sizes.  "The security posture of most companies is based on an outdated model of attacker sophistication. Generative AI has enabled an entirely new type of attack focusing on human vulnerabilities. It also significantly lowers the learning curve and cost - what Metasploit and Kali Linux did for pentesting is now happening for social engineering."  The Breacher Platform launches August 1st. With prelaunch spots already full they are opening 20 application-only early access partner spots for security providers ready to differentiate with the most advanced AI security testing available. A second round will open September 1st. Qualifying providers can sign up for a demonstration and apply for early access on Breacher.ai.  https://breacher.ai/solutions/simulation-platform/  About Breacher Breacher is dedicated to empowering busy security teams, with a flexible and easy to deploy solution, to deliver unmatched protection for their clients against deepfake cyber threats. By harnessing cutting-edge AI for true-to-life security simulations, Breacher enables partners to proactively strengthen defenses and demonstrate real-world resilience.
