# Back to Work, Back in Time: 1978 Datsun Pickup Rolls into DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, June 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A hardworking classic with vintage character has arrived at the DFW Car & Toy Museum as part of the renowned Ron Sturgeon Collection. The 1978 Datsun Pickup is a no-frills, tough-as-nails workhorse that delivers old-school reliability and charm straight from the late '70s.  Under the hood, this Datsun is powered by a 2.0-liter inline-four engine paired with a five-speed manual transmission, offering the kind of analog driving experience that's become a rare delight in today's automotive world. With power-assisted front disc brakes, this classic truck brings a surprisingly modern touch to its braking performance.  "The Datsun Pickup is the blueprint for durable, dependable small trucks. It's a classic that never stopped being useful," says museum founder Ron Sturgeon. "This one has just enough patina to prove it's lived a life—and that's part of what makes it special."  Inside the cab, the pickup keeps things refreshingly simple with a stock AM radio, manual heater, and glove compartment—though the door may take some coaxing. The faux wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer, along with gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, providing a dashboard that's all about function over flash.  Visible wear on the outer driver-side seat bolsters is a reminder that this truck was built to be used, not pampered—making it a favorite among vintage truck lovers who appreciate a ride with both grit and story.  See this classic Datsun up close at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where more than 200 collector vehicles and 3,000 nostalgic toys are on display in a 150,000-square-foot celebration of automotive history.
