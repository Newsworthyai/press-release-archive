# Clean and Simple Cleaning Highlights the Link Between Home Cleanliness and Mental Health as Stress Levels Rise in Washington

EVERETT, WA, November 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With stress levels at an all-time high and families juggling work, kids, and daily responsibilities, Clean and Simple Cleaning is raising awareness of an often-overlooked mental health factor: the state of the home environment. Research continues to show a strong connection between clutter, anxiety, and overall well-being, prompting many families to turn to trusted house cleaning in Lynnwood WA to reduce overwhelm and support a healthier lifestyle.  Home mess and unfinished chores are two of the most common sources of daily stress, especially for two-income households, busy parents, seniors, and individuals managing health concerns. Clean and Simple Cleaning, a Lynnwood-based cleaning company with more than 30 years in the industry, says they've seen a growing number of clients reach out—not just for convenience—but for peace of mind.  "People are incredibly stretched thin today," said Stacie Sutton, owner of Clean and Simple Cleaning. "A messy home doesn't just look overwhelming—it feels overwhelming. When our team steps in, we're not just cleaning; we're helping families breathe easier, feel calmer, and reclaim their time. That's the impact we're most proud of."  The company notes several key stress-related trends among local homeowners:  Clutter increases cortisol levels, making people feel more anxious and less in control.  Lack of time to keep up with chores leads to guilt and mental fatigue.  Parents and pet owners often feel added pressure to maintain a healthy home environment.  Seniors and those with mobility challenges experience frustration when they can't manage household tasks the way they used to.  Busy professionals report difficulty relaxing when their space feels chaotic.  Clean and Simple Cleaning offers weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly recurring cleaning services, as well as deep cleaning, move-in/move-out cleaning, and small office cleaning—all designed to help reduce stress and give families more breathing room. Their professional cleaners are background-checked, trained, insured, and known for consistent, high-quality results.  "As a local business, we're deeply connected to the community," added Ms. Sutton. "We understand the pressure families are under. Providing reliable house cleaning in Lynnwood WA is one way we can help people live healthier, less stressful lives."  The company encourages residents to think of home cleaning not as a luxury, but as a support system—one that contributes to mental clarity, better focus, lower stress, and more time for the things that matter.  Clean and Simple Cleaning continues to advocate for mental wellness, highlighting how a clean and organized home can support emotional health, especially during busy or demanding seasons of life.  Clean and Simple Cleaning has proudly served Lynnwood and surrounding communities for more than 30 years.
