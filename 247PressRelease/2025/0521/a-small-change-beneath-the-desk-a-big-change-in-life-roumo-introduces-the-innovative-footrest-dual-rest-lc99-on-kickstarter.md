# A Small Change Beneath the Desk, A Big Change in Life! — ROUMO Introduces the Innovative Footrest 'Dual Rest LC99' on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It is well understood how prolonged hours spent sitting at a desk can negatively impact the health of modern individuals. One brand seeks to offer a simple yet effective solution to this challenge by bringing a meaningful transformation beneath the desk. This May, "ROUMO", a brand specializing in desk solutions, will unveil the innovative footrest "Dual Rest LC99" through the global crowdfunding platform "Kickstarter".  ROUMO has led innovation in the desk environment through its "original two-tier footrest system", the *Dual Rest*, which supports both posture correction and physical rest. Since its initial launch in 2020, the Dual Rest has become an essential accessory for improving comfort and productivity at the desk, shifting the paradigm of workspace ergonomics.  Making its first appearance on Kickstarter, the "Dual Rest LC99" was developed with close attention to the working habits of U.S. users, particularly those who wear shoes while working at their desks. Constructed from a durable ABS frame and easy-to-maintain materials, it maintains cleanliness even in footwear environments. Additionally, it incorporates "CORDURA® re/cor™ recycled nylon", offering an eco-friendly solution  The "Dual Rest LC99", combining a footrest and ottoman in one, provides a total of 18 levels of front and rear height and angle adjustment, enabling users to fine-tune the product to their body type and work environment. Thanks to its stable frame, users can easily reposition the footrest with their legs, and the anti-slip supports ensure stable weight-bearing performance.  To commemorate the Kickstarter launch, ROUMO is offering an additional accessory: a blanket made with 3M Thinsulate™ fabric. Highly insulating and lightweight, the blanket can be used as a lap throw or worn over the shoulders. It is especially useful in indoor spaces where central heating and cooling are not adjustable, and it comes with a dedicated carry pouch for added convenience.  Moreover, the Dual Rest LC99 features a cushion pad made from the same eco-friendly CORDURA® re/cor™ fabric, which is water-resistant and easy to clean. This allows the product to be used comfortably while wearing shoes, without worry about stains or contamination.  With the LC99, ROUMO aims to further strengthen its mission of enabling healthier and more focused desk habits for all. A company representative stated, "A small change beneath your desk can lead to a significant improvement in your health and concentration. We believe the LC99 will bring meaningful and practical change to users' daily lives."  The Dual Rest LC99 will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting May 20, 2025.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/321469708/versatile-high-performance-2nd-gen-footrest-dual-rest?ref=7qd4x4
