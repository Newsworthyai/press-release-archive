# EHC Transitions to Employee-Ownership

FORT MYERS, FL, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- EHC, Inc., a trailblazer in the construction industry renowned for its comprehensive pre-construction, earthwork, and infrastructure services, is excited to announce the transition to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), marking a significant milestone in the company's journey.   Since Jeff Hunt founded EHC in 1990, EHC's growth has been driven by a commitment to rewarding dedication and leadership. Over the years, Greg Hunt joined in the early 1990s and became a co-owner, followed by Shane Graves in 1998 and Tony Hamilton in 2005, both of whom gained ownership in 2014.  This tradition of expanding ownership now reaches its fullest expression. Through the ESOP, every EHC employee has the opportunity to become an owner. This transition honors the site construction company's history of sharing success with those who help build it and extends that opportunity to the entire team.  The ESOP also enabled Jeff and Greg to retire from daily operations, while ensuring continuity and experienced leadership as Tony Hamilton became President and Shane Graves became Vice President of Operations. Importantly, Jeff, Greg, Tony, and Shane all continue to serve on EHC's Board of Directors, providing invaluable guidance as the company moves forward.  "With strong financials and a bright outlook, EHC's future is brighter than ever," said Tony Hamilton EHC President. "The ESOP empowers our current and future employees, strengthens our culture, and ensures that everyone shares in the rewards of our continued growth and success. Together, we are building a legacy where every employee is invested in EHC's future."  ABOUT EHC, INC.
