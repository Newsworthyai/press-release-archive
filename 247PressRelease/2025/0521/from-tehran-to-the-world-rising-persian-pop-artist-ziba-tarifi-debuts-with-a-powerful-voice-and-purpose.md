Persian pop newcomer Ziba Tarifi is poised to make her mark on the global music scene with her debut, offering a heartfelt blend of melodic pop infused with emotional depth and cultural pride.  Deeply inspired by the iconic Googoosh, Ziba carries forward the legacy of strong Persian female voices while forging her own path. Her sound is defined by a soft yet powerful vocal presence, effortlessly weaving vulnerability with resilience—each note a call to uplift, empower, and unite.  Her music speaks directly to the Persian experience, both within Iran and across the globe. Through her lyrics and melodies, Ziba addresses themes of identity, strength, and hope.  "I want my music to be a light—for my people, for women, for anyone who's ever felt voiceless," Ms. Tarifi shares. "We've inherited so much beauty and pain. I'm here to turn that into something that sings."  With her debut single This I Promise launching next month in June, Ziba invites listeners into a soundscape that is both intimately personal and universally resonant. This I Promise will be the first track from Ziba's debut album The Lioness.  Ziba Tarifi is more than a singer—she's a storyteller, a cultural bridge, and a fresh chapter in Persian music.
