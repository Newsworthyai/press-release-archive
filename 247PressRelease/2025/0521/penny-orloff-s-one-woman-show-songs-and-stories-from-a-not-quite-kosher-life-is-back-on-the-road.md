# Penny Orloff's One Woman Show, Songs And Stories From A Not-Quite-Kosher Life, Is Back On The Road

WILMINGTON, NC, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Penny Orloff recently announced that her one woman show, Songs And Stories From A Not Quite Kosher Life, is back on the road.  Orloff's first one-woman show, inspired by her the novel, 'Jewish Thighs On Broadway,' played to standing ovations and critical acclaim, including sold-out houses and rave reviews for its premiere in the Seattle Fringe Theater Festival in March, 2000. The show toured the U.S. for a decade, including a successful off-Broadway run in 2005. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive:  "Penny Orloff… assured and excellent in every way." New York Times  "This funny, multi-faceted story of one woman's journey through Showbiz entrances from its first word to the last." Seattle Fringe Review  "Ravishingly descriptive and continuously entertaining...incredible warmth, wit, charm... Brilliant!" Bellevue Post Intelligencer  "…a sweet and charming presence, narrating the story while acting an assortment of characters... her self-effacing humor is enjoyable and authentic. She sings in a soft, legit soprano …Penny Orloff is so darn likeable!" Broadway World  Her new solo show is bursting with heirloom melodies, stories of her Jewish immigrant family, and tales from her zany life in show business.  "As a Jewish woman, I'm Not Quite Kosher without marriage and children," she says. "Still, I am the Keeper of the Lore. I am the only one left to remember the stories, to sing the songs."  The show is available for small venues, house concerts, fundraisers, senior centers, and community events. A preview of the show is available at YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RanMdQxAwPY. Booking information is available at her website at https://PennyOrloff.com.  The ebook version of the underlying novel, 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway,' has achieved bestseller status in a number of categories: Comedy, Biographies of Comedians, Humorous Literary Fiction, and Theatre Biographies.  Orloff's novel is populated by an oddball immigrant family, on-again-off-again lovers, diets from Hell, and a Rogue's Gallery from the Showbiz underworld; and every scene has readers laughing out loud.  Abigail Paine, born Miriam Rosen, has been in love with Showbiz and the performing arts since childhood, perpetually fantasizing herself as the Little Trouper Who Finds Stardom and True Love by the end of the movie. After a hundred shows and a hundred one-night stands, love and fame still elude her, and she'd rather eat cyanide than face another audition. Complicating her search for the Busby Berkeley ending is her primitive alter-ego: The Beast. This creature can track, kill, dismember, and devour an entire cheesecake; and kick the stuffing out of smaller muggers on the sidewalks of New York. When Abigail finds love at long last, she is faced with an agonizing choice: Showbiz or The Guy. As she laments, "Breaking into this Business is like breaking into Fort Knox; breaking out, we're talking Alcatraz."  Metropolitan Opera Leading Tenor Jacques Trussel called 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway', "Ravishingly descriptive and continuously entertaining... the best book I have ever read on this subject... incredible warmth, wit, charm... Brilliant!"  Theater Puget Sound's review said, " . . . passionate. . . Wonderfully evocative language, lots of humor, tears where they belong...thoroughly enjoyable."  One Amazon reviewer wrote, "Fun book! I highly recommend it. Characters are bigger than life, and delightfully screwball. Everyone's Jewish family nightmare! Lots of laughs." Another stated, "No doubt the most fun I've had reading for many years. Read it and laugh!"  Penny Orloff is available for media interviews and can be reached at Penny@pennyorloff.com. 'Jewish Thighs On Broadway' is available at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Thighs-Broadway-Misadventures-Trouper-ebook/dp/B0DTC15NGZ/ref=sr_1_1?.
