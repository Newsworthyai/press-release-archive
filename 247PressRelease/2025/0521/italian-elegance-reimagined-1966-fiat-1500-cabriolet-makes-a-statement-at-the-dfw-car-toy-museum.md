# Italian Elegance Reimagined: 1966 Fiat 1500 Cabriolet Makes a Statement at the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly welcomes a striking 1966 Fiat 1500 Cabriolet, finished in sleek gray and part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection. Built for the U.S. market on April 26, 1966, this convertible represents the perfect blend of Italian craftsmanship and modern preservation, following a multi-year refurbishment that began in 2021.  This restoration included comprehensive rust repair, a professional repaint in gray, and meticulous overhauls of the braking, cooling, and electrical systems. Under the hood lies a 1.5-liter inline-four engine, fed by a single Weber downdraft carburetor, delivering its power to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The gearbox and differential were reportedly resealed during the restoration for improved performance and reliability.  Style and function merge effortlessly in this cabriolet. It rides on 14″ steel wheels, equipped with front disc brakes, rear drum brakes, and a suspension system featuring an independent front with coil springs and a live rear axle with leaf springs. The black vinyl soft top matches the low-back bucket seats, creating a timeless interior that invites both spirited drives and leisurely cruises.  The three-spoke steering wheel—bearing signs of its history—frames a 120-mph speedometer and 8,000-rpm tachometer, complete with inset gauges for fuel, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 72,000 miles, a testament to the car's long-standing journey.  "This 1966 Fiat 1500 Cabriolet isn't just a car—it's a statement of style, resilience, and restoration excellence," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a thrill to bring such a graceful piece of automotive heritage to the public."
