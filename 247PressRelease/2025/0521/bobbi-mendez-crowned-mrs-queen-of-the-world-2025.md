# BOBBI MENDEZ CROWNED MRS. QUEEN OF THE WORLD 2025

NEW YORK, NY, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On May 10, 2025, Bobbi Mendez was officially crowned MRS. QUEEN OF THE WORLD at the internationally celebrated Queen of the World Pageant. This prestigious title recognizes Bobbi's exceptional journey from humble beginnings to becoming a national voice for empowerment, entrepreneurship, and social impact.  Raised in a conservative Mennonite household, Bobbi's rise to the crown is anything but traditional. Leaving home at the age of 17, she enrolled at the Jean Madeline Aveda Institute in Philadelphia and later launched Glamour Room—a luxury organic salon in Lancaster County. The salon has since been voted "Best Hair Salon" five years in a row, a testament to her vision and resilience.  Bobbi's success isn't limited to business. She is a powerhouse philanthropist. Her nonprofit Operation Dignity has provided meals, haircuts, and hygiene support to over 5,000 unsheltered individuals. Through Bussin Beauty, she teaches underserved teens makeup artistry and confidence. Her Money Mindset program has empowered more than 6,000 students—and 180 women in Africa—with financial literacy and business skills.  "This crown isn't just about beauty or titles," said Bobbi. "It's a platform to elevate unheard voices, to serve the forgotten, and to prove that no matter where you come from, you are worthy of greatness."  During her reign as Mrs. Queen of the World, Bobbi is committed to bridging the gap of poverty through international outreach and empowerment. She is distributing 10,000 Dignity Bags filled with self-care items, beginning in Africa, India, and the Philippines. She is also raising funds to build a playground in Uganda—giving children in third-world countries a chance to simply be kids and enjoy a safe outlet for fun.  Bobbi will be traveling both nationally and internationally, working in communities and promoting the Queen of the World Pageant. Her journey will take her back to Sierra Leone, where she helped fund an orphanage and launched her Money Mindset and Bussin Beauty programs. She also plans to expand these life-changing initiatives to South Korea.  As Mrs. Queen of the World, Bobbi will continue her mission to break cycles of poverty and uplift women and youth around the globe.
