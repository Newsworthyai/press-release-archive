Director & Executive Producer Aaron Salazar shares, "The goal of our series is to respect the audience's time with each episode being a tight 6 to 25 minutes and to make high-quality production and top-tier acting accessible to anyone worldwide via your favorite podcast platforms. Each episode is its own stand-alone story, and the difference with our storytelling style is that YOU, the audience member, are the other character in the story, and the characters speak to you directly, or you are the fly on the wall listening in on the scene. It is personal, not presentational, creating a more bespoke and intimate audio experience. My hope is that you enjoy it as a quick respite from the world."  Show Author Jeffrey James Keyes shares, "At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, so many of us in the theater world turned to audio, video, and new media to keep storytelling alive. This series is the result of that shift—a creative collaboration between two longtime friends, with each episode adapted from original plays of mine, reimagined for an immersive audio experience."
