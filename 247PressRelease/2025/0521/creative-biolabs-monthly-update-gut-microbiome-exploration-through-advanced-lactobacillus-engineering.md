# Creative Biolabs Monthly Update: Gut Microbiome Exploration Through Advanced Lactobacillus Engineering

SHIRLEY, NY, May 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Given the rising relevance of gut microbiota in health and disease, one of the leading probiotic genera, Lactobacillus, is attracting significant attention both scientifically and commercially. Creative Biolabs has recently launched Lactobacillus development solutions that include strain screening, functional validation, and small-scale fermentation production to efficiently assist probiotic endeavors.  "In the currently available probiotic R&D services, it is evident that a number of scientists get into technical traps related to selecting an experimental model, estimating the activity of the isolated strain, or engineering alterations to enhance the strain," said the project lead at Creative Biolabs in a recent interview. "Thus, we intend to use our competence in microbiome research to formulate a comprehensive, precise, and client-friendly approach for probiotic engineering."  For that reason, Creative Biolabs considers these services to be not only routine screening and identification of Lactobacillus but also elaborate functional validation and development of engineered strains. In experimental design, Creative Biolabs provides multi-dimensional data support such as acid and bile tolerance tests, epithelial cell adhesion assays, and inflammatory cytokine profiling to help researchers evaluate the immune-regulatory potential and gut colonization ability of target strains.  Creative Biolabs also has developed an advantageous strain library that includes several popular species like Lactobacillus reuteri strains with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, Lactobacillus rhamnosus capable of moderating the gut-brain axis and related neurological functions, and Lactobacillus plantarum known for high adaptability and important roles in metabolism. All genome-sequenced strains come with genome annotations alongside experimental data, and customized validation services are provided depending on client requirements.  Aside from natural strain selection and research assistance, Creative Biolabs is active in engineered probiotics. The company can conduct gene knockouts, insertions, or function enhancements on Lactobacillus strains to construct capable specific expression systems for live delivery via their mature gene editing platform. This ability opens other prospects in synthetic biology, drug delivery, and oral vaccines.  Particularly, with regard to the study of microbe-host interactions, Creative Biolabs has developed simulation systems such as organoids and epithelial co-culture models to enable scientists to perform in vitro experiments on organs that closely replicate physiological conditions. These models facilitate a more accurate examination of Lactobacillus in the microbiome, evaluating its strain functions in preserving the gut barrier, stimulating immune response, or controlling inflammation, which synergistically enhances the value of traditional animal models.  "We do not merely offer strains. Our purpose is to help clients devise comprehensive experimental design strategies," the project lead said. "In our opinion, genuinely productive probiotic investigation is not merely 'screening a strain' or locating a probiotic organism, but rather constructing an entire system around the responses of the host, the mechanisms of action, and the ways to translate findings into practical applications."  Creative Biolabs stated that it will keep increasing its collection of strains and the library of functional model systems in order to better serve research teams worldwide with more accurate and efficient resources.
