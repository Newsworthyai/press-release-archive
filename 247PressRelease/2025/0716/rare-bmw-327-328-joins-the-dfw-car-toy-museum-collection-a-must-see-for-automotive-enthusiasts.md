# Rare BMW 327/328 Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection – A Must-See for Automotive Enthusiasts!

FORT WORTH, TX, July 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase a true icon of pre-war automotive engineering: the BMW 327/328 Sports Cabriolet. This rare and historically significant vehicle, part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection, offers visitors an up-close look at one of the most advanced and exhilarating sports-tourers of the 1930s—an absolute dream for car aficionados and history buffs alike!  Originally introduced in 1938, the BMW 327 sports-tourer was built on the shortened, boxed, ladder-type chassis of the 326 saloons. It featured a Hurth four-speed manual gearbox with freewheel functionality between 1st and 2nd gears, allowing for clutchless gear changes at lower speeds. The car was equipped with hydraulic brakes all around, ensuring impressive stopping power for its time.  At the heart of the 327 was BMW's advanced pushrod six-cylinder engine, enlarged to 1,971cc and developing around 55 bhp. For those craving more performance, an upgrade to the 328's revolutionary 80bhp engine was available. Designed by Rudolf Schleicher, the 328's engine was a masterpiece of efficiency and innovation, incorporating hemispherical combustion chambers and inclined valves—all while maintaining a single camshaft and pushrod valve actuation, avoiding the complexities and cost of a twin-cam redesign.  With two rocker shafts positioned above each bank of valves, the engine closely resembled a twin-overhead-cam design, and its downdraft inlet ports significantly improved airflow. The engine's tune-ability made it a popular choice for British racing car constructors, including the legendary Cooper team, well into the 1950s. In race trim, this 2.0-liter powerplant delivered well beyond its standard 80bhp output, making it a formidable performer on the track.  Only 428 examples of the BMW 327/328 were produced before World War II halted production in 1940. All chassis numbers for this exclusive model commence with "74," adding to its rarity and collector appeal. Notably, Autocar magazine tested a 328-engined Type 327 Sports Cabriolet in 1939 at the famed Brooklands circuit, achieving a remarkable top speed of 156 km/h—a testament to the vehicle's engineering excellence.  For those passionate about classic cars and motorsport history, the BMW 327/328 offers an unparalleled combination of power, agility, and period-correct luxury. Beloved by regularity rally competitors, it remains a symbol of pre-war German engineering prowess.
