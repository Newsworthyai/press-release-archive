Alongside this milestone, Gala has also unveiled his first book, "The Strength to Endure," a compelling reflection on perseverance, leadership, and personal growth.  As the founder and CEO of Alpha Care Medical, a multi-location primary care organization in Delaware, Nihar Gala is no stranger to innovation. With CareIQ, he takes a bold step forward, offering a holistic digital platform that allows providers to manage patients remotely using advanced, user-friendly tools.  A Complete RPM Solution for Modern Practices CareIQ provides a fully integrated system for healthcare professionals seeking to extend their care models into the digital space. The platform features cellular-enabled medical devices, a seamless cloud-based dashboard, a mobile app designed for patient engagement, and clinical monitoring services that support timely intervention.  "Our goal with CareIQ is simple: close the distance between care providers and their patients," said Nihar Gala. "This platform is built to make remote monitoring easier, faster to deploy, and truly impactful—especially for managing chronic conditions."  From Clinical Practice to Innovation Leadership  Gala earned his medical degree from Rutgers University and completed his residency in family medicine at the same institution. Drawing on over ten years of clinical experience, he launched Alpha Care Medical in 2017, which now offers comprehensive services including primary care, behavioral health, psychiatry, and addiction treatment across four Delaware locations.  The development of CareIQ is rooted in Nihar Gala's deep understanding of patient needs and provider challenges. With healthcare systems under growing pressure, especially in managing long-term health conditions, Nihar Gala recognized a need for remote solutions that improve access and outcomes while reducing hospital readmissions.  A New Book That Speaks to Resilience and Purpose  In addition to launching CareIQ, Gala has released his first book, "The Strength to Endure," now available on Amazon. The book captures his journey as both a medical professional and entrepreneur, offering insights into overcoming hardship, making purposeful decisions, and leading with empathy.  "This book is a personal project," Nihar Gala shared. "It's meant to inspire readers—from professionals to aspiring leaders—to keep pushing forward through life's most difficult chapters." Supporting Future Entrepreneurs Through Philanthropy  Gala's commitment to empowering others extends beyond healthcare. In 2022, he launched the Nihar Gala Scholarship for American Entrepreneurs, a nonprofit initiative offering financial aid to students with a passion for business and innovation.  Fluent in English, Spanish, and Hindi, and deeply connected to his home state of Delaware, Gala continues to combine compassion with forward-thinking strategy.
