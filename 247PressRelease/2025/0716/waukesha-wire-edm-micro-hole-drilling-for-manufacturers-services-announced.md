# Waukesha Wire EDM &amp; Micro Hole Drilling For Manufacturers: Services Announced

MUSKEGO, WI, July 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- CAM Tech, Inc., a wire EDM service provider operating since 1996, now offers micro hole drilling capabilities to manufacturers in the Waukesha, Wisconsin area and throughout the Midwest. The company's two EDM micro hole drilling stations create starter holes in hard metals, allowing wire EDM machines to produce precise openings for aerospace, medical, electronics, and filtration applications.  To learn how wire EDM micro hole drilling is changing modern manufacturing, visit https://www.camtechedm.com/how-wire-edm-micro-hole-drilling-is-changing-modern-manufacturing/  The micro hole drilling process begins with EDM drilling, which uses a rotating electrode to create initial openings in conductive materials. Wire EDM then threads through these starter holes to achieve micron-level accuracy and complex shapes. This two-step approach enables manufacturers to produce holes in titanium, carbide, and other hard metals without mechanical stress or heat distortion.  "Our micro hole drilling service helps engineers create smaller, lighter parts with exact specifications," said a CAM Tech representative. "We handle both prototypes and production runs, working with manufacturers who need precise holes for cooling systems, sensors, surgical tools, and filtration components."  The facility operates 13 high-speed wire EDM machines alongside the micro hole drilling stations. A recent 6,000-square-foot expansion to their facility provides space for increased production capacity. The company offers 24/7 operation to meet urgent deadlines and maintains close communication with customers throughout each project phase.  Micro holes serve critical functions in various industries. For instance, aerospace turbine blades require cooling holes for heat management, while some medical devices and instruments need tiny, clean openings to maintain functionality and patient safety. In electronics, small holes may be required for housing miniature parts or enabling airflow in densely packed assemblies. Each application demands exact tolerances that EDM-based drilling delivers.  The EDM process removes metal through controlled electric sparks rather than physical cutting. This approach preserves part integrity while achieving hole diameters measured in fractions of millimeters. Once the starter hole is created, wire EDM can produce non-circular shapes, tapered openings, and other custom features according to design specifications.  CAM Tech serves manufacturers throughout southeastern Wisconsin from its Muskego location. The company combines over 30 years of wire EDM experience with modern equipment to support both single-part prototypes and high-volume contracts.
