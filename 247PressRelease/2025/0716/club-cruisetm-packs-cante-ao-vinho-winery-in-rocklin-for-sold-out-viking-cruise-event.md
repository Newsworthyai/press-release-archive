# Club Cruise™ Packs Cante Ao Vinho Winery in Rocklin for Sold-Out Viking Cruise Event

ROCKLIN, CA, July 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In what attendees are calling one of the most polished and enjoyable cruise nights ever hosted, Club Cruise's "Voyages to Vines" Viking event drew a sold-out crowd of past guests, wine lovers, and Viking-curious travelers at Cante Ao Vinho Winery in Rocklin, CA.  The setting — a rustic and charming Gold Rush-era building nestled in historic Rocklin — added to the immersive experience. Guests were welcomed into a courtyard reminiscent of Old World Europe, complete with wine barrels, live vines, and the atmosphere of a Tuscan garden. For more on this award-winning venue, visit canteaovinowinery.com/privateevents or call Cante Ao Vino directly.  Cante Ao Vino specializes in small-batch, estate-crafted wines including their signature Rocklin Red Blend, a bold expression of California terroir with notes of blackberry, cocoa, and spice. Their crisp Viognier was a fan favorite on this warm summer evening, as was the rich and fruit-forward Old Vine Zinfandel sourced from nearby Lodi vineyards. Guests sipped, mingled, and swirled their way through flights while chatting about future cruise dreams.  Guests traveled from across Northern California to attend — including Lincoln, Loomis, Granite Bay, Folsom, Napa, the Bay Area, and even Lake Tahoe. The venue was standing-room only by 5:15 p.m. with attendees excited to explore the world of Viking Cruises while enjoying a curated selection of fine wines.  The event featured Viking Cruises' West Coast Business Development Manager Mario Herrera, who traveled from Los Angeles to personally present Viking's latest itineraries, promotions, and travel insights. Mario's professional presentation covered Viking's river and ocean products, with highlights on fan-favorite routes like Paris to the Swiss Alps along the Rhine, new European Grand Voyages, and Viking's deeper cultural offerings. Guests took notes, asked questions, and later crowded around to speak with Mario and Heather one-on-one.  As Mario noted, "Travel today is about meaning — and Viking delivers more culture per day than any other cruise line. From Budapest to Bordeaux, we're bringing travelers deeper into Europe's heartland, glass by glass."  Mario also brought a wide variety of Viking-branded gifts and materials for the guests to enjoy — including full-color brochures, exclusive promotional sales flyers, collectible mugs, hats, wine glasses, and more. His support and presence were instrumental in making the event feel like a true Viking experience. Club Cruise™ extends its sincere appreciation to Mario and the Viking team for their commitment to this partnership and their outstanding event support.  Heather Viking added, "Mario's insight and leadership have meant so much to our growing Viking team. His product training and mentorship — especially as I prepare for upcoming Viking Ocean Line familiarization this summer in Europe — have already helped shape how we deliver elevated, expert guidance to our clients. I'm honored to have his support and to grow alongside this brand I truly love."  Club Cruise™ President Jef "El Jefe" Huber opened the evening by sharing the company's legacy since 1991, thanking longtime clients, and giving a heartfelt shout-out to former employee Jennifer Fezler, who was in attendance with her mother. "Jennifer was one of our first employees," Huber said. "Seeing her here, now ready to sail Viking with her mom, it brought everything full circle."  Heather Viking captivated the crowd during her live Q&A, delivering a 40-minute keynote packed with insights on how to plan smarter Viking trips. Her poise, expertise, and natural rapport wowed the audience — further reinforcing her national buzz as Viking's go-to advisor. Several audience members booked cruises on the spot following her talk.  Among those browsing itineraries at the booking table were several who were no strangers to world travel. A handful of attendees inquired about Viking's 180-day World Cruises and even longer expedition voyages. Some were already booked, while others were there to research extended options — a sign of shifting travel priorities.  Amanda Huber, the main host and face of Club Cruise™, also served as the evening's design and hospitality lead. She pulled out all the stops with charcuterie displays, thematic wine service, and atmospheric decor. As the proud mother of Michelin-trained Chef Sabrina Huber — currently working at the famous 3-Star Michelin Single Thread in Healdsburg, now ranked the #1 restaurant in the world by La Liste 2025 Top 1000 List— Amanda quipped, "When the daughter you raised becomes a 3-Star Michelin chef, you simply can't serve plastic cups and cheddar cubes."  Amanda spoke candidly about the increase in long-cruise demand. "It used to be rare for someone to book a 90- or 120-day world cruise," she shared. "Now, I get quote requests weekly. For many, it's becoming more affordable than living full-time in California." She noted that demand now exceeds supply on many long voyages, and that her favorite part of the job is helping make that lifetime dream trips a reality. "Long cruises give us a chance to really help people reset, explore, and re-imagine their lives."  Guests sipped varietals including bold Italian reds, oaky California Chardonnays, and crisp Rieslings reminiscent of the Moselle and Wachau valleys — a wine lover's tour of Europe by glass. Dozens of guests lingered long after the official program concluded, enjoying meaningful conversations, trip ideas, and shared laughs. It was clear this wasn't just another travel pitch — it was a true celebration of community, storytelling, and the magic of travel done right.  The night ended with exclusive giveaways including Viking-branded luggage, cruise credits, souvenir glassware, and bottles of wine. Laughter, music, and applause closed out the evening by 7:30 p.m., but the memories lingered long after. Many attendees described the event as "the best cruise night they've ever been to." Sue said, "comfortable surroundings and no pressure and truly enjoyable". Others said they'd attend again — just for the fun and experience.  Guests Nancy and Dan, who had previously visited the Club Cruise™ office a few years back for TSA PreCheck™, shared their thoughts as well. "We've seen Jef and Amanda around Church for years," said Nancy. "And now that Dan's finally retired, we're ready to see the world. We had a great time and feel like we've found our home travel agency and new friends too— a place that truly cares and will help make our travel dreams come true."  Club Cruise™ would like to offer a heartfelt thank-you to the entire Club Cruise team leading the new Viking Department offices at headquarters in Lincoln, California, and especially to Heather Viking, who has been offering complimentary TSA PreCheck™ enrollments this month as a value-added thank-you gift to select Viking clients. "It's a meaningful bonus for those looking to travel smarter," said Heather. "We're proud to offer full-service travel planning — from door to door."  Most importantly, Club Cruise™ wishes to thank Cante Ao Vinho Winery for hosting and sincerely all of the Club Cruise loyal guests and supporters who made this event so special. "Without your trust, your bookings, and your belief in family-run businesses like ours, there would be no Club Cruise," said Huber. "These wine nights are a celebration of our shared passion for exploration — and you make it all possible."  A follow-up sale is now live through next week, with exclusive offers and bonus perks from Club Cruise™ and Viking for attendees and friends. Travelers can still take advantage of select cruise perks if they contact the Club Cruise offices Viking specialty team by July 22.  Due to overwhelming response, Club Cruise™ is already planning its next Voyages to Vines event -maybe next one, set for outside Napa Valley in Healdsburg at Single Thread with 3-Star Michelin Chef Sabrina — expected to sell out again in record time.
