# THE P.U.S.H. PLAYBOOK CLIMBS AMAZON CHARTS, LAUNCHES NEW ERA IN RECRUITING FOR OVERLOOKED OFFENSIVE LINEMEN

CHARLOTTE, NC, July 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A powerful new book is gaining national attention for giving a voice to football's most under-recruited position, offensive linemen. The P.U.S.H. Playbook: The Offensive Lineman's Blueprint for Recruiting Success by Dr. Derichard McCoy is rising through the Amazon rankings, arming student-athletes and families with a clear system to earn college offers through strategy, structure, and self-belief.  The playbook introduces the P.U.S.H. Framework, Playing Time, Up-Leveling, School, and Hype, a four-part blueprint that helps linemen take control of their own recruiting journey, even when stars and exposure are lacking. Parents, coaches, and athletes across the Southeast are already calling it a game-changer.  "There are thousands of talented linemen who never get seen," said Dr. McCoy. "This book is the system I wish I had. It's a guide to help families stop waiting and start building the path to a scholarship."  From Overlooked Athlete to Scholar, Professor, and Mentor Dr. McCoy's journey fuels the mission. Once a high school student with a 1.4 GPA and no varsity starts, he walked on at Livingstone College, earned a scholarship, and helped lead his team to back-to-back CIAA championships. Today, he holds a doctorate in sport management and serves as an assistant professor at Benedict College.  He's also the founder of Football I-Q, a recruiting innovation platform focused on developing offensive linemen through custom evaluations, academic support, AI-driven tools, and recruiting strategy. The brand's mission is to shift the recruiting narrative and make football scholarship opportunities more accessible for under-represented student-athletes.  Academic Integration and HBCU Innovation Football I-Q is also at the center of a groundbreaking research initiative at Benedict College. Dr. McCoy is leading a pilot project designed to transform Benedict's football program into one that performs at the level of elite FBS Power 4 schools, on and off the field, using advanced scouting, athlete development tools, and AI applications.  "This is bigger than one book," said Dr. McCoy. "We're engineering a new recruiting culture, smarter, more strategic, and built for long-term success."
