# African Voices Presents Lineage: Celebrating A Legacy of Love, Family &amp; Activism

NEW YORK, NY, July 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Sat., July 26, 2025, African Voices magazine will host an opening exhibition for Brooklyn artist Watson Mere and a launch celebration for our special issue honoring the art and activism of Harry Belafonte! Mere's art graces the front cover of our Summer/Fall 2025 issue. We invite you to enjoy an afternoon of art and celebration. Contributors from the issue will share their poems and stories, including writer Gia Anasi-Shakur who will share her work. The event is free and open to the public. Donations are welcomed.  "We're proud to showcase Watson Mere's art and celebrate the legacy of actor and activist Harry Belafonte whose film Beat Street helped defined New York City as the capital of Hip Hop culture and art. He was one of the first 'Artvists' who leveraged his influence as a world-class actor to fight for justice during the Civil Rights era," said publisher Carolyn A. Butts. "Our issue, guest edited by award-winning poet Keisha-Gaye Anderson, is timely as we are continuing the struggle to preserve our cultural institutions and access to jobs, education and affordable housing."  African Voices is celebrating 33 years of publishing art and literature by artists of color. The event is also a fundraiser in support of the magazine, which recently received the news that it was defunded by the National Endowment for the Arts. African Voices is encouraging supporters to make donations and become members. Longtime supporters are invited to attend the event and share testimonials on how African Voices has impacted their lives.   Spelman College, one of the nation's oldest HCBUs, is archiving the organization's art collection making it accessible for future generations. African Voices is renowned for publishing top artists on its front cover. Past front cover artists include Faith Ringgold, Verna Hart, Patrick Dougher, Kimberly M. Becoat, Sadikisha Saundra Collier, Malik Seneferu, Danny Simmons and Elizabeth Catlett.  Mere was commissioned by African Voices to design the iconic front cover for our issue dedicated to Belafonte.   "This portrait of Harry Belafonte honors him in his regality, while capturing the depth, compassion and intensity of his unmistakable gaze. The stars surrounding him symbolize his presence in the ancestral realm, ever-watchful and guiding, just as he did in life. His pose is balanced with a quiet tenderness, reflecting his lifelong commitment to the care and upliftment of the Black diaspora. The piece celebrates not just the man, but the legacy and light he continues to cast over us," said Mere.  Limited copies of our Spring 2025 digital issue will be available. You can reserve copies of our Harry Belafonte issue when you RSVP: LINEAGE. The issue will be released in August.
