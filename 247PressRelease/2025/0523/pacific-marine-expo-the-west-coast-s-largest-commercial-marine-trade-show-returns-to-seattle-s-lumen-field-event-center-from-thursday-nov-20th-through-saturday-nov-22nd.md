SEATTLE, WA, May 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pacific Marine Expo, the West Coast's largest and longest-running commercial marine trade show, will return to Seattle this fall. The 2025 edition of the show will take place at the Lumen Field Event Center from Thursday, Nov. 20th through Saturday, Nov. 22nd bringing together thousands of industry professionals from across the commercial fishing, workboat, and maritime sectors.   With fresh programming, new evening events, and the return of industry favorites, the 2025 Pacific Marine Expo (PME) is shaping up to be one of the most dynamic and inclusive editions in the show's more than 50-year history.    WorkBoat West will return as a dedicated area focused on shipyards, vessel construction, and repair. In partnership with Washington Maritime Blue, the show will host the popular Maritime Blue Innovation Hub, showcasing sustainable solutions and early-stage innovators shaping the future of the maritime economy.    The 2025 Expo will include a major update to a longstanding PME tradition: the National Fisherman Highliner Awards. This year, the ceremony will evolve into a celebratory, ticketed dinner event on Day 2 to honor outstanding leaders in the commercial fishing industry.   In addition, PME will host a Fishing Vessel Stability Workshop presented by Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA). These 30-minute hands-on workshops will help fishermen understand and apply key principles of vessel stability. Those interested in attending the Stability Workshop are encouraged to sign up ahead of time when registration launches.    "We're thrilled to be bringing back so much of what our Pacific Marine Expo community loves, while creating new experiences that align with where the industry is headed," said Wes Doane, Group Vice President, Diversified. "From sustainability and innovation to workforce development and industry celebration, PME 2025 will have something meaningful for everyone who makes their living on the water."   Attendees can look forward to the Expo Market Center, featuring maritime art, retail goods, apparel, and handmade items from small vendors and local makers. In addition, the show will continue to offer Happy Hours, product demos, the popular Alaska Hall, and a robust lineup of free educational content including keynotes, technical sessions, thought provoking panels, and hands-on workshops curated by National Fisherman.   In partnership with Port of Seattle, PME will continue to host Maritime Highschool and other youth-focused organizations to welcome students to the show floor, helping introduce the next generation to careers and businesses in the maritime sector.   "With renewed energy and fresh programming, 2025 is shaping up to be a standout year at Pacific Marine Expo," said Lauren Streeter, Event Director.
