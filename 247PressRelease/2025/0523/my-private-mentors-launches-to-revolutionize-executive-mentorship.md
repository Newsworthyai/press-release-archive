# "My Private Mentors" Launches to Revolutionize Executive Mentorship

ORLANDO, FL, May 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A bold new player has entered the career development space with the official launch of My Private Mentors, a groundbreaking mentorship platform built specifically for high-performance executives and ambitious professionals looking to rapidly climb the corporate ladder.  Touting the promise to help users "Find a Mentor in Minutes, Not Years," My Private Mentors offers an answer to what many professionals quietly struggle with: traditional mentorship systems that are slow, inaccessible, and often biased toward company interests.  "Most executives either wait years to find the right mentor—or they never do. We're here to change that," said Craig A. Fleming, Founder and CEO of My Private Mentors. "This platform removes the guesswork, politics, and hidden agendas from mentorship and puts your career growth back in your hands." The Problem with Traditional Mentorship  Traditional mentorship—whether organic or corporate-sponsored—often fails today's driven professionals. Internal mentorship programs typically serve company objectives more than individual ones. Professionals hesitate to confide in internal mentors for fear it may hurt future opportunities. And the ask—"Will you be my mentor?"—is often so awkward that it's never made.  A Modern Solution: Unbiased, Third-Party Mentorship  My Private Mentors offers something radically different: personalized, one-on-one mentorship from leaders outside your company who have already walked the path you want to follow. These are real-world mentors—CEOs, VPs, founders, and rising stars—ready to offer strategic, politically neutral career advice that puts your interests first.  "Internal mentors may have a stake in keeping you where you are. Our mentors don't," said Fleming. "They help you explore all your options—not just the ones that serve your current employer."  Why This Matters Now  In today's rapidly shifting economy, career agility matters more than tenure. My Private Mentors empowers professionals to accelerate their path to leadership by offering tailored advice, professional storytelling tools, and strategic planning from someone who's already succeeded.  Imagine having direct access to someone who holds the job you want—without waiting 15 years to get there yourself. This is the kind of fast-tracked insight the platform delivers.  Key Features:  •	Instant Access to top-tier mentors with proven track records. •	Career-Focused Guidance—no corporate bias, politics, or internal conflicts. •	Custom Roadmaps to reach leadership roles faster and more confidently. •	Pro Bono Programs for students and early-career professionals  About My Private Mentors LLC  My Private Mentors LLC is an elite, invitation-only, fee-based membership community of C-Suite executives dedicated to mentoring ambitious, high-achieving professionals in their career development.
