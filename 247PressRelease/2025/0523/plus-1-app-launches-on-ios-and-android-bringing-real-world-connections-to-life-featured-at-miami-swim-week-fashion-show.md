MIAMI, FL, May 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Plus 1, a Miami-based social connection app, is now officially live on the App Store and Google Play. Designed for people who want to do something and just need the right person to join them, Plus 1 helps users find companions for everything from last-minute plans to thoughtfully scheduled events.  Whether you're looking for a new best friend to hit a festival with, a business contact to network with, or a hot wedding date, Plus 1 puts the event first—and cuts through the endless swiping and dead-end chats of traditional apps.  "Plus 1 was built to solve the inefficiencies of today's dating and social platforms," says founder Jeff Wulkan. "We created the most efficient way to meet someone by flipping the script—matching people based on what they want to do, not just how they look."  To mark its public launch, Plus 1 will be featured during Miami Swim Week at the exclusive DRIP Fashion Show, hosted by acclaimed swimwear designer CAPRISTAN Swim. The show takes place May 30th from 8PM to 11PM at 440 Rooftop Miami, and is expected to draw models, creators, and influencers from across the country.  "Plus 1 is all about genuine connections and reliability," adds Angie Romasanta, the company's Chief Operating Officer. "It's about building trust in a space that's been missing it for too long. We want users to actually show up for each other—and we've built tools that reward that."  The app includes optional real ID verification, a built-in messaging system, and a post-meetup Reliability Score—a feature that allows users to rate each other based on punctuality, communication, and overall experience after each interaction.  Plus 1 is available now for free download on iOS and Android. To learn more, visit www.joinplus1.com.
