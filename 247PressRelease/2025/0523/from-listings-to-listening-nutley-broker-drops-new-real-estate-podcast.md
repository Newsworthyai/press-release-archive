NUTLEY, NJ, May 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Veteran real estate broker Matthew De Fede of Realty Executives Elite Homes has teamed up with fellow Nutley Realtor Ella Benenati to launch "The Nutley Pulse," a hyperlocal podcast delivering sharp, no-BS insights on North Jersey real estate, lifestyle, and community trends.  With both hosts deeply embedded in the Nutley market, The Nutley Pulse goes beyond surface-level market chatter. De Fede—known for his aggressive digital marketing and record-setting sales—pairs his expertise with Benenati's fresh, community-focused perspective to create a show that's equal parts informative and engaging.  "This isn't just another real estate podcast—it's a platform built for the people who live here, invest here, and want to thrive here," said De Fede. "We're talking real strategies, real stories, and the real state of the market."  Benenati adds, "As two working Realtors in the trenches, we see what's really going on in Nutley and Northern New Jersey. This podcast lets us pull back the curtain and empower locals with the truth."  Realty Executives Elite Homes 653 Franklin Ave Nutley, NJ 07110 www.matthewdefede.com
