# New Book "AMERICA... SPELLS... I AM RACE" to Spark National Dialogue on Identity, Power, and Cultural Legacy

CHICAGO, IL, June 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the national conversation around race, power, and identity continues to evolve, author Gerard Matthews is stepping forward with a bold and timely literary contribution: AMERICA... SPELLS... I AM RACE. Scheduled for release in the coming weeks, this unflinching and thought-provoking book is already generating buzz for its poetic language, cultural insight, and unapologetic critique of systems that continue to shape the American experience.  This isn't just a book—it's a reckoning. Matthews peels back the layers of American myth and memory, exposing how language, history, and systemic bias have distorted the very idea of race. Part meditation, part social analysis, and part spoken-word manifesto, the book delivers a profound call to consciousness, challenging readers to reexamine their beliefs, their institutions, and their roles in the ongoing struggle for racial equity.  What Makes This Book Urgent and Unique Explores how the word "AMERICA" encodes "I AM RACE", reframing the national narrative through a new symbolic lens • Investigates how religious doctrine, legal constructs, and cultural inheritance perpetuate unconscious racial norms • Written in spoken-word poetic cadence, blending scholarship with street-level authenticity • Targets readers seeking truth, not comfort, on topics of race, identity, trauma, and liberation  "This book will disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed," Matthews says. "We're not just talking about race. We're confronting what America spells out in its soul."  About the Author: Gerard Matthews Gerard Matthews is a creative disruptor, critical thinker, and emerging author whose work blends psychological insight, historical deconstruction, and cultural realism. With a background rooted in both activism and introspection, he approaches race not as a fixed category, but as a force—constructed, manipulated, and internalized across generations.  In AMERICA... SPELLS... I AM RACE, Matthews invites readers to listen more deeply to the stories we've inherited—and the ones we've been told to forget.
