# Accelerated Development of Non-IgG Antibodies at Creative Biolabs With the New Platform Update

SHIRLEY, NY, June 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the ongoing evolution of antibody therapeutics, non-IgG antibodies—specifically types IgA, IgM, and IgE—are gaining attention as an important area of investigation in biomedical research. As a solution to the persistent technical challenges in this domain, Creative Biolabs has built a fully integrated and tailored platform for the discovery and development of non-IgG antibodies to provide bespoke services for partners worldwide.  "Even though non-IgG antibodies have great therapeutic potential, their commercial use has been restricted due to low yield, purification issues, and instability," said the head of immunology projects at Creative Biolabs. "It is our intention to provide enabling technology that would help overcome these issues and allow clients to progress with the functional validation and clinical advancement of these candidates."  To address the problems associated with non-IgG antibody discovery, Creative Biolabs has implemented phage display libraries, single B cell technologies, and hybridoma screening to overcome the shortcomings of traditional hybridoma techniques for IgA, IgM, and other isotypes. Furthermore, the team's expression optimization strategies, aimed at different subclasses of antibodies, have enabled the selection of appropriate mammalian or other expression systems to increase the yield and functionality of the antibodies.  Due to their distinctive structural features, non-IgG antibodies face challenges with downstream processing. An example of this would be the low stability and solubility of IgM antibodies. Creative Biolabs has addressed these challenges by developing a specialized buffer system along with purification protocols designed to maintain the multimeric structure of IgM antibodies while providing them with high purity. For IgA antibodies, the team has customized affinity chromatography resins and ion exchange purification to overcome the limitations of protein A/G methods. Further therapeutic efficacy and enhanced pharmacokinetics may be achieved through humanization, glycoengineering, and site-specific conjugation.  "The discovery of antibody candidates is only the first step; the real challenge lies in translating these candidates into clinically viable products. Each of our platforms goes beyond discovery—at Creative Biolabs, we provide thorough functional validation and PK/PD modeling to aid our partners in systematically assessing the druggability of their antibody candidates."  To assess the quality of the antibodies, their structure, as well as biological functions, Creative Biolabs has set up a complete suite including ELISA, flow cytometry, SDS-PAGE, electrophoresis, HPLC, and mass spectrometry for rigorous quality characterization.  "Non-IgG therapeutic antibodies do not aim to supplant IgG therapeutics, but rather, they serve as important complements in certain therapeutic niches,"the immunology project leader concluded. "We look forward to collaborating with more research partners to make this promising class of antibodies."
