# Retargeting, Reinvented: Drip Campaigns Arrive in Digital Banking to Drive Timely, Personalized Engagement

HUNTSVILLE, AL, August 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DeepTarget Inc. a leader in AI-powered digital marketing for financial institutions, today announced its Summer 2025 Release, headlined by the launch of a breakthrough feature: Drip Campaigns for digital banking ads. Well-known in email marketing, drip campaigns have now been reimagined and brought to life within DeepTarget's Digital Experience Platform (DXP), empowering financial institutions to drive smarter, sequential messaging across digital banking channels.  "Drip campaigns are exciting because they automatically deliver the right message to the right customer at just the right time," said Jenna Stone, Director of Business Intelligence, IncredibleBank. "The ability to create a sequenced ad journey for digital banking that runs in the background keeps our audience engaged and supports sales—even when our team is off the clock. I can't wait to start using them."  Unlike traditional email drips, DeepTarget's Drip Campaigns operate directly within online and mobile banking—where members are already active. There's no need to manage email lists, monitor deliverability, or chase open rates. Instead, messages are automatically delivered based on accountholder behavior—whether it's a click, a view, or the passage of time—making follow-ups timely, relevant, and visible.  These sequential, behavior-driven ads unfold like a story—reinforcing offers, educating users, and evolving with their actions and behaviors. The result is more personalized engagement and increased conversion opportunities, all within the trusted environment of digital banking.  "Digital banking ads are no longer one-and-done," said Preetha Pulusani, CEO of DeepTarget. "With Drip Campaigns, financial institutions can run intelligent, automated sequences that respond to user behavior and timing—right inside the banking experience. It's a familiar concept for email, but it's a first for digital banking banners. And it's going to change the game."  Drip Campaigns are designed for flexibility, allowing marketers to:  • Deliver ads based on user actions, delays, or specific dates • Assign a destination URL • Visualize and manage sequences with intuitive tools  For community financial institutions, where every marketing dollar counts, the ability to set up a campaign once and let it automatically adjust messaging over time is a powerful multiplier. The new release also features multiple usability enhancements and performance optimizations across DeepTarget's DXP, including a streamlined workflow for building rules-based campaigns, enhanced reporting insights, and easier creation of ad sequences.  DeepTarget's DXP already delivers click-through rates that are 8x or more than industry benchmarks. With Drip Campaigns, community banks and credit unions now have a new lever to sustain attention and drive conversion inside the digital banking journey —all without additional operational lift.  The Summer 2025 Release is available now to all DeepTarget DXP clients.
