# Nicolet Law Partners with Green Bay Packers First-Round Pick Matthew Golden

GREEN BAY, WI, August 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nicolet Law Accident & Injury Attorneys is proud to announce an exciting new partnership with Matthew Golden, the Green Bay Packers' standout first-round draft pick and rising star wide receiver.  Golden has made a name for himself both on and off the field. Known for his speed, precision, and leadership, Golden gained national recognition in 2023 while playing for the University of Houston. That season, he earned Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week honors after a spectacular 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against Texas Christian University, followed just weeks later by a 100-yard return against West Virginia University.  After transferring to the University of Texas, Golden's momentum continued. During the 2024 season, he recorded nearly 1,000 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. He further solidified his reputation as a top NFL prospect with a blazing 4.29-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine, generating widespread buzz ahead of the draft.  Beyond athletics, Golden embodies the values Nicolet Law stands for. A dedicated family man and community advocate, he recently used part of his signing bonus to buy back his grandmother's home. This gesture highlights his deep roots and commitment to giving back.  "Matthew Golden is the kind of person we are proud to stand beside," said a spokesperson for Nicolet Law.
