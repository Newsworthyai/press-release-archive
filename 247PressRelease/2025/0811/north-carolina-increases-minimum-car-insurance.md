# North Carolina Increases Minimum Car Insurance

CHARLOTTE, NC, August 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Layton Law Firm's personal injury lawyer wants North Carolina drivers to be aware that the state's minimum coverage requirements for car insurance increased on July 1, 2025. This applies to all policies purchased or renewed after July 1.  The previous minimums, which apply for all policies that were purchased or renewed before June 30, 2025, were:  - $30,000 per person for bodily injury - $60,000 per accident for bodily injury - $25,000 property damage  The new minimum insurance coverage amount required of all North Carolina drivers are:  - $50,000 per person for bodily injury - $100,000 per accident for bodily injury - $50,000 for property damage  The increase in the minimum coverage required for North Carolina drivers isn't the only change to the state's auto insurance policy mandates. As of July 1, 2025, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage became mandatory for all liability policies. Policyholders who are hit by an underinsured or uninsured driver will be covered by their own insurance policy up to its limits.  These changes are designed to provide enhanced financial protection for accident victims and drivers alike in response to rising medical costs and the increasing expense of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles. According to the North Carolina Department of Insurance, auto insurers required the state to enact a 22.06% insurance rate increase to account for these rising costs.  While the increased coverage limits are likely to increase the payment amounts for policyholders involved in a collision, especially those hit by an uninsured driver or the party not at fault for the crash, this additional coverage may be a boon, especially in severe accidents.  If you have questions about your insurance coverage and how your policy will be affected, contact your insurance carrier.
