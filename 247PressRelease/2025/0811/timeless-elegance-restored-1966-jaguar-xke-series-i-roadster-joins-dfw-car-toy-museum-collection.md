# Timeless Elegance Restored: 1966 Jaguar XKE Series I Roadster Joins DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, August 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to unveil one of the most celebrated and beautiful sports cars of all time: a fully restored 1966 Jaguar XKE Series I Roadster, now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  Acquired in 2023 as a disassembled project, this British icon has undergone an extensive, painstaking restoration — transforming it once again into the head-turning masterpiece it was always meant to be.  "Few cars capture the spirit of automotive design and engineering like the Jaguar XKE," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "With this meticulously restored 1966 Series I, visitors can witness firsthand why Enzo Ferrari himself once called the XKE the most beautiful car ever made."  This particular roadster now gleams beneath a striking blue convertible top with all rubber seals, glass, wiring, and chrome trim either replaced or restored to original brilliance. The convertible top frame was also rebuilt, ensuring every detail of the car matches its timeless allure.  Under the hood, the rebuilt 4.2-liter inline-six breathes new life through triple SU carburetors, delivering a factory-rated 265 horsepower and 283 lb-ft of torque. A rebuilt four-speed full-synchromesh manual transmission and limited-slip differential channel power to the rear wheels with a balance of refinement and raw driving pleasure.  The car's fully overhauled four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes (with inboard-mounted rear rotors) ensure the XKE remains as capable on the road as it is beautiful in the museum.  Inside, the driver is greeted by a classic wood-rimmed steering wheel, elegant black vinyl dash, and Smiths instrumentation, including a 160-mph speedometer, 6k-rpm tachometer, and center-mounted auxiliary gauges — a cockpit built for both spirited driving and sophisticated style. Every inch of this Jaguar tells a story of craftsmanship, passion, and history. From its rebuilt drivetrain to its freshly polished chrome and precision-refined bodywork, this Series I Roadster is a must-see for fans of vintage sports cars and British automotive excellence.  The DFW Car & Toy Museum invites visitors to admire this stunning addition alongside more than 200 vehicles and thousands of collectible toys — making it one of Texas' most captivating free attractions.
