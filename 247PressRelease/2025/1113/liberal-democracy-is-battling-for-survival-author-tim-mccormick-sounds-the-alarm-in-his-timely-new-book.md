# Liberal Democracy Is Battling for Survival, Author Tim McCormick Sounds the Alarm in His Timely New Book

LONDON, ENGLAND, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an era of rising populism, eroding freedoms, and growing polarization, political analyst and author Tim McCormick presents an urgent and deeply researched wake-up call in his latest book, Liberal Democracy Battling for Survival: A Plan for Action.  The book opens with the haunting enigma of democracy, its global rise after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and its alarming decline in the decades since. Drawing on history, economics, psychology, communications, and ethics, McCormick dissects the forces undermining democratic systems around the world, from the corruption of financial power to the influence of social media and the creeping normalization of autocracy.  "Democracy rarely dies overnight—it disappears by stealth," says McCormick. When freedom of the press, judicial independence, and civil rights are gradually eroded, we only recognize the danger when it's almost too late.  Across 24 meticulously researched chapters, McCormick traces democracy's evolution from ancient Athens to the present, exposing the subtle shifts that weaken institutions and empower authoritarianism. He explores how populism, financial inequity, and online disinformation have corroded democratic trust and how polarization fuels the very forces democracy seeks to prevent.  Unlike most works on political decline, Liberal Democracy Battling for Survival goes beyond diagnosis to offer a comprehensive plan of action. McCormick outlines practical reforms for citizens, media, governments, and global institutions, emphasizing the need for coordinated digital literacy, civic engagement, and transparent governance.  This book is as scholarly as it is urgent, thoroughly researched, illustrated with contemporary examples, and finished only after assessing the first hundred days of the second Trump presidency, which McCormick describes as bearing "fascist tendencies."  A powerful synthesis of history and foresight, Liberal Democracy Battling for Survival is not just a study of politics, it's a moral appeal to protect the world's most fragile inheritance.  About the Author Tim McCormick is a political thinker and researcher with a global perspective, having studied and worked in over fifty countries. His interdisciplinary approach spanning history, finance, psychology, and communication, offers a unique lens on the state of democracy today. Passionate about truth, justice, and freedom, McCormick dedicates this book to those who have fought and died defending democratic values, from Ukraine to Gaza.
