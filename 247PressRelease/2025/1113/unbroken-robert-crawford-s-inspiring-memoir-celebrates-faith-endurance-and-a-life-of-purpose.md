# UNBROKEN: Robert Crawford's Inspiring Memoir Celebrates Faith, Endurance, and a Life of Purpose

LONDON, ENGLAND, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In UNBROKEN: A Story of Adversity and Resilience, Robert Crawford shares the powerful testimony of a life that defied limitations, injustice, and personal loss to rise into global service and spiritual leadership. From a zinc-roofed childhood in rural Jamaica to international ministry across Africa, the UK, and beyond, Crawford's journey is a deeply human and deeply hopeful one.  Crawford recounts a lifetime of challenges: failing school exams, enduring wrongful arrest, financial hardship, and devastating family tragedies. Yet through every setback, he was sustained by the unwavering love of his mother, a prophetic sense of purpose, and a faith that never wavered. Whether starting a school at 17, overcoming stigma, or preaching across continents, Crawford's story is one of transformation through trial, an unbroken spirit shaped by God's guidance.  Told with clarity, heart, and honesty, UNBROKEN is more than a memoir. It's a roadmap for those navigating hardship, a tribute to the strength of family and faith, and a call to live with compassion, courage, and service.  For readers drawn to spiritual memoirs, Caribbean heritage, or stories of resilience and redemption, this book is a must-read.
