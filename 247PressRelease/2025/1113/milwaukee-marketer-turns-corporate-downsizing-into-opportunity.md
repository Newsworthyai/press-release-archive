# Milwaukee Marketer Turns Corporate Downsizing into Opportunity

MILWAUKEE, WI, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When corporate downsizing ended his prior role, Milwaukee marketing professional Eric Vallee saw it as an opening—not a setback. Instead, he launched Silver Fox MKE, LLC, a digital marketing consultancy specializing in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) services for small and mid-sized businesses. In less than two years, the company is thriving—serving over 20 clients across Wisconsin and the Midwest and growing steadily through referrals and word-of-mouth.  "This business was born out of necessity—but it's become the most fulfilling work I've done in my career," said Vallee, who brings more than 15 years of SEO experience to the table, including work across manufacturing, B2C, healthcare, and service-based industries. "After the unexpected downsizing, I realized I didn't want another job—I wanted the freedom to build something of my own that delivered real results for companies."  Founded in March 2024, Silver Fox MKE offers tailored SEO consulting, technical audits, website optimization, keyword research, content strategy, and local SEO support. By incorporating advanced AI tools into his workflow, Vallee is able to deliver faster throughput, deeper analysis, and smarter content strategies—helping clients achieve better results in less time. He works directly with business owners, marketing teams, and web developers—combining hands-on implementation with strategic guidance powered by automation and data-driven insights.  What sets Silver Fox MKE apart is the personal touch. "Clients work directly with me—and they know I'm invested in their success," said Vallee. "I make it a point to communicate quickly and understand what success looks like for each business I serve."   Since launching, Silver Fox MKE has served clients in industries including manufacturing, retail and professional services, with a focus on improving Google visibility, driving qualified leads, and ultimately—making the phone ring.  Vallee, known to some as the "Silver Fox" due to his prematurely gray hair, embraces both the nickname and the experience that comes with it.  "I named the company Silver Fox MKE because I'm proud of the journey—and I'm here to help others grow through smart, sustainable SEO."
