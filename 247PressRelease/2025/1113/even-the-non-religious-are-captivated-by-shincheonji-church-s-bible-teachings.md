# Even the Non-Religious Are Captivated By Shincheonji Church's Bible Teachings

NEW YORK, NY, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Both the religious and the non-religious are captivated by the Bible teachings of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.  Soon-to-be graduates of Class 116 of the Zion Christian Mission Center took part in a survey and the results were remarkable — 57% identified as having previously had no religion.  Respondents noted, "At first, I thought it was just a simple Bible lecture, but it became an opportunity to reflect on my life and relationships," and "it helped me establish standards for life beyond religion."  Prior to its November 2nd graduation of 59,192 theology students, Shincheonji Church conducted a survey from October 17-25. Participants included 1,285 students who had completed a year-long course to master the whole Bible and the Book of Revelation.  When asked (multiple responses allowed) what had changed the most through taking the course, 99% gave positive answers, with the highest response being "increased inner peace, stability, and emotional comfort" (50.7%).  Nearly half of the soon-to-be-graduates (46.7%) said they "experienced spiritual growth and a deepening of faith."  "I had previously tried to learn about God and the Bible through various church teachings in the Christian world, but I didn't see much intellectual growth," one survey participant in their 20s said. "However, through the Mission Center, I came to truly understand the Bible."  Other responses from survey participants who completed the Zion Christian Mission Center Bible course included: • "I developed a positive value system" (41.2%) • "I gained forgiveness, love, and a spirit of tolerance" (38.3%) • "Improved interpersonal relationships" (25.8%) • "Better stress management and problem-solving ability" (20.4%) • "A new perspective on social life and work" (16.5%)  Those satisfied with the instructors and the program reached 94.5%, including 73.3% who answered "very satisfied."  The 116th Zion Christian Mission Center graduation ceremony was held at the Cheongju Church in South Korea under the theme, "Love, Blessings, and the Light That Shines Upon the World." Through the ceremony, the Shincheonji Church announced its plan to be a positive influence for both individuals and society, centering on the core values of "qualitative maturity and the restoration of the essence of the Word."
