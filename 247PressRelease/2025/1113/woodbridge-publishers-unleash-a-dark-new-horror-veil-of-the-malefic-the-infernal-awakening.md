# Woodbridge Publishers Unleash a Dark New Horror: Veil of the Malefic – The Infernal Awakening

LONDON, ENGLAND, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Woodbridge Publishers announces the release of Veil of the Malefic – The Infernal Awakening, the first book in a bold new supernatural horror series by Jonas Ethan Harris.  Blending gothic terror, psychological suspense, and small-town mystery, Harris delivers a gripping tale of prophecy, vengeance, and the human psyche pushed to its limits. At its core is Damon, a bullied and isolated teen whose nightmares bleed into reality—ushering in a demonic awakening that threatens not just his town, but the fragile boundaries of sanity itself.  Sheriff Max Sanderson and his mysterious deputy Samuel are drawn into a series of horrifying crimes, uncovering secrets buried for generations. Behind it all looms Lucius Azazel, a figure as captivating as he is malevolent.  Harris, a scientist-turned-writer based in China, weaves his love of slasher horror, psychological thrillers, and the supernatural into a narrative that is both terrifying and thought-provoking. His exploration of bullying, isolation, and societal breakdown makes Veil of the Malefic not only a horror story but also a social commentary on the darker sides of humanity.  "They say nightmares aren't real. Damon is living proof they are."  Veil of the Malefic – The Infernal Awakening is available now in paperback, hardback, and eBook.
