NEW YORK, NY, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BRYGE AI, an ADHD communication assistant built to help neurotypicals communicate more clearly and compassionately with people who have ADHD, has been awarded the Silver Stevie® Award for Best Health Tech Product for Women at the 2025 Stevie® Awards for Women in Business.  Developed by Rebecca Koniahgari, BRYGE AI uses artificial intelligence to transform overwhelming or unclear messages into ADHD-aware, emotionally intelligent communication—reducing anxiety, confusion, and miscommunication in relationships, classrooms, and workplaces.  Unlike productivity apps or therapy tools, BRYGE AI focuses on communication health—helping neurotypicals rewrite messages that are easier for ADHD minds to process. The tool includes an ADHD-aware rewrite engine for tone and clarity, cognitive load and pressure analysis, personalized educational feedback, and voice cloning for accessible message delivery.  Judges praised BRYGE AI for its innovation and empathy-driven design. One described it as "an amazing health tech solution… not just tech with impact, but a caring, feasible, and radical change in the right direction." Another noted that "putting empathy at the center of AI is so appreciated—you're not just bridging communication gaps, you're rewriting the emotional script for countless relationships."  Judges also praised the tool's originality and real-world impact, describing it as "a thoughtful, much-needed tool with real promise" and "a user-friendly, intuitive technology that gives those living and working with ADHD an authentic voice."  "Inspired by the experiences of women with ADHD, BRYGE AI empowers neurotypicals to communicate with empathy, clarity, and understanding for everyone with ADHD," said Rebecca Koniahgari, Founder of BRYGE AI. "Receiving this Stevie® Award is a powerful validation of our mission. It reinforces that technology can and should be built to foster deeper human connection and support neurodiversity."  The recognition in the Best Health Tech Product for Women category is particularly meaningful, highlighting the growing need for tools that support the mental wellness and communication challenges that women with ADHD often navigate at home and in their careers.  Early users include educators, professionals, and partners seeking better communication with ADHD individuals. Feedback shows measurable reductions in anxiety and improvements in clarity, trust, and emotional understanding.
