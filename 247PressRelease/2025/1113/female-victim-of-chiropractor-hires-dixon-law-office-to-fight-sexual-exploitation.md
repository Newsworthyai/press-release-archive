# Female Victim of Chiropractor Hires Dixon Law Office to Fight Sexual Exploitation

AURORA, IL, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A trusted chiropractor secretly filmed female patients while they were undressed—and now, one victim is fighting back. Dixon Law Office, a renowned personal injury firm in LaGrange, Illinois, has been retained on behalf of a woman who was a patient of the doctor and is believed to have been recorded nude without her knowledge inside Hanson Family Chiropractic in Batavia, Illinois.  Dr. David Hanson, owner of Hanson Family Chiropractic, now faces multiple felony charges after authorities uncovered more than 180 hidden-camera recordings of patients—many of them nude, some of them minors—taken without consent. According to prosecutors, the secret videos were made in treatment rooms. The Kane County State's Attorney has called the case "one of the most egregious violations of patient privacy" they've ever seen.  "This was sexual exploitation under the guise of medicine," said G. Grant Dixon III, founder of Dixon Law Office. "My client came to this clinic for healing. Instead, she was secretly violated in one of the most intimate and vulnerable moments a patient can have." Grant continued, "and if you were one of the thousands of patients at Hanson Family Chiropractic, you were likely filmed without your knowledge as well."  The Dixon Law Office client, a longtime patient of the clinic, had undergone multiple red-light therapy sessions. During these treatments, patients disrobe in a private room where red lights are used to promote healing in muscle and tissue. While undressed and alone, she believed she was receiving legitimate medical care. She later learned through news reports that Dr. Hanson had been secretly recording patients with hidden cameras during these sessions. "Our client is devastated to learn of this shocking invasion of her privacy," Dixon said. "We intend to make this right for our client. We will hold Dr. Hanson fully accountable for the trauma he caused and the trust he destroyed."  Dixon Law Office is actively investigating additional claims and anticipates further action soon. If you have any information, you are urged to contact the office immediately.
