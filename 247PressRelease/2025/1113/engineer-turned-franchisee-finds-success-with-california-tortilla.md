# Engineer-Turned-Franchisee Finds Success with California Tortilla

POTOMAC, MD, November 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In celebration of National Entrepreneurship Month in November, California Tortilla® recognizes franchisee Twinkle Patel, a business leader who turned an engineering career into a fast-growing restaurant venture inside one of the country's largest malls.   Patel signed his franchise agreement in 2019 and opened his California Tortilla location at King of Prussia Mall in 2020, launching during one of the most challenging times for the restaurant industry. Through resilience, attention to quality, and a data-driven approach, Patel built a loyal customer base and established his restaurant as a standout fast-casual destination.   Before joining California Tortilla, Patel spent more than a decade in aerospace and electronics engineering, where he developed a strong analytical mindset and process-oriented leadership style. While engineering offered stability, Patel sought a new challenge that provided both professional fulfillment and long-term opportunity. His desire to create a lasting impact through his own business ultimately inspired him to take the leap into entrepreneurship, where he could channel his problem-solving skills into something tangible and community-driven.   "Engineering taught me how to approach problems with logic and consistency," Patel said. "But franchising with California Tortilla gave me the freedom to build something meaningful and something that reflects my hard work and vision."   Introduced to California Tortilla through friends who were already franchisees, Patel was drawn to the brand's bold flavors, supportive franchise model, and community-focused culture. Despite having no prior foodservice experience, he leveraged the brand's training program and support network to build an efficient, guest-focused operation that continues to grow year after year.   The King of Prussia location attracts shoppers and food enthusiasts alike, leveraging high foot traffic in one of the nation's largest malls. Guests regularly praise the fresh, flavorful menu items and clean, welcoming environment. Signature offerings, including the Honey Lime and BBQ Ranch Bowls with Havana Sauce, drive repeat visits, with some customers traveling significant distances just for a meal.   "Twinkle represents the entrepreneurial spirit that drives California Tortilla forward," said Keith Goldman, President & CEO of California Tortilla. "He combines a strong analytical mindset with genuine passion for quality and guest satisfaction. His success at King of Prussia reflects what's possible when our franchisees bring their own expertise and commitment to the brand."   With an average volume unit of $1,477,553, California Tortilla supports franchisees with its ACE service model (Accuracy, Customization, and Engagement), driving order precision, personalized builds, and attentive guest interaction at the counter. In parallel, the brand's franchise program equips owners with local store marketing toolkits, training, and PR support that help them integrate into their communities and build long-term brand equity.   Looking ahead, Patel plans to expand, bringing California Tortilla's bold flavors and operational excellence to new communities.
