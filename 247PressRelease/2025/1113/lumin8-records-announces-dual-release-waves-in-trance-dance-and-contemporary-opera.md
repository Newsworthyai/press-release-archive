December 20 – Contemporary Opera & Classical Crossover (LUMIN8 Classica)  A second release wave follows December 20, introducing the new division LUMIN8 Classica, dedicated to modern opera, dramatic vocals, and cinematic orchestral compositions.  All four Classica titles are performed by Alejandra, showcasing her vocal versatility and commanding operatic range.
