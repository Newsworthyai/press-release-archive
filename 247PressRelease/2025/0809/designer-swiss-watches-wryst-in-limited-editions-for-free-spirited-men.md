# Designer Swiss Watches Wryst In Limited Editions For Free Spirited Men

NEW YORK, NY, August 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Designer Jacques Fournier started his watch brand Wryst in 2012 after creating some of the most innovative modern watch designs. Before that, Mr. Fournier designed for his company, Horology Design Limited, for brands aimed at both the mainstream and the luxury Swiss market.  Jacques Fournier was born and educated in Switzerland; he later moved to France and eventually on to the UK, where he currently resides.  WRYST was born out of Jacques's passion for designing, creating, and expanding his vision of the ultimate lifestyle sports watch, which began with a never-before-attempted style. Wryst timepieces are reasonably priced but keep a sense of sophisticated European design with a modern flair intended for those watch lovers who share his aesthetic vision. All watches are dedicated to extreme sports or motorsports enthusiasts.  From a young age, Jacques Fournier began exploring luxury watches. He often visited boutiques in Geneva, where he was educated, and wherever he traveled. Driven by passion, he searched for a truly unique timepiece, one that stood above all others. His goal was to own it one day. This pursuit stayed with him for years. Eventually, he created his watch designs and shared them online.  A Private Label watch design studio in Le Locle, Switzerland, asked Mr. Fournier to design for them because of his fascinating and unique approach to watch design. His contemporaries have not always understood Jacques's inspirational design aesthetic, but it is awe-inspiring just how involved he becomes in the watchmaking process.  If you are looking for a new men's watch, the sheer volume of brands out there can be overwhelming. So, which watches matter? Discover a unique brand that you might have heard the name of before, but now need to hear more about. It represents independent watchmaking at its finest, from a visionary and passionate watch designer.  Men's sports watches should be characterized as a timepiece that prioritizes pragmatism, style, and a level of functionality beyond simply telling the precise time. Many durable references among the Wryst collection compete with the most prestigious quality brands.  Mr. Fournier infuses a humbling and tireless artistic vision and entrepreneurial spirit into each of his magnificent creations. Such unique watch designs as the Wryst mechanical red face watch SX8, a high-quality watch, are built out of a passion for the art form, inspired by luxury and athletic racing sports. That said, Wryst is anything but a typical men's motorsports-inspired watch brand.  Imagination truly does shape reality, innovation, and transform ideas into complete and tangible projects. Independent brands require distinct and diverse views and sources of inspiration for their new collections.  The company prefers to use powerful and consequential adjectives when referring to their watches, such as:  - Unique and provocative - Advanced design style - Bold, rugged, and sexy  When describing the feelings associated with some of their athletic timepieces, all of which are excellent statement pieces, it gives the owner a sense of atypical sophistication. As the owner of a Wryst timepiece, the exquisite attention to detail alone will be very much appreciated, at the very least. But watches like these prove that a certain level of refinement is needed to craft wristwatch shape designs that work. The WRYST Racing series offers particular originality in almost all aspects.  These striking watches are dedicated to athletes with distinctive personalities. Wryst has invented the world's most resistant modern wristwear experience ever. A unique fashion designer wristwear with durable materials and the prestigious Swiss stamp, capturing the 21st century in style.  The latest men's automatic watches Wryst RACER are designed with the motorsports enthusiast in mind; these motorsport-inspired, stylish men's collections with leather bands are for the bold at heart. With a quality self-winding mechanical movement, these unique timepieces will harmonize with your lifestyle moment by moment. Four examples of this type of automatic wristwatch include the:  - The SX1 Steel Self-Winding Watch - Rose Gold Watches for Men SX2 - Luxury SX3 Yellow Gold Watches - Automatic Black Watch Wryst SX4  These timepieces are available in a small production of fewer than 75 units, making them the perfect collectible item. These watches include automatic references with integrated bracelets, and all have a see-through back displaying the 38-hour power reserve Swiss automatic movement.  The new Wryst Force chronographs now come with a large, bold, and more masculine appeal; the four new oversized models are elegant and charismatic. These are 100 meters water-resistant, and the glass is made of sapphire crystal. The Limited Edition Wryst Swiss chronographs pay tribute to the athletic, fun personality and all that it has to offer:  - Black Swiss Chronograph Watch SX210 - Black and Gold Wryst SX270 - White and Black Watch SX210 - Leather Black and Gold Wryst SX270  It is fascinating to understand where these designs originated. With the distinctly wide case shape and the overall brand theme, the world's fastest races inspired the timepieces. Even more interesting is that the wide case design, with its skeletonized flanks, is directly inspired by oblong race car steering wheels. Now that is remarkable sporting design virtuosity at its finest.  A controversial aspect of the Wryst sports watch is the overall size and shape of the case. There is nothing like the unique curves and contours of a Wryst timepiece in the watchmaking industry. Jacques Fournier designs every watch produced by Wryst to date. The first Wryst Airborne collection was released in April 2012. Since then, the same design has inspired other collections.  To celebrate the new advanced materials, a small limited series of 10 pieces of the Wryst PARAGON wristwatch with a full carbon fiber case and an automatic chronograph was recently released. This model with a world-premiere white enamelled engraving runs the workhorse Swiss movement ETA7750.  Engines and other racing machine components inspire the dials on specific watches. Wryst includes a series of design elements, such as a sequence of colors, textures, and levels, and explores ways to connect the hour hand to a gear-style disc and have a double-sided second hand. All the layout aesthetics are harmoniously implemented, resulting in a very cohesive and well-crafted timepiece.  And make no mistake, these are not just collectors' watches. These watches appeal to a particular niche of timepiece buyers amenable to this design and its aesthetic inspirations. The case design is different and complicated, and particularly satisfying with the overall production finish; the brand's identity is paramount. Wryst is seen as a privileged opportunity to own a bold sports timepiece with a modern and futuristic style; the goal is to offer innovative watches as an alternative for collectors interested in owning something distinct and creative.  The Wryst brand is exclusive, with limited supply in the market at one time. It is high-tech and exceptionally lightweight. Customers never want to take it off their wrist. It is the perfect fashion accessory for men. Functionally, the watches are uncomplicated and highly reliable. People can look forward to wearing the timepiece to sporting events, trendy viewings, or eating out without feeling awkward or out of place. The pieces are low-maintenance and never fail. The Wryst brand is designed to appeal to its creator first and foremost, and then attract its tribe.  Someone's look speaks volumes. People with solid personalities usually choose their appearance very carefully; thus, what they wear must be right.  In the world of luxury and fashion, people choose to wear timepieces with a pulse, with a heartbeat. And not a tech heartbeat but an authentic showpiece.  Your overall appearance is an essential tool for your ongoing self-awareness and success. Wryst offers atypical watches with leather straps and blends a gold casing with a white or black dial. Wearing a stunning time accessory, one that you love, will not only enhance your contemporary lifestyle. It will let those people around you know that you take your time seriously.  At Wryst, we take the statement: "If you're going to do something, do it right or don't do it at all" to heart. There is always room for improvement, constantly.  What makes the business and state of mind different is remarkably simple: a keen eye on what is happening in influential places worldwide, especially in areas where no one has bothered to look, and searching with integrity, daring, and sincerity. When you think of personalized watches. Think Wryst; it is essential.  Prices & info from the Wryst watches website.  Wryst designs bold Swiss watches inspired by motorsport and adventure.
