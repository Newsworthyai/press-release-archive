# New Sci-Fi Novel "Echoes of an Unseen Brane" Reimagines Reality and Identity Through Quantum Physics and Parallel Worlds

HEYBURN, ID, August 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What if your dreams weren't dreams at all—but memories from a life lived in another universe? In Echoes of an Unseen Brane, debut author Alan Ray Mooso delivers an immersive, emotionally charged science fiction novel that merges cutting-edge quantum theory with the raw human experiences of love, grief, and belonging. The novel will be officially released on August in both print and digital formats.  Echoes of an Unseen Brane follows the life of Evan Korr, a solitary mechanic in the rust-bitten town of Ash Hollow. But Evan's ordinary world begins to unravel when vivid, unshakable dreams start haunting him—dreams of commanding a rebel starship in a technologically advanced world as Commander Evaris Korran. These are no ordinary dreams. They are detailed memories—of war, of love, of loss—and they're bleeding into his waking life.  Soon, Evan finds himself caught in a collision of realities, where a dangerous regime called The Dominion threatens not only Evaris's world but his own. At the center of it all is a mysterious woman named Lirien, a rebel pilot who crosses through the veil between dimensions to bring a desperate warning: Earth is next.  As memories merge and identities blur, Evan must come to terms with a terrifying truth—he may not just be witnessing another life. He may be living two of them.  A Story of Sci-Fi, Soul, and Survival  Unlike traditional space operas or hard science fiction, Echoes of an Unseen Brane occupies a unique intersection between speculative quantum theory and deeply human storytelling. Through vivid prose and cinematic structure, Mooso explores themes of:  • Quantum entanglement and parallel realities • Trauma, memory, and personal identity • Love beyond space and time • The consequences of unregulated scientific exploration • Resistance, loss, and the price of freedom  Early readers and beta reviewers have praised the novel for its emotionally compelling characters, sharp dialogue, and a narrative style that is as gripping as it is thought-provoking.  "A visceral exploration of identity and the multiverse. It's Arrival meets The Matrix, with a love story that hits harder than most war novels." — Robin A., Beta Reader  About the Author: Alan Ray Mooso  Alan Ray Mooso grew up in Heyburn, Idaho, where he discovered a passion for storytelling during a junior high creative writing class. His first written assignment received a standing ovation from classmates—an early spark that would ignite a lifelong love for exploring the unknown through words. Drawing inspiration from dreams he describes as "far too vivid to be imagined," Alan blends scientific speculation with deeply personal themes.  Echoes of an Unseen Brane is his first published work—a project born from years of contemplation, research, and creative introspection.
