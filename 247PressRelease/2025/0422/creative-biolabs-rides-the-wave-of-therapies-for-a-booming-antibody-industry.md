# Creative Biolabs Rides the Wave of Therapies for a Booming Antibody Industry

SHIRLEY, NY, April 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The past two years have witnessed climbing demand for antibody-related reagents by 60%. With advances in bispecific antibodies for example, now reshaping treatments for cancer, the market for these drugs should reach $130 billion by 2030." An oncology expert from Creative Biolabs says, "This isn't just step-by-step progress—it's a full-blown revolution. The tools to outsmart cancer are finally coming up to meet the ambitions."  Creative Biolabs has established top-of-the-range platforms to source high-grade reagents for researchers who want to target what is hereby "undruggable" in new ways:  Antibody-Coupled Liposome (ACL) Tech  Also named immunoliposomes, ACLs use antibody-guided lipid nanoparticles to deliver drug payloads or other therapeutic agents straight to the tumor microenvironment while minimizing off-target effects. "Think of it as a GPS for drugs," the expert says, "reducing the chance of collateral damage while maxing out effectiveness." Creative Biolabs collected research-ready cationic liposomes, long-circulating liposomes, and protein-lipid complexes for drug delivery-oriented projects, represented by: • Anti-CD74 Recombinant Antibody Coupled Liposome • Anti-TMEFF2 Recombinant Antibody Coupled Liposome • Anti-EZH2 Recombinant Antibody Coupled Liposome • Anti-PRSS2 Recombinant Antibody Coupled Liposome  Flow Cytometry Reagents: X-Ray to Scan Cell Functions  With T-cell therapies on the rise, Creative Biolabs' multi-panel flow products and kits are an essential tool for dissecting immune cell hosts.  • High-affinity antibodies that are conjugated to a variety of fluorophores for multicolor flow cytometry applications. • Targeted cell marker reagents for labeling and identifying specific cell populations to increase analytical precision. • FC complete kits encapsulating antibodies, buffers, and fixatives.  Antibody Labeling Kits: Speed or Precision?  "Those kits, containing all necessary components, protocols, and reagents, are designed to be user-oriented to streamline the labeling process, and customizable as they are, the kits allow researchers to select labeling agents and quantity on the basis of their study objectives." The expert elaborates. • Fluorescent-Antibody Labeling Kit • Metal Antibody Labeling Kit • Magnetic Antibody Labeling Kit • Latex Antibody Labeling Kit • HRP Check Kit  Webinar Alert: Dual-Function Antibodies Take Center Stage, May 22  On May 22, Creative Biolabs will host a webinar with the title Generation of a dual-function multi-engager antibody for simultaneous targeting NK cells and tumor cells. "This live session will be devoted to an innovative design, an ingenious multi-engager antibody complex TABK that simultaneously enhances NK cell proliferation while directing these empowered immune cells to engage and eliminate ADAM17-expressing tumor cells." The expert comments, "This represents a big step forward in a potent immunotherapeutic strategy."  Roadshow 2025: Where Innovation Meets Industry  "Our team is hitting every major conference this year," the expert says, "committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within the entire scientific community."  April 24 | NIH Spring Research Vendor Fair May 7 | 23rd BioPharma Drug Discovery Nexus Conference September | World Bispecific Summit October | Exosome-Based Therapeutic Development Summit November | World ADC Summit December | Antibody Engineering & Therapeutics (US) 2025  For the latest updates, visit https://www.creativebiolabs.net/.
