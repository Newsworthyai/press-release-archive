CHICAGO, IL, April 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Legendary vocalist and two-time Grammy nominee Martha Wash will take center stage at City Winery Chicago on Friday, May 2, 2025, for a one-night-only performance â€” the Midwest kickoff of her highly anticipated nationwide Martha Wash: The Love and Conflict Tour.   Best known for her powerhouse hits like "It's Raining Men" and "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)", Wash is ushering in the season of love with an unforgettable evening that will showcase her signature blend of passion and powerhouse vocals, featuring romantic and deeply moving songs from her acclaimed album Love & Conflict.   This nationwide tour will highlight a fresh and dynamic side of Martha Wash, blending emotional ballads, thought-provoking lyrics, and infectious grooves. Love & Conflict marks a bold departure from her dance music roots, venturing into blues-rock and adult contemporary sounds that highlight her extraordinary vocal range. Produced by Sami Basbous, the album delves into themes of love, heartbreak, and resilience, with each track delivering a powerful message.   "My producers pushed me outside my comfort zone into a new musical direction, and the result is both uplifting and thought-provoking," says Wash. "I believe everyone will find something to connect with in these lyrics, and each listener will take away their own personal message from the music."   A true icon of dance music, Martha Wash has dominated airwaves and dance floors for decades. Her unmistakable voice powered some of the most enduring anthems of the 1980s and 1990s, including "It's Raining Men," a pop culture staple featured in countless movies, commercials, and TV shows, as well as C+C Music Factory's chart-topping "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)." She also lent her vocals to Black Box's Dreamland album, which produced four #1 Billboard Dance singles and multiple Top 40 hits, including "Strike It Up," a fan-favorite at NFL and NBA games.   Wash's musical journey began in her parents' San Francisco church, where she honed her vocal skills in gospel music. She later studied opera and toured Europe, experiences that shaped her ability to seamlessly transition between ballads, dance, and pop. Her career skyrocketed when she teamed up with Izora Armstead to form Two Tons O' Fun, later known as The Weather Girls, whose 1982 megahit "It's Raining Men" cemented their place in music history.   Throughout her illustrious career, Martha Wash has collaborated with music's biggest stars and performed on some of the world's most prestigious stages. Her fearless musical evolution is evident in Love & Conflict, which pairs her commanding vocals with a bold exploration of new genres. Audiences at Martha Wash: The Love and Conflict Tour can expect a performance that is both intimate and electrifying, as Wash takes them on a journey through her storied career while introducing them to the exciting new sound of her latest album.
