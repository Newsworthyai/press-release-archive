# A Place to Heal: Virtue Recovery Center Stands with Veterans and Families Across the United States

LAS VEGAS, NV, April 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When military service ends, the journey home doesn't always begin. For thousands of Veterans across the country, reintegrating into civilian life comes with battles no one sees — trauma, addiction, and a silence that cuts deeper than most realize. In a time when 17 Veterans a day die by suicide, one facility is turning that statistic into a mission. Virtue Recovery Center offers more than just treatment — it's about trust, community, and a second chance.  Importantly, when it comes to Veterans, cookie-cutter care won't do it. You can't slap a one-size-fits-all plan on someone who's been through combat, loss, or years of high-pressure service and expect them to just "get better." That's why Virtue Recovery Center has spent years working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Veteran community — not just in Las Vegas, but across the country — to build something real.  Why Veteran Care Matters More Than Ever  Let's talk facts, because the numbers don't lie. In 2022 alone, 6,407 Veterans died by suicide. The leading cause of death for Veterans under 45? Suicide. Not cancer, not car accidents — suicide. That's heartbreaking.  Take Victor Agnacio — a former Marine who battled PTSD and severe insomnia. After being hospitalized for suicidal thoughts, he was denied a referral to a private rehab center. Shortly after, he took his own life. And sadly, stories like his aren't rare. Veterans like Chris Dillahunty and Ryan Williams faced similar ends. What they needed wasn't more bureaucracy — they needed someone to listen to them.  That's where Virtue Recovery comes in.  Creating a Safe Space — No Uniform Required  You know what's often overlooked? Veterans don't just want to be "fixed." They want to be seen. They want to be understood. At Virtue Recovery Center, every program is designed with that simple truth in mind.  Veterans at the Las Vegas, Houston, and Oregon locations can access a full range of services, including:  - PTSD and trauma-specific therapy - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Substance abuse and relapse prevention programs - Group sessions led by peers who've walked the same path - Detox, stabilization, and long-term recovery planning  But beyond the treatment itself, there's something deeper — the atmosphere. Veterans aren't treated like statistics here. They're treated like people who've carried more than their share of the burden.  Houston Roots, National Impact  While Virtue Recovery's heart beats strong in Las Vegas, its reach extends beyond Nevada. In Houston, TX, the center offers another powerful hub for Veterans seeking support. There, just like in Las Vegas, the philosophy remains the same: personalized care, zero judgment, and relentless compassion.  Whether it's learning how to handle triggers without alcohol, building new routines that don't revolve around survival mode, or simply relearning how to ask for help — Veterans find their footing at Virtue. In just four short years, Virtue Recovery has helped more than 1,200 Veterans find that footing and ultimately, their way..  It's Not Just About Recovery — It's About Life  Families often ask, "Will they ever be the same again?" Here's the honest answer: maybe not. But that's not the goal. The goal is something better — helping Veterans become who they're meant to be now. Recovery doesn't mean returning to the past; it means stepping into a future that's still worth fighting for.  Parents, spouses, kids — they're all part of this journey. And when one Veteran heals, it echoes. Suddenly, the family dinners feel less tense. The nightmares don't run the household. The weight lifts a little. Recovery isn't just for the individual — it's for everyone who loves them.  Veterans Deserve More Than "Thank You"  A handshake and a salute aren't enough anymore. We need action. As Rep. Mark Takano once said, "It will take all of us… to reduce Veteran suicide." And Virtue Recovery Center is walking that talk.  By combining clinical excellence with emotional intelligence — and a whole lot of heart — the team is building something rare: a treatment center Veterans can trust.
