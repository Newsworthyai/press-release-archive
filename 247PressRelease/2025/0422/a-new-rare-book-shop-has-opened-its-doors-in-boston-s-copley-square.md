# A New Rare Book Shop Has Opened Its Doors in Boston's Copley Square

BOSTON, MA, April 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Boston has a new book shop, Philip Salmon & Company Rare Books. Collectors will likely already be familiar with the address, 607 Boylston Street. That's because the new shop occupies a space, on the second floor, where the legendary Bromer Booksellers ran its shop for decades. Co-owner Phil Salmon describes his new business as "a legacy venture," where he and his colleagues (all previous employees at Bromer) are now "the new old kids on the block." That legacy includes a commitment to maintaining the prestige and professional heritage of Bromer while "experimenting with new materials, in a new arrangement."  A look at their just-issued introductory catalog, "The Interaction of Paper," and it's obvious that Phil's mission is to continue in that rarified tradition: "Drawn largely from a private collection, the catalogue explores paper engineering as education and entertainment, represented in materials from the 18th through 21st centuries: traditional pop-ups and movables for children, peepshows, interactive works for tradespeople, and artist's books."  The four-color glossy catalogue features some of the most sought-after material in the genre of sophisticated, colored illustrated books for a largely juvenile audience, now collected by aficionados of the genre. Items in this catalogue range from $50.00 to mid-four-figures.  "We intend to build on the Bromer reputation for the book beautiful and rare, and expand it to encompass challenging materialâ€”particularly relating to the exploration of social justice issues," Phil says.  Other genres of books, manuscripts, and paper collectibles on shelves in their walk-in shop and to be offered in future catalogs include: literary first editions, manuscripts and letters, fine printing and artist's books, works by Edward Gorey, and miniature books.  At a time when the vast majority of rare book dealers are selling exclusively online, it is refreshing to see a new brick-and-mortar shop in the heart of Boston. "There's no substitute for visiting a shop and being afforded the pleasant experience of physically examining books before making a purchase," Phil says.  Philip Salmon & Company, 607 Boylston Street, Boston, is an open shop with a curated inventory. It offers appraisals, cataloging services, and collection-development guidance. Operating hours are Monday through Friday, 10:00 am to 5:30 pm, and weekends by appointment. The entire stock can be viewed online at www.salmonrarebooks.com.
