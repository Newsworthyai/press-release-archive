WEST PALM BEACH, FL, April 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fully Promoted®, a top distributor in the promotional products industry, proudly celebrated its 25th year in business at its annual convention in Fort Worth, Texas. Coinciding with the ASI Show® hosted by the Advertising Specialty Institute, the event gathered over 200 attendees, including franchise owners, sales representatives, and vendors, as well as staff from United Franchise Group™ (UFG), of which Fully Promoted is an affiliated brand.  This year's theme, Trailblazers, commemorated Fully Promoted's leadership and innovation in the promotional products industry over the last 25 years, while signaling the brand's unstoppable momentum and bold vision for the future. The three-day event kicked off with a welcome address by Fully Promoted President Andrew Titus, where he recapped the brand's year-over-year performance and major wins in 2024 as well as future strategy and key initiatives to drive growth in 2025 and the years ahead.  "Gathering together for our 2025 convention was a powerful reminder of the passion, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit that defines Fully Promoted," said Andrew Titus. "Celebrating 25 years of success is an incredible milestone, but what excites me even more is the future we're building together. With exciting partnerships, new technology, and the strength of our franchise family, we are well-positioned to lead the industry for the next 25 years and beyond."  Ray Titus, who established Fully Promoted in 2000 and is CEO of UFG, delivered an inspiring keynote address titled, "Get Smart," where he highlighted key strategies for success. In his remarks, he encouraged franchise owners to refine their vision, set ambitious goals, and take decisive action, reminding everyone that "comfort is the enemy of growth." He outlined strategies for driving revenue through sales expansion, pricing, and referrals, while emphasizing the importance of profitability and sustainability. Attendees left energized to promote high-margin products, save for the future, and lead their businesses with gratitude and a strong culture.  "Watching Fully Promoted grow over these past 25 years has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. The convention wasn't just about celebrating our past; it was about setting the stage for an even stronger future," said Ray Titus. "I'm incredibly proud of our franchise owners, our team, and the culture we've built together. The best is yet to come for Fully Promoted, and I can't wait to see how we continue to raise the bar for our industry."
