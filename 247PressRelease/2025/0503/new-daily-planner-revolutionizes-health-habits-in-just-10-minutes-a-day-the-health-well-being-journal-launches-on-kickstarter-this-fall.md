# New Daily Planner Revolutionizes Health Habits in Just 10 Minutes a Day — The Health & Well-Being Journal Launches on Kickstarter This Fall

ST. LOUIS, MO, May 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This fall, health-conscious individuals will have a powerful new tool at their fingertips with the Kickstarter launch of the Health & Well-Being Journal™, a structured daily planner designed to help users optimize their health, mind, body, and spirit in just 10 minutes a day.  Created by husband-and-wife team Keith and Nina Herman, the journal blends behavioral science, nutrition research, and wellness strategies into a practical, easy-to-use format.   Unlike typical planners that rely on inspirational quotes or blank pages, the Health & Well-Being Journal™ offers science-backed systems for creating sustainable health habits—without guilt or overwhelm.  Nina Herman, an occupational therapist and certified health coach, has spent more than 25 years helping families navigate eating and developmental challenges.  "For many of my clients, taking care of themselves feels like another overwhelming task. I wanted to create something that meets people where they are - something that helps them take small, meaningful steps toward health without adding more pressure or guilt. This journal is that tool," says Nina Herman, Occupational Therapist and Certified Health Coach.  Keith Herman, a private wealth planning attorney and founder of the Expert Diet Project, brings a new concept of "health planning" to life, empowering people to thrive now rather than just prepare for the future.  "This journal is for anyone tired of fad diets, burnout, or confusing advice," says Keith Herman. "It's about giving people clarity, structure, and a realistic way to take control of their health."  Key Features of the Health & Well-Being Journal™:  - Research-informed habit trackers  - Simple meal planning tools  - Daily prompts for focus, reflection, and stress relief  - Gratitude and mindfulness practice  - Daily and weekly check-ins to build consistency  The Kickstarter campaign will offer early supporters:  - VIP bonuses and behind-the-scenes updates  - Discounted first-run pricing  - Priority shipping  - Expert health insights  The Health & Well-Being Journal™ Kickstarter campaign is expected to launch in Fall 2025.
