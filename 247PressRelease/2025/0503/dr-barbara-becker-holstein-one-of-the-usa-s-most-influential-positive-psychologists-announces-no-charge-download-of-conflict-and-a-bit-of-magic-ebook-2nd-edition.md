WILMINGTON, NC, May 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein is a visionary Positive Psychologist and an award winning film maker. As one of America's most influential Postive Psychologists, she has spent most of her career helping girls and women of all ages build resilience, enhance their self-esteem and recognize their own talents and strengths. She recently announced that her latest ebook,the 2nd edition of her best-selling book, 'Conflict and a Bit of Magic', will be available at no charge May 6 and 7, 2025 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbara-Becker-Holstein/author/B001JXEZ8U?.  The new book helps girls build self esteem through reading the journal of a girl, identifying with the girl, and understanding they have more courage and resiliency than they thought they had. In this book, written by the girl in journal form, the already famous 'girl' 'The Truth, Diary of a Gutsy Tween' and 'Secrets, Diary of a Gutsy Teen' is in her first year of high school and things are not going well at all. A boyfriend that disappoints her has to be dealt with. A party only furthers her problems and despair. An opportunity to go visit her aunt in Minnesota and get away from her irritating family seems too good to be true. She gets to Minnesota and finds that her Aunt is only too eager to involve her in a seance night that brings up mysterious information and a deceased relative. The 'girl' comes home to deal with more mysteries, communication problems with mom and finally some wonderful moments that explain a lot.  As a school psychologist and in her private practice, Dr. Holstein has worked with many children and parents, helping them to develop life skills in decision making, recognize their own talents, feel more courageous, and helping both kids and parents develop more successful inter-generational skills.  Building resilience and self-esteem is absolutely crucial for girls, and for women of all ages, as it empowers them to navigate challenges and setbacks with confidence, fostering mental and emotional well-being. High self-esteem enables women to advocate for themselves and their rights, breaking down barriers and stereotypes. Resilience helps women to bounce back from adversity, making them more adaptable and better equipped to pursue their goals and aspirations.  "I'm so excited to present the second edition of Conflict and a Bit of Magic," Dr. Holstein stated. "I'm excited it will be in an ebook version at no charge. There is also a short film version of this book that you can view at https://vimeo.com/showcase/10863899/video/895136258. It will be magical to read the book with your child and then watch the film together. I am sure lots of discussion will develop.  "As a filmmaker as well as a positive psychologist, an author and a playwright I am always looking at ways to inspire kids to develop their talents. The film version utilizes the concept of selfie film making. I hope you take a look. Smart phones are a dream come true for families. Not only can families record important events as a family, but each person can keep his or her own diary of thoughts and pictures via the smart phone. How amazing can life be? To be able to make films with your children about any subject? Please feel free to share any creative moments that may happen in your family as your read and then hopefully see the film all about Conflict and a Bit of Magic.
