# musa Technology Partners, One of the Nation's Leading Managed Services Providers, Achieves SOC 2 Type 2 Attestation, Reinforcing Commitment to Data Security and Operational Excellence

BOSTON, MA, May 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- musa Technology Partners, a leading provider of managed IT and cloud services, announced that it has successfully completed its System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2® Type 2 examination, conducted by an independent third-party auditing firm. This achievement demonstrates musa's ongoing commitment to the highest standards of information security and controls.  SOC 2 Type 2 attestation is a rigorous, industry-recognized framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). More vigorous than SOC 2 Type 1, it evaluates an organization's internal controls over a specified period—typically 3 to 12 months—based on the Trust Services Criteria. This attestation assures customers and partners that musa Technology Partners has implemented effective security measures and operational procedures that are maintained over time.  "Achieving SOC2 Type 2 is musa's commitment to our clients and partners that we are doing things correctly. There are a lot of MSPs to choose from and not much in the way of industry regulation, which is concerning for such a critical role with access to the most sensitive information our clients hold – from scientific through HR and finance. By achieving our SOC 2 Type 2 attestation our partners have the comfort of knowing that not only do we have sufficient procedures that have been vetted by an external authority, but we also have the proof, from an independent auditor, that those procedures are being followed," said Joshua Campbell, COO, musa Technology Partners.   SOC 2 Type 2 compliance strengthens overall cybersecurity posture by validating that security controls are not only well-designed but consistently operated to protect client data against evolving threats. The benefits of this are pivotal for organizations working with sensitive data and intellectual property as the threats within the cybersecurity landscapes continue to grow and be more intricate.   Jeff Beard, Director, Engineering and Operations, says, "As organizations mature, they inevitably face increasing demands for robust cybersecurity and risk management. These demands often stem from business partnerships with requiring specific technical controls, clinical research involving protected health information, or regulatory compliance requirements like Sarbanes-Oxley. Such requirements lead to greater scrutiny of service providers and suppliers. By maintaining strong security policies, procedures, and SOC 2 Type 2 attestation, we distinguish ourselves from many service providers who lack these essential controls, making us better positioned to support our clients' evolving needs."  Campbell adds, "Cyber security and compliance are constantly evolving needs for the companies that we support. Cyber insurance carriers are raising rates and dropping coverage for companies who do not meet the increasing requirements. Our SOC 2 Type 2 work puts our clients in the position to be sure that when asked by insurance companies or partners if they have vetted their MSP, they can answer with a resounding 'YES'."  The audit confirms that musa Technology Partners not only designed robust security controls but also operated them consistently and effectively over the audit period. This distinction is especially critical for clients in regulated industries, such as finance and life sciences, where data protection is paramount.  Key highlights of the SOC 2 Type 2 report include: •	Proven effectiveness of access controls and data encryption •	Resilience of infrastructure against security threats •	Documented incident response procedures •	Reliable system uptime and performance monitoring •	Confirmation processes are being followed  musa Technology Partners' SOC 2 Type 2 report is available upon request under NDA to clients and partners seeking assurance regarding the company's controls and practices.
