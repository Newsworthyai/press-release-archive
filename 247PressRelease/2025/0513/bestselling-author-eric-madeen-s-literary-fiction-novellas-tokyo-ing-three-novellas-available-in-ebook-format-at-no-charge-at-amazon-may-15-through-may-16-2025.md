One Amazon review stated, "Eric Madeen's storytelling prowess shines brightly, and I wholeheartedly recommend Tokyo-ing! to anyone who loves exploring diverse cultures and compelling characters through the lens of expertly crafted stories." Another said, "Madeen's insight into Tokyo's dynamic landscape is unparalleled. An enthralling read for anyone fascinated by the complexities of Asia's bustling metropolis."  Eric Madeen writes cross-genre, and is the author of a number of other books:  'Water Drumming in the Soul' is a fiery tale set in steamy equatorial Africa, where Peace Corps volunteer David Fields is on mission: to build a medical dispensary in a village where spells are cast on enemies and fear of a geek-shaman reigns. David seldom has his bearings – cultural or geographical – and must fight a cocktail of tropical maladies as well as social taboos as he throws himself into work. Until... he meets Assam. Captivated by her water drumming, her playing the stream as a drum, David is drawn to her early on and becomes the hunter captured by the game. And what a rollicking game of love it is - with a tension or excitement between them that never dissipates, … until the haunting end.  One Amazon reviewer said, "Water Drumming in the Soul not only tells a passionate love story, but it also delves into thought-provoking themes like culture, identity, and the power of human connection. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that'll have you laughing, crying, and everything in between. This isn't your typical love story! This novel is so well-written and full of unexpected twists that it keeps you flipping those pages. Plus, the characters are so well-developed that you'll feel like you've known them forever. So, if you're ready for a wild and adventurous ride, grab a copy of this modern-day classic ASAP!"  'Asian Trail Mix: True Tales from Borneo to Japan' is a smorgasbord of travel essays which scale down the sprawl of Asia by focusing on the unique and revelatory in sharp, crisp prose. Readers will get to see up close and personal the razzmatazz of novice monks at play in northern Laos, the bonding with hustling pedicab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City, and rainforests blazed on gutsy treks across Borneo and Thailand's Elephant Island. Served up nice and spicy, Asian Trail Mix is slathered across 12 rocking-it essays plus a tall tale at its glorious ending, making for a baker's dozen of sumptuousness.  In a review for 'Asian Trail Mix,' one reader said, "The writing is lush and emotive. It contains images and turns of phrase that will stay with you." Another said, "'Mr. Madeen has a knack for taking one into the depths of Asian countries and introducing the reader to fascinating customs and interesting characters. Five stars!"  'Tennis Clubbed, Snubbed and Rubbity-Dub Dubbed' - In historically rich Yokohama, where Captain Perry and his Black Ships cracked open Japan, the wicked shiver of the tennis snub in the postmodern present pits David Adams against K: a puffed-up xenophobic tyrant who rules over the courts of a club that has as its anthem, ironically, the promotion of international friendship. Making it even more pithy is that a good half of it is set at a Japanese university where David as lecturer dives deep into a part of Japan so rarely and scintillatingly transcribed.
