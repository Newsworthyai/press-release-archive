# Exit Factor Launches International Expansion, Targets Growth in Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, May 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Exit Factor, the leading franchise in business value enhancement and exit planning, has announced its strategic plan to begin its international expansion, initially targeting Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. This global growth initiative comes on the heels of significant domestic expansion in the first quarter of 2025, with six territories sold across the United States.  The company, which is part of the United Franchise Group (UFG) family of affiliated brands and consultants, is actively seeking partnerships with Master Licensees in these international markets to establish a strong presence and bring Exit Factor's proven methodologies to business owners beyond U.S. borders.  "Our global expansion represents a pivotal moment in Exit Factor's growth trajectory," said Jessica Fialkovich, founder and president of Exit Factor. "We've demonstrated the strength and universal appeal of our business model throughout the United States, and we're now ready to help business owners across North America and Europe build more valuable, exit-ready companies. By partnering with dedicated Master Licensees who share our vision, we're positioned to make a significant impact in these new markets."  Exit Factor's impressive domestic growth this year builds on momentum gained in late 2024, when the company sold ten new territories in December alone. The first quarter of 2025 saw continued expansion with three territories sold in January, followed by the sale of one new territory in February. Two territories were sold in March, including Exit Factor's first territory in Georgia, marking entry into a new state for the brand.  Together, these successes and the company's rapid growth have solidified Exit Factor's position as a leading franchise, with the brand ranking #28 out of 150 companies on Entrepreneur's 2025 Top New Emerging Franchises list and #1 in the business coaching/services category. This ranking is based on a formula that evaluates and scores emerging franchise brands based on more than 150 data points in the areas of costs and fees, size and growth, franchisee support, brand strength, and financial strength and stability. Exit Factor's ranking not only emphasizes the viability of its franchise opportunity but highlights the need of its services, especially in today's economic landscape.   To support this rapid growth and ensure consistently high service standards, Exit Factor has brought on a dedicated operations and training advisor. This strategic hire strengthens the company's ability to provide comprehensive support to new franchises as they launch services in their respective markets, helping them implement Exit Factor's business valuation and exit planning methodologies effectively.  "Our first-quarter growth, coupled with our ranking on Entrepreneur's annual list of Top Emerging Franchises, underscores the increasing demand for professional exit planning and value enhancement services across diverse markets," added Fialkovich. "As we continue our domestic expansion while simultaneously entering international territories, we're investing in the infrastructure and support systems needed to maintain our high standards of service excellence. This dual growth strategy positions Exit Factor for continued momentum throughout 2025 and beyond."  Exit Factor's comprehensive suite of services includes business valuation, value enhancement strategies, exit planning, and succession planning. The company's track record of helping business owners increase their company's value and achieve successful exits has made it a trusted name in the industry.
