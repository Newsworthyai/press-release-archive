# Notify Expands in Wisconsin to Standardize Nurse Call and Modernize Communication Infrastructure

MINNETONKA, MN, May 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Notify, a leading provider of nurse call and staff communication technology for senior living, is expanding its presence in Wisconsin, bringing scalable modernization tools to operators navigating fragmented systems, staffing challenges, and aging infrastructure.   The expansion is led by Erich Klett, newly appointed Director of Strategic Partnerships. A Wisconsin native, Klett brings more than 16 years of experience in healthcare and senior living technology, with a track record of helping Midwest communities implement solutions that improve care coordination and reduce staff friction.   "Wisconsin providers are deeply committed to quality care—but the systems they've inherited often make that harder than it needs to be," Klett said. "What drew me to Notify is how quickly it simplifies communication and streamlines workflows—without requiring operators to rip and replace their current systems."   Notify's flagship Overlay Platform enables communities to unify alerts and reporting across more than 25 nurse call system manufacturers—installing in hours without construction, retraining, or equipment replacement. Its companion product, the Notify Communications App, delivers secure, WiFi-based push-to-talk voice communication within a single building, offering a modern alternative to traditional radios.   "Operators in Wisconsin are eager to standardize, but they need flexible solutions that work across diverse communities and legacy hardware," said Greg Robertson, SVP of Growth at Notify. "Erich understands both the regional landscape and the frontline realities—and we're excited to support more providers with tools that improve visibility, reduce manual work, and help teams focus on care."   As part of its Wisconsin expansion, Notify is offering free pilot programs for both solutions. Communities still using pagers can test the Overlay Platform in a live environment, while those looking to replace radios can trial the Notify Communications App for 60 days. Both pilots are fast to implement, require no infrastructure changes, and include onboarding support.   Notify's solutions are currently in use at more than 600 senior living communities nationwide, including several in Wisconsin.

Its flagship solution, Notify Overlay, unifies alerts from more than 25 legacy nurse call systems into a single software platform with integrated analytics and staff communication. The Notify Communications App enables WiFi-based push-to-talk voice, text, and video across care teams—eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional radios. Together, these solutions help communities improve coordination, increase visibility, enhance operational efficiency, and support caregiver retention—without replacing existing infrastructure.
