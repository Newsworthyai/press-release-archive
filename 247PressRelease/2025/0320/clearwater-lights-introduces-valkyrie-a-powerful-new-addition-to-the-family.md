# Clearwater Lights Introduces Valkyrie: A Powerful New Addition to the Family

RANCHO CORDOVA, CA, March 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Clearwater Lights proudly announces the launch of Valkyrie, the latest innovation in auxiliary lighting for motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. At 3 inches in diameter, this powerhouse is slightly smaller in size than the Keri lights, and almost as bright as an Erica!  Valkyrie is available in two distinct configurations to suit different riding and driving needs. The 5-optic spot version is perfect for those who need long-range visibility, or for broader peripheral visibility, the 3-spot/2-fog optic version is ideal. Both models share an ultra-compact 3-inch diameter and weigh only 14 ounces each, making them an excellent fit for a wide range of motorcycles and OEM fog light mounting locations. As with our Darla, Erica, and Sevina lights, "Val" also utilizes our world-class mounting systems.   At full power, Valkyrie delivers a stunning 5,500 lumens. Like all Clearwater Lights products, Valkyrie features adjustable brightness control and seamlessly integrates with Clearwater's proprietary CANopener system or the optional dimmer knob. This allows riders and drivers to customize light output for any environment.   Clearwater Lights remains dedicated to prioritizing safety and performance so you can feel comfortable on every ride. Day or night, Valkyrie ensures you're always ready for the road ahead!   Valkyrie is now available to order along with our brand new R1300 GSA Light Bar Bracket!
