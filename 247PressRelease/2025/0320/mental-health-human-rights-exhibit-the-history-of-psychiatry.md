# Mental Health Human Rights Exhibit: The History of Psychiatry

CLEARWATER, FL, March 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The exhibit, titled "Psychiatry: An Industry of Death Exhibit", presents documentation of the history of abuse in the field of mental health. The free exhibit will be held at 5403 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy in Kissimmee, FL and will be open to the general public from 10am to 6pm from March 20-23rd. There will be a special presentation on Sunday, March 23rd at 1pm announcing a new partnership between the Boomtown Community Partners (BCP) and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights of Florida (CCHR).  The Florida chapter of CCHR, winner of 11 awards for their work to help protect a parent's right to direct the mental health of their child and to end coercive psychiatry, is a nonprofit watchdog organization that is dedicated to the reformation of mental health.  The BCP was formed to reach the community through events and festivals, providing alternative ways to educate and uplift local youth and families. The organization, co-founded by Isaac Vasquez, also known as Coach Boom, has become a cornerstone of community engagement in Central Florida. Coach Boom, who also serves as the Director of BCP, will be the guest speaker for the special presentation on March 23rd at 1:00 PM. His involvement marks a significant moment for both BCP and CCHR as they collaborate to raise awareness about mental health human rights abuses, particularly among children and families.  "We are excited to announce our new partnership with Coach Boom as well as the establishment of our newest chapter of CCHR in Orlando, FL.," states Diane Stein, President CCHR Florida. "Hosting this exhibit as our first activity as partners only seems fitting given the fact that children are often the victims of mental health human rights abuse."  Raising awareness on the harsh realities of psychiatric abuse to tens of thousands across the world each year, the traveling exhibit documents the origins of psychiatry including its blatant disregard for human rights; psychiatry's social control and profit-driven motives; and psychiatric "treatments" that result in debilitation and death.  Visitors to the exhibit will gain a historical perspective of psychiatric human rights abuse while being educated on abuses that continue in present day such as forced commitment and the use of electroshock on seniors and children. Along with educational panels and photos, the exhibit features a documentary with interviews of more than 160 health professionals, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, academics, legal and human rights experts and victims giving firsthand accounts of psychiatric brutality.

About CCHR: Initially established by the Church of Scientology and renowned psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz in 1969, CCHR's mission is to eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969. For more information visit, www.cchrflorida.org.
