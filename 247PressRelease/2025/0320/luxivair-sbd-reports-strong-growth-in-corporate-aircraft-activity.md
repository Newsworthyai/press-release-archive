In 2024, Luxivair reported 9,890 corporate flights, marking a 10% year-over-year increase and an impressive five-year growth rate of 114%. The FBO, which will exhibit at the 2025 NBAA Schedulers & Dispatchers Conference (SDC2025) in New Orleans from March 25–27, invites attendees to visit Booth 1201 in the Titan Fuels section to discover why increasing numbers of corporate customers and general aviation pilots choose Luxivair SBD.
