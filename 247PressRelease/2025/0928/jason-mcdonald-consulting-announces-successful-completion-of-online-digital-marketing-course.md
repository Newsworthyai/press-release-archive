SAN FRANCISCO, CA, September 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Jason McDonald Consulting Agency, a top-rated consultancy specializing in search engine optimization, social media marketing, and Google Ads at https://jasonmcdonald.org/, is proud to announce the successful completion of a new course from Dr. Jason McDonald, titled "Digital Marketing: Social Media, SEO, Content, and Advertising." The ten-week course was taught online during Summer 2025, providing a deep dive into today's most critical digital marketing channels.  "This new course was designed for the modern marketerâ€”whether you're just entering the field or looking to sharpen your skills across multiple platforms," explained Dr. McDonald, Director of the Jason McDonald Consulting Agency based in San Francisco. "With practical lessons in everything from SEO to AI tools, I'm thrilled to offer this comprehensive course through Stanford Continuing Studies. Now concluded, it will be re-offered in January 2026, so interested persons can stay tuned and sign up when enrollment opens in January."  The course ran from June 24 to August 26, 2025, meeting Tuesday evenings from 6:00 to 7:30 pm PT. Students received recorded lectures, access to class forums, and guided instruction through a live Zoom format. This same format will be used in January 2026 when the course is again offered via Stanford Continuing Studies.  A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO MODERN DIGITAL MARKETING  The course included five core focus areas:  1. Social Media Marketing: Learn to navigate Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn with strategies grounded in content, behavior analysis, and community building.  2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Master on-page, off-page, and technical SEO while understanding its intersection with content marketing.  3. Content Marketing: Explore storytelling, blogs, podcasts, webinars, and ebooks to engage audiences and drive conversions.  4. Online Advertising: Discover best practices for PPC, display ads, and paid social media campaigns with a focus on targeting, budgeting, and ROI.  5. AI for Marketers: Leverage the latest AI tools to improve efficiency, personalization, and content creation.  Students also developed an original digital marketing plan that integrates strategy and tactics across all channels, preparing them for real-world success in a rapidly evolving industry. Again, this strategy will repeat in January 2026, so this announcement is both backward-looking at the successful summer course and forward-looking at the upcoming 2026 course.  ABOUT DR.
