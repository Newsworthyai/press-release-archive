# Automotive Defense Specialists Announces New Content on the Bureau of Automotive Repair and Criminal Defense Lawyers

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Automotive Defense Specialists, a team of lawyers working both administrative and criminal law in California vis-Ã -vis the Bureau of Automotive Repair at https://automotivedefense.com/, is proud to announce updated content on criminal issues. In some cases, a SMOG or auto repair shop may face a criminal case stemming from an earlier violation of California administrative law. A criminal defense attorney can defend the charges and help protect a SMOG testing or auto repair business.  "While the Bureau of Automotive Repair cannot technically bring a criminal case, it can refer one. That referral carries a lot of weight. If these allegations are not fought at the earlier administrative stage, they can become a criminal case," stated William Ferreira, lead attorney at Automotive Defense Specialists. "Our lawyer team can help at both the administrative and criminal levels if a SMOG shop or auto repair technician is facing charges."  Interested persons can review the updated page for a Bureau of Automotive Repair criminal attorney at https://automotivedefense.com/about/services/bureau-of-automotive-repair-criminal-defense/.   The law firm defends smog technicians and auto repair shops from the following: * STAR suspensions * SMOG license issues * Interim Suspension Orders * Accusations, letters, citations, and other actions from the Bureau of Automotive Repair * Criminal allegations arising out of a BAR action The law firm has attorneys who have deep experience with the auto repair and SMOG check industry, making it an ideal fit for the industry.  LOSING ONE'S LICENSE MIGHT BE JUST THE BEGINNING  Here is background on this release. Small, mom-and-pop auto repair shops could lose their reputation or business if an action from the BAR is not addressed quickly. Indeed, an administrative action might "graduate" into a criminal action if not addressed. An attorney can help auto shop owners avoid hefty fines and even potential loss-of-license issues by helping to dismiss charges. Legal support could also help expunge criminal charges. The Bureau of Automotive Repair is a powerful administrative and regulatory agency that can easily refer cases to district attorneys and others who can bring criminal charges.  Smog testing technicians help vehicles remain compliant with California's high air pollution standards. Smog checks should be performed around every two years. Regular smog testing helps to lower emissions in the air. Frequent emissions testing and vehicle repairs can help keep a driver's car compliant with California's air safety standards. Automotive Defense Specialists allow technicians to continue the vital work of smog testing cars.
