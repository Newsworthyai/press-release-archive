# Key Housing Names Metro Gateway in Riverside, CA as October's Featured Corporate Housing Listing for SoCal

RIVERSIDE, CA, September 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Key Housing, a top-rated provider of corporate housing in California, is proud to announce Metro Gateway in Riverside as its Featured Listing for Southern California for October. This month's decision came down to one thing: location. Or maybe it's three things—location, location, location.  "We looked at properties from Ventura to Temecula," said Bob Lee, President of Key Housing. "Metro Gateway just stood out. It's not the flashiest complex on paper. But in the real world, it works. It's close to freeways, close to trains, close to the heart of Riverside—and that matters to those looking for the best corporate housing in Riverside and indeed all of SoCal."  Why was Metro Gateway chosen? Tucked along the 91, with easy access to the 60 and I-215, Metro Gateway puts business travelers in the right place without putting them in the middle of a traffic nightmare. Riverside-La Sierra Metrolink Station is just a short walk away. That's rare in Southern California. A busy corporate type could commute to Ontario, San Bernardino, or even Downtown L.A. without getting behind the wheel.  At Metro Gateway, location is key. Close to major highways and just a short walk to the Riverside-La Sierra Metrolink Station, our community puts you in the center of everything. Travel is easy. Work is closer. Life is simpler.  That's quoted direct from the listing, and yes, the team at Key Housing agreed. Every month they scour their listings to highlight a "featured" SoCal listing for busy corporate travelers. That's their value – they are experts in hard-to-find housing throughout California.  A City with Roots Here is background on this release. Riverside isn't just a waypoint. It has history. Founded in the 1870s, it was the birthplace of California's citrus industry. One can still walk through California Citrus State Historic Park (https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=649) and smell the oranges on a cool October morning. It's also home to the University of California, Riverside, and the beautiful Mission Inn (https://www.missioninn.com/).  There's business in Riverside, of course—logistics, healthcare, public sector, education—but there's also something quieter. Trees. Trails. Mountains in the distance. It's not quite suburban. Not quite urban. Just livable. Those who want to explore Riverside short-term housing opportunities can visit https://www.keyhousing.com/corporate-housing-city/riverside/ or contact Key Housing for a one-on-one consulting to find hard-to-find housing in SoCal.  Metro Gateway offers furnished one- and two-bedroom apartments with modern layouts, in-unit laundry, full kitchens, and private balconies. The community has a resort-style pool, a fitness center, and even a bike repair station for those who commute on two wheels. Not every guest uses the amenities.
