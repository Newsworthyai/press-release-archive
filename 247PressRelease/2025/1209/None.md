# Fresno Personal Injury and Car Accident Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Offer Winter Weather Driving Tips

FRESNO, CA, December 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fresno personal injury lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have been representing car accident victims in Fresno County and surrounding counties for over 30 years. They have a toll-free Accident Hotline at (833) 200-7111 for people who want to speak with an attorney for no cost after being involved in an accident. "Anyone who has been in an accident that wasn't their fault should call the Accident Hotline as soon after the accident as possible to learn about how our law firm can help," says Butch Wagner of The Wagner Law Group.  With the rainy season of 2025-2026 already here, the Fresno car accident lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are offering winter weather driving tips. Some of the tips are very simple, such as slowing down and increasing following distance. These two things can greatly reduce the chances of being involved in a motor vehicle accident in the first place, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The best way to survive a car accident or not get injured in a motor vehicle accident is to not be in an accident in the first place.  Other recommendations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration include ensuring your windshield wipers are in good enough condition to properly clear rain, sleet, or snow from your windshield. The accident and injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have seen many situations where a pedestrian, motorcycle, bicycle, or other vehicle was collided with simply because the driver wasn't able to see well enough. Another common factor many motorists don't consider is that, as temperatures drop, tire pressure decreases, which affects how the vehicle contacts the roadway. Properly inflating your tires is an easy way to make your vehicle safer.  If your vehicle becomes disabled on the roadway, it is important to make it as visible as possible. Using the built-in emergency flashers, as well as aftermarket or LED flares, is a good way to indicate to other motorists that your vehicle is disabled. It is also a good idea to keep a reasonable amount of emergency supplies in your trunk in case you are stranded for an extended period before help arrives. If you are involved in a collision because someone else didn't take these precautions and caused an accident, you can call The Wagner Law Group Accident Hotline at (833) 200-7111.  In Fresno County and the surrounding Counties, there are hundreds of people killed every year in motor vehicle accidents. Roadways such as HWY 99, Interstate 5, HWY 80 & HWY 50 can be extremely hazardous during the winter. The accident death and wrongful death attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have been helping families rebuild and get the compensation they deserve after losing a loved one because of someone else's error.
