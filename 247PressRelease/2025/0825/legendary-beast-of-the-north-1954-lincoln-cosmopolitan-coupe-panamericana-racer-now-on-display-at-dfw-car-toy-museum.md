# Legendary "Beast of the North": 1954 Lincoln Cosmopolitan Coupe Panamericana Racer Now on Display at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, August 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A true motorsport legend — the 1954 Lincoln Cosmopolitan Coupe known as "La Bestia del Norte" (The Beast of the North) — is now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. This storied racer has participated in La Carrera Panamericana rally 11 times and remains an enduring symbol of determination, engineering, and racing spirit.  The original Carrera Panamericana was launched in 1950 to commemorate the opening of the Pan-American Highway in Mexico. Known for its treacherous terrain and grueling pace, the event quickly became one of the most challenging races in the world. Lincolns of the era were dominant in the stock car division, capturing the top four positions in 1952 and 1953.  The Carrera was revived in 1988 as a modern rally, honoring the legacy of the original event. This 1954 Lincoln Cosmopolitan Coupe was originally used as a race car in the 1970s and underwent a full conversion to modern rally specification around 2005, purpose-built to endure the extreme demands of today's La Carrera Panamericana.  Affectionately nicknamed "La Bestia del Norte," this Lincoln has been extensively upgraded with modern rally enhancements, including drivetrain, braking, electrical, safety, and suspension improvements — all designed to handle the punishing roads and intense competition of the rally.  "This car represents everything that makes La Carrera Panamericana so thrilling — power, endurance, and a rich history," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "We're proud to showcase La Bestia del Norte here in Fort Worth, where visitors can get up close to a machine that has battled mile after mile through Mexico's toughest rally stages."  Visitors to the DFW Car & Toy Museum can now view this iconic Lincoln alongside more than 200 classic and rare vehicles, plus over 3,000 collectible toys. The museum's collection continues to grow and rotate, offering fresh experiences throughout the year.
