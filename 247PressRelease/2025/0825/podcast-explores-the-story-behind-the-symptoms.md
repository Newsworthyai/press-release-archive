# Podcast Explores 'The Story Behind the Symptoms'

PORTLAND, OR, August 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When a person experiences pain or illness but doctors find no disease or injury to explain it, their symptoms become a medical mystery. David Clarke, MD, interviews patients to unravel this enigma in his podcast, "The Story Behind the Symptoms."  A renowned gastroenterologist, Dr. Clarke is president of the Association for the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms (Symptomatic.Me). In each episode, he looks for clues in the guest's present and past and how these can lead to chronic pain and illness, just as he has for over 7,000 people throughout his career. Find episodes at symptomatic.me/podcast.  "The Story Behind the Symptoms" is the first podcast series featuring a doctor speaking with patients publicly about their symptoms to unravel the processes behind neuroplastic pain and illness. These are pathways in the brain and nervous system that are learned in response to stress, trauma, and adversity, often starting in childhood. When these patterns are uncovered and understood, this knowledge can lead to healing without the need for invasive procedures or long-term medical treatment.  Neuroplastic symptoms include chronic primary pain anywhere in the body, migraines, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, post-viral syndromes, and many other conditions. An estimated 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from neuroplastic pain or illness as do four out of ten people seen by physicians.   The ATNS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to ending the chronic pain epidemic by promoting awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of neuroplastic pain and illness. They support an evidence-based, biopsychosocial approach called Neuroplastic Recovery Therapy that is safer, more affordable, and more effective than traditional methods in treating chronic pain. With a focus on uncovering stress, trauma, and unrecognized emotion, patients are able to take control of their symptoms without drugs, surgery, or expensive treatments.  "Neuroplastic Recovery Therapy is the only treatment backed by gold standard science from randomized trials published in top medical journals like the American Medical Association Psychiatry journal," Dr. Clarke notes.  In May, the ATNS commissioned the first national survey of its kind on neuroplastic pain and illness. The association will present full results at the ATNS 2025 National Conference Sept. 28-30 in Boulder, Colo. For media passes, contact info@symptomatic.me.
