# Turning Waste into Worth: Poodini Pet Waste Removal Celebrates Nearly a Decade of Giving Back to the Rescue Community

GILBERT, AZ, August 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What started as a small local business with a funny name and a serious work ethic has grown into one of Arizona's most well-known pet waste removal services. While most recognize Poodini by their green uniforms and a well-dressed magician dog mascot, what truly sets this local "pooper scooper" company apart is their heart.  For nearly a decade, Poodini has been helping pet owners keep their yards clean and smelling fresh. But behind the scenes, the company has also quietly supported local dog rescues through donation drives, fundraising efforts, and community outreach.  One of their most beloved initiatives is the Poodini Pals Toy Drive, an ongoing donation effort that collects pet food, treats, toys, and enrichment items for local rescue groups. For years, customers and community members have rallied around the drive, donating thousands of items to help animals awaiting their forever homes.  Last year, the company expanded its impact with the launch of the Poodini Gives Back campaign. Through this initiative, a portion of every new client booking is donated to a different "adopted" rescue each month, providing ongoing financial support to the organizations that are working tirelessly to save and rehome animals. So far this year, these poop scooping heroes have managed to raise over $5000 to aid non-profit organizations through this campaign alone.  Poodini's reputation for top-rated service is well known across the East Valley, but it's their consistent efforts behind the scenes that have earned them loyalty from both customers and rescue organizations alike. These guys do much more than just pick up after dogs.  "We're not in the dog poop business. We're in the business of serving our community, and scooping dog poop is the vessel that allows us to do just that," said Mike Casten, founder and owner of Poodini. "This community has supported us for nearly a decade, and we believe it's our duty to give back in ways that can make a real difference."  As Poodini approaches its 10-year anniversary, the company encourages the public to get more involved, whether by supporting their services, contributing to toy drives, or nominating rescues to be part of the Poodini Gives Back campaign. "Arizona has a significant dog rescue problem, primarily due to overpopulation and a lack of resources," says Casten. "Finding ways to provide for the frontline of the rescue effort is the first step towards helping these dogs have a happy ending."
