# Floridians Educated on Mental Health Abuses at the "Psychiatry: An Industry of Death" Traveling Exhibit in Orlando

ORLANDO, FL, August 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Floridians toured an exhibit highlighting the history of psychiatry and exposing mental health abuse this week in the Oviedo Mall, a northeastern suburb of Orlando. The exhibit, Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, travels all over the world reaching tens of thousands of people annually. Designed to raise awareness on such human rights abuse as the use of electroshock, involuntary examination and the drugging of children with dangerous psychiatric medications, the exhibit is based on the permanent museum located at the international headquarters for CCHR in Los Angeles, California.   Hosted by the Florida chapter of CCHR, an award-winning nonprofit that exposes abuse in the mental health industry, the exhibit attracted human rights advocates, students, psychiatric facility employees, professionals, veterans and teachers. Stating that they have seen the abuses shown in the exhibit firsthand, these individuals pledged to work with CCHR to help prevent mental health abuses in Florida.  A retired psychiatric hospital employee was so impacted after the tour that she became emotional and had to take a walk. She said that while she was working at the psychiatric hospital, a doctor told her, "You need to stop working there or you'll turn into one of them [a psychiatric patient]".  A veteran who toured the exhibit stated that psychiatry "degrades patients' rights and that the TV ads promoting psychiatric drugs are contributing to society's overall degradation".  Speakers at the event included youth advocate, Issac "Coach Boom" Vasquez, who spoke about the over-drugging of children and how important it is to know your rights in the field of mental health and an electrical engineer and Congressional candidate, Tuan Le, who spoke about his passion for advocating for human rights and fighting back against racism and mistreatment, especially in the mental health industry.  The Florida chapter of CCHR also has a permanent installation of this exhibit located in their center in downtown Clearwater. Unveiled in July of 2015, the Florida version of the Psychiatry: An Industry of Death museum presents the unvarnished history of psychiatry while also providing information on the state of psychiatry today. Consisting of 14 audiovisual displays revealing the cold, hard facts about psychiatric abuses, the museum uses interviews from more than 160 doctors, attorneys, educators and survivors to expose the multi-billion dollar fraud that is psychiatry.  Over 10,000 people have toured the Florida museum including students from nursing schools and technical colleges from across the state who come to the museum to go through the 2-hour self-guided tour as part of their clinical days finding the experience to be informative and eye opening. Coupling tours of the museum with seminars and workshops delivered by attorneys and healthcare professionals on the mental health law, known as the Baker Act, CCHR is working to educate lawmakers, doctors and all private citizens on mental health abuse and their rights under the law. The museum is open from 10:30am until 6pm Monday through Friday and from 2pm until 6pm on Saturday and Sunday. Events are held weekly and monthly. Both are free to the general public.

About CCHR: Initially established by the Church of Scientology and renowned psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz in 1969, CCHR's mission is to eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
