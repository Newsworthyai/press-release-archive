# Iowa Insurance Adjuster Exam Prep &amp; Appraiser Exam Prep Courses Now Available from WebCE

DALLAS, TX, August 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- WebCE, a nationwide leader in insurance exam prep, today announced the launch of its new Iowa Insurance Adjuster Exam Prep and Appraiser Exam Prep courses. Each course is expertly crafted to help professionals meet the new licensing requirements established by Iowa's Senate File 619.   In the wake of the devastating tornadoes and flooding Iowa weathered in 2024, Governor Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 619 into law on April 22, 2025. The bill not only boosted the state's financial agility but also created several new insurance license types within the Iowa Insurance Division.   Effective July 1, 2025, under Senate File 619, state licensure is now required for the following roles:   - Public Adjuster (Business Entity)  - Independent Adjuster (Individual)  - Independent Adjuster (Business Entity)  - Staff Adjuster (Individual)  - Appraiser (Individual)  - Appraiser (Business Entity)  - Umpire (Individual)   To legally operate in these roles, Iowa now requires a state-issued insurance license. Anyone acting as an insurance adjuster, appraiser, or umpire without a license commits a Class D felony and is punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine ranging between $750 and $7,500.   In response to the new legislation, WebCE's team of seasoned industry experts conducted a comprehensive review of Senate File 619. This in-depth analysis of the new Iowa regulations formed the foundation for the Iowa adjuster and appraiser exam prep curriculum, ensuring all content is accurate and directly aligned with the state's new licensing requirements.   The result is a bespoke exam prep solution, specifically tailored for professionals navigating the new Iowa licensing landscape. The learning material has been meticulously curated to focus on the precise knowledge required to pass the exam, while the overall course structure has been handcrafted to provide a clear, efficient, and comprehensive path to licensure.
