# Signarama Advances AI and Tech Integration to Power the Sign Shop of the Future

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, September 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Signarama®, the world's leading sign and graphics franchise, is doubling down on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies to revolutionize how franchisees operate, compete, and grow. As the company prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2026, these forward-thinking initiatives reflect Signarama's commitment to building the sign shop of the future, combining four decades of proven success with next-generation business tools.   Under its ongoing 2025 growth strategy, Signarama has rolled out a series of powerful tech-driven enhancements designed to give franchisees stronger financial insight, operational efficiency, and customer targeting capabilities. These include:  • A new financial benchmarking platform being developed in partnership with RevScale, powered by AI to automatically collect, standardize, and analyze financial data, helping franchisees better understand their performance and identify opportunities for growth. • A custom-built CRM platform that enables franchise owners to track sales pipelines, manage leads, and improve conversion rates with greater accuracy and ease. • Expanded use of data from the Install My Signs platform, giving franchisees enhanced visibility into upcoming installation activity, especially in commercial real estate, so they can proactively pursue new client opportunities.  "Our industry is evolving, and so are we," said A.J. Titus, President of Signarama. "As we approach our 40th year in business, we're investing in the tools, technology, and partnerships that will carry our brand, and our franchisees, into the next 40. Whether it's using AI to optimize financial planning or leveraging data to find the next big client, we're focused on building a smarter, more profitable future for every Signarama location."  The technology rollout complements Signarama's ongoing investments in peer-to-peer learning and advanced training. Programs like the P3 (Peer, Profit, Performance) initiative and the Masters Academy continue to help franchisees implement best practices, improve production and sales performance, and adapt to the changing needs of today's customers.  Additionally, AI-driven capabilities such as automated design tools, smart inventory systems, and predictive marketing engines are currently in development as part of the brand's long-term transformation strategy.  The company's focus on innovation follows a record-setting year in 2024, which saw the signing of 72 new franchise agreements and the opening of 15 new locations.
