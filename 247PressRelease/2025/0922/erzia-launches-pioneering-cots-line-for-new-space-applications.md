# ERZIA Launches Pioneering COTS Line for New Space Applications

SANTANDER, SPAIN, September 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ERZIA announced today the launch of a new line of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RF microwave amplifiers engineered specifically for New Space missions, addressing the industry's demand for faster delivery and cost efficiency without compromising performance.  The current lineup includes 13 new COTS RF amplifiers designed for satellite and payload manufacturers, SmallSat developers, and commercial space integrators operating in LEO, MEO, and CIS-Lunar orbits. Each amplifier delivers best-in-class RF performance while incorporating enhancements that make it flight-ready for next-generation missions.  ERZIA's New Space COTS line has been engineered to meet the toughest mission demands, featuring radiation-tolerant circuitry valid up to 30 Krad and 32 MeV for proven resilience in space environments. Each unit is built with vacuum-compatible housings and integrated depressurization structures to withstand rapid decompression, while outgassing-compliant materials ensure compliance with mission standards. Leveraging automotive-grade components, the products are prepared for rigorous thermal, vibration and acceleration environments. Every delivery includes by default a complete Acceptance Test Report at three temperatures with the option for additional screening upon request.  "New Space programs move fast, and cost pressure is intense," said David Diez, ERZIA's Managing Director. "We created this product line to give commercial satellite builders and integrators immediate access to flight-ready RF hardware that has been engineered from the ground up for New Space demands."  The product line includes both high-power amplifiers (HPAs) and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) covering a broad frequency range. Applications span communications payloads, navigation, telemetry, radar, tracking & command (TT&C), and more. The ERZIA New Space launch will be officially unveiled this week at European Microwave Week 2025 in Utrecht, with the presentation of three flagship models.
