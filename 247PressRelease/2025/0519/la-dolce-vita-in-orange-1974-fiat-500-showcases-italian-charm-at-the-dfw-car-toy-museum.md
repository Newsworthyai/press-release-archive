# La Dolce Vita in Orange: 1974 Fiat 500 Showcases Italian Charm at the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to feature a brilliant 1974 Fiat 500 in a head-turning orange finish, part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. This iconic Italian microcar has been lovingly restored and updated, combining vintage flair with thoughtful modern touches—perfect for fans of compact charm and nostalgic design.  Inside, the Fiat's interior has been fully reupholstered with sleek black seats and matching door panels, complemented by a folding vinyl sunroof for an open-air experience. Beneath its stylish salt-and-pepper carpets lies Dynamat sound-dampening material on the rear firewall and underfloor—offering a quieter ride than you might expect from this feisty classic. Adding to the fun is a Pioneer CD stereo paired with an aftermarket speaker for a retro-modern audio vibe.  At the heart of the dashboard sits a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel, framing a 120-km/h speedometer lit by a custom LED replacement. A hidden gem lies beneath the ashtray lid—a discreetly added digital engine temperature gauge. The five-digit odometer currently reads 95,000 kilometers (~59,000 miles), reflecting the car's storied journey.  The rear-mounted 500cc twin engine features an Abarth valve cover and drives the rear wheels via a four-speed manual gearbox, making this petite powerhouse just as enjoyable to drive as it is to admire.  "The Fiat 500 is a reminder that great design never goes out of style," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "This orange 1974 model is a perfect mix of personality, precision, and preservation—it's one of the most smile-inducing cars in the collection."
