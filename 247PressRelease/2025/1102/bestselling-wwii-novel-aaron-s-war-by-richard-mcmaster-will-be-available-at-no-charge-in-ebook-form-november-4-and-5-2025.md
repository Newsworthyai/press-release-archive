# Bestselling WWII Novel, Aaron's War By Richard McMaster, Will Be Available At No Charge In Ebook Form November 4 and 5, 2025

WILMINGTON, NC, November 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- World War II stories still hold a special place in the minds of millions of Americans. We are enthralled by stories about this time period like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and Winds of War. Amazon best-selling novel, Aaron's War, is a story of devotion, faith, and redemption—where the battle for one man's soul proves as fierce as the war itself.  On the eve of World War II, Aaron Vanko learns two truths that shatter his world: his friends doubt he can kill, and his Ukrainian mother reveals he is Jewish, shattering his plans to marry the pastor's daughter he loves. As he fights across Europe, Aaron witnesses the ruins of churches and synagogues, the horrors of death camps, and German soldiers clutching Bibles. Haunted by faith, identity, and the question of what separates belief from humanity, he returns home broken—until a twist of fate forces him to confront the German soldier who's tormented his dreams, and to choose between vengeance and forgiveness.  The ebook version will be available at no charge November 4 and 5, 2025 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-McMaster/author/B01LDIJ2QU.  In a story about the author, Richard McMaster, printed by The Hudson Weekly, Dennis Keller said, "There have been multiple authors that have made a significant contribution to the world of literacy. In the current era, we have come across several first-time authors with the gift of writing. Richard McMaster is an accomplished author whose works have been praised for their depth, complexity, and emotional resonance."  Keller continued with "Richard McMaster never falls into the trap of presenting his characters as simplistic archetypes or caricatures, instead allowing them to emerge as fully-formed individuals with their unique voices and perspectives.  "In addition to his skillful characterization, he is also a master of plot and pacing. The structure of his novels keeps readers engaged and invested in the story while also allowing for moments of quiet reflection and contemplation. The author's writing is often described as 'page-turning' or 'gripping,' but it is also imbued with a sense of thoughtfulness and depth that elevates his work beyond mere genre fiction."  Richard McMaster is also the author of best-selling, psychological thriller, The Attic. The Attic is an emotional story about facing adversity and overcoming loss. When Byron Kelly's wife dies, he faces assault charges and a lawsuit and flees to Chicago and assumes a new identity. When Byron Kelly becomes a whistleblower on the run from the FBI he hides out in the attic of a dying old man, Henry Steele. Byron cares for the old man and learns he is estranged from his daughter over the death of her mother, his wife, because of family secrets he has kept from her.  Readers of The Attic said, "Absolutely loved this book. I don't want to give anything away, but this was the best book I have read in a long time. Haven't done anything else for the last 24 hours. Just wonderful!" Another reviewer asked, "When they make the movie who will play the part of Byron? Who will play Sybie?"  Another book, A Love Divided by Time, is described as "one part The Notebook, one-part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter, and find peace by joining her in the ever after.  A Writer's Digest critique stated, "This book is exemplary in its voice and writing style. It has a unique voice, and the writing style is consistent throughout."  The author' favorite book is, Voyage Of Life, the life journey of Sean Buchanan is detailed through metaphoric depictions of the four stages of life in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings, childhood, youth, manhood, and Old Age. The painting's depictions are a metaphor for his life—the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood become turbulent in youth, and early in manhood the shores turn rocky when he faces one obstacle after another. Secrets that live in darkness can take a lifetime to see the light of day and the secret that has hovered over him since Youth is revealed late in his life.  A reader said, "While reading, you will smile, you will hesitate thinking, oh no, and you will cry, but there is a surprise toward the end. This is one of the best romantic books I have read."
