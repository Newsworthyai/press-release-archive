# Omni Insurance Services, LLC Launches in Pennsylvania and Georgia

PENNSYLVANIA and GEORGIA, November 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Omni Insurance Services, LLC ("OMNI Insurance"), headquartered in Erie, Pennsylvania, with a corporate presence in both Connellsville, PA and Snellville, Georgia, today announced its launch in both Pennsylvania and Georgia. They are introducing a "shop-the-market" approach that helps households and small businesses manage premiums through strategic carrier relationships and modern digital tools. We Do the Shopping for You!  The company's roadmap includes near-term expansion to New Jersey and Maryland.  "Customers want more than a quote—they want a plan to manage rates over time without compromising protection," said the President of Omni Insurance. "By pairing multi-carrier access with data-guided tools and disciplined renewals, we help clients navigate market shifts, surface savings opportunities, and maintain appropriate coverage as needs evolve."  What's launching now • InsuranceRx: Streamlined process—60-second inquiry, optional text-to-quote, and optional secure upload of current declarations—to accelerate quoting when documentation is provided. • Multi-Carrier Market Access: Competitive options across top-tier carriers for personal and commercial lines; placement guided by coverage fit, underwriting appetite, and service history. • Rate-Management Playbook: Proactive renewal checkpoints, market scans, discount optimization, bundling strategies, and coverage/deductible right-sizing aligned to risk and cash-flow goals. • Products & Services (initial): Home, auto, renters, umbrella, small business/BOP, general liability, workers' comp, and commercial auto—with ongoing product enhancements as carrier relationships deepen. • Small Business Focus: Practical coverage for main-street and growth-stage firms, with transparent terms and responsive service.  Community Partnership: Complimentary Support via IBU  Through a strategic community partnership with IBU (a nonprofit membership organization), eligible consumers can access free IBU membership and receive a complimentary InsuranceRx coverage snapshot. The no-cost assessment helps families and businesses understand current exposures and potential savings opportunities before they choose to engage with OMNI for quoting. (Participation is optional and not required to obtain insurance from OMNI.)  How OMNI helps clients manage rates 1. Qualify first, quote second: Verify exposures, loss history, and asset details to avoid misquotes and mid-term surprises. 2. Shop the market: Compare multiple carriers and program structures to balance price, coverage, and claims performance. 3. Refine discounts & structure: Evaluate bundling, telematics, protective devices, and endorsements that may reduce the total cost of risk. 4. Plan the renewal: Calendarized check-ins and market scans flag material rate changes and trigger repricing when appropriate. 5. Improve the risk: Practical guidance (maintenance, documentation, and risk-mitigation steps) that can support better pricing over time.
