# Birth of the APEC Dedication NFTs: 21 "Dancing Flags of Peace" Works by BDKim

NEW YORK, NY, October 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Korean artist BDKim (Kim Dae-Yong) announced a special project celebrating world peace and APEC 2025 through his official website (www.Daum.ai) on October 22, 2025.  Kim suspended all artistic activities following the declaration of martial law in South Korea on December 3, 2024. As political stability returned, he resumed his work and launched the nationwide art tour project "BDKim – Art on the Move."  As part of this initiative, a 1.2-ton wing-body truck has been transformed into a mobile gallery and has been touring the country since October 3.  The journey will culminate in Gyeongju, where leaders of the 21 APEC member economies will gather. At the Mojeon Stone Brick Pagoda at Bunhwangsa Temple in Gyeongju, Kim will unveil two 2.5-meter original canvases, the truck installation, and dozens of video and NFT artworks.  The canvas works include previously unreleased pieces originally created for an exhibition atop Mount Baekdu one year ago.  The NFT video artworks — titled "Dancing Flags of Peace" — reinterpret the national flags of APEC member economies and are dedicated to their leaders and citizens. Each piece is a five-second video composition expressing the harmony of Yin and Yang energies.  Importantly, the NFTs do not rely on external URL links; instead, the digital assets are directly uploaded and permanently preserved on-chain through a third-generation Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain node.  This fully decentralized blockchain technology — SASEUL PoW Chain, independently developed over seven years by Artifriends Co., Ltd. (CEO Jeongwoo Lee) — has been recognized for its technological integrity through its listing on the BitMart exchange and is preparing for a hard fork.  In 2023, Elon Musk emphasized on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that NFTs depending on off-chain URLs are inherently vulnerable, stating that digital artworks such as JPEGs must be encoded directly onto the blockchain.  Reflecting this principle, Kim noted that his entire collection is stored securely and immutably on-chain, to be presented as gifts to APEC nations and shared publicly through social media.  In addition to the NFT dedication works, three supplementary video versions (6-second, 30-second, and 2-minute cuts) have already been delivered to the embassies of all 21 member economies, accompanied by official invitations to national leaders and relevant officials.  Kim explains that "Beyond the Whole World" and "Dancing Flags of Peace" embody the energy of peace and the origins of primordial art for the future spiritual era — a cultural legacy for generations to come.  Looking ahead, Kim plans to present the complete five-piece set of "Beyond the Whole World" — including three previously unreleased works, totaling 12 meters — at Mt. Baekdu in North Korea, together with artists from across the world.  This peace-themed international exhibition is expected to draw significant attention within the global art community. News about BDKim's planned Mount Baekdu exhibition was previously reported by North Korea–related media outlets, referring to his intention rather than an ongoing project.  As the contemporary art world faces stagnation, whether BDKim's artistic universe will illuminate a new path remains to be seen — yet growing global attention is already turning toward his next steps.
