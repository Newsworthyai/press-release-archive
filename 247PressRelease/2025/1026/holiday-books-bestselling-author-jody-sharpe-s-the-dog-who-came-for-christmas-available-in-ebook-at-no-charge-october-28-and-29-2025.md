But with surprising twists and turns of intrigue, both Gayle and Alex find there are always angels at the helm as they ride on their coattails.  Most of Sharpe's book feature angels and a strong anti-bullying message.  "Every one of us may have been bullied in our young lives or as adults and there is such a need to teach the children how to overcome being bullied and how bullying hurts," Sharpe said in a recent article. "We can teach kids to walk away, tell parents or adults like their teacher, bus driver or family member if somebody has bullied them. Talk to your kids about bullying.  "An important lesson for our kids is to explain to them how kindness helps us grow into loving adults and how helping others helps ourselves grow up to be kind. Being kind can spread love around the world. It is more powerful than hate.  "I've written books that have won awards, I think mainly because of the themes of love, forgiveness, redemption and thwarting bullies. In my next Mystic Bay novella due to be released in 2026, bullying will once more be a theme. I love to write and the angels inspire me to realize my potential to get themes of love and hope out into the world. It is my belief that any one can change if they want to."  Many of her anti-bullying messages can be found at her website at https://jodysharpe.com/blog.

Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  One of her latest books, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California.

With surprising twists and turns of intrigue and love, Gayle and Alex find there are angels at the helm as they help prove the bully never wins.  In addition, on the "Tuesdays With The Angels" section of her site, Sharpe presents stories of real-life encounters with angels.
