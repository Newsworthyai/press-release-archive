# Las Vegas Insurance Claim Denials on the Rise – What Policyholders Need to Know

LAS VEGAS, NV, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Amid a noticeable uptick in insurance claim denials across Nevada, particularly in Las Vegas, consumer protection advocates and legal experts are raising alarms. In 2025, more policyholders are finding themselves facing denied claims without clear justification—a trend that is prompting calls for stronger oversight and legal accountability.  Data from consumer reports and legal filings indicate a rise in complaints tied to delay tactics, insufficient investigations, and underpayment of benefits by insurance providers. These denials can impact homeowners, drivers, business owners, and others who rely on timely and fair claims processing to recover from loss or injury.  Industry analysts point to several contributing factors: economic pressures on insurers, a backlog of natural disaster-related claims, and evolving corporate policies designed to minimize payouts. As these issues converge, legal professionals in Nevada are seeing an increase in cases where policyholders suspect their insurance company may be acting in bad faith.  Under Nevada law, insurance companies are legally obligated to act in good faith when handling claims. A denial is not automatically considered bad faith—but if the insurer fails to investigate properly, misrepresents policy language, or delays payment without valid reason, legal remedies may be available to the policyholder.  Legal practitioners stress the importance of distinguishing between routine claim disputes and more serious instances of insurer misconduct. In cases involving bad faith, the legal strategy shifts from negotiating the original claim to pursuing damages for the insurer's wrongful conduct.  "People often feel powerless when their insurance company denies a claim without a proper explanation," said Patrick Leverty, one of the lead attorneys at Leverty & Associates Law. "But when those denials cross the line into bad faith, policyholders have options under Nevada law."
