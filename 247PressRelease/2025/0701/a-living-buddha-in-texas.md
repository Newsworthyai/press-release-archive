# A Living Buddha in Texas?

HOUSTON, TX, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a quiet corner of Sugar Land, Texas, just outside the hum of Houston, sits a spiritual sanctuary unlike any other. At the Universal Door Meditation Center (Thiền Viện Phổ Môn), visitors don't just practice meditation. They step into the presence of Awakened Zen Master Thich Dieu Thien, a rare female spiritual leader recognized by students across the world as a living Buddha.  As wellness trends continue to flood social media with curated calm and surface-level self-care, this monastery offers something far more powerful: direct experience.  "Each person is a droplet of water, flowing together like a river," shares Thich Dieu Thien. "The river finds its way back to the Source, flowing into the immense Ocean."  Here, Zen isn't something you study. It's something you live.  A Different Kind of Retreat  At Universal Door, every moment becomes part of the practice. Walking. Eating. Speaking. Even washing dishes. Visitors are invited to experience the Unborn Mind, a deep, unshakable awareness beyond stress, fear, and thought. This is not a place for escape. It's a place to wake up.  "We don't offer distraction here," says one longtime student. "We offer freedom. Even joy. The real kind."  Unlike commercial retreats focused on temporary peace, the teachings at Universal Door offer clarity that carries into everyday life.  Youth & Teen Summer Retreat: July 21–25  This July, Universal Door will host a five-day retreat for youth and teens, ages 10 to 18. Guided by Thich Dieu Thien, the retreat helps participants let go of performance pressure and digital noise. Instead, they are supported in returning to a calm, clear awareness that builds emotional stability and self-trust.  Retreat Fee: $500, includes meals and accommodations Location: Universal Door Meditation Center, 15202 Dora Lane, Sugar Land, TX RSVP: (281) 565–9718 More info: universaldoormeditationcenter.org Media visits and on-site interviews are available by request.
