# 'The Traumatic Loss Workbook: Powerful Skills for Navigating the Grief Caused by a Sudden or Unexpected Death' to be published July 1

OAKLAND, CA, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Whether caused by suicide, violence, medical crisis, overdose, or accident, traumatic loss shatters lives — and most grief support systems aren't built to address it. That's why Dr. Jennifer R. Levin wrote "The Traumatic Loss Workbook: Powerful Skills for Navigating the Grief Caused by a Sudden or Unexpected Death" (New Harbinger Publications, July 1, 2025).  This groundbreaking workbook blends cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, narrative therapy, and emotional regulation to help readers rebuild their world after loss — offering practical tools for managing grief attacks, processing trauma, and finding meaning again.  "The Traumatic Loss Workbook: Powerful Skills for Navigating the Grief Caused by a Sudden or Unexpected Death" offers a first-of-its-kind guide specifically created for those navigating grief after a sudden or traumatic loss. Whether the loss was due to suicide, overdose, accident, medical crisis, or violent event, this book addresses the unique emotional, psychological, and physiological challenges that arise in the aftermath.  The workbook is organized into 12 skill-building chapters that gently guide readers through trauma stabilization, emotional regulation, grief integration, and meaning-making. Early chapters help readers understand the nature of traumatic grief, process their shattered assumptions, and regain a sense of safety and control. Later chapters explore grief attacks, anniversaries, long-term triggers, and how to rebuild a meaningful life in the presence of ongoing pain. Key tools include trauma symptom assessments, guided journaling, grief goal setting, and exercises that can be done solo or with a therapist.  "Jennifer Levin's book, 'The Traumatic Loss Workbook,' promises to be extremely helpful in offering the reader a way to process and understand their response to sudden loss. Every page offers compassion, guidance, and information to support one through a very painful journey. I highly recommend it." — Pamela D. Blair, PhD, coauthor of "I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye" and "The Long Grief Journey"  "A beautiful and important guide for anyone who has experienced sudden loss, 'The Traumatic Loss Workbook' is full of practical guidance and comfort, walking grievers through what's most helpful immediately and over time. I'll be gifting this book on repeat." — Tina Payne Bryson, PhD, New York Times bestselling coauthor of "The Whole-Brain Child" and founder of The Center for Connection  "Jennifer Levin's workbook provides guidance and assurance: You are not alone. You can find your way through grief and uncertainty. The exercises are designed to assist and support you, with the wisdom of someone who has listened to, and learned from, the lives of many bereaved people." — Donna Schuurman, EdD, senior director of advocacy and education, and executive director emeritus at the Dougy Center: The National Grief Center for Children & Families  Publication Details: · Publisher: ‎New Harbinger Publications · Paperback: ‎176 pages · ISBN-10: 1648484921 · ISBN-13: 978-1648484926  A licensed therapist for almost 14 years, Dr. Levin has over 30 years of experience in thanatology, the study of death, dying and bereavement.
