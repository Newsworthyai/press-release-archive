# Prosidio Endoscope Enables First-Ever Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery in The Gambia

BANJUL, THE GAMBIA, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Prosidio, a leader in advanced surgical visualization technology, proudly announces that its state-of-the-art endoscope was foundational to the first-ever endoscopic pituitary surgery successfully performed in The Gambia. This landmark procedure was a highlight of the recent Harvard-Banjul Mission Trip to the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, a philanthropically funded initiative to dramatically advance neurosurgical care in a region with severely limited access.  "This was the first time in Gambian history an endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal procedure had been done, and it's already changing their practice." – Maddie Ikeya, Marketing Team, Department of Neurosurgery, Mass General Brigham  The groundbreaking surgery was collaboratively led by Dr. Tim Smith, Director of Endoscopic Skull Base and Pituitary Fellowship, Surgical Director of the Multidisciplinary Pituitary Center, and Associate Professor of Neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School (MGB), alongside Dr. John Jabang, Director of Neurosurgery at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital in The Gambia. Their expertise, combined with Prosidio's gifted endoscope system, marked a critical turning point in surgical capability for the nation.   "Prior to Prosidio's donation of this instrument, we had no access to an endoscope, and without it, key neurosurgical procedures simply weren't possible," explained Dr. John Jabang. "Now with the endoscope, many people will benefit. I know that without Prosidio giving us this instrument, I can't imagine when we would actually have it."  The mission, which brought together a comprehensive team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, surgical technologists, researchers, and educators, extended its impact far beyond the operating room.  "We did pituitary surgery microscopically last year here, but there's a lot of limitations in the visual corridor using a microscope in general, and specifically one that was essentially underpowered for what we needed in terms of illumination." – Dr. Tim Smith, Director of Endoscopic Skull Base and Pituitary Fellowship, Mass General Brigham  This forward-looking approach included vital meetings with the Ministry of Health, hospital leadership, and university faculty to explore sustainable investments, develop a national neurosurgery training program, and forge a clear roadmap for long-term progress. Dr. Smith further added in correspondence from the mission that, "What we are really trying to do is build an infrastructure and skill set so that when we leave here, they can continue on."  The transformative experience deeply resonated with Gambian neurosurgery resident Dr. Manneh, who affirmed, "I want to ensure that people here have access to the same standard of neurosurgical care that someone in the richest of countries can get." He expressed confidence that with continued partnership, the Gambian team will eventually perform these advanced procedures independently, "even when they [the Brigham team] aren't around."  The reciprocal benefit of this collaboration was also keenly felt by the visiting team. "This has been one of the best parts of my medical education," commented Dr. Saksham Gupta, a member of the MGB team. "You become a better clinician when you practice in an environment like this… and that makes you better for your patients everywhere."   "As an sinus and skull base surgeon myself, witnessing the direct, life-changing impact of our technology in The Gambia is profoundly rewarding," said Jonathan Simmonds, M.D., CEO of Prosidio, "This partnership with the Harvard-Banjul team, philanthropists, and the dedicated surgeons at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital exemplifies Prosidio's core mission: empowering medical professionals worldwide with innovative tools that push the boundaries of what's possible in patient care and ensure access to advanced healthcare, regardless of geography."  The successful execution of this procedure, alongside the strategic efforts to establish sustainable training and infrastructure, promises to lay a strong foundation for specialized neurosurgical care in The Gambia.
