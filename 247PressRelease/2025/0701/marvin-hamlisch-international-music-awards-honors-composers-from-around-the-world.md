The awards were created to honor the late Marvin Hamlisch, paying tribute to his remarkable legacy as both an artist and an advocate for emerging talent. The awards first began as the Marvin Hamlisch Film Scoring Contest, presented by the Washington, DC-based nonprofit CINE since 2013. Hundreds of composers worldwide competed annually in this unique contest for emerging media composers. In 2019, the Marvin Hamlisch International Music Awards launched to continue and expand the contest's impact, adding three additional categories: composition for musical theatre, film scoring, classical composition and jazz composition. In 2021, categories were added for contemporary pop and R&B songwriters.  About the Avon Theatre: Founded in 1939, the Avon Theatre Film Center is a historic nonprofit cinema in downtown Stamford, CT. The Avon Theatre Film Center regards cinema as a uniquely effective vehicle for artistic expression and fulfills its mission by bringing the community together to share experiences that entertain, educate, touch and inspire audiences of all ages and backgrounds. In addition to presenting independent, art, foreign language and classic films and documentaries, the theater partners with other local and regional organizations to present programs that appeal to different audiences and deal with the critical issues of the day. Some of the most meaningful experiences provided at the Avon have been the moderated dialogues and panel discussions with filmmakers, actors and other subject experts that are frequently offered after our screenings.
