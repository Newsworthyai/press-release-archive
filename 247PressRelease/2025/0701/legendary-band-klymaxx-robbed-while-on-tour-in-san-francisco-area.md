# Legendary Band Klymaxx Robbed While on Tour in San Francisco Area

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The iconic all-female band Klymaxx featuring Cheryl Cooley fell victim to a devastating episode of smash and grab theft while in the Bay Area after performing shows in celebration of the Juneteenth holiday. While stopping for a quick meal at Kincaid's restaurant in Burlingame, California, the band's rental vehicle was broken into and ransacked, resulting in the loss of professional gear and personal items valued at several thousand dollars.  The theft took place on June 23, 2025 at around 4:45 pm in the parking lot for the Kinkaid's restaurant located at 60 Bayview Place, Burlingame, where the group's van was parked for approximately 45 minutes while the band members dropped in for a quick meal. Despite the presence of a security guard that was on site at the time of the crime, no steps were taken to prevent the vehicle break-in or to alert law enforcement authorities while it was taking place.  Fortunately, the Burlingame Police were extremely responsive when notified by Cheryl Cooley and her bandmates, arriving at the scene quickly and providing professional and courteous assistance to the women as they absorbed the shock of the event and came to terms with the loss of their possessions. The ladies noted special appreciation for the work of Officer Theo, who took the time to sweep broken glass from the seat of the vehicle to help the musicians settle their nerves and resume their travel. Stolen items include musical equipment, luggage, clothing, passports, IDs, jewelry, computers, and thousands of dollars in cash. "It's overwhelming," said Cheryl Cooley, lead guitarist of Klymaxx. "Some of our band members even suffered cuts from the shattered glass. We missed our flights,had no money left for lodging, and were left stranded until help arrived."  In the aftermath of the robbery, the group endured an exhausting 7-hour drive back to Los Angeles, thanks to the endurance and dedication of band member KK "Funktress" Ross, who drove through the night to ensure everyone got home safely. "This was not just a loss of possessions. It was a violation of the personal safety of these musicians and their ability to make a living," said Charis Jones, COO of Klymaxx Music, LLC and Manager of Klymaxx Ft. Cheryl Cooley. "We're working with our financial institutions and insurance providers to recover what we can. We're tired, shocked, and deeply shaken, but still holding onto prayer, humor, and gratitude for those supporting us."  The band is in the process of regrouping and moving forward with their scheduled performances. Nonetheless, the theft has been a traumatic experience for the band members and extremely disruptive to the operations of the business. A GoFundMe has been created to help the musicians replace the items that were stolen from them so that they can resume their work as soon as possible: https://gofund.me/dc0d4354.  Klymaxx is asking the public and media for support in spreading awareness of the dangers that come with live touring and for help in recovering their stolen items, if possible. The band intends to continue its 40th Anniversary Tour, celebrating decades of empowering music including hits like "Meeting in the Ladies Room" and "The Men All Pause."  Formed in the early 1980s, Klymaxx made music history as one of the first all-female funk and R&B bands to gain mainstream success. With hits that became cultural anthems, the group continues to inspire generations through music, empowerment, and resilience.
