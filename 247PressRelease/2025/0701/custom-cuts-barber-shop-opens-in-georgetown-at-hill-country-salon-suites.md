# Custom Cuts Barber Shop Opens in Georgetown at Hill Country Salon Suites

GEORGETOWN, TX, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Central Texas just got a little sharper. Custom Cuts, the latest addition to Hill Country Salon Suites in Georgetown, is officially open for business. Founded and operated by seasoned barber Roland Gonzales, the shop offers classic cuts, modern styles, and old-school customer service—with a personal touch that comes from generations in the barbering world.  With nearly a decade of professional experience and a deep-rooted family tradition, Roland is no stranger to the barbershop life. Many may recognize him from his years at Dave's Barber Shop, where he built a loyal clientele. Now, stepping out on his own, Roland is bringing his passion and talent to Suite #126 inside Hill Country Salon Suites, offering clients a new space to sit back, relax, and walk out feeling their best.  Barbering is in his blood. Roland grew up in Killeen surrounded by the sounds of clippers and lively shop conversations. His father owned four barbershops across Central Texas, and Roland spent his childhood watching the magic happen from a front-row seat. This year, his father retired—and the torch has been passed. Continuing the tradition, Roland's daughter is also a seasoned hair stylist with over ten years of experience.  "What I love most is connecting with people," Roland says. "Whether someone's getting ready for a job interview, a date, or just needs a reset, I want them to feel confident walking out of my shop. A great haircut can change your whole day."  Custom Cuts Barber Shop is now accepting new clients and welcomes walk-ins and appointments. Roland offers a full menu of services, from precision fades and beard trims to classic cuts for all ages. More than just a barber, he's committed to building relationships and creating a space where customers feel like family.
