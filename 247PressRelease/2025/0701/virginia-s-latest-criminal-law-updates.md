# Virginia's Latest Criminal Law Updates

RICHMOND, VA, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sweeping criminal justice reforms passed during the 2025 Regular Session of the Virginia General Assembly will go into effect on July 1, 2025, reshaping how a wide range of offenses are prosecuted and defended. With enhanced penalties for emerging threats like drone-based surveillance and fentanyl trafficking, as well as long-overdue reforms in criminal procedure, the Commonwealth is signaling a more aggressive and nuanced approach to public safety and individual rights.  Several new statutes expand Virginia's criminal code and elevate the penalties for certain behaviors:  • Mail Theft Now a Felony (HB 1715/SB 939): Tampering with, stealing, or knowingly receiving unlawfully obtained mail is now a Class 6 felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. • Drone Trespassing Criminalized (HB 1726/SB 757): Flying unmanned aircraft systems over contracted defense facilities to gather imagery is now a Class 4 felony. • Intimidation with Nazi Symbols (HB 2783): Displaying Nazi swastikas or similar emblems with the intent to intimidate is now a Class 6 felony. • Assaulting Sports Officials (SB 986): Battery against referees or umpires during or near athletic events is now a Class 1 misdemeanor, potentially resulting in both criminal penalties and bans from future events.  "These laws reflect a growing zero-tolerance stance by prosecutors on symbolic intimidation and technologically-enabled crimes," said attorney Cody Villalon.  Virginia lawmakers have also introduced measures to curb the spread of dangerous substances:  • Fentanyl-Linked Deaths as Involuntary Manslaughter (HB 2657/SB 746): Dealers may now be prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter if someone dies after using fentanyl they knowingly sold—even without intent to kill. • Nitrous Oxide Sales to Minors Banned (HB 2308/SB 1361): Selling nitrous oxide delivery devices to anyone under 18 is now prohibited, with penalties including a Class 1 misdemeanor. • Tobacco and Hemp Products Off-Limits to Youth (HB 1946/SB 1060): Possession of these items by individuals under 21 is now prohibited. Products are subject to confiscation, but no criminal charges will be filed under this specific law.  "These drug laws are a double-edged sword," Villalon said. "While they aim to reduce public harm, they also dramatically raise the stakes for those accused, especially in cases involving fentanyl, where proving knowledge and causation will be key."
