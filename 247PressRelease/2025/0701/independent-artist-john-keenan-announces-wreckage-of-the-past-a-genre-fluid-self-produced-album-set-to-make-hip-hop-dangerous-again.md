# Independent Artist John Keenan Announces Wreckage of the Past — A Genre-Fluid, Self-Produced Album Set to "Make Hip Hop Dangerous Again"

PHOENIX, AZ, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Independent rapper, producer, and writer John Keenan has announced the release of his new full-length album, Wreckage of the Past, arriving September 7, 2025.  The 23-track project is a genre-defying manifesto — fully written, produced, and arranged by Keenan himself, with no guest features and no compromises.  Drawing from hip hop, alternative, rock, soul, and cinematic elements, the album blends political critique, spiritual struggle, and emotional vulnerability into a bold and unconventional soundscape.  Built on a foundation of self-produced beats and real instrumentation — from jazzy boom bap to trap-inspired folk-hop — Wreckage of the Past offers a rare blend of melodic honesty and grounded masculine energy.  From slap bass and orchestral switches to dissident lyrics and raw personal confessions, Wreckage of the Past challenges hip hop's complacency — and music's obsession with image and conformity.  "I wanted to make something honest enough to be dangerous," Keenan says. "This isn't about fitting in — it's about being vulnerable and making the most authentic music I can."  Keenan's summer-long campaign — themed "Make Hip Hop Dangerous Again" — will include short-form videos, mini-documentaries, satire, and raw storytelling content that reclaims hip hop's roots as a voice for truth, struggle, and rebellion.  The album is as much a personal reckoning as it is a cultural broadcast — a call to artists to tell the truth, break the mold, and risk being real.  John Keenan is a self-produced hip hop artist based in Arizona, originally from Great Bend, Kansas. Known for his raw lyrics, genre-blurring production, and philosophical depth, Keenan has quietly built a 20-year catalog by staying true to his voice. Wreckage of the Past is his most ambitious, vulnerable, and politically charged work to date.
