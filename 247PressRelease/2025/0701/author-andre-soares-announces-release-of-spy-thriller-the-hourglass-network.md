# Author Andre Soares Announces Release of Spy Thriller The Hourglass Network

ATLANTA, GA, July 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Acclaimed author, screenwriter, and actor Andre Soares is set to release his latest novel, The Hourglass Network, on July 14, 2025, with pre-orders now available through all major retailers. The release marks Soares' highly anticipated return following a year-long creative hiatus and rebrand, and will be commemorated with a launch event in Atlanta, Georgia.  Building on the momentum of his genre-defying romance The Sunflower Protocol, Soares now turns to the spy thriller genre with a gripping new narrative that combines espionage, environmental collapse, and high-stakes global intrigue. The Hourglass Network follows a covert terror cell operating in the shadows of collapsing institutions, where fractured alliances and buried secrets define the battle for truth and survival. At the heart of the story is a disillusioned CIA operative navigating a world where enemies wear familiar faces, and loyalty is a moving target. As global powers race to control a rapidly destabilizing climate, the novel plunges readers into a suspenseful web of unconventional warfare, shadow diplomacy, and ruthless ambition. With every page, Soares challenges conventional notions of justice and sacrifice, revealing the human cost of a world spiraling toward irreversible change.  "This is more than a thriller," says Soares. "It's a cautionary tale about the slow erosion of truth in a world driven by profit and paranoia. We're watching climate justice and class warfare intersect in real-time, and that's the world I wanted to capture while highlighting characters who feel real and choices that feel impossible."  The Hourglass Network cements Soares's reputation as a bold voice in contemporary fiction. His impact is one unafraid to confront the global anxieties of our time through unforgettable characters and cinematic storytelling. Perfect for fans of political thrillers, spy novels, and climate fiction, this 2025 book release is already generating buzz across literary and entertainment circles.
