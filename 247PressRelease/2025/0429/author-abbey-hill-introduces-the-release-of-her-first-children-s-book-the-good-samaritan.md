# Author Abbey Hill Introduces the Release of Her First Children's Book, "The Good Samaritan"

MAGNOLIA, TX, April 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When author Abbey Hill welcomed her first child in July 2024, she sought God's guidance in both her personal and creative life. As a mother, she embraces the teachings of Jesus, striving to raise her son with God's values at the center of everything she does.  Realizing that some biblical lessons can be challenging for young children, Abbey began illustrating on her iPad to make them more accessible. The moment she put stylus to screen, the stories of God's Word came to life.  Jesus often used parables—simple stories with powerful messages—to explain deeper truths about God, faith, and how we should treat others. These timeless lessons are just as important for our children today. In Abbey's new book, children will explore the story of "The Good Samaritan", where Jesus teaches what it truly means to be a good neighbor.   With vibrant illustrations and thoughtful, interactive questions, this book invites young readers to reflect on God's word and grow in faith. It's a meaningful tool to help guide your child's spiritual journey.  What started as a personal endeavor quickly became a calling. Abbey's illustrations bring the words and works of Jesus to life, beginning with His parables and expanding to other biblical narratives. With a heart for faith-filled storytelling, she is excited to continue sharing God's truth through her art.  As a heartwarming read that has already received glowing reviews from families across the US, Abbey's new book will bring a smile to your favorite child or story lover. "The Good Samaritan" is written for those who want to dive into the teachings of God and Jesus, and appreciate the beauty of a unique and thoughtfully illustrated book.
