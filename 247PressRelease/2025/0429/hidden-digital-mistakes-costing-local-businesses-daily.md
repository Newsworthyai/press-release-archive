# Hidden Digital Mistakes Costing Local Businesses Daily

FREEPORT, IL, April 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Local businesses are silently losing customers due to hidden digital mistakes, and Communication & Design Inc. just created a way to find and fix them fast.  The veteran digital marketing agency just launched their "Marketing Playbook" – a comprehensive digital footprint deep-dive that reveals exactly where established businesses are missing out on potential customers and revenue.  Shocking Findings From 100+ Local Business Audits  "What we discovered after analyzing over 100 local businesses was eye-opening," says Ryan Lester, founder of Communication & Design Inc. "Last month alone, we found three established Freeport companies sending customers to disconnected phone numbers. Another had their Google listing pointing to their old location from 2019. These aren't complex problems – but they're costing real businesses real money every single day."  The Marketing Playbook analyzes every corner of a business's online presence – from their website and Google Maps listings to their SEO rankings and advertising performance.   While most free assessments give you a pretty-much-useless 30,000-foot overview, the Marketing Playbook hands you a clear roadmap of exactly what to fix first for maximum profit.  Competitive Intelligence Reveals Critical Gaps  "The fascinating part is showing businesses what they don't know they don't know," says Lester. "For example, we recently showed a local HVAC company that their top competitor was responding to every customer review within 2 hours. Meanwhile, their own negative reviews sat unanswered for months. Homeowners were choosing their competition because of it. That's what the Marketing Playbook does - it shows exactly how you stack up against competitors and gives you a clear plan to get ahead...and stay there."  Client Success Stories  "Without a doubt, Communication and Design Inc. has been a complete winner for us. Having worked with us on a number of digital issues, including completely rebuilding our brand and website. They gave us support throughout the process and listened to our needs before producing a solution that works," said Darryl Leathart, owner of Following Seas Recruiting. "Do yourself a favor, get in touch if you need digital work, you won't be sorry."  The Marketing Playbook is specifically designed for established businesses doing at least $500,000 in annual revenue who want to maximize their digital presence and capture more local customers.
