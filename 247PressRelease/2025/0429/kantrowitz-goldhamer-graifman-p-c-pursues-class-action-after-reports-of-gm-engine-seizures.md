# Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C. Pursues Class Action After Reports of GM Engine Seizures

MONTVALE, NJ, April 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hackensack, NJ personal injury attorneys at Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C. have launched an investigation into alleged defects affecting General Motors' 6.2L V9 L87 engines installed in numerous vehicle models from 2019 to 2024.  The investigation targets multiple GM vehicles including Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (2019-2024), Chevrolet Tahoe (2021-2024), Chevrolet Suburban (2021-2024), GMC Sierra 1500 (2019-2024), GMC Yukon (2021-2024), GMC Yukon XL (2021-2024), Cadillac Escalade and Cadillac Escalade ESV (2021-2024).  According to reports received by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), owners have experienced sudden power loss due to engine seizures. These failures appear to stem from bearing failures that may result in the engine seizing or the connecting rod breaching the engine block.  The potential defect presents significant safety concerns. A seized engine can lead to unexpected loss of power while driving, substantially increasing the risk of crashes and injuries to vehicle occupants and others on the road.  Despite the NHTSA's ongoing investigation and numerous consumer complaints, General Motors has not yet issued a formal recall for the affected vehicles.  The law firm is evaluating the possibility of a class action lawsuit on behalf of affected vehicle owners. Owners who have experienced engine problems with the specified models may be entitled to compensation for repair costs, diminished vehicle value, and other damages.
