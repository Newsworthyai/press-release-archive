# Federal Whistleblower Files Constitutional Challenge to Private Equity HIG Capital Controlled Bankruptcy in Wellpath Holdings Case

Federal Whistleblower Files 75-in-One Motion Suite in Wellpath–H.I.G. Bankruptcy, Citing Suppression, ADA Retaliation, and Procedural Fraud  FRESNO, CA, April 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Kanwar Partap Singh Gill, M.D., a board-certified California physician and federally protected whistleblower, has filed the 75-in-One Verified Emergency Motion Suite in the bankruptcy proceedings of Wellpath Holdings, Inc. (Case No. 24-90533, SDTX). This unprecedented 300-page emergency filing constitutes the most comprehensive verified whistleblower submission in the history of the federal bankruptcy system.  The motion suite challenges what Dr. Gill alleges is a procedurally and constitutionally tainted reorganization process, orchestrated by private equity sponsor H.I.G. Capital and its agents. According to the filing, the bankruptcy was not a good-faith debt restructuring, but rather a mechanism to extinguish billions in legal exposure through the abuse of non-consensual third-party releases, ballot manipulation, and judicial docket suppression.  Between April 14 and April 22, 2025, Dr. Gill submitted eight verified filings—raising formal objections to the plan, asserting ADA retaliation, ERISA fiduciary breaches, IRS §409A noncompliance, and governance-based CPOM violations. However, none were publicly docketed. The plan and solicitation proceeded without record of those objections, giving the false impression of creditor consensus.  In response, Dr. Gill filed the 75-in-One Verified Emergency Motion Suite, which includes motions to:  Strike Dkt. 2321 (Plan Supplement),  Invalidate tainted ballots and voting reports,  Disqualify noticing agent Epiq and debtor counsel McDermott Will & Emery LLP,  Enforce constitutional due process rights under the Fifth Amendment,  Trigger DOJ, U.S. Trustee, and Grand Jury referrals under 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1519, 3332.  The filing invokes statutory protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), ERISA, CPOM Doctrine, and governing bankruptcy statutes including 11 U.S.C. §§ 105(a), 1125(b), 1129(a), and Rule 60(d)(3).  A confirmation hearing is scheduled for April 30, 2025, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. Dr. Gill asserts that confirmation cannot lawfully proceed while 75 verified motions are pending, and has declared his intent to pursue post-confirmation remedies through Rule 60 relief, appellate review, and federal prosecution.
