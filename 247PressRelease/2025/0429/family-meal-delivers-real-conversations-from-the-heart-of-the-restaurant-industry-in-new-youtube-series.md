# Family Meal Delivers Real Conversations from the Heart of the Restaurant Industry in New YouTube Series

CHICAGO, IL, April 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Family Meal, a new documentary-style YouTube series created by Bottle Rocket Media and hosted by food journalist Ari Bendersky, offers a raw, behind-the-scenes look at what really happens inside restaurants beyond the menu and media spotlight.  Rather than focusing on fame or dramatized chaos, Family Meal features honest, roundtable conversations with chefs, GMs, sommeliers, line cooks, and other hospitality pros. Each episode is filmed inside a real restaurant, revealing the culture, teamwork, and quiet rituals that define modern restaurant life.  The show's namesake is at the center of each episode: the family meal; a pre-service tradition where teams pause to share food, decompress, and reconnect. Often unknown or misunderstood by diners, the family meal is a moment of reflection and camaraderie that reminds restaurant workers why they do what they do.   "This show is a love letter to the people who make hospitality happen," says Bendersky. "We're not just talking about food, we're talking about mentorship, burnout, grit, creativity, and the family dynamic that forms behind the scenes."  The debut episode features Chicago's West Town Restaurant, Brasero, where Chef John Manion and his team explore the highs and lows of life in the industry. The episode centers on shared experiences and the everyday family meal that turns coworkers into a chosen family.  "I've had this concept in my head for years," says Brett Singer, Executive Producer and Principal of Bottle Rocket Media. "I'm not a chef or a foodie, I just deeply respect the people who hold this industry together. This show was born from wanting to show the craft, the chaos, and the community of restaurant life from the inside out."  Created for Hospitality Professionals, Industry Insiders and Foodies The Family Meal audience spans the hospitality spectrum from back-of-house kitchen staff and general managers to vendors, hospitality leaders, and industry partners.
