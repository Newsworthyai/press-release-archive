# Glassonic Awarded U.S. Patent for Curved Glass Wireless Speaker That Delivers Full‑Range, Room‑Filling Sound

IRVINE, CA, September 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Glassonic today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted U.S. Patent No. 12,395,784 B2 for the company's breakthrough glass‑based, free‑standing wireless speaker system. The invention covers a distinctive curved glass panel that is widest at the base and gradually narrows toward the top, with three slots near the top to reduce mass and fine‑tune resonance. This geometry is engineered so that low frequencies resonate more prominently near the base, mids in the middle section, and highs toward the top, creating a natural full‑range response from a single glass structure.  "This patent recognizes years of R&D to unlock the acoustic potential of glass," said Nelson Fathollahi, inventor of the patented system. "By shaping and precisely mass‑tuning the panel, we transform glass from a decorative element into a high‑fidelity transducer that produces a spacious soundstage while preserving a clean, modern aesthetic."  With the newly issued patent, Glassonic strengthens its IP position as it advances product development and partnerships. The design enables wireless, free‑standing speakers that integrate elegantly into contemporary interiors—delivering immersive sound without bulky boxes.  What's Patented Curved glass panel: wide at the base, tapering to the top for controlled modal behavior.  Three mass‑reducing slots near the top to optimize high‑frequency response and sensitivity.  Frequency gradient along the panel: lows emphasize at the bottom, mids in the center, highs toward the top.  High‑fidelity, free‑standing, wireless speaker system that leverages the above geometry.  Why It Matters Full‑range performance from a single sculptural element—a minimalist alternative to traditional multi‑driver enclosures.  Architectural integration: glass form factor complements modern spaces while delivering audiophile‑grade sound.  Scalable platform: geometry and slotting can be tuned for different sizes, rooms, and use‑cases.
