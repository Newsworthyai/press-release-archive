# Nucleon Energy and ARC Clean Technology form NuARCâ€”a partnership entity to deploy non-emitting power, starting in Alberta, Canada

CALGARY, AB, September 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nucleon Energy Inc. ("Nucleon"), a Calgary-based small modular reactor development and operations company focused on Canada and the U.S., and ARC Clean Technology Canada Inc. ("ARC"), a Canadian and U.S.-based nuclear reactor technology company, announced today the formation of a partnership entity named NuARC. The newly formed entity is focused on the development and deployment of affordable, reliable and non-emitting electrical generation facilities using ARC's advanced small modular reactor technology with an initial focus in Alberta, Canada.  NuARC leverages Canada's deep ingenuity and skilled workforce to accelerate the delivery of advanced nuclear technology. By combining Nucleon's development and operational expertise with ARC's proven Generation IV advanced reactor technology, NuARC is positioned to be a leader in the development and delivery of cost-effective advanced nuclear facilities. This initiative is expected to create new jobs, diversify Canada's economy, and attract significant foreign investment, strengthening the country's position as a global leader in clean energy.  NuARC's mandate is particularly timely as it highlights Canada's proven nuclear technology and delivery capabilities amid unprecedented global trade tensions. The partnership will leverage Nucleon's site locations in key areas, including Alberta, where ARC's advanced reactors can support electricity demand growth, industrial heat requirements, and the production of life-saving medical isotopes.  ARC's Generation IV reactor technology, the ARC-100, is a 100 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a modular design that enables rapid, cost-effective deployment and offers a versatile solution for a wide range of electrical grid and industrial applications. Earlier this year, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission completed a Phase 2 Vendor Design Review of the ARC-100 reactor and found no fundamental barriers to licensing.  "Our partnership with ARC Clean Technology marks a major step forward for private-sector nuclear development," said Dustin Wilkes, CEO of Nucleon Energy Inc. "By combining Nucleon's project development and operating expertise with ARC's advanced Generation IV technology, we can accelerate deployment of clean, reliable power while driving economic growth and energy security. Together with ARC, we're proving that private enterprise can lead the next wave of nuclear development in North America."  "The formation of NuARC is the culmination of a shared vision to make advanced, non-emitting nuclear energy a cornerstone of the future energy mix," said Lance Clarke, Vice President of Commercialization and Strategy of ARC Clean Technology. "Our reactor technology is designed for safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The modular design of the ARC-100 allows for streamlined construction, and its ability to deliver industrial heat and medical isotopes unlocks incredible value for communities and industries. We are thrilled to partner with Nucleon to bring this clean energy solution to new markets."  "Alberta is a land of opportunity," said Nathan Neudorf, Alberta's Minister of Affordability and Utilities. "With the creation of the NuARC partnership, we are seeing the enormous private sector investment nuclear energy could potentially bring to our province. There's momentum to helping our province meet growing energy needs, as well as provide life-saving medical isotopes that can ensure a better, brighter future for all Albertans. We have recently launched our consultation process on nuclear energy and we are eager to hear back from Albertans on the path forward."
