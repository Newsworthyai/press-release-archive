# SB 30 Fails to Pass Texas Legislature

STAFFORD, TX, September 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A bill that would have limited payouts for personal injury and wrongful death claims has died in the Texas legislature. Initially introduced in 2025, SB 30 was intended to reduce the amount of money plaintiffs could receive after filing suit for personal injuries (such as car accidents, work-related accidents, and premises liability claims) and wrongful deaths.  Proponents of SB 30 claimed that the bill would prevent runaway lawsuits, packaging the bill as a major step forward for tort reform. However, opponents of the bill viewed SB 30 as a pro-insurance piece of legislation that would sacrifice the rights of the injured in favor of limited payouts from major insurance corporations.  SB 30 proposed monetary caps on what injured parties could receive. It would have also limited the ability of injured parties to present evidence referring to emotional anguish, damage to reputation, pain and suffering, and other non-economic damages. During the Senate Committee's hearing, survivors of injuries and sexual assaults stepped forward to explain why these non-economic damages matter.  While supporters of SB 30 argued that the bill would cut down on "nuclear verdicts" - high payout, unpreventable awards for personal injuries and wrongful deaths only 4.6% of all verdicts in Texas between 2021 and 2025 exceeded $10 million1. Meanwhile, SB 30 would have imposed limits on all personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, not just the highest-profile cases.  Being able to pursue legal damages against a negligent party is a cornerstone of the Texas legal system. Now that SB 30 has died in the Texas legislature, those in need can continue to seek damages and financial compensation that actually matches their injuries both economic, and non-economic. For the time being, the rights of the injured have been placed ahead of the rights of insurance companies.
