"At SunKnowledge, our mission has always been to empower healthcare providers by simplifying financial operations. Accounts receivable is where most practices lose revenue, and we've built our reputation by ensuring that money owed is money collected," said the spokesperson at SunKnowledge Inc., Ronnie Hastings.

Today, SunKnowledge proudly manages AR for clients in all 50 states, making it a truly nationwide partner. Its team understands the nuances of different payers, state-specific billing requirements, and specialty-driven challenges, whether it's orthopedics, cardiology, urgent care, home health, pain management, infusion, or hospital-based care.   This month, SunKnowledge has once again demonstrated its market strength by welcoming a renowned hospital in California to its growing network. This partnership not only reflects the company's expanding footprint on the West Coast but also showcases the trust healthcare organizations continue to place in its ability to deliver results.
