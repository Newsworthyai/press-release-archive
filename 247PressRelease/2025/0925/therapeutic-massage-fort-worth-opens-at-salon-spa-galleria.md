# Therapeutic Massage Fort Worth Opens at Salon &amp; Spa Galleria

FORT WORTH, TX, September 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Professional massage therapist Laura Myres is pleased to announce the opening of her new studio, Therapeutic Massage Fort Worth, located in the Salon & Spa Galleria at 6351 Oakmont Blvd. in Fort Worth, Texas. With more than 25 years' experience and specialized training in many different modalities and styles of massage, Ms. Myres has the knowledge and expertise to identify and isolate problem areas and tailor each session to suit a client's individual needs.  According to Laura, therapeutic massage should be carefully designed to alleviate pain, improve emotional well-being, and help relieve stress. Rather than focusing on one specific massage style per session, she prefers relying on clients' requests and what her hands can feel. Through questions and observation of what sets of muscles are "angry" at a given time, she's able to gear services towards a better outcome. Above all, she does not believe a massage should be painful or hurt beyond a controlled degree of therapeutic discomfort. "I feel like all levels of massage have their own merit and benefits. I offer a touch as light as the weight of a nickel to a deeper firm touch as needed to address the underlying muscles."  Therapeutic Massage Fort Worth is regularly open on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Special Saturday and Monday appointments can be arranged in advance if needed. Although walk-ins are welcome, appointments are strongly encouraged to ensure availability.  To schedule an appointment or request more information about the services offered, call or text Laura directly at (817) 789-9696. If a call is missed, rest assured that it will be returned as soon as possible. According to Laura, "I always welcome calls to address questions and help determine if I am what they are looking for. Whether or not you receive service from me or another, massage can be a great addition to your life."  Interestingly, Ms. Myres worked out of the Oakmont Blvd Salon & Spa Galleria very early in her career. After venturing out to other locations, she came "full circle back to the same location" where she first began. Said Laura, "I am impressed by the new management. I have already had one client comment that she enjoys the energy of the place, that people seem happy."  Ms. Myres also likes the fact that she is now situated where "There's a great group of professionals with different talents, all within one location." By choosing to lease an upscale suite in one of the numerous Salon & Spa Gallerias in the Fort Worth area, she has joined a group of successful salon owners who are each able to offer specialized beauty and wellness services in their own private and luxurious setting.
