# Carosella &amp; Associates Warns Families About the Financial Risks of DIY Estate Administration

WEST CHESTER, PA, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- While online legal tools and downloadable forms promise quick and affordable solutions, they often leave grieving families vulnerable to costly errors, disputes, and delays in settling a loved one's estate.  "Estate administration is more complex than many people realize. Pennsylvania law has specific requirements for probate, asset distribution, and debt resolution," said Vince Carosella, Founding Attorney at Carosella & Associates. "When families try to handle it on their own, they can unintentionally miss critical deadlines, file incorrect documents, or fail to properly account for assets. These errors can cause unnecessary stress and financial loss."  The attorneys at Carosella & Associates have seen first-hand the problems that arise when families attempt DIY estate administration without legal guidance. Common issues include failing to file probate petitions on time, overlooking creditors' claims, or incorrectly dividing assets between beneficiaries. Such mistakes can lead to higher court costs, prolonged delays, and even lawsuits between family members.  A well-structured estate administration plan requires careful attention to Pennsylvania probate rules, local court procedures, and the specific terms of wills and trusts. Without the knowledge of a probate attorney in Chester County, PA, personal representatives may also risk becoming personally liable for unpaid debts, tax filings, or mismanagement of estate assets. Families often find themselves spending more time and money correcting errors than they would have by seeking professional legal assistance from the beginning.  Carosella & Associates stresses that estate administration is not just about completing paperwork. It involves: • Filing probate documents with the appropriate Orphans' Court in Pennsylvania • Identifying, securing, and valuing all estate assets • Paying debts, taxes, and expenses in the proper order • Resolving creditor claims fairly and legally • Distributing property and funds according to the decedent's will or state law • Protecting executors and administrators from liability through proper documentation  "Our goal is to ease the burden during what is often an emotional and difficult time," Carosella explained. "By working with an experienced estate administration lawyer, families can avoid disputes, reduce stress, and ensure that their loved one's legacy is honored and protected."  The firm also highlights the importance of integrating estate administration with broader estate planning strategies such as wills, trusts, and powers of attorney. These tools help prevent conflicts, streamline the probate process, and provide long-term financial security for heirs. In many cases, the attorneys at Carosella & Associates are able to help families save significant time and resources by guiding them through the process step by step.  Families in West Chester, Exton, Downingtown, Coatesville, Kennett Square, and surrounding communities are encouraged to seek legal advice before attempting to manage an estate on their own. "The bottom line," Carosella added, "is that trying to navigate estate administration without legal guidance may cost far more in the long run. We want families to know that they don't have to go through this difficult process alone."  For more than 25 years, the skilled team of attorneys, paralegals, firm administrators, administrative assistants, and legal secretaries at Carosella & Associates has provided top-quality legal representation for matters in myriad aspects of the law.
