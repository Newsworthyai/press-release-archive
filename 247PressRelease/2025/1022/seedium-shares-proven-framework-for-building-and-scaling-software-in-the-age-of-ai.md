# Seedium Shares Proven Framework for Building and Scaling Software in the Age of AI

LONDON, ENGLAND, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Seedium, a global software engineering company, is sharing its framework for building and scaling software products in a recent Xraised interview. The company's CEO, Mykhailo Kopyl, outlined how AI is impacting the software industry, the opportunities it brings to startup founders, and how to leverage them efficiently.  As AI technology continues to advance, the number of no-code and low-code solutions that enable accelerated development of software products is growing rapidly. While these tools allow startups and SMBs to validate ideas and bring products to market faster than ever, they also carry the risk of producing poorly structured software if foundational architecture considerations are neglected.  "AI brings startups unique opportunities to create as many prototypes as possible even without having technical skills," said Mykhailo Kopyl, CEO of Seedium. "Many of such vibe-coded products successfully find product-market fit. But another side of these products is that they are not scalable enough."  Seedium's approach helps businesses build quickly while staying ready for growth and global expansion. By combining the latest technologies with years of engineering expertise, Seedium helps founders take what they already have to the next level in a smarter and faster way. This approach combines intelligent automation of repetitive tasks through custom templates and setups, with experienced software engineers overseeing the process, making final decisions, and validating the quality of AI-generated outcomes.  Mykhailo Kopyl emphasizes the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration as a key driver for accelerating success in software development. This collaboration shortens development cycles, accelerates time-to-market, and ultimately delivers a higher return on investment for startups and SMBs.  "In our recent case, we rebuilt the back end of a huge platform with legacy code within three months," said Mykhailo. "Before AI, building something similar would probably have taken a year."  Founders and tech leaders can watch the full interview on Seedium's YouTube channel or explore the company's updates on the official website.  Seedium is a trusted web & mobile app development company that has been helping startups and SMBs design, build, and scale software products since 2017. With more than 200 successfully delivered products, Seedium has earned recognition from its clients and the industry as a reliable development partner across SaaS, HRTech, HealthTech, and other industries.
