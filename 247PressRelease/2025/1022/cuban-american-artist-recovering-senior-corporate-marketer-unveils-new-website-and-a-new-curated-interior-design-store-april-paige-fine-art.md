DURHAM, NC, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- April Paige Fine Art is kicking off its creative renaissance with the launch of an all-new website, packed with original artwork, exclusive prints, and an exciting new online Interior Design Store. Whether you're an art enthusiast, interior designer, collector, or home decorator, the new site invites you to explore items designed to make a statement in any space.  A New Chapter for April Paige Fine Art "This isn't just a website update—it's a creative evolution," says April Paige, the visionary artist behind the brand. "My work is about energy, emotion, and movement, and the new site is a reflection of that. It's a fresh space to connect with art lovers and designers who are seeking more than just art—they're looking for pieces that stir the soul."  After years as a senior corporate marketer, April describes herself as a "recovering senior marketer" who returned to her roots in art to build a more intentional, creatively authentic life. That leap from boardrooms to brushstrokes fuels every piece she creates.  Art That Moves You The revamped site introduces a bold new wave of vibrant artworks that pulse with texture and movement, pushing the boundaries of what art can evoke. These pieces aren't just meant to hang on a wall — they're designed to energize and transform any environment, making each room feel alive. April believes in creative authenticity and using her work to bring personal meaning into personal space.  A Rich Cuban Heritage of Creativity April's unique Cuban-American heritage has deeply influenced her artistic journey. Growing up surrounded by a vibrant cultural mix—from cigar rollers and lectors in Ybor City to TV directors, radio show hosts, painters, and musicians—her family offered an eclectic blend of artistry, storytelling, and passion. This dynamic lineage continues to shape her artistic voice today.  Whether you're searching for the perfect statement piece, a curated design element, or something unexpected for your business or boutique space, April Paige Fine Art offers a fresh take on interior art.  20+ years ago April Paige Fine Art was a thriving art business. I had to put it on hold for many reasons - work and personal. But now I am very happy to say that, I now have the time and the resources to bring my passion back to life. I am giving it the true dedication that I always dreamed of but never had the time to do. I am so grateful and thankful to have this opportunity and I hope that you enjoy the journey along with me.
