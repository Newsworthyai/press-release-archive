# Meet "Fast Fred" — The DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum's Beloved Autonomous Racer

FORT WORTH, TX, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum has officially added a surprising new favorite to its lineup of classic cars and rare collectibles: Fast Fred, the museum's fully autonomous robotic floor scrubber. While he was built to clean, this high-tech Tennant X4 ROVR has quickly become one of the most talked-about "exhibits" on the floor.  Fast Fred was named in honor of museum founder Ron Sturgeon's late twin brother, a lifelong drag racer whose spirit lives on in this unexpected little speedster. Outfitted with custom decals, an NHRA sticker, and a smiley face up front, Fast Fred fits right in among the museum's collection of muscle cars, race legends, and automotive icons.  During his three-hour cleaning runs, Fast Fred zips through the galleries with precision, pausing politely when guests cross his path before darting off again with racer-like urgency. Visitors often stop to snap photos or cheer him on as he cruises past rows of chrome and horsepower.  "In a museum built on speed, nostalgia, and the love of cars, it's only fitting that even our cleaning crew has racing DNA," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "Fast Fred keeps our floors spotless—and our visitors smiling."  From roaring engines to autonomous innovation, the DFW Car & Toy Museum continues to blend automotive history with modern technology, creating an experience that surprises and delights guests of all ages.
