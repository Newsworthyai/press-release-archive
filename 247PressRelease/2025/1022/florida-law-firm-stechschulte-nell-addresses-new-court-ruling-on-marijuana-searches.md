# Florida Law Firm Stechschulte Nell Addresses New Court Ruling on Marijuana Searches

TAMPA, FL, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Following a major appellate court ruling that the smell of cannabis alone no longer justifies a vehicle search, Ben Stechschulte, the Tampa, FL, drug defense lawyer of Stechschulte Nell, is calling attention to how this decision reshapes law enforcement practices and criminal defense strategies in Florida.  The Second District Court of Appeal's ruling stems from a 2023 Hillsborough County case, where officers relied solely on marijuana odor to search a vehicle. The court determined that since Florida now allows medical marijuana and hemp, the smell of cannabis can no longer automatically indicate criminal activity.  "This ruling reinforces constitutional protections and emphasizes the importance of probable cause," said Ben Stechschulte, founding attorney at Stechschulte Nell. "As both a former prosecutor and a board-certified criminal defense attorney, I've seen firsthand how search-based evidence can alter a person's future. These changes require precise legal understanding to make certain clients' rights are fully protected."  In addition to state-level implications, the firm notes this ruling may influence broader procedures involving search and seizure laws. Individuals facing federal drug charges or related investigations are urged to consult our qualified Tampa, FL federal crimes defense lawyer to help decipher these evolving regulations.
