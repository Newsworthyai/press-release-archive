# Patented Automatic Center-Aligning "Laonson Pill Cutter" Launches Globally on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, October 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A healthy life begins with balance - in diet, exercise, sleep, and proper medication habits. The supplements and medicines we take daily are deeply connected to the health of ourselves, our families, and even our pets. As a result, the importance of tools that help ensure accurate dosage is growing. In response to this need, the Laonson Pill Cutter, a precise and hygienic cutting solution, is launching globally through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  The core technology behind the Laonson Pill Cutter lies in its "automatic center-aligning mechanism." Conventional pill cutters often fail to align pills perfectly, causing them to break unevenly or crumble. In contrast, the Laonson Pill Cutter's automatic alignment system allows users to slice pills exactly down the middle. This proprietary technology is patented in South Korea and patent-pending in the United States and China.  With a cutting range of 5–25 mm, it can handle everything from small tablets to large vitamins. Regardless of shape, be it round, oval, triangular, or octagonal, as long as the pill has a flat surface, it can be neatly cut.  For precision, it uses a 0.3 mm medical-grade 440 stainless steel blade, and only the blade itself needs to be replaced, allowing for hygienic use across different types of medication. The main body is designed for long-term durability, and by replacing only the blade, the product reduces plastic waste, promoting sustainability.  Pill residuals can be removed using a dedicated cleaning brush or by washing the entire cutter with water. The sliding lock cover ensures hygienic and safe storage, and with its compact size (67×62×32 mm), it's highly portable.  An optional pill-cutting workstation is also available for purchase, designed to enable quick and stable pill placement. This addition enhances convenience for home users while also increasing cutting efficiency in professional settings such as pharmacies and hospitals where large quantities of pills are handled.  A Laonson representative stated, "Accurate medication habits are not just about personal health; they mark the starting point of a healthier culture for society as a whole. Through the Laonson Pill Cutter, we aim to promote not just convenience, but an evolution in the culture of medication."  The Laonson Pill Cutter will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting October 21, 2025, with exclusive launch-day discounts for early supporters.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1953218735/laonson-next-generation-pill-cutter-cut-pills-like-a-pro?ref=1e4lvm
