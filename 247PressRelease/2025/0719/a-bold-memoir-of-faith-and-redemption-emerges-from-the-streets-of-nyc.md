# A Bold Memoir of Faith and Redemption Emerges from the Streets of NYC

RICHMOND, TX, July 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a riveting new memoir, A Journey Finding Jesus: My Story, retired Navy veteran and speaker Nelson Tirado opens his heart to readers in a raw, poignant, and deeply personal account of trauma, survival, and spiritual awakening. From the violent streets of Manhattan to global tours in the U.S. Navy, Tirado's life is a testimony to the unwavering power of God's presence even in our darkest moments.  This memoir is not just a life story. It's a spiritual roadmap for those searching for meaning amid hardship. Orphaned by age twelve, haunted by personal loss, and surrounded by crime, Nelson defied the odds through grit, determination, and grace. His journey through poverty, abuse, gang violence, and PTSD ultimately led him not just toward personal success but toward a powerful and abiding relationship with Jesus Christ.  "I knew something was missing," Tirado shares. "But I didn't realize that Jesus had been by my side all along."  Tirado's story touches readers from all walks of life. With themes of family dysfunction, personal healing, military discipline, and spiritual awakening, this memoir is as much a call to faith as it is a compelling narrative of human strength.
