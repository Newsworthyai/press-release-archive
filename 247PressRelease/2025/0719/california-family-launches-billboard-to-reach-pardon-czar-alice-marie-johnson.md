# California Family Launches Billboard to Reach "Pardon Czar" Alice Marie Johnson

WASHINGTON, DC, July 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a bold move thousands of miles from home, a California family has launched a heartfelt billboard campaign in Olive Branch, Mississippi, on Hwy 78 towards Memphis, Tennessee — the hometown of Alice Marie Johnson — in hopes of gaining her attention and support.  The billboard, which reads "Congratulations Alice Marie Johnson — America's Pardon Czar. We pray for your help," with a link to PardonMazzei.com, is the work of advocating for Chris and Erin Mazzei, parents and small business owners seeking justice after what they describe as a devastating and misrepresented federal case.  "We're not celebrities, we are not wealthy. We're just a regular conservative American family trying to recover from the fallout of a broken system," said Chris Mazzei. "Alice Marie Johnson understands injustice on a personal level — and we believe if we could just get our story to her, she's the one who will care enough to hear us out."  The Mazzeis say they were targeted by federal prosecutors and pressured into a plea deal. Their case has already drawn the attention of political commentator Roger Stone, who recently wrote about their experience in an article titled "A Modern-Day Railroading" and had Chris Mazzei on his national radio show.  In addition to the billboard, the Mazzei's have sent hundreds of packets of supporting documents detailing their case to Ms. Johnson, as well as to key figures in the Trump-aligned clemency movement. The White House, Pam Bondi, Ed Martin and Kash Patel have all been made aware of the case. In a formal response, Patel's office confirmed that the materials were being forwarded to the Los Angeles FBI office for possible investigation into the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Hawaii who led the case.  "We chose Mississippi because it's where Alice lives," said Erin Mazzei from her prison camp. "We didn't know what else to do. This billboard is our way of saying, 'Please — just look at what happened to us.'"  The billboard is expected to run throughout the coming months, and the family prays it will spark attention and lead to a conversation with Johnson or members of President Trump's team.

Their lives were upended during the COVID-19 pandemic. This billboard campaign is one of many efforts to raise national awareness and seek clemency. - Mazzeijustice@gmail.com
