# "The Emotion Code" listed among 15 life-changing books recommended by Tony Robbins

ST. GEORGE, UT, January 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The Emotion Code: How to Release Your Trapped Emotions for Abundant Health, Love, and Happiness" by Dr. Bradley Nelson, a book that launched a healing revolution, has been listed among 15 life-changing books recommended by Tony Robbins.  Robbins, a renowned motivational speaker and life coach, lists "The Emotion Code" among classics such as "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor E. Frankl, "As A Man Thinketh" by James Allen, and "Mindset" by Carol S. Dweck.  "What we really love about Dr. Brad is his drive to empower patients to learn how to do more to heal themselves," Robbins says. "I can relate to this because I am always on the hunt for what I call profound knowledge. What's profound knowledge? To me it's when you can learn something that's so simple, you can apply it immediately to change your own life or someone else's."  In "The Emotion Code," Dr. Brad introduces a revolutionary approach to healing. By identifying and releasing trapped emotions, readers can experience profound physical and emotional relief. The book provides practical tools for achieving emotional balance and unlocking the body's innate healing potential.  "I believe that the discoveries in this book can change our understanding of how we store emotional experiences and, in so doing, change our lives," Robbins wrote in the foreword to the revised and expanded 2019 edition of the book. "'The Emotion Code' has already changed many lives around the world, and it is my hope that millions more will be led to use this simple tool to heal themselves and their loved ones."  In 2007, Dr. Brad, a veteran holistic physician, tapped into his 20 years of experience helping patients heal from emotional trauma and chronic physical illness to publish the original edition of "The Emotion Code." The original edition of the book sold more than 175,000 copies and launched a holistic healing revolution worldwide.  Dr. Brad has had the privilege of training and certifying over 14,000 Emotion Code practitioners across more than 80 countries. These practitioners have learned to identify and release trapped emotions that can negatively impact health and relationships. He also uncovered what many consider a groundbreaking discovery in energy medicine — the Heart-Wall™, an energetic barrier made up of trapped emotions that can hinder people from fully giving and receiving love, often leading to feelings of loneliness, sadness, and emotional isolation.  The revised and expanded edition of "The Emotion Code" features a new chapter on how we can "inherit" emotions from our ancestors, 60 new subsections, definitions of emotions, new information on the Heart-Wall™, and more details on the process of clearing "trapped emotions" — the emotional baggage we all carry from difficult and traumatic life experiences.  "Some of the greatest satisfactions in my life come from teaching people, bringing out the healer in them, practicing the healing arts myself, and experiencing the joy that comes from helping others to be well," Dr. Brad says.  About Dr. Nelson: Veteran holistic physician Dr. Bradley Nelson (D.C., ret.) is one of the world's foremost experts on natural methods of achieving wellness. He is the creator of the Emotion Code, the Body Code and the Belief Code, and is the CEO of Discover Healing, a holistic education platform that provides training and certifies practitioners worldwide.
