# Replace Fear With Gratitude To Create Joy Says Bestselling Author Jody Sharpe

WILMINGTON, NC, January 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The universe holds endless opportunities to experience joy, if we will only choose to look for them. Bestselling author Jody Sharpe believes we will always find them. That is sage advice indeed. It is a new year, and now is the perfect time to begin.  In a recent article titled "Replacing Fear with Gratitude Will Find Joy," Sharpe wrote:  A new year comes and unfortunately our world still reels from a tumultuous 2024. There is a thought by many though that the world will improve, that hate can dissipate, that love can find a way to unite us here on our beautiful earth. It's just a speck in the vast universe and yet we are made from all the components, the fabric of life but still so many are blind to that thought. Hate is powerful but Love is the most powerful force of all.  When I ask for inspirations from the angels they come in words and phrases. Lately. the phrase has been, let gratefulness replace fearfulness. Would it really be that strange to think that attitude and hope could be the catalyst for ending wars and hate?  I've written many times that after my daughter passed away I met a man who I'm sure was an angel. I feared my life had no meaning and gratefulness and joy were seemingly gone. Hope was a thing of the past. Yet meeting the angel with his comforting presence started to change my way of thinking. I could be happy again, I could find courage to go on and love those left to care for including my fellow man. Bitterness, I vowed, would never show its face, I had work to do as a teacher, a parent, a wife and a friend.  Now and forever, I look for hope for our world as I ask for inspiration from the angels.  The full text of the article is available at https://jodysharpe.com/tuesdays-with-the-angels-replacing-fear-with-gratitude-will-find-joy/  Sharpe recently received an honorable mention in the 2024 National Federation of Press Women's Professional Communication contest at the national level for one of her novels, 'Summer of Angels'.

Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs.

With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away.
