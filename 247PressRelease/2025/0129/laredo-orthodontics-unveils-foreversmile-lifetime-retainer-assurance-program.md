# Laredo Orthodontics Unveils FOREVERSMILE: Lifetime Retainer Assurance Program

LAREDO, TX, January 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Laredo Orthodontics is thrilled to announce the launch of FOREVERSMILE, a groundbreaking lifetime retainer assurance program designed to help patients protect their investment in their orthodontic care. This program is the first of its kind in Laredo, offering unparalleled support for maintaining a perfect smile post-treatment.  About the FOREVERSMILE Program FOREVERSMILE allows patients who have completed their orthodontic treatment to protect their new smiles with a lifetime guarantee on retainers. For a one-time fee of $465, which roughly equals the cost of a new set of retainers, patients can secure their smile's longevity. If a retainer is lost or damaged, a replacement can be ordered for a nominal $48 copay, significantly below typical costs.  This program is exclusive to Laredo Orthodontics, reflecting our commitment to innovative and patient-focused care. Patients benefit from personalized 3D digital impressions stored securely, enabling quick and convenient retainer replacements without the need for additional office visits.  Dr. Catalina Zambrano's Vision Dr. Catalina Zambrano, a respected board-certified orthodontist at Laredo Orthodontics, shared her enthusiasm about the launch: "With the introduction of FOREVERSMILE, we are setting a new standard for orthodontic care in Laredo. This program is a testament to our dedication to providing lasting value and peace of mind to our patients and their families. I am excited to offer this unique service that ensures our patients can enjoy their beautiful smiles indefinitely, without worrying about the additional costs typically associated with retainer replacement."  The Benefits of FOREVERSMILE FOREVERSMILE not only offers financial benefits but also ensures that retainers, which double as night guards and whitening trays, continue to protect and enhance patients' smiles. Additionally, the program includes a 15% discount on corrective treatments if needed due to the loss of retainers.  Joining FOREVERSMILE Enrollment in FOREVERSMILE is encouraged at the start of any braces, Invisalign, or clear aligner treatment to maximize the benefits.
