# Bone Science Introduces Prime NMN & Prime Brain: Next-Generation Health Solutions for Families

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From growing children to busy professionals, Bone Science is revolutionizing the healthcare market with its latest offerings: Prime NMN and Prime Brain. Developed with cutting-edge technology, these products aim to enhance quality of life by supporting cellular health and brain development, respectively.  Prime NMN features 99.9% ultra-pure NMN, a compound essential for boosting NAD+ levels. NAD+ plays a critical role in cellular energy production, DNA repair, and anti-aging, making it a cornerstone of cellular health. Utilizing advanced enzymatic biosynthesis technology and a double antioxidant process, Prime NMN ensures maximum stability and absorption, providing users with a reliable way to revitalize their daily energy levels. Building on the success of previous generations that sold out early, this fourth-generation product sets a new benchmark for cellular health solutions.  Prime Brain, on the other hand, is tailored to support brain health, particularly for teens dealing with academic stress and difficulty focusing. Its formula includes scientifically backed ingredients, such as Rhodiola rosea extract, alpha-GPC, and L-theanine to enhance brain function, reduce stress, and improve learning capabilities. When paired with Prime Height, Bone Science's flagship growth supplement, it provides a synergistic solution for balanced physical and cognitive development, addressing the needs of growing minds and bodies.  Both products have already received enthusiastic responses in the U.S. market and are now preparing for global expansion. "These products are built on a foundation of science and innovation to address the diverse health concerns of modern families," said a company representative. "We are confident that they will set a new standard in personalized healthcare."  Designed for convenience and backed by rigorous scientific research, Prime NMN and Prime Brain are trusted by consumers for their effectiveness and ease of use. Both products are now available for purchase on the official Bone Science website and through authorized retailers, offering next-generation health solutions for all ages. Bone Science remains committed to helping people around the world lead healthier lives through continuous innovation.  [Bone Science Official Website] https://thebonescience.com
