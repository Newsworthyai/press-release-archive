ATLANTA, GA, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sola Salon Studios, a leading salon studio franchise with more than 700 locations nationwide, is bringing its health and beauty concept to 1200 White Street, an adaptive reuse mixed-use development in Atlanta's West End. The salon studio has leased 7,952 square feet in the development, owned by Atlanta-based Ackerman & Co. and Belgium-based Baltisse, and is targeting an early 2026 opening.  Ackerman Retail's Kelly Wilson, Suzanne Shank and Patrick Green represented ownership in the lease signing, and Sarah Williams of COUNCIL Real Estate represented Sola Salon Studios.  1200 White Street, a 211,585-square-foot warehouse building, is undergoing an adaptive reuse transformation, offering a variety of space options for retail, restaurants, creative office, experiential concepts and high value-add industrial.   "We truly appreciate the vision behind this project and are excited to be part of an adaptive reuse development. We're especially thrilled to provide health and beauty professionals in the Atlanta area not only with a space to operate their businesses, but also with an opportunity to benefit from the transformation happening in their own neighborhood. Another major advantage is the convenient access to the Atlanta Westside BeltLine," said Kelley Morrissey, the franchise owner of the Sola Salon location at 1200 White Street.   Also located on White Street, Lee + White, co-owned by Ackerman with MDH Partners, is a 442,000-square-foot redevelopment of the West End's former "Warehouse Row" that has become an entertainment and business hub.  Sola Salon Studios provides health and beauty professionals fully-equipped, private studios along with business support, educational resources and cutting-edge technology solutions to help their businesses thrive. The location at 1200 White Street will feature 41 salon suites customized for varying health and beauty specialties.   "We're pleased to welcome Sola Salon Studios to 1200 White Street as we continue building a dynamic, mixed-use destination that brings together a diverse mix of businesses and retailers," said Leo Wiener, President of Ackerman Retail, a division of Ackerman & Co. "This strong addition to our ongoing redevelopment will also create opportunity for beauty professionals to grow their careers."  Sola Salon's lease follows the recent opening of Dill Dinkers, an 11-court, 35,891-square-foot pickleball facility that marked the growing franchise's entry into the Atlanta market.   Teaming up to lease the remaining spaces at 1200 White Street are Hunter Henritze, Michael Howell and Maia Perri of Lincoln Property Group (office and flex opportunities) and Marisa Roy and Patrick Green of Ackerman Retail (retail spaces).
