# Dr. Susan Littman's Acclaimed "Picture of Health" Delivers Stunning Episode 2 — and Celebrates Renewal for Season Two

AMBLER, PA, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After nearly two years of anticipation, Dr. Susan Littman's acclaimed web series Picture of Health makes its triumphant return with the premiere of Episode 2. The long wait was no accident — Dr. Littman and her team have treated each installment less like a quick broadcast and more like a carefully crafted motion picture, focusing on quality over quantity to ensure that every episode delivers both visually and intellectually.  The release comes at a pivotal time. With the world now officially in a post-COVID era, the medical landscape has shifted dramatically. Episode 2 explores how advances in technology, evolving patient expectations, and the lingering lessons of the pandemic are reshaping the practice of medicine today — and tomorrow. Stunning visuals, in-depth analysis, and Littman's signature clarity anchor an installment that has truly been a long time in the making.  "Medicine is changing faster than ever, and it's important to step back and capture the bigger picture," says Dr. Littman, esteemed oncologist and internist. "I believe our viewers will see why the wait was worth it — we're creating more than a show, we're building an experience."  In even more exciting news, as of August 18, Picture of Health has officially been renewed for a second season, ensuring audiences will continue to benefit from Dr. Littman's insights as the world of healthcare evolves.  Adds Littman: "Season 2 will allow us to go even deeper into the issues that matter most in medicine today. From breakthroughs in technology to the human stories behind the science, our goal is to continue elevating each episode into something that feels like a small film — thoughtful, visually striking, and meaningful. If Season 1 is about setting the stage, Season 2 will about expanding the conversation and showing just how much the future of healthcare is unfolding right before us."  Episode 2 of Picture of Health is now available to stream at www.SusanJLittman.com.
