# South Fork Instruments Expands Portfolio with Hycontrol SureSense+ for Food Processing Plants

AUBURN, CA, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ --  South Fork Instruments, a supplier of process measurement and control solutions, has announced the addition of Hycontrol's SureSense+ foam detection and control system for food processing to its product portfolio across the Americas.  Foam is unpredictable and difficult to monitor, yet many plants still depend on fixed chemical dosing or liquid-level probes that perform poorly in foaming conditions. The result is higher antifoam chemical use, inconsistent control, and unexpected process interruptions.  The SureSense+ system from Hycontrol was developed specifically to address these challenges. Unlike repurposed liquid-level sensors, it uses IMA (Intelligent Multi-Action) sensing technology to distinguish true foam from probe fouling, delivering accurate, repeatable measurement even in high-foam or heavily contaminated environments.  Key technical features of SureSense+ include:  -Detection of foam and foam-liquid interfaces -Reliable operation under heavy fouling conditions -Fully configurable control outputs for dosing systems -Compatibility with a wide range of food, chemical, and industrial processes  "Foam detection has always been a difficult variable to monitor accurately," said John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments. "Hycontrol's SureSense+ system solves this by using probes designed specifically for foam, rather than misapplying liquid level sensors for the job. That distinction makes it possible to dose antifoam precisely when it's required, cutting waste and improving process stability."  South Fork Instruments supplies and supports SureSense+ systems across the Americas, providing configuration and integration expertise to ensure reliable operation in demanding process environments.
