# Three Buddies Expands to Athens: Restaurateur Peter Anand Brings More Than Just Burgers &amp; Bold Flavors to the Classic City

ATHENS, GA, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Three Buddies, the fast-casual dining concept redefining comfort food with a creative twist, proudly announces the official grand opening soon to take place at its newest location in Athens, Georgia. Behind this rapidly growing brand are visionary multipreneur Peter Anand and Managing Partner Tia Jakes, whose combined leadership, innovation, and decades of experience in hospitality are setting new standards in Georgia's dining scene.  Launched in May 2024, Three Buddies quickly distinguished itself with its Certified Angus Beef burgers—widely regarded as some of Atlanta's best—alongside a diverse menu that blends comfort and creativity. In less than a year, Anand and Jakes have successfully opened three thriving locations, with Athens marking the latest milestone in the brand's expansion.  "Three Buddies was built on the idea that food should be both comforting and exciting," said Anand. "Bringing that vision to Athens is incredibly special, because this community values flavor, experience, and togetherness—exactly what Three Buddies stands for."  A Bold Journey from Barbecue Pits to Boardrooms Anand's journey is nothing short of remarkable. Born in Putnam, Connecticut, and raised in Utica, NY, he relocated to Atlanta at just seven years old. By his teenage years, he was already winning barbecue competitions and showcasing his culinary skills at formal events. His early career in hospitality began as a server at Buffalo's Café, where he was promoted to General Manager within just one month. Leadership roles at McDonald's, Atlanta Bread, and Uncle Vito's soon followed.  After college, with the support of his father, Anand opened his first bar and began working closely with the Buckhead Life Group's legendary "Mr. Buckhead George." From there, he built a diverse restaurant portfolio that includes Mirala Fine Dining, Pete's Sports Bar & Grill, Vince Et' Chrision Italian, and Firkin & Gryphon—culminating in his latest concept, Three Buddies.  The Power of Partnership: Tia Jakes at the Helm of Operations At the heart of Three Buddies' rapid success is Tia Jakes, Managing Partners and business partner to Anand. With more than 26 years of diverse and progressive experience in the restaurant, hospitality, and event planning industries, Jakes brings unparalleled expertise to the table. From opening restaurants to designing operational processes, she has played an instrumental role in ensuring Three Buddies' consistent growth and efficiency.  Jakes also leads the development, implementation, and execution of short- and long-range business plans for Your Fifth Quarter, LLC, a premier Atlanta-based restaurant management company that owns, operates, and oversees a variety of innovative dining concepts. Her leadership ensures that every Three Buddies location delivers not only exceptional food but also a seamless guest experience.  "Three Buddies is more than a restaurant—it's a lifestyle brand built on vision, consistency, and community," said Jakes. "Athens represents an exciting chapter, and we are committed to making this location a cornerstone of the neighborhood."  Beyond the Kitchen: Engineering Success Anand's entrepreneurial spirit extends beyond hospitality. In 1988, he joined Canterbury Engineering, where he rose from machine operator to VP of Operations, driving sales from $8 million to $120 million in just three years. He later founded Joe Tools in 2009, scaling the design and engineering startup to $30 million in annual sales before selling it in 2023 for $16 million.  Looking Ahead With Athens now on the map, Anand and Jakes plan to expand the Three Buddies brand through franchising, while also exploring new ventures. Balancing their passion for business with a commitment to family and community, the leadership team is focused on creating long-term opportunities for growth and sustainability.
