# Exquisite 1961 Maserati 3500 GT Now Featured in the Ron Sturgeon Collection at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A stunning 1961 Maserati 3500 GT — ordered by British Viscount Guy Neville Montagu — is now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. Beautifully restored and rich with history, this rare Italian grand tourer offers visitors a close-up look at one of Maserati's most celebrated designs.  Originally introduced at the 1957 Geneva Motor Show, the Maserati 3500 GT marked the brand's first true production grand touring car. Designed by Carrozzeria Touring of Milan, the lightweight coupe features Superleggera construction with aluminum body panels wrapped over a tubular steel spaceframe. This particular example underwent a meticulous three-year refurbishment in Italy from 1990 to 1993, emerging in a pristine Bianco (white) finish with a luxuriously re-trimmed red leather interior.  Under the hood, the Maserati is powered by a 3,485cc Tipo 101 DOHC inline-six engine, complete with an aluminum block and cylinder head, hemispherical combustion chambers, triple Weber 42 DCOE carburetors, and twin-plug ignition — all delivering power through a ZF five-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels. The advanced suspension features double wishbones and coil springs up front, paired with a leaf-sprung solid rear axle and tubular shock absorbers, ensuring the ideal blend of handling and ride quality for spirited touring.  This particular 3500 GT, originally delivered to Cagliari, Italy, blends timeless Maserati engineering with aristocratic provenance, having been first ordered by Viscount Montagu.  "Few cars capture the romance of mid-century Italian motoring quite like the Maserati 3500 GT," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "This example has such an extraordinary story, from its noble first owner to its world-class restoration. It's a true highlight of the collection, and I'm excited to share it with our visitors."  Now featured among over 200 classic and exotic cars at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, this 1961 Maserati 3500 GT offers a rare opportunity to experience one of the most elegant and technically sophisticated grand tourers of its era.
