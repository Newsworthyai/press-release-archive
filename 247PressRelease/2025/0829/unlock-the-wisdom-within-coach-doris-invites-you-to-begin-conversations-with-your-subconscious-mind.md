# Unlock the Wisdom Within: Coach Doris Invites You to Begin "Conversations with Your Subconscious Mind"

ATLANTA, GA, August 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There are quiet voices within each of us—parts that have waited patiently to be heard and understood. Sometimes they show up as hesitation, sometimes as inner conflict, and other times as a subtle feeling we can't quite explain. For many, those voices are the subconscious mind speaking—rich with untold stories and deep wisdom. Through her transformative new offering, Coach Doris now extends a hand to help you open a meaningful, two-way conversation with your inner self.  Launching in late September 2025, Conversations with Your Subconscious Mind is a six-session live online course designed to guide participants into deeper connection with their inner world through a self-directed version of the powerful modality known as Voice Dialogue. Rooted in compassion, self-awareness, and soul connection, this experience is more than a course—it's a reunion with the parts of yourself that are ready to be seen, understood, and gently brought home.  "This journey is about presence and activating your untapped capacity," says Coach Doris, founder of Deep Coaching Portal. "It's about finally giving yourself the space to hear what's been waiting to be acknowledged—not just with your ears, but with your heart."  Each live Zoom session will explore a specific aspect of inner dialogue, offering guided methods, experiential practices, and collective insight. In addition to the group container, participants will also have the option to schedule private Voice Dialogue sessions with Coach Doris to deepen personal reflection and integration. To support continued growth after the course, all participants will receive downloadable, step-by-step guides and six-month access to all session recordings.  Whether you're navigating old wounds, recurring thought loops, or feeling stuck in transition, this course offers a loving framework to shift from inner noise to meaningful clarity.  "Most of us were never taught how to relate to our inner selves," explains Coach Doris. "We were taught to fix, push through, or silence what we didn't understand. But true healing begins when we stop trying to fix ourselves—and instead start listening with reverence to the inner teacher we've always carried."  Course Highlights  · Identify the unconscious energies and inner voices currently shaping your thoughts and choices  · Practice guided inner conversations using clear, step-by-step methods—delivered in a downloadable eBook you can revisit and use anytime  · Receive private, personalized feedback in a safe, one-on-one setting—just you and Coach Doris  · Access a newly simplified and user-friendly version of Carl Jung's Active Imagination, reimagined for everyday use  · Deepen your journey with optional private Voice Dialogue sessions  To ensure space for those who feel called to this experience, Coach Doris has opened an early-access waitlist, offering priority updates, bonus content, and exclusive pre-enrollment benefits.  A free pre-enrollment Zoom session will also be announced soon—a welcoming opportunity to meet Coach Doris, explore the method, and see whether this journey feels aligned for you.  "This is for the hidden healers, the quiet leaders—the ones who sense they're meant for more but haven't quite found the words for it," says Coach Doris. "It's not about becoming someone new. It's about finally making peace with who you've always been."  From a career in human resources across multiple industries to her deep mastery in Voice Dialogue, Coach Doris brings decades of grounded wisdom and soul-level clarity into every session.  This course is ideal for those seeking deeper self-understanding during seasons of growth, burnout, or life transition. It's also a meaningful complement to therapy, coaching, or spiritual practice.  "You won't leave this course with someone else's blueprint," Coach Doris adds. "You'll leave with your own inner compass—clear, calm, and ready to lead."
