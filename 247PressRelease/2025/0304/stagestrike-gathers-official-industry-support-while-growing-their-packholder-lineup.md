# StageStrike Gathers Official Industry Support While Growing Their packHolder Lineup

ORLANDO, FL, March 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- StageStrike, the innovative brand dedicated to revolutionizing wireless gear management, is making significant strides in the professional audio industry. The company has recently received direct support from industry-leading manufacturers, including Audio-Technica, Wisycom, and Shure, who have provided their wireless packs to assist in the development of model-specific packHolder solutions. This marks a pivotal moment in StageStrike's mission to provide versatile and reliable solutions for live sound professionals worldwide.  Expanding the packHolder Lineup  Since its launch in April 2023, StageStrike has been on a mission to help audio professionals protect, organize, and deploy their wireless gear with ease. The "packHolder", a modular, stackable and interlocking system for wireless bodypacks, has quickly gained traction among touring engineers, broadcast professionals, and AV teams. By working directly with leading wireless audio brands, StageStrike ensures that its solutions are tailored for real-world applications and optimized for a variety of wireless transmitter models.  "Stage Servicios is our biggest client in Chile, and they needed a Wisycom-compatible StageStrike system to perform at the prestigious Viña del Mar Festival, so when they suggested us to contact StageStrike it only made sense" said Marcos Nieves – Business Development Manager of Wireless at DPA Microphones Inc., who distributes Wisycom in the US – confirming that these collaborations ensure that the packHolder lineup integrates seamlessly with the most widely used wireless systems on the market.  Industry Recognition and Growth  StageStrike has already made waves in the industry with endorsements from top touring engineers, including Eddie Caipo (Enrique Iglesias/No Doubt/Gwen Stefani), as well as distribution deals in India and the UAE through Sonic Evolution. Its patent pending designs have created a category of its own, setting a new trend which is even starting to spawn imitations, and with a steadily growing dealer network and a strong social media following of over 10,300 Instagram followers, the company is focused on scaling production while maintaining the customization and durability that professionals demand.  What's Next for StageStrike?  With continued interest from major pro audio manufacturers and an expanding dealer network, StageStrike is setting its sights on further global expansion and trade show presence. The company is actively seeking additional resellers, distributors, and rental companies interested in offering StageStrike solutions to their customers.  "We're totally committed to streamlining the workflow of audio professionals and making their jobs easier," said Castor Milano, CEO of StageStrike. "By continuously evolving and expanding our product lineup, we're ensuring that wireless gear management is no longer an afterthought—it's a competitive advantage."
