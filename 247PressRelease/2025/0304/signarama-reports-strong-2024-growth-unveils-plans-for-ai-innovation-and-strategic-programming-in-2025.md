# Signarama Reports Strong 2024 Growth, Unveils Plans for AI Innovation and Strategic Programming in 2025

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, March 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Following a year of strategic expansion and program development in 2024, Signarama®, the world's leading sign and graphics franchise, is poised for continued advancement and systemwide success in 2025.  After kicking off 2024 with three franchise deals renewed for another 35 years each in Huntington, NY; Norwalk, CT; and Doylestown, PA, Signarama ended the year with 72 new franchise agreements and the opening of 15 new locations in markets including Lubbock, TX; Castle Rock, CO; Arlington, TX; and College Station, TX.   Beyond its development success, Signarama continued to prioritize ongoing education for franchisees through engagement programs such as the P3 (Peer, Profit, Performance) Program, a training resource designed to facilitate the sharing of best practices among Signarama owners in similar life-stages of their franchise journey. The brand also continued its Masters Academy program, which provides hands-on training in essential areas including production efficiency, sales techniques, and profit optimization, resulting in measurable performance improvements for participating franchisees. This year, Signarama will expand its P3 Program with the addition of at least two new peer groups, fostering deeper collaboration among franchisees, and host two seasonal Masters Academy workshop sessions in the spring and fall.  "Our network's remarkable performance in 2024 reflects the strength of our franchise system and our unwavering commitment to innovation," said A.J. Titus, President of Signarama. "Through our enhanced training programs and technology integration, we're equipping our franchisees with advanced tools to streamline operations, boost productivity, and deliver superior customer service. This year, our focus on AI implementation and peer learning will further accelerate growth and profitability across our network."  The company's 2025 strategy centers on leveraging artificial intelligence to transform key business operations. Planned AI initiatives include automated design assistance for faster customer turnaround, smart inventory management systems, and predictive analytics for targeted marketing campaigns. As part of the AI integration process, Signarama will provide franchisees with practical training on implementing these tools to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.  With a focus on continued development in 2025, Signarama projects significant domestic expansion, targeting 400 U.S. locations by the end of this year. The network will also celebrate significant franchisee milestones, including a 27th anniversary for Signarama Troy, a 25th anniversary for Signarama North Dallas, alongside several 20-year celebrations including Signarama locations in Redding, CA; Sacramento, CA; Frisco, TX; Piscataway, NJ; Baton Rouge, LA; Woburn, MA; Fargo, ND; Ridgeland, SC; Miami, FL; and our location in Sydney, Australia. Additionally, our Master License Partner in South Africa is celebrating its 25th anniversary, which they will commemorate at their upcoming conference. These long-term partnerships exemplify the enduring success of Signarama's franchise model and highlight the brand's commitment to providing comprehensive support throughout a franchisee's journey.
