# Bishop Loverde Scholarship Fund at Divine Mercy University, Sterling, VA

STERLING, VA, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Paul S. Loverde is the beloved Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Arlington in Virginia.  Appointed by St. John Paul II as the diocese's third bishop, he served for nearly 17 years from 1999 to 2016. In the words of Bishop Michael F. Burbidge, Arlington's current prelate, Bishop Loverde "has been a steadfast advocate for the sacredness of all human life, an ardent supporter of Catholic education, and an active promoter of vocations to the priesthood and consecrated life."  Bishop Loverde also demonstrated a keen awareness of the increasing mental health needs in dioceses across the US. Seeking to address this issue, he has been serving on the board of directors of the Institute for the Psychological Sciences, now Divine Mercy University, for the past 25 years.  To honor Bishop Loverde's inspiring legacy and to further support priestly and religious vocations, DMU is establishing a scholarship program in his name. The fund will support priests and religious from across the country who will serve their home dioceses and communities after graduation as well as students who agree to work in the Diocese of Arlington after graduation. We hope to raise at least $500,000 by June 30th, 2026.
