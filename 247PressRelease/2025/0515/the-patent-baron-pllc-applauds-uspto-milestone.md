# The Patent Baron PLLC Applauds USPTO Milestone

DETROIT, MI, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Patent Baron PLLC, a leading intellectual property law firm serving innovators and brand owners nationwide, applauds the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) recent milestone: the cancellation of over 50,000 goods and services from trademark registrations through ex parte expungement and reexamination proceedings under the Trademark Modernization Act (TMA).  This major enforcement effort targets fraudulent trademark filings, particularly those tied to "specimen farms" - websites created solely to produce fake evidence of use. Many of these registrations were never supported by actual commerce, and the USPTO Director initiated proceedings to clean up the register accordingly.  "For legitimate entrepreneurs, small businesses, and global brands alike, these cancellations are a welcome step toward restoring integrity to the U.S. trademark system," said J. Baron Lesperance, founder of The Patent Baron PLLC. "Fraudulent filings and unused registrations choke the register and block rightful applicants. This is exactly the type of proactive leadership the trademark community needs."  The TMA's new tools - ex parte expungement and reexamination - give both the USPTO and private parties a streamlined process to challenge and remove unused marks that are obstructing legitimate trademark applications.  The Patent Baron PLLC encourages business owners, startups, and brand managers to review pending obstacles on the register and take action. If a registered mark is not actually in use for the goods or services listed, expungement or reexamination may be appropriate.
