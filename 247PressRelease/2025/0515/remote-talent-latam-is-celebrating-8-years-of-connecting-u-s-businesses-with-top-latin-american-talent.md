# Remote Talent LATAM is Celebrating 8 Years of Connecting U.S. Businesses with Top Latin American Talent

SHERIDAN, WY, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Remote Talent Latam, a reputable recruitment agency located out of Sheridan, WY, is celebrating its eighth anniversary of connecting U.S. marketing agencies with exceptional remote professionals from Latin America. Since its founding in 2017 by marketing veteran Angel Salinas, the company has become a trusted hiring partner for hundreds of agencies across the United States seeking reliable, affordable, and results-driven marketing talent.  With more than 1,000 successful placements and an average hire tenure exceeding four years, Remote Talent LATAM has redefined the standards of remote recruitment. The agency operates under a simple but effective model: only pay when you hire. This zero-risk structure eliminates costly subscription fees and long-term retainers, enabling U.S.-based companies to scale without financial uncertainty or unnecessary delays.  "Our journey over the past eight years has been one of constant evolution and focused impact," said Angel Salinas, CEO and founder of Remote Talent Latam. "Eight years of building elite remote teams for U.S. marketing agencies. Eight years of trial, error, refinement, and results. Here's the biggest lesson I've learned: we're not for everyone — and that's by design."  Remote Talent LATAM has built its success on a deep understanding of both marketing and recruitment. As a former Senior PPC Specialist and Regional Marketing Manager overseeing digital strategy across seven Latin American countries, Salinas brings more than 12 years of experience to the table. This dual perspective has positioned the agency uniquely: not just as a recruiter, but as a partner who understands what makes a marketing team truly effective.  "Our sweet spot is clear," Salinas continued. "If you're a marketing agency that needs agency-experienced talent, if you want a team that actually speaks marketing — because we're marketers too — and if you're not just chasing lower costs but want profit-driving talent, then there's no better recruiting partner for you than us."  A Proven Model That Works At the heart of Remote Talent Latam's offering is a streamlined, three-step process that makes hiring simple and scalable: 1. Book a Free Discovery Call 2. Receive Three Pre-Vetted Top Candidates 3. Welcome High-Value Talent to Your Team  Each shortlisted candidate comes with a video introduction, updated CV, English and personality assessments, and a tailored summary highlighting their alignment with the client's role. To further eliminate risk, each finalist completes a paid assessment so clients can evaluate their skills in real-world conditions before making a hiring decision.  The agency's recruiting process is designed for rigor and results. Every applicant undergoes a multi-step screening that ensures not just technical capability but cultural alignment and long-term commitment.  The average hire from Remote Talent LATAM saves clients up to $32,000 per year — all while delivering senior-level results.  Built for the U.S. Market With 95% of its client base comprised of U.S. marketing agencies, Remote Talent LATAM's infrastructure is fine-tuned for the needs of American businesses. All talent operates within U.S. time zones, communicates fluently in English, and brings a deep understanding of agency dynamics.  This approach eliminates the common pain points of offshore hiring — from time zone misalignment to lack of contextual marketing knowledge. Clients like RealTop Marketing have turned to Remote Talent LATAM after facing challenges with traditional recruiters.  "RTL has staffed more than 100 people for us over two different companies," said Nikitas Tsoukalis, CEO & Owner of RealTop Marketing. "They can scout the best people in the Americas, ensuring your time zone needs are met. From sales and support to even technical roles, RTL has been a godsend. Thank you, Angel and company."  Looking Ahead As the demand for remote marketing talent continues to rise, Remote Talent LATAM is well-positioned to expand its impact. With plans to deepen its service offerings and further streamline the hiring process, the company remains committed to its founding mission: to make hiring top-tier marketing professionals simple, risk-free, and cost-effective.  "We're proud of what we've accomplished, but more importantly, we're excited about what lies ahead," said Salinas. "U.S. marketing agencies shouldn't have to choose between affordability and quality. With us, they don't have to."  For more information about Remote Talent LATAM or to schedule a discovery call, visit https://remotetalentlatam.com or call (703) 646-8734.
