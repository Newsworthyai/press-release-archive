# Unveiling the Bold Wryst SX7 Swiss Automatic Watch White & Blue Edition

DEVON, UK, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The realm of horology is experiencing a significant shift with the introduction of the Swiss mens blue watch Wryst Racer SX7 Automatic.   Encased in brushed steel, this striking blue watch is accompanied by two interchangeable straps, one in solid blue with white accents and another in a vibrant blue and white stripe. As a distinguished member of Wryst's premier RACER collection, this self-winding marvel is produced in a highly exclusive series, with only 40 individually numbered pieces ever created, signifying a mark of exceptional taste and sophistication.  The captivating blue hue immediately sets the automatic blue face watch SX7 apart within the Wryst lineup. While blue men's watches paired with white straps are currently on trend, a wristwatch featuring a white and blue striped bracelet is a rarer find. Wryst has already established a reputation for crafting distinctive, high-caliber dress watches known for their legibility. With this model, the brand demonstrates a powerful drive for innovation, presenting a playful yet refined modern luxury automatic watch that embodies cutting-edge design.  Accurate and Tireless Swiss Automatic Movement  Powering this exceptional wristwatch is a precise Swiss automatic chronometer movement. The intricate workings of the rotor are visible through a sapphire crystal on the case back, showcasing the self-winding mechanism where an oscillating weight harnesses the energy of motion to wind the mainspring. The SX7 boasts a power reserve of approximately 38 hours and can also be manually wound for a full charge. However, the watch will begin ticking effortlessly with the natural movement of the wearer's wrist.  The deep blue sunray dial exudes a "presidential" aura highly valued by watch aficionados. The hands and hour markers are treated with bright Super-LumiNova, ensuring excellent readability even in dim lighting conditions. Visuals demonstrating the luminosity of the watch face are available upon request.  Bringing Fashion Style to a New Level  Wryst refreshes its collection of blue watches with this new iteration, featuring an eye-catching 'white and blue' dual-injection silicone strap. For added versatility, the watch also includes a deep blue strap accented with two white stripes, allowing the wearer to adapt the timepiece to various moods and occasions. This bold timekeeper offers adaptability to suit any situation.  Blue is evocative of the sea and the sky, offering a spectrum of stylish possibilities mirroring the diverse shades found in nature. White, a color associated with light, purity, and positivity, combines with blue to create a unique designer watch. The white and blue strap of this model beautifully symbolizes the pristine meeting point of clear blue waters and pure white sands.  The Racer SX7's color scheme harmoniously reflects the positive and relaxed atmosphere of a flawless beach. Note that you can also choose the Wryst Swiss racing wrist watch with red strap, the mens automatic gold watch SX3, or even the  Gold Watches for Men Wryst SX2.  This robust timepiece is well-suited for a range of outdoor activities, from leisurely pursuits to adventurous explorations. The blue tones on the dial and strap also invite thoughts of the vast oceans. With a water resistance rating of 100 meters and excellent resistance to corrosion, this blue and white bracelet watch provides unmatched style for ocean sports, sailing, and naval adventures.  This sporty design possesses a stylish allure that appeals to fashion-conscious modern men. A classic pairing of a crisp white t-shirt and blue denim jeans is universally recognized as perfect casual wear for men, and the white and blue color pattern of the Wryst SX7 instantly evokes this timeless style. This blue watch, complemented by the white and blue strap, will serve as a striking wrist accessory to enhance trendsetting denim outfits.  Bold and Brawny  The captivating and refined appearance of the new Racer SX7 model is underpinned by remarkable design considerations. Each Racer model features a generously sized case, positioning it as a standout piece in the large watch category. To justify this substantial wrist presence, Wryst has selected a superior-grade stainless steel alloy for the construction of the case and external components, innovative specifications that contribute to the Wryst brand's distinctiveness within the industry.  Given the substantial dimensions of the case, the prominent design is more susceptible to external forces. Therefore, the use of highly durable and robust materials is essential for crafting such timepieces. All Wryst models feature bold case diameters ranging from 45mm to 50mm. The Racer SX models boast a 50mm diameter and a 15mm thick barrel-shaped case.  Crafted from innovative, high-grade 516L stainless steel, the case and external elements of this Wryst timepiece ensure exceptional strength and longevity. Certain variations also incorporate surface coating techniques to enhance the watches' hardness and resistance to scratches. In this particular model, the blue dial significantly elevates the overall aesthetic and feel of this remarkable design.  The brand's distinctive barrel-shaped case design, along with its alluring blue color, makes this model instantly recognizable. This bold wristwear seamlessly integrates protective features without hindering access to operational elements such as the crown. The unique design of the upper case, combined with the protective structures, perfectly exemplifies the brand's commitment to innovation.  The new Wryst SX7 model blends the cool appeal of its blue and white aesthetic with precise Swiss accuracy. In many sports, even the slightest fraction of a second can be critical, influencing outcomes in motorsports and athletics. The Wryst Racer SX7 delivers impressive precision for an automatic watch.  Beyond its accuracy, it also provides reliable day-to-day timekeeping and a day-date display. The movement comprises 26 jewels, operates at a frequency of 28,800 vibrations per hour (4 Hz), and is manufactured according to rigorous Swiss-made quality standards. The date window is positioned between the 4 and 5 o'clock markers.  A watch with a substantial and robust design requires an equally resilient yet comfortable strap. The strap fitted to this model is perfectly proportioned to complement the watch's dimensions. With a width of 24mm and a size range of 170mm to 210mm, it is ideally suited for energetic and masculine wrists. The blue accents on the strap harmonize beautifully with the case's silhouette. The strap is crafted from silicone using a double-injection technique, providing the flexibility of rubber while also being dust-free, waterproof, and hypoallergenic.  The registered trademark of the Swiss brand Wryst serves as a unique symbol of individuality and exclusivity. These limited edition men's watches are not available through traditional retail channels or physical stores. The Racer SX7 can only be acquired online directly from the watch brand, ensuring professional and customer-focused service.  Consistent with other models in the Force collection, the automatic versions feature luminous hour and minute hands, along with double luminous dots at each hour marker. This enhances legibility in low-light conditions and creates a vibrant, illuminated dial in darkness. The decorative bracelet attachment rings and the screw-down crown all feature a polished chrome finish. Overall, this blue men's watch is a highly accomplished timepiece offering significant refinement and unique characteristics. This watch is a key accessory for reaching new heights while fully expressing personal style. With only 40 pieces ever to be produced, it represents a rare opportunity. Let your style drive your success.  The case back is engraved with the hallmark "Swiss Movement," the watch name "SX7," "Limited Edition," "water-resistance of 100 Meters," and the unique serial number of the specific watch (e.g., #35 out of 40). Additionally, several decorative engravings pay homage to high-end watchmaking, and the Wryst logo is deeply etched in 3D at the center. While other features such as "Sapphire Crystal" and "Screw-in Crown" could have been included, they were likely omitted to avoid cluttering the design. The backplate is secured with four screws.  A comments section is available for visitor feedback, inviting commentary on this distinctive Swiss watch. Initially, the blue dial might seem striking, but the consistent design language across the Racer, Force, and TT watch collections soon reveals its enduring appeal. This timepiece also represents an excellent long-term investment for avid collectors and enthusiasts, as its limited availability ensures that once sold out, it will become a truly unique find.  Two Bracelets Included with Each Watch  Each Wryst SX7 blue and white men's watch includes an additional interchangeable strap at no extra cost. This particular model comes with a supplementary dual-injection silicone bracelet, offering a different aesthetic. The solid pin buckle is stamped with the brand name, and its brushed stainless steel finish perfectly complements the model's color scheme. Wryst also offers more luxurious Swiss chronograph watch models with the Force series.
