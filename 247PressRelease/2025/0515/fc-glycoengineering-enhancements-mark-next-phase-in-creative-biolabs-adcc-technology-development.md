# FC Glycoengineering Enhancements Mark Next Phase in Creative Biolabs' ADCC Technology Development

SHIRLEY, NY, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Creative Biolabs has an industry-leading proprietary analytical platform designed specifically for IgG1 monoclonal antibodies. In the therapeutic antibody glycan profiling, this platform is capable of executing sample preparation within an hour due to its innovative column technology coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry.   The detailed glycosylation profiling of the Fc region and evaluation of IgG1 heterogeneity are achieved through the HILIC-UPLC/FLR/MS, which is intended for the more advanced analysis post completion of the initial processing.  Apart from platform developments, Creative Biolabs has established full-service laboratories for glycosylation that include diverse biotherapeutic niches. From MS intact glycoprotein profiling, through glycosylated peptide analysis by HPLC or MS, to HPLC/UPLC-MS workflows for released glycan analyses. Other offered specialized services, such as N-glycan structural determination, site occupancy analysis, and sialylation pattern characterization, serve to broaden the research and development spectrum in the biopharmaceutical market.  Creative Biolabs has achieved significant progress with Fc region characterization. The Fc region, as the tail part of the antibody, is important because it binds to receptors and engages the complement system, all critical interactions for therapeutic efficacy and safety.  For this ADCC technology upgrade, Creative Biolabs has focused on the precise control of glycosylation at the Fc region. This optimization improved the utilization of antibodies and immune components, enhancing cytotoxicity and molecular stability significantly.  An expert at Creative Biolabs noted: "Considering the Fc region, glycosylation is one of the most important factors that governs the antibody-receptor binding and immune modulation. Our custom modification of this region has greatly enhanced overall antibody functionality."  Due to these changes, it is possible to create the advanced IgG products with engineered Fc fragments. Internal models demonstrated the advantages of glycoengineering in conjugation and performance with protein A conjugated with MMAF and Fc-fusion constructs.  Creative Biolabs positions itself competitively due to its advancements in ADCC and Fc engineering. These innovations aid in the swift progression of antibody drug development and the creation of therapeutics that are safer and more effective.
