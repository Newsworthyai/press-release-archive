# ADAP Advocacy Airs Commercial to Open National Advocacy Campaign Calling for Reforming the 340B Drug Pricing Program

WASHINGTON, DC, May 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today, as part of its 340B Project, aired a new commercial calling for reforms to the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The commercial opens a national advocacy campaign, asking a critical question: "Is the 340B Drug Pricing Program the Next 'Too Big to Fail'?".   Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, summarized: "We're sounding the alarm on why common-sense reforms are needed to ensure the integrity of the nation's second largest federally sponsored drug program, behind only Medicare Part D. The '340B Too Big To Fail' national advocacy campaign builds on the work being done by our 340B Patient Advisory Committee. It is grounded in the premise that the 340B Program's lack of meaningful accountability or transparency standards, especially among the big hospital systems, despite explosive growth, draws parallels to the collapse of the financial markets in 2007-08 after years of minimal federal oversight of the big investment banks."  The commercial will air in the greater metropolitan DC market while Congress is in session. The '340B Too Big To Fail' national advocacy campaign will run through the end of the year, highlighting hospitals' declining charity, rising healthcare executive compensation, and exploding patient medical debt, among some other issues.  The commercial is available online at https://youtu.be/IIr9QWaQaMA. 		  To learn more about ADAP Advocacy, 340B Drug Pricing Program, or the new 340B commercial, please email info@adapadvocacy.org.
