ALBERTA, CANADA, May 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Season 36 of the Outstanding Maternity Award delivered an exceptional level of artistry. As one of the leading international competitions dedicated to maternity and family photography, this latest season continued the award's tradition of showcasing powerful images that reflect the deep emotional bonds within families. All the winning photographs are now available on the official Outstanding Maternity Award website.  Last year marked a noteworthy milestone—Outstanding's 10th anniversary. For a decade, the award has celebrated photographers from across the globe, encouraging the creation of authentic, heartfelt images centred around family and motherhood.  That legacy was again honoured in Season 36 with emotionally resonant work that moved both the judges and the audience. This season's jury featured an exceptional panel, including two internationally recognized photographers: Elif ES from Germany and Mariana Bontempo from Brazil.  Elif ES is a highly respected photographer specializing in newborn, family, and wedding photography. She holds a master's degree in International Photography and has extensive training in newborn photography. Her work combines refined technique, deep knowledge of child development, and a sensitive artistic approach. Elif creates a calm, welcoming environment during sessions, ensuring the baby's safety and capturing genuine, emotional moments. Fellow professionals in the field always appreciate her thoughtful judging.  Mariana Bontempo is renowned for her artistic and emotionally rich fine art photography. Her images are featured in prestigious venues such as the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris and exhibitions in Venice. As co-founder of the Brazilian Association of Newborn Photographers (ABFRN), Mariana is a respected educator, frequently leading workshops and lectures in Brazil and internationally. Her work transforms intimate family moments into stunning art pieces, blending visual and emotional depth.  Eliane Pellegrini, who has led the award since its founding in 2014, brings more than 12 years of experience as a photographer. She has documented families and weddings in 14 countries around the world. Reflecting on this season, Eliane notes, "It's inspiring to see how each photographer brings their unique identity to the work, shaped by their culture and personal journey. Each season, this exchange of diverse perspectives adds even more depth and meaning to the award."  Season 36 also stood out for its cultural diversity, with winning photographers hailing from Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Turkey, the United States, Cyprus, India, Italy, France, Martinique, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Canada.  The award-winning images span every stage—from pregnancy to everyday family life—capturing motherhood's essence and intergenerational relationships' richness. These portraits reflect love in its purest form: sincere, beautiful, and profoundly moving. More than a competition, the Outstanding Maternity Award is a global community devoted to telling authentic stories through the art of photography. We extend our heartfelt thanks to every participating photographer, our jurors, and everyone who follows and supports this journey.  Established in 2014, the Outstanding Maternity Award celebrates the art of maternity and family photography, bringing together talented photographers from across the globe.  The award serves as a platform for photographers to showcase their work, gain well-deserved recognition for their art, amplify their notoriety, and reach new audiences.
