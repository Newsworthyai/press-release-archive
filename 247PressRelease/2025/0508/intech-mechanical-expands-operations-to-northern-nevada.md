# Intech Mechanical Expands Operations to Northern Nevada

ROSEVILLE, CA, May 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Intech Mechanical, a trusted name in HVAC, plumbing/piping, and sheet metal for over 30 years, is proud to announce its expansion into the Northern Nevada market. Headquartered in Roseville, CA, Intech has built its reputation on grassroots growth and a "do what's right" mantra, delivering high-quality construction, special projects, service, and controls solutions. Now, the company is bringing that same commitment to excellence to the Reno market.  Leading the charge is Scott Cooper, a longtime Northern Nevada resident and mechanical industry professional. As Reno Branch Manager, Scott will spearhead Intech Mechanical's service, projects, and controls operations in the region. His mission? To break free from the corporate red tape and bureaucracy that often slow down customer service in the "big box" mechanical firms.  "Intech has done for 30 years what we want to bring to the Reno market—Genuine customer service, authentic responsiveness, and a real commitment to doing what's right," said Scott Cooper, Branch Manager of Intech Mechanical – Northern Nevada. "We're not a national corporation looking at spreadsheets and metrics first. We're a company that makes decisions with the customer in mind and delivers results without the roadblocks."  The expansion is a strategic move for Intech Mechanical, which has been steadily growing its construction, special projects, service and controls divisions. This next step allows the company to extend its footprint while staying true to its core values.  "We've always believed in controlled, strategic growth, and expanding into Northern Nevada was a natural fit," said Rick Chowdry, President of Intech Mechanical. "Scott brings the local expertise and customer-first mindset that aligns perfectly with Intech's culture. We're excited to serve this market with the same quality and integrity that have been the foundation of our success."  Dan Myers - Director of Building Automation and Service Projects, emphasized the company's ability to provide a full range of services in-house. "With our engineering, fabrication, and project teams working together seamlessly, we're able to deliver efficient, high-quality solutions that set us apart. We look forward to bringing that level of expertise to the Reno market."  For James Childers - Director of Service, this expansion is about more than just market growth—it's about bringing Intech's customer-driven approach to a new region. "We're a locally owned company that operates with the flexibility and agility that only a non-corporate structure allows, but with all of the capabilities of the corporate giants. We believe in relationships over transactions, and that's what we're excited to introduce to Northern Nevada."  With a strong leadership team and a legacy of quality craftsmanship, Intech Mechanical is poised to make an immediate impact in Reno and the surrounding areas. Businesses in Northern Nevada can now expect a service provider that prioritizes integrity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
