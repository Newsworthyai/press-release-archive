New UI Interface Upgrade  AudFree Tidal Music Converter's latest version introduces a completely revamped user interface (UI) that focuses on improving user experience through enhanced design, easier navigation, and a more intuitive workflow.  Cleaner and Modern Design: The updated UI gives the software a sleek, minimalist design, making it easier for both beginners and experienced users to navigate the application.

Better Responsiveness: The UI adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimized experience whether you're using the software on a desktop or a laptop.  This upgrade enhances the overall aesthetic and functionality, making the software feel faster and more modern while keeping it simple and user-friendly.  2. Support Filtering Converted Tracks  One of the standout features in this update is the new filtering system, allowing users to easily sort and filter their converted tracks by various criteria such as:  Conversion Status: Filter by whether the tracks have been successfully converted, are still in progress, or have failed.  Album/Artist: Filter by album or artist, helping users quickly find specific songs, albums, or artists from their converted files.  This feature is especially useful for users who convert large batches of tracks or entire playlists and need to organize and track their converted music efficiently.  3. Support Saving the List to be Converted  The Save Conversion List feature allows users to save their conversion tasks for later use. This improvement offers several benefits:  Easier Batch Management: Users can now save their music conversion lists and resume them at any time, even after closing the software or restarting the computer.  Multi-Tasking: For those who want to convert multiple playlists, albums, or tracks, the ability to save the list means they can queue up multiple tasks and work on other things in the meantime.  Convenience: Instead of having to re-add tracks or playlists to the conversion list every time, users can simply load previously saved tasks and pick up right where they left off.  This functionality is ideal for users who frequently convert large music libraries or playlists and want a more streamlined, hassle-free process.  4. Support Custom Output File Naming Rules  AudFree Tidal Music Converter Version 3.0.0 introduces customizable output file naming rules, giving users complete control over how their converted music files are saved. This feature is particularly helpful for organizing music collections with specific naming conventions.  Multiple Naming Options: Users can set up naming rules based on variables like: Track Title Artist Name Album Title Track Number Year of Release Playlist Index  Avoiding Duplicate Files: The feature also includes options for appending or modifying file names to avoid overwriting existing files when converting the same tracks multiple times.  Whether you're converting individual tracks or entire albums, the ability to define your preferred naming structure ensures your music collection remains organized according to your specific needs.  5. More Output Audio Formats  One of the most requested features by users has been the expansion of supported output audio formats. AudFree Tidal Music Converter Version 3.0.0 introduces more output formats, providing users with greater flexibility when it comes to converting their Tidal music to a variety of popular audio formats.  Expanded Format Support: In addition to the previous options like MP3, FLAC, M4A, M4B and WAV, users can now convert Tidal music to Lossless and AIFF. This allows users to choose the format that best suits their devices, preferences, and specific needs.  Optimized Quality Settings: For each new output format, AudFree Tidal Music Converter provides customizable bitrates (bit depth)/sample rates/audio channel, ensuring that the converted audio maintains high quality, whether you're saving in a lossless format like FLAC or a compressed format like MP3.  Versatility for Devices: With more formats supported, users can now easily convert Tidal music to formats optimized for various devices, including smartphones, MP3 players, and home stereo systems.  This feature ensures that users have a wide variety of format choices, making AudFree Tidal Music Downloader the most versatile solution for converting and managing Tidal music.
