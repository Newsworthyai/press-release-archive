# Winter in America (Again Anthology Release

SEATTLE, WA, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Poets from the United States and beyond respond to the 2024 Presidential election. The poems are rooted in a belief that the incoming administration will not relieve or heal us from our nation's past: the destruction of the environment, the unbridled use of power, the pervasive narrative that Black lives do not matter, patriarchy, reproductive injustice for women, silent support for the US prison-industrial complex, and the lack of compassion for diverse gender identity, immigrants, the indigenous, and unsheltered populations. The editorial team worked tirelessly for six weeks to publish this anthology before the January 20, 2025 inauguration. Lead Editors: Katie Sarah Zale and Paul E. Nelson. Editorial Board: allia abdullah-matta, CChristy White, Gabriella Gutiérrez y Muhs, Robert Lashley, Roxi Power, and Theresa Whitehill.  "Although words are the main tool of poets, in the beginning, it is not the Word; it is listening; it is reflection. A poet's practice is to reflect deeper than the conscious awareness of anger and to cast that awareness beyond the self. A poet, a "noiseless patient spider," to borrow the words of Whitman, uses language to explore a sense of connectedness with others and the natural world. A poet "launch[es] forth filament, filament, filament out of itself… / Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them / Till the bridge [they] need be form'd … / Till the gossamer thread [they] fling catch somewhere…" Katie Sarah Zale and Paul E. Nelson, Lead Editors. Winter in America (Again is available to purchase now!
