# Calvert Impact names Andrew Marino as new board chair

BETHESDA, MD, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Calvert Impact announced today the appointment of current board member and Vice-Chair Andrew Marino, partner at Summa Equity, as chairman, effective Jan. 1. He succeeds Bart Harvey, who has led the board for the last decade.  Marino brings several decades of private market investment and corporate governance experience, including significant time in impact and climate-oriented investing. As a partner at Summa Equity, he leads the group's North American activities. Prior to joining Summa, he held senior roles at Generate Capital and The Carlyle Group. He also serves on the board of Climate United, a coalition of three firms, including Calvert Impact, created to manage part of the National Clean Investment Fund.  "We're in the process of creating a new strategic plan for Calvert Impact and I know it will benefit from Andrew's expertise and his energy as we begin implementing it," said Calvert Impact CEO Jennifer Pryce.  "I'm honored to be taking up the chair role from Bart Harvey and to partner with Jennifer and the team to help guide Calvert Impact through this next phase of exciting growth," said Marino.  Marino will replace Bart Harvey, who departs the board after 10 years at its helm. Harvey is the former chairman and CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit focused on creating access to decent affordable homes for millions of families in the U.S. Harvey helped Congress create the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which provides financing for the majority of affordable rental homes in the country. He also led Enterprise's launch of the Green Communities initiative – an unprecedented commitment to use sustainable development's benefits for low-income communities nationwide.  "Bart has had a profound impact in shaping Calvert Impact into the innovative organization we are today, and we are tremendously grateful for his tenure as the board chair," said Pryce. "His leadership has been instrumental in guiding Calvert Impact through immense growth over the last decade. His dedication and insight have been invaluable to our success."  "It's been an honor and a privilege to serve as board Chair. I have both a deep passion for Calvert Impact's mission and deep respect for the staff leading the organization," said Harvey. "I'm excited to follow their next chapter; the sky is the limit for the team at Calvert Impact." More information about the Board of Directors can be found here.
