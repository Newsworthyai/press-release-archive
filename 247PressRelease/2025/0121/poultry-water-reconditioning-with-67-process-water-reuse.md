# POULTRY WATER RECONDITIONING WITH 67% PROCESS WATER REUSE

MADISON, WI, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In validation studies performed in partnership with third-party accredited labs and poultry processors, BIOIONIX® generated activated water (also known as electrolyzed water with nanobubbles) demonstrated a microbial kill, reduced turbidity and process water reconditioning for reuse in poultry applications.  "Over the past two years, we've been working with academia and processors to validate a chemical-free solution for poultry process water reconditioning which will change the poultry industry as we perceive it today." States Ryan Karns, CEO. In a scalder water validation study results demonstrated: 1.) Over 7 log reduction of pathogens, 2.) 81% water clarity restored, 3.) enabling 67% process water reuse. Additionally, the defouling capabilities of the activated water was found to be remarkable with complete elimination of any foul odor and undesirable characteristics.   The BIOIONIX BIOSAIF24/7 systems have long-been proven in food safety for microbial management at par or superior to toxic chemicals (like peracetic acid, bleach and ammonia). With the chemical-free solution, powering RTE meat brine recirculation for up to 4 weeks and cheese brine use for often years, raw meat partners were looking to go beyond the microbial kill step use of the BIOIONIX BIOSAIF24/7 system to also include enhancements for reconditioning and process water reuse. Kyle Jenson, VP Innovation and Sales states, "We're confident our solution provides not only the peace of mind for food safety, but also offers poultry processors the ability to save millions of gallons of process water, working toward their sustainability goals."   With recent announcements for more thorough USDA testing procedures combined with water restrictions, food manufacturers have even more challenges for microbial prevention and water stewardship throughout their facilities. "With all the recent recalls and new regulations that follow, combined with more media attention on employee safety with chemical burns, we know processors are looking for solutions opposite of throwing more toxic chemicals at the problem," states Jenson.   BIOIONIX BIOSAIF24/7™ three tiered systems are used by many of the world's largest brands for in-process disinfection, enabling food manufacturers to make their own natural and safe disinfectants. In addition to eliminating dependence on the use of toxic chemicals, the BIOIONIX system supports continuous and monitored disinfection and water reuse. In 2024, the system was validated for sanitizer replacement in CIP, in process disinfection of produce, and now the company continues to expand its services to provide water reconditioning solutions in poultry. More validations are in the works for 2025 as the company celebrates 20 years in food safety.  About BIOIONIX, LLC BIOIONIX® was originally founded by a NASA grant for space shuttle water reuse 20 years ago. While focusing on an out-of-world science, they developed a technology capable of disrupting the chemical dependence in food processing. The BIOIONIX® solution safely eliminates harmful pathogens and diseases from all stages of food production. With its roots in space-age research, BIOIONIX brings a paradigm shift in the industry by elevating food quality by eliminating hazardous chemicals and solving sustainability challenges for business leaders. EPA registered, patented and proven BIOIONIX® systems are FDA (FCN #2198) and USDA approved as a chemical-free solution for disinfection in all stages of food manufacturing. www.bioionix.com
