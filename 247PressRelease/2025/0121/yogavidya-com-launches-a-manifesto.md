# YogaVidya.com Launches a Manifesto

WOODSTOCK, NY, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Yoga Manifesto answers two questions: Why Yoga? Why now?  It summarizes the very long and remarkable history of Yoga from its Indian origins to its global present, its entanglement with money, where it fits in the constellation of religions, its dialectic with science, its place in today's society, and the bright future of Yoga.  It is already getting rave reviews. Rachel Scott, a leading Yoga educator, says, "It's a quick read. A quick and juicy read." "It's really nice, well-written, accessible, and also sensible throughout," says Dr. Dominik Wujastyk, a Sanskritist at the University of Alberta. "Just what's needed." Dr. Thomas R. Trautmann, emeritus historian at University of Michigan says, "It is a lovely thing. Well done!"
