# Southwest Florida's Tyson Eye a 2025 Castle Connolly Practice Center of Excellence

FORT MYERS, FL, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tyson Eye, a leading ophthalmology practice in Southwest Florida, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Practice Center of Excellence.  Castle Connolly Practice Centers of Excellence are premier healthcare entities that employ multiple Castle Connolly Top Doctors. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors in their regions for their specialties.  Proudly serving the community for decades, Tyson Eye helps adults age 18 or older achieve and maintain optimal vision and eye health, cares for patients like family, and supports local charities and other organizations.  Tyson Eye is home to five ophthalmologists and seven optometrists — most fellowship trained — including these Castle Connolly Top Doctors:  • Farrell C. Tyson, MD, FACS, is the stepson of Dr. Benjamin G. Martin, who founded Cape Coral Eye Center in 1980, which later became Tyson Eye. Dr. Tyson is a second-generation owner who specializes in cataract surgery and glaucoma management — including state-of-the-art laser-guided cataract surgery. Dr. Tyson is active in FDA research and has played an integral part in developing more effective treatments for cataracts and other eye conditions. • J. David Stephens, MD, specializes in diagnosing and treating corneal disease and glaucoma disorders. Dr. Stephens is experienced in performing cataract, LASIK, cornea, astigmatism management (ICL, LASIK, clear lens exchange), and glaucoma surgeries. He is one of the most experienced ophthalmologists in Southwest Florida for implanting and performing adjustments for light adjustable lenses (LALs). His expertise with the cornea makes Dr. Stephens an ideal surgeon for performing LASIK and PRK procedures. • Cristos Ifantides, MD, MBA, specializes in performing surgeries of the front of the eye — including those used to treat complex cataracts and glaucoma — and he has special expertise in performing refractive laser cataract surgery. Dr. Ifantides has helped to develop innovative new techniques for performing complex anterior-segment surgeries. • Marilyn A. Márquez, MD, specializes in treating diseases of the retina and vitreous, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, retinal tears, and retinal detachment. Dr. Márquez is fluent in Spanish. • Roman O. Pravak, MD, specializes in the medical treatment of diseases affecting the retina and vitreous, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and macular degeneration. Dr. Pravak is dedicated to providing expert care for these complex eye conditions.  Tyson Eye's nine locations in Southwest Florida include surgical centers in Cape Coral and Naples and five optical centers.   Advanced care for all types of eye and vision concerns The caring clinicians and staff at Tyson Eye strive to exceed patient expectations and make the practice a leader in ophthalmic care.

Research plays a pivotal role in advancing the quality of clinical care at Tyson Eye. By staying at the forefront of medical and technological advancements, the practice ensures its patients receive cutting-edge treatment options tailored to their needs.  Prospective patients would choose Tyson Eye over other ophthalmology practices simply because of our slogan: "Modern technology with old-fashioned concern." In these few words, the patient knows that they will be stepping into an ophthalmology practice with the latest and greatest technology for all of their vision concerns, while knowing they are being treated with care and are in the right hands with Tyson Eye. When you call our office, an actual person will answer the call, not an automated computer system or outsourced offshore call center.  Tyson Eye stands out from other practices because of our core values, which include delivering an exceptional patient care experience from the moment the patient calls us to schedule an appointment to when they walk in the door and when they leave. Tyson Eye knows this is a collaborative effort and, in order to deliver on this experience, all employees must be sold on this common goal. We strive to demonstrate the highest professional standards of ethics, integrity, knowledge, skill, and competence, to name a few.
