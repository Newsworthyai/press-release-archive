# Creative Biolabs: Engineered Strain Designâ€”The "Magician" in Microbial Therapeutics

SHIRLEY, NY, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Engineered therapeutic strains have emerged as a critical element in modern medicine. As global biotechnological specialists, Creative Biolabs has a clear focus on providing efficient and precise engineering strain design services with the goal of designing tools to treat a wide array of complex ailments using microbes and their engineering technologies.  At the heart of these engineered therapeutic strains is the gene editing of target microorganisms. Using genomics data and molecular biology research tools, Creative Biolabs seeks to augment the metabolism and activities of available natural microbial communities. For example, the accepted Lactobacillus as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) could be utilized for therapeutic purposes in the future. By means of genetic engineering, Lactobacillus can be engineered to become carriers of anti-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant enzymes, or other therapeutic molecules.  Creative Biolabs' Chief Scientist stated during an interview: "Lactobacillus has inherent immunomodulatory properties coupled with efficient gut retention capabilities, making it a good candidate for therapeutic molecule delivery. Our genetic engineering strategies are diverse, which include gene regulation, gene targeting, and even stable genetically modified organisms. Highly customized services are delivered for researchers."  As another significant advance in technology, the company Creative Biolabs demonstrated the synchronized lysis circuit (SLC) technology for targeting tissue drugs where engineered strains are used for drug delivery. This approach allows for the specific release of pro-apoptotic factors without preloading them but enables genetic circuits to be engineered with different frequencies and amplitudes of lysis cycles.   "Synchronized lysis circuit is a truly disruptive technology," the scientist explained. "Using SLC technology, these bacteria can lyse synchronously at predetermined intervals, which gives a chance to release therapeutic factors to directly target tumor cells."  Aside from Lactobacillus, Creative Biolabs also achieved great success on the genetic modification of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a well-characterized probiotic having an excellent safety record and is frequently used as a therapeutic chassis. Creative Biolabs has the complete genomic sequence of the specific bacteria, including expressing direct therapeutic factors, auxiliary therapeutic factors, and constructing targeted delivery systems.   One of the successful cases includes engineering EcN for cancer treatment. The engineered EcN strain has two key functions: it overproduces specific therapeutic molecules, which activate programmed cell death and inhibit new blood vessel formation. Thus, this E. coli strain targets tumor cells and avoids healthy tissues during the delivery of the therapeutic molecules.  The services offered by Creative Biolabs in engineered strain design are a collection of different innovative technologies providing aid to the clients. From Lactobacillus genetic modification and dynamic SLC regulation to functional optimization of EcN, Creative Biolabs' engineered solutions cover numerous disease areas such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, diabetes, and other infectious diseases.
