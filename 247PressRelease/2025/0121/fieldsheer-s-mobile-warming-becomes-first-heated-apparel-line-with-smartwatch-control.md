# Fieldsheer's Mobile Warming Becomes First Heated Apparel Line with Smartwatch Control

CARLSBAD, CA, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fieldsheer, a leader in temperature-controlled apparel, has announced that Mobile Warming, its Bluetooth-based, heated clothing line, is the first heated clothing brand offering dedicated smartwatch control.  Control of Mobile Warming items has already been available through the user's smartphone. Now, a specialized app downloaded through the watchOS operating system (Apple) or the Wear OS system (Android) gives users complete control with just their smartwatch, eliminating the need for the smartphone to be present.   The app is separate from the MW Connect App that currently controls Mobile Warming apparel; users will download the watchOS and Wear OS app separately. As with the smartphone, users will be able to control multiple garments at the same time, change temperature, and monitor battery levels, among other functions.   "While we develop outstanding heated clothing we are, at our core, a technology company," noted Patrick Deighan, Fieldsheer's Director of E-Commerce and Marketing. "So, it made sense to expand the technological options available to control our Mobile Warming line.  "Just as important is the convenience factor. Increasingly, consumers are relying on smartwatches to control their electronic devices and other Bluetooth-based items. That's why we wanted to ensure we were keeping up with our customers' growing technological choices."  Fieldsheer's new smartwatch integration is a sound business move, coming at a time when the use of smartwatches is significantly growing. The global smartwatch market, currently valued at $50.57 billion, is set to reach $143.19 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 15.6% from 2024 to 2032.   The new smartwatch app is currently available and will be facilitated through regular MW Connect App updates on the Apple and Android stores. The app is free of charge.  ABOUT FIELDSHEER Founded in 1978, Fieldsheer has redefined what technical outerwear can do. Fieldsheer was the first to design motorcycle jackets with integrated protective pads and the first to introduce heated motorcycle apparel. Fieldsheer is the only heated apparel company in the U.S. market that owns its full supply chain, from hardware R&D, battery design, cut-and-sew, and app development with Bluetooth control. Fieldsheer brings temperature control to everyday products and partners with known brands to offer the most extensive temperature-controlled technical apparel line in the industry.
