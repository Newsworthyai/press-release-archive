NEW YORK, NY, January 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NPCore, Inc., a global leader in cybersecurity solutions, delivered a lecture on cybersecurity awareness and introduced its Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution to 100 officials from Indonesia's Ministry of Creative Economy. The session focused on the critical role of apt defense in addressing growing cyber threats.  The Ministry of Creative Economy collaborated with NPCore to highlight the need for apt defense strategies to protect digital infrastructure. Supported by the Creative Economy Agency, the initiative stressed the importance of apt defense across government entities.  With rising cyber threats, including hacking incidents targeting public and private sectors, Indonesia faces vulnerabilities that demand apt defense measures. Many institutions lack even basic protection, underscoring the urgency of adopting apt defense mechanisms.  NPCore's presentation emphasized building apt defense systems to enhance security. Attendees learned how apt defense frameworks mitigate risks and secure sensitive data. This initiative marks a proactive step toward prioritizing apt defense in Indonesia's cybersecurity efforts. Attendees were provided with actionable insights on:  • Basic cybersecurity awareness: Understanding the fundamentals of cybersecurity and recognizing potential threats. • Prevention strategies: Adopting proactive measures to mitigate risks, such as avoiding suspicious links and implementing regular software updates. • Network security: The critical role of securing internal and external networks to prevent unauthorized access. • Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Moving beyond traditional ID and password combinations to enhance security. • Defense measures: Exploring practical approaches to strengthen apt defense against malware and phishing attempts.  "Cybersecurity is no longer optional—it's essential for every government institution," said a representative from NPCore. "As cyber threats become more sophisticated, awareness and education are critical components of an effective defense strategy. NPCore is committed to equipping public institutions in Indonesia with the tools and knowledge needed to protect their digital assets with apt defense solutions."  The lecture provided an interactive platform for government officials to discuss their concerns and seek expert advice. NPCore's specialists shared real-world examples of cyber incidents, illustrating the potential consequences of inadequate cybersecurity measures. By fostering an open dialogue, the event encouraged participants to prioritize cybersecurity in their respective institutions and advocate for continuous education and system upgrades with apt defense strategies.  As part of the lecture, NPCore introduced its state-of-the-art Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.
