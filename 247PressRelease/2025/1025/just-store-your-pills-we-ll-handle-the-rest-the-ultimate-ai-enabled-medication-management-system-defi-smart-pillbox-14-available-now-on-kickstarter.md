# "Just Store Your Pills. We'll Handle the Rest." The Ultimate AI-Enabled Medication Management System: DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 Available Now on Kickstarter

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, October 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DontEverForgetIt, INC. (DEFI) today announced the launch of the DEFI Smart Pillbox 14—an advanced smart pillbox that keeps you on top of your mediation—now available on Kickstarter. Designed to revolutionize how people manage their daily medications, DEFI combines cutting-edge AI, real-time tracking, and intuitive design to ensure users never miss a dose again.  Key Features That Set DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 Apart  At the core of the DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 is a powerful 3-step alert system designed to ensure that users never miss a dose. When it's time to take medication, the system initiates with a push notification via the DEFI app. Simultaneously, the pillbox itself provides clear cues: a voice alert, a message on the display, and a colored light indicating the correct slot to open. If the system detects that no dose has been taken, it follows-up with a phone call, creating a failsafe process that keeps you healthy and consistent.  DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 takes intelligence a step further with its AI-powered auto scheduling. In tandem with the in-app reminder system is a built-in AI that learns individual behavior patterns and adjusts medication times accordingly. For example, if a user consistently takes their medication 30 minutes later than scheduled, DEFI recognizes the habit and recommends shifting reminders to match real-life routines. This flexibility enhances adherence without creating stress or unnecessary alarms.  Automatic dose tracking is another standout feature. Each of the 14 slots is equipped with a built-in infrared sensor that detects when pills are physically removed. Every user action is logged instantly in the device and synced with the DEFI app. This lets the user access data through easy-to-read calendars and visual graphs, giving a clear understanding of medication patterns over time without the hassle of manual entry.  In addition to scheduled alerts, DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 includes a smart motion sensor that actively reminds users when they're nearby but haven't yet taken their dose. If a user misses the initial alert, simply walking past the pillbox will trigger a secondary reminder. This function continues to activate each time movement is detected near the device, offering gentle nudges until the medication is taken, making it nearly impossible to forget.  For those managing care for a loved one, the real-time caregiver monitoring feature adds extra peace of mind. Family members and caregivers can track intake activity remotely and receive immediate alerts if a dose is missed. This ensures timely intervention and provides reassurance for those supporting individuals with complex medication routines or memory challenges.  Even when offline, the DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 doesn't skip a beat. The system is designed to work standalone, with all reminders, alarms, and LED indicators operating directly on the device itself. Automatic logging continues without the need for Bluetooth or internet connectivity, and once a connection is restored, all data syncs seamlessly with the app, ensuring continuity and reliability at all times.  Available Now on Kickstarter  DEFI Smart Pillbox 14 is available exclusively on Kickstarter, with Early Bird Deals for backers who pledge early.
