# Urtopia Expands Carbon Fiber eBike Lineup with Four New Models for Black Friday

IRVINE, CA, October 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Urtopia, the pioneering carbon fiber e-bike brand known for blending advanced Carbon Fiber material, will unveil four new models during this year's Black Friday season, bringing its lineup to a total of 11 models designed to meet the needs of a wider range of riders.  New Carbon Classic Series Launching November 1st Two new models — the Carbon Classic and Carbon Classic ST — will debut on November 1st.  Both share the signature design DNA of Urtopia's best-selling Carbon 1 Pro (designed by former BMW designer Mathis Heller) and Carbon 1 ST, and weigh just 38 lbs, thanks to their racing-grade Toray® carbon fiber frames.  In response to customer and market feedback, the new models introduce several key upgrades: · Throttle option for a more flexible riding experience · User-friendly color display with a simplified start interface · More accessible pricing at $1,999, achieved by removing the AI-powered Smart Box  These updates make the Carbon Classic series Urtopia's most approachable carbon e-bike lineup yet — lightweight, beautifully designed, and ideal for everyday riders.  Joy Ultra and Fold ST Arriving Mid-November Later in November, Urtopia will launch two additional models — the Joy Ultra and Fold ST.  Both build on the success of the popular Joy Carbon e-bike, offering lighter weight, enhanced performance, and the same modern, minimalist design. The Fold ST, a step-through folding e-bike, follows the success of the Carbon Fold 1, which received widespread praise for its portability and design.
