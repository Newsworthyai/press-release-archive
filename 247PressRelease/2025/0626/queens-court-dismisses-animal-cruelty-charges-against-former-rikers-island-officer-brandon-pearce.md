# Queens Court Dismisses Animal-Cruelty Charges Against Former Rikers Island Officer Brandon Pearce

STATEN ISLAND, NY, June 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Brandon Pearce, a former New York City Department of Correction officer, has been cleared of all animal-cruelty allegations stemming from the 2022 death of his ex-girlfriend's 12-year-old Maltese, Princess.  At a recent hearing in Queens County Supreme Court (Indictment No. 735/2022), the District Attorney's Office formally dismissed the felony charges after witness statements, veterinary records, and an expert affidavit raised significant doubts about the original narrative.  Key facts now part of the public record  A disclosure addendum filed on May 23, 2022, includes a witness statement from Omar Velasquez, a former partner of the complainant. According to his sworn account, the complainant privately admitted that her surveillance footage showed someone other than Brandon Pearce was responsible for the dog's injuries.  Veterinary records from V.E.T.S. New Hyde Park dated February 25, 2022, initially noted no visible external wounds. However, a subsequent entry referencing trauma was added only after a follow-up by detectives, raising questions about the consistency and origin of the medical findings.  An affidavit by surveillance expert John Layne further supported Mr. Pearce's defense. Layne stated that building surveillance cameras were fully operational and recorded continuously—not motion-activated as previously claimed. Despite this, approximately four and a half hours of footage during the time frame in question were missing, with no technical explanation provided.  Case timeline  The events in question began on the night of February 24, 2022, when Princess was reportedly injured. According to court transcripts, Mr. Pearce attempted to bring the dog to a veterinary clinic on two occasions but turned back at the direction of the dog's owner. Formal charges were filed in early March 2022, including felony counts of animal cruelty.  In the months that followed, critical new evidence emerged. A witness came forward with information indicating that the complainant had acknowledged someone else was responsible for the injury. At the same time, inconsistencies in the veterinary documentation and the discovery of missing surveillance footage undermined key elements of the original accusation.  By June 2025, with the felony counts withdrawn, Mr. Pearce entered a plea to a single misdemeanor under New York Agriculture & Markets Law § 353 for failing to seek veterinary care quickly enough. No admission of causing harm was entered, and the case was closed.  In March 2022, the case drew widespread media attention, including coverage by the New York Post (original article), which reported the initial allegations based on police statements at the time. However, as legal proceedings progressed and new evidence emerged, the outcome differed significantly from the original reporting.  "I have always maintained I did nothing to harm an animal," Brandon Pearce said after the resolution. "The dismissal of the cruelty charges allows me to move forward and rebuild my life."  Supporting court documents (available upon request)  • Queens County Indictment No. 735/2022 and docket history  • Veterinary medical records (Feb–Mar 2022)  • Affidavit of surveillance expert John Layne  • Witness statements disclosed by the District Attorney's Office  This press release reflects verified information from public court records, expert affidavits, and official veterinary documents. Supporting materials are available upon media request.  Following the resolution of the case, Mr. Pearce did return to his position as a corrections officer before eventually departing to pursue other professional interests.
