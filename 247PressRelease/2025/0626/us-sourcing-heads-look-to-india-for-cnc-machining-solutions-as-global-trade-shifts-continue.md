# US Sourcing Heads Look to India for CNC Machining Solutions as Global Trade Shifts Continue

DAYTON, OH, June 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- rivexa by mjunction Services Limited (Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Limited joint venture), a digital sourcing marketplace, reports increased sourcing activity from US procurement professionals looking for cost-effective and dependable CNC machining solutions from India. This trend is an outcome of broader effects by global buyers working on diversifying their supply chains to safeguard them against volatility affecting legacy manufacturing destinations.   As industrial sourcing strategies become more risk-averse, India's manufacturing base is being reassessed for its long-term strategic potential. With a wide talent pool maturing digital infrastructure, and production capabilities across Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, India meets global CNC machining, custom components, and engineered goods components. Such conditions offer considerable advantages to American stockists, sourcing leads, and MSEs navigating disrupted global trade routes (Reuters, CNBC, KMPG).   Trade between the United States and India exists through frameworks such as the US-India Trade Policy Forum (USTR.GOV), which encourages industrial collaborations and improves market access across engineering and component segments (Deloitte). This is relevant in high-mix, low-volume categories such as drawing-based CNC machined parts, replacement parts, and aftermarket OEM components.   Through rivexa, global brands gain access to verified Indian manufacturers offering CNC machining services. Other related industrial processes include forging, casting, injection molding, and sheet metal fabrication.   rivexa's supplier onboarding process includes factory audits, compliance certification checks, quality process verification, and continuous inspection support during transactions.
