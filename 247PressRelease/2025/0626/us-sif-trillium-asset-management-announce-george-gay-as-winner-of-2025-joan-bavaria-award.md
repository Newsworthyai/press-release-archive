# US SIF &amp; Trillium Asset Management announce George Gay as winner of 2025 Joan Bavaria Award

WASHINGTON, DC, June 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- US SIF and Trillium Asset Management today announced that George Gay has been selected for the 2025 Joan Bavaria Award. Gay joined First Affirmative Financial Network over 35 years ago to provide clients with values-aligned investment solutions. In addition, Gay founded SRI in the Rockies in 1990—later known as ESG! For Impact—one of the first conferences to provide educational and networking opportunities for sustainable investors across the US.  "As leader of one of the first SRI-focused advisory firms and organizer of the SRI in the Rockies and ESG! For Impact conferences, George spent his career building and supporting the sustainable investing community from the ground up," said Maria Lettini, CEO of US SIF. "From helping clients build portfolios that reflect their values to creating spaces where advisors could connect and learn, George has earned his spot as one of the pioneers of the industry.'"  The 2025 Joan Bavaria Award was presented at the 2025 US SIF FORUM, held in Washington D.C. from June 25 – 27, 2025. The Award Committee included Maria Lettini, CEO of US SIF, and Matthew Patsky, CEO of Trillium. Both judges lead organizations that were founded or co-founded by Joan Bavaria, who died in 2008 following a long battle with ovarian cancer. This prestigious award honors leaders who embody the collaborative and innovative spirit of Joan Bavaria—a visionary in sustainable investing.   "George has channeled Joan's legacy by his commitment to mentorship and community building within the field" said Matt Patsky, CEO of Trillium. "For many years, the SRI in the Rockies was the must-attend event for advisors seeking to deepen their impact and advance sustainable investing—and its legacy continues to shape the field today."  "It is an incredible honor and a privilege to be recognized along with the past recipients of the Joan Bavaria award," said Gay. "If Socially Responsible Investing were to have a Mount Rushmore, there is no doubt that the first face to be honored would be that of Joan Bavaria. I had the opportunity to count Joan as one of my friends when I entered and grew in this industry, and to serve with her on the Board of Directors of US SIF for many years. Her values and leadership were an inspiration to me, and I am humbled to be able to carry them forward in this industry which is so critical to a just and sustainable future."  In 2024, Joy Anderson, Suzanne Biegel (posthumously), and Jackie VanderBrug received the award for their influential work in developing the field of Gender Lens Investing. Other previous honorees include Napoleon Wallace, Managing Partner of The Southern Reconstruction Fund, Sr. Patricia Daly, Executive Director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, and Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
