# Xoë Miles Redefines Self-Worth in Her Bold New Single "Someone's Somebody"

NASHVILLE, TN, November 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Award-winning alt-pop artist, songwriter, and producer Xoë Miles released her highly anticipated new single, "Someone's Somebody" today. Known for her bold blend of emotional honesty and catchy self-produced pop, Xoë delivers a powerful anthem that dives into self-doubt and desire, layered over bright, 2010s-inspired production.  "I wrote 'Someone's Somebody' about feeling unwanted and overthinking everything in a one-sided relationship — blaming myself, craving validation, and trying to be whatever someone wants just to feel wanted," says Xoë. "The lyrics are heavy, but I intentionally made the production have a vibrant 2010's pop sound to make the contrast hit even harder."  With "Someone's Somebody", Xoë continues to cement her reputation as one of indie pop's most fearless voices — seamlessly blending catchy melodies with lyrical honesty and self-produced sonic textures.
