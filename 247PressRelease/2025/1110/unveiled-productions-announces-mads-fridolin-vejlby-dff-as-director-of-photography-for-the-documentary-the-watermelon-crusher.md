# Unveiled Productions Announces Mads Fridolin Vejlby DFF as Director of Photography for the documentary "The Watermelon Crusher"

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Unveiled Productions is proud to announce that acclaimed cinematographer Mads Fridolin Vejlby will serve as Director of Photography for the upcoming documentary feature "The Watermelon Crusher," directed by Katie Ginge Cox and produced by Harrison Van Pelt.   "The Watermelon Crusher" follows the extraordinary journey of Kortney Olson — world-renowned athlete, entrepreneur, best-selling author, and advocate for resilience and empowerment. Through deeply personal stories of adversity, including overcoming trauma, addiction, and depression before age 21, Olson has emerged as an inspiring role model for women worldwide. The film will highlight Olson's rise from surviving a challenging youth to building a successful clothing brand and empowering thousands to reclaim their strength, both physically and emotionally.  Mads Fridolin Vejlby will be responsible for visualizing the film's narrative, employing a combination of handheld reportage and intimate interview framing to convey the authenticity and emotional impact of Olson's life and her mission. Vejlby will collaborate closely with Producer Harrison Van Pelt and Director Katie Ginge Cox to design the unique visual language that underscores the film's ambition: to provide audiences with a vivid, nuanced portrait of Olson while exploring broader themes of female empowerment.  "The Watermelon Crusher" is committed to presenting a story as raw and real as its subject, inviting audiences into Olson's world without telling them what to think. Through the lens crafted by Vejlby and his crew, viewers will experience the triumphs, challenges, and transformative self-belief that define Olson's path.
