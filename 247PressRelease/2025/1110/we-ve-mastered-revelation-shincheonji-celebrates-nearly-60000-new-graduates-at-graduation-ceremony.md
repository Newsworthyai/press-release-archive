# "We've Mastered Revelation!" Shincheonji Celebrates Nearly 60,000 New Graduates at Graduation Ceremony

ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA, November 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "I have mastered the Book of Revelation. The truth that no seminary or church could explain, I finally understood at Shincheonji."  That was the resounding testimony echoing across the Shincheonji Church of Jesus as tens of thousands of believers celebrated their graduation from the Zion Christian Mission Center—declaring they had found answers to the mysteries of Scripture.  On November 2, the church announced that 59,192 students officially graduated from the Mission Center's 116th class during a spectacular ceremony held at Shincheonji's Cheongju Church. The church hails the graduates as "believers who have mastered the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation."  A Celebration of Faith and Learning  The Zion Christian Mission Center is known for its rigorous, structured program that walks students through the prophecies and their fulfillment across Scripture. To graduate, each student must complete three levels—elementary, intermediate, and advanced—and score at least 90 out of 100 on the final comprehensive exam.  Taking the stage, Chairman Lee Man-hee inspired the crowd with a powerful message:  "The Bible warns that no one who adds to or takes away from God's Word can enter heaven (Revelation 22:18–19). Our church has mastered the Book of Revelation. If you want genuine faith—if you truly want to know God's Word—come to Shincheonji and learn."  Lee urged Christians not to depend on human authority but to return to the Bible itself, challenging them:  "Don't rely on church hierarchy. Look to the Word, and see if your faith is truly biblical."  13,500 Pastors in Four Years  Despite what the church describes as "intensified persecution and misunderstanding," the number of graduates continues to rise. Among this year's class, 2,248 are ordained pastors, bringing the total number of pastor graduates over the last four years to more than 13,500 — a sign, the church says, that religious leaders worldwide are seeking deeper biblical understanding.  One of them, Oh Sun-kyung, a former pastor who led three churches, delivered the main testimony at the ceremony.  "For years, I preached with confidence but carried a heavy burden—I could not understand Revelation," she confessed. "I read the Bible over 30 times, but the answers never came. I was ashamed before my congregation and eventually stepped away from ministry."  That changed, he said, the moment he began studying at the Zion Christian Mission Center.  "Within an hour of the first class, my heart opened. Every lesson was grounded in Scripture—nothing else. Now I can say with conviction, "I have mastered Revelation!"  Turning to fellow pastors, he urged,  "This is the time when the secrets of Revelation are revealed. Our calling is to lead God's people to heaven. Let's humble ourselves before the Word and walk this path together."  Testimonies from Around the World  The stories of transformation didn't stop there. Park Sang-jun (44), who spent over four decades in the Presbyterian Church, shared,  "I used to criticize Shincheonji and even watched documentaries attacking it. But when I followed my wife to a Mission Center class, I realized—Shincheonji teaches strictly according to the Bible."  Flying 16 hours from the Netherlands, Lígia Monteiro (19) said,  "What makes Shincheonji different is that they don't interpret the Bible based on personal opinion. Every verse is explained using Scripture itself. That's what moved me."  Tan Young-jin, Director-General of the Zion Christian Mission Center, remarked,  "Despite prejudice and misunderstanding, more people are being renewed through the Word. This proves God is with us. These graduates have uncovered biblical truths even pastors once struggled to understand—this isn't just knowledge; it's transformation through truth."  A Global Celebration of Light  The graduation, themed "Love and Blessing—The Light That Shines on the World," filled the Cheongju Church and its outdoor grounds with more than 20,000 graduates in person, while tens of thousands more joined online from Shincheonji churches around the world.  From powerful worship to emotional testimonies, the atmosphere overflowed with joy, unity, and conviction—a celebration of what graduates described as "faith reborn through the Word."
