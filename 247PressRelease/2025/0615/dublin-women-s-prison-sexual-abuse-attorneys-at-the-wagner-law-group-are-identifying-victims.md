# Dublin Women's Prison Sexual Abuse Attorneys at The Wagner Law Group are Identifying Victims

OAKLAND, CA, June 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dublin prison sex abuse lawyer Butch Wagner, Founder of The Wagner Law Group has successfully represented victims who survived sexual assaults at the FCI Dublin Women's Correctional Facility. The Wagner Law Group has recovered over 300 million dollars for victims. "When it comes to experience there is no firm out there that has our unique skillset and array of cases and case results," says Butch Wagner.  The now closed Dublin FCI prison has been referred to as, "The Rape Club," according to multiple outlets with victims making statement like, "It was like hell." The rape culture was so pervasive at the prison that victims were scared to come forward according to Buth of The Wagner Law Group, "Even when an internal investigation was being conducted within the prison victims were scared to come forward with what was happening to them because they feared retaliation from the guards and other prison administrators."  After a recent mistrial in a criminal proceeding, it is becoming clearer that it is important for as many victims of prison sex abuse as possible to come forward not only to seek compensation for the abuses they survived but to also help provide the largest amount of substantiated evidence available against prison officials as defense attorneys attempt to discredit survivors in open court. During the recent trial a defense attorney stated that the victims' stories had changed, even implying that they were made up all together, "[Victim A] was a driving force in this group of inmates, [Victims B&C] both consulted with [Victim A] before reporting."  This type of conduct is very concerning the prison sex abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group. According to the National Institutes of Health, "Rape survivors who speak out about their assault experiences are often punished for doing so when they are subjected to negative reactions from support providers. These negative reactions may thereby serve a silencing function, leading some rape survivors to stop talking about their experiences to anyone at all." This is why it is so important for survivors of sexual assault at FCI Dublin continue to come forward and not be discouraged.  The power that prison officials hold may be difficult for the general public to understand. At the beginning of the most recent criminal trial the prosector, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sailaja Paidipaty stated, "Defendant Darrell Smith liked power, and he abused that power. He abused his power when he fondled [one victim's] breasts. He abused his power when he pinned her against a wall and shoved his fingers into her anus. He used his power for many years to sexually abuse many women." This is why the role of prison sex abuse lawyers is so important, to provide representation to survivors of these horrific acts.
