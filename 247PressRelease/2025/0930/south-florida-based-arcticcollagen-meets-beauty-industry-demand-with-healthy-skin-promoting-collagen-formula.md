# South Florida-Based ArcticCollagen Meets Beauty Industry Demand With Healthy Skin-Promoting Collagen Formula

BOCA RATON, FL, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As American consumers seek convenient, accessible ways to keep their skin looking healthy and youthful, South Florida based ArcticCollagen, creators of a supplement blending 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in once-a-day sachets, is raising awareness of the impact collagen can have on skin health as well as general wellness.   "Collagen may sound like a health industry buzz word, but in reality it is a natural, and even essential, part of your body," explained ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist. "It affects structures across every system inside and out, including keeping our skin elastic and youthful while fighting the effects of sun damage like wrinkles."   According to WebMD, collagen makes up approximately 1/3 of all protein in the body, with its strong fibers 'working like glue' to hold muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, organs, and skin together. Of the 16 types in the body, type 1 is most responsible for helping build healthy skin. Problems arise when the body's levels begin to deplete, which is caused by not only natural aging, but sunlight (ultraviolet light makes fibers unravel), smoking (causes skin sagging and wrinkles), and sugar (causes fibers to tangle and lessens elasticity).   One solution to strengthen the skin? Supplements, a challenge ArcticCollagen took to heart in the development of its consumer-friendly, travel-ready, and sweet-tasting formulation. Made from the sustainably sourced skin of wild caught, Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon and hydrolyzed in Norway, ArcticCollagen is a type 1-rich collagen supplement that significantly boosts the body's natural levels. Launched in both strawberry and lemon flavors, the honey-like substance is easily added to everyday foods, encouraging a healthy diet, or can even be eaten on its own with ease (as displayed by President Winqvist during an interview with The Donna Drake Show).   The effects of collagen supplements have been the focus of numerous studies, including a 2022 piece by Dermatology Practical & Conceptual shared by the National Library of Medicine that compared oral and topical options, stating: "The evidence from the reviewed studies suggested that both collagen supplements improve skin moisture, elasticity, and hydration when orally administered. Additionally, collagen reduces the wrinkling and roughness of the skin, and existing studies have not found any side effects of its oral supplements."   Winqvist added, "We were inspired to create ArcticCollagen after feeling our needs were not met by other supplements on the market, and we could not be more proud of the result. As we continue to expand our reach, we will utilize our platform to inform consumers of the importance of collagen and how easy it can be to improve your health one tasty sachet at a time."   Earlier this month, ArcticCollagen's products were showcased at Florida's ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session, being displayed for retailers like GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens in private, one-on-one meetings. ArcticCollagen was also spotted in Beverly Hills for Emmys Week, being included in luxurious swag bags provided by CapAquarius Media through repeated partnership with "The Marianna Group." Emmys Week attendees, including reality TV stars, soap opera stars, Emmy nominees, producers, directors, and more, received exclusive products selected based on their uniqueness, quality, and dedication to healthier, more beautiful living.   ArcticCollagen is available for purchase on OneLavi.com, Medpaid Market, and Amazon.com. A pack of 14 single-use, tear-top sachets retails for $47.99.
