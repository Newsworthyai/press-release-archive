# Introducing RentalBoss™: Next-Generation Software for Equipment Rental Yards Launching in 2026

CLEVELAND, OH, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rental yards and equipment dealers have long struggled with fleet management software that wasn't built to handle the unique challenges of their industry. FleetNow, a Cleveland-based equipment services company, announced today that it is developing RentalBoss, a rental management platform designed specifically for the equipment rental sector. The software is slated for launch in the second quarter of 2026.  The announcement comes as the rental industry faces increasing pressure to digitize. Many independent companies still rely on spreadsheets, paper systems, or software adapted from other industries—leaving gaps in efficiency and customer experience.  FleetNow's team analyzed existing rental software—from POR to Alert Rental to RentalMan. While each has strengths, and some were built with the equipment industry in mind, most weren't designed specifically around the realities of rental yards—leaving teams to wrestle with tools that don't fit their day-to-day business. As FleetNow sees it, that's not good enough. Rental software shouldn't just be generic management software—it needs to be equipment rental software.   In addition to streamlining daily operations, the software is being developed with reporting features that make it easier for rental businesses to track performance and use data to make smarter decisions about their fleets.   This announcement also kicks off the start of a five-part series in which FleetNow will examine the rental software landscape—spotlighting both strengths and gaps in current tools and exploring how technology is reshaping rental operations.   "At OHR Rents and IronTek we live and breathe this business and this industry every day, so we know all too well how fragmented and outdated many rental software solutions are," said Carly Cahlik, CEO and founder of FleetNow. "We couldn't find a platform that was easy to use and truly met the needs of today's rental businesses—so we decided to create one."   RentalBoss is being developed with a focus on intuitive design, practical tools, and scalability. Unlike larger enterprise systems that can be difficult for smaller operators to adopt, RentalBoss is designed to grow with a business, making it accessible for small to mid-sized rental yards while still adaptable to larger fleets.   "The equipment industry is at a turning point," Cahlik added. "Rental businesses need technology that simplifies operations while keeping customers at the center. RentalBoss is our contribution to that shift."
