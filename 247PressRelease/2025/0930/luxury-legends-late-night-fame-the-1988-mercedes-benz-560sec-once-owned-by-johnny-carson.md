# Luxury, Legends &amp; Late-Night Fame: The 1988 Mercedes-Benz 560SEC Once Owned by Johnny Carson

FORT WORTH, TX, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Among the many distinguished vehicles at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, few blend star power, automotive excellence, and personal nostalgia like the 1988 Mercedes-Benz 560SEC formerly owned by Johnny Carson. Sold by Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills with a then-staggering MSRP of $77,910, this pillarless coupe was the top-tier Mercedes-Benz of its time—fitting for the king of late-night television.  The 560SEC embodies the era's pinnacle of engineering and refinement. Long, low, and unmistakably powerful, it was the flagship of the W126 S-Class line and one of the most expensive production cars available in the U.S. during the late '80s. Carson, known for his discerning taste and understated elegance, reportedly kept the vehicle until 2003.  Featured in the January–February 2022 issue of The Star, the official magazine of the Mercedes-Benz Club of America, this vehicle doesn't just carry the cachet of celebrity ownership—it also resonates with car enthusiasts like museum founder Ron Sturgeon, who once owned an identical 560SEC himself.  "This was the most expensive car Mercedes made at the time, and if you had one, I reckon some would say you were a baller," Sturgeon recalls. "I remember sailing along the freeway in mine and spotting a blonde in a Mustang 5.0 beside me. I thought she was looking at me, so I gave her an extra glance—just as I slammed into the curb. I cracked a wheel, limped home, and told my wife Kathi. She just said, 'YOU GOT JUST WHAT YOU DESERVED.'"  That story, like the car itself, captures the spirit of an era—one where bold design, personal stories, and a touch of celebrity merged on the open road.  Explore this iconic Mercedes-Benz 560SEC and hundreds of other automotive and cultural artifacts at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. From rare supercars to toy collections that span generations, the museum is a celebration of vehicles that left their mark on the world—and the people who drove them.
