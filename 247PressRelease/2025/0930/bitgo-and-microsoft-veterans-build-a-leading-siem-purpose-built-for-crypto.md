# BitGo and Microsoft Veterans Build a Leading SIEM Purpose-Built for Crypto

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Web3Firewall has emerged as a leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform purpose-built for Web3. Founded by BitGo veterans Samer Fayssal (CEO) and Matt Hardy (COO), together with former Microsoft engineering leader Cody Nicewanner (CTO), the company is positioning itself as the solution to fill the security foundation gap for the digital asset ecosystem.  In traditional enterprise IT, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms act as the central nervous system of cybersecurity. They aggregate and correlate data from across the infrastructure — firewalls, identity systems, applications, and networks — to deliver real-time monitoring, threat detection, and automated response. This model has underpinned the operations of enterprise security teams for decades.  Web3Firewall adapts this proven approach to the realities of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. By aggregating signals from risk, compliance, and KYC providers and combining them with its proprietary intelligence engines and AI decisioning technology, Web3Firewall enables institutions to detect anomalies and enforce policies across chains and wallet infrastructure in real time.  "Web3 has powerful risk and compliance tools, but they operate in silos," explained Samer Fayssal, Co-Founder and CEO of Web3Firewall. "Our SIEM platform unifies them with AI-driven decisioning and anomaly detection — giving institutions, protocols, and managed service providers a single source of truth for on-chain security, regardless of wallet infrastructure, chain, or jurisdiction."  The platform also supports an application layer, allowing organizations to build advanced compliance and risk solutions on top of the SIEM foundation. One example is proof of solvency, where Web3Firewall integrates zero-knowledge proofs (zk) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with collateral protection mechanisms to help custodians and stablecoin issuers demonstrate reserve backing without compromising client privacy.  Core capabilities of Web3Firewall include:  Integration-first architecture that unifies external risk, compliance, and KYC signals with Web3Firewall intelligence.  Pre-broadcast simulation and post-broadcast monitoring to detect anomalies before and after transactions.  Cross-chain and wallet infrastructure coverage for consistent, enterprise-grade protection across ecosystems.  A policy engine with jurisdictional coverage, enabling compliance with regulatory frameworks across different regions.  Advanced wallet management tools for proactive asset control and enforcement.  Multi-tenant SIEM features designed for managed service providers, exchanges, and custodians.  Web3Firewall is already trusted by regulated custodians in the US and internationally. The company is ISO compliant, partnered with Google and AWS, and has served as an intelligence partner to CryptoISAC for the past eight months, contributing threat data and insights to strengthen the broader digital asset security ecosystem.  "With decades of experience securing billions in institutional assets and scaling enterprise systems, our founding team is uniquely positioned to provide the security foundation that Web3 has been missing," said Matt Hardy, Co-Founder and COO of Web3Firewall.
