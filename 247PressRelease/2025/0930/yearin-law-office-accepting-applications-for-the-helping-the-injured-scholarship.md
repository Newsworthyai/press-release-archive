SCOTTSDALE, AZ, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As leaders in the personal injury field and locally recognized Scottsdale motorcycle accident lawyers, the Yearin Law Office believes in giving back to the legal community, mentoring emerging legal minds, and helping the next generation of law students succeed in their endeavors.  Because of our passion for giving back and helping injured people have their voices heard, we initiated the Helping the Injured Scholarship, an academic award open to all college, university, and post-secondary students. The scholarship is awarded to one deserving student each year and is valued at $1,000.  The ideal candidate will be in academic good standing with their accredited college or university and demonstrate leadership, a commitment to helping those in need, and goals of making the voiceless heard. We seek people who have not let their circumstances deter them from their goals and academic pursuit.  As part of the selection process, applicants must submit an essay explaining how they have helped injured people in the past, such as through volunteer work or community advocacy, and how they plan to use their education to help others in the future. You can find more information, including submission requirements and deadlines, on our firm's scholarship page.
