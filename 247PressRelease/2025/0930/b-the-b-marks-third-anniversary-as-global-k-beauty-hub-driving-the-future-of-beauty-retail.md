# B the B Marks Third Anniversary as Global K-Beauty Hub Driving the Future of Beauty Retail

NEW YORK, NY, September 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ --  • B the B, a Seoul-born incubator, is emerging as a leading K-beauty platform helping SMEs grow globally. • From discovery to purchase, B the B is redefining beauty retail with a hybrid model merging beauty and technology. • As a gateway for K-beauty exports, B the B is expanding its platform from New York to Vietnam.  Operated by the Seoul Business Agency (SBA, CEO Hyunwoo Kim) — a public agency dedicated to advancing the growth and competitiveness of Seoul's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) — the beauty cultural complex "B the B" is celebrating its third anniversary and gaining recognition as a leading platform shaping the future of the global K-beauty industry.  B the B, a brand-incubating hub founded in Seoul, is emerging as a premier K-beauty platform that empowers SMEs to grow and compete globally. From discovery to purchase, it is redefining beauty retail through a hybrid online–offline commerce model that fuses beauty with cutting-edge technology. As a strategic gateway for K-beauty exports, B the B is also expanding its innovative spaces and platforms to international markets — from New York to Vietnam, while actively engaging consumers worldwide through social media channels including Instagram (@btheb_official).  SBA, the Seoul Business Agency, is a frontline organization dedicated to driving the growth and brand competitiveness of Seoul's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  Redefining Beauty Retail Through Innovation  Established in 2022 within Seoul's Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP), B the B was designed as a next-generation beauty-tech convergence platform — going beyond a simple showroom to allow consumers to experience and share brand philosophy and identity. In just three years, the space has welcomed 1.94 million visitors, including 350,000 international guests, solidifying its role as an experiential export hub for K-beauty.  A Platform for Growth and Global Reach  True to its name, "Be the Beautiful," B the B presents a new perspective on beauty while helping both individuals and brands discover their unique values. The space delivers a full-funnel commerce journey — from personalized skin diagnostics and product recommendations to hands-on trials and direct purchase via QR code — creating an immersive experience that bridges beauty and technology.  All participating brands are Seoul-based SMEs, making B the B both a test market for emerging players and a brand incubator that drives growth through storytelling and consumer engagement.  Global Recognition and Expansion  B the B's innovative model has drawn international attention. In July, Alibaba's Taobao selected B the B — over traditional shopping districts like Myeongdong or Hongdae — as the broadcast site for its live commerce program. Several brands achieved sell-out success during the "Sold Out Project" Korea special, underscoring B the B's global market impact.  The platform's hybrid structure blurs the boundaries between online and offline, positioning B the B as a new benchmark in the evolution of global beauty retail — from wholesale and retail distribution toward a model centered on content, commerce, and experience.  Looking ahead, B the B is expanding internationally not just as a physical space but as a "platform export model" encompassing brand curation, content creation, live commerce, and strategic planning. Countries ranging from advanced economies such as the United States to rapidly emerging Asian markets have expressed strong interest, positioning B the B as a future hub for global K-beauty exports.  Transforming Dongdaemun Into a Global Cluster  By redefining Seoul's traditional fashion hub of Dongdaemun into a future-oriented beauty industry cluster, B the B is driving a new era where global influencers, international platforms, and Seoul's beauty brands converge to create cross-border opportunities.  "As B the B celebrates its third anniversary, it is expanding beyond Seoul to the global stage," said Hyunwoo Kim, CEO of the Seoul Business Agency. "By reaching advanced markets such as the United States and emerging ASEAN economies, we are creating a new distribution ecosystem where Seoul's beauty brands directly connect with global consumers. This is more than operating a space — it is a core strategy positioning Seoul as the world's K-beauty hub."
