# Secure Gated Luxury in Woodland Hills—Now Accepting Crypto

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nestled behind the guarded gates of Westchester County Estates, 4637 Westchester Drive offers nearly 4,900 square feet of refined living in one of Woodland Hills' most private and prestigious enclaves. Blending timeless Tudor architecture with modern luxury—and now the ability to purchase with cryptocurrency—this estate represents both classic elegance and future-ready innovation.  "Luxury today isn't just about square footage—it's about control, confidence, and future-proof ownership," said Rick Barraza, Global Real Estate Advisor with Sotheby's International Realty. "This property delivers all of that inside a community where privacy and prestige are non-negotiable."  Unmatched Privacy and Peace of Mind Set within a 24/7 guard-gated and patrolled community, 4637 Westchester Drive provides a level of security few homes in the area can match. Residents benefit from controlled access, on-site personnel, and community-wide surveillance.  Homes in gated communities experience up to 33% fewer property crimes than their non-gated counterparts—offering not just physical safety, but peace of mind that extends beyond the front door.  Whether you're raising a family or seeking a secure retreat from city life, Westchester County Estates delivers an elevated level of exclusivity, safety, and serenity rarely found in Los Angeles.  Thoughtful Layout for Modern Living This two-story home offers 5 bedrooms, thoughtfully laid out for both comfort and flexibility: Upstairs: 4 bedrooms, including 2 with en-suite bathrooms—one of which is the expansive primary suite with spa-style bath and three walk-in closets Downstairs: A dedicated office ideal for remote work, plus a maid's quarters with private bath and direct access to the lush backyard  With soaring ceilings, formal entertaining areas, and a chef's kitchen equipped with Viking and Sub-Zero appliances, the home is equally suited for quiet evenings or lively gatherings.  The backyard retreat features a tranquil rock waterfall, gazebo, and mature landscaping that adds both privacy and ambiance—perfect for outdoor entertaining or unwinding in nature.  Crypto-Forward Flexibility In a forward-thinking move, the seller is open to accepting cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, etc.), making this home one of the only guard-gated estates in Los Angeles offering such purchasing flexibility.  "We're seeing increased demand from global buyers and tech-forward investors seeking tangible, secure assets," said Barraza. "Being able to transact in crypto opens doors to a new generation of ownership."
