# Summit Restoration Founder Prepares to Launch National Franchising Model

CORAL GABLES, FL, July 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Summit Restoration, one of Florida's fastest-growing property restoration companies, is preparing to expand its reach nationwide through a bold new franchising model, announced today by founder and CEO Raymond Tahhan.  Founded in 2023, Summit Restoration has rapidly gained a reputation for delivering fast, high-quality water damage and mold remediation services throughout Florida. After restoring over 2,000 homes and commercial properties in under two years and launching successful satellite offices in cities like Tampa and Orlando, the company recently tested its model in California — with the same success.  Now, Tahhan is ready to take the next step: launching a franchise model designed to empower other entrepreneurs across the country.  "We started Summit with no investors, no background in restoration — just grit, structure, and a real commitment to taking care of people," said Tahhan. "Now it's time to help others do the same. If you've got drive and heart, we'll show you how to build something real — not just restore homes, but create opportunity in your community."  The Summit franchise program will offer:  Full training in sales, operations, and claim management  Proprietary tech tools using AI for faster claims, automated workflows, and market intelligence  Personalized franchisee support from headquarters, not just a generic corporate hotline  Flexible models for local restoration teams or sales-only operations  Summit's AI-driven platform gives franchisees a competitive advantage by speeding up the inspection-to-claim process, improving lead quality, and reducing administrative overhead — all key pain points for small restoration businesses.  Unlike large corporate franchise chains, Summit promises hands-on support from a leadership team that was in the field just two years ago.  "We're not some out-of-touch corporation," added Tahhan. "We remember what it's like to grind for every job, to juggle leads and invoices, to build trust one homeowner at a time. That's why our franchisees will get real mentorship, not a binder and a hotline."  The company will begin pre-qualifying its first round of franchisees in Q4 of 2025, focusing initially on the Southeast, Gulf Coast, and select Western states.
