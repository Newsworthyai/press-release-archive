# Allen Brooks Is Back With A Fresh Take On A Rock Classic!

KANSAS CITY, MO, July 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Allen Brooks, a rock musician from Kansas City, Missouri, is back with a fresh take on a classic. His latest single is an acoustic remake of "Changes" by Black Sabbath. This version highlights the emotional power of the original song in a whole new light. Stripped down to its core elements, Allen's interpretation proves that sometimes less really is more. When you have honest lyrics, a melody that stands the test of time, and a performer who puts his heart into every note, the result is something that connects deeply with listeners.   For this new release, Allen teamed up with Keith Maples. The two played together years ago in Bishop Steel, and this project marks their first time collaborating again in many years. Keith brings his own style to the acoustic version of "Changes," adding to the heartfelt energy of the track. The song is available now on all major platforms, with the mechanical rights secured through the Harry Fox Agency. The music video for the track is already live on Allen's YouTube channel.   What makes this release stand out is its simplicity. The acoustic setting puts the focus squarely on the raw beauty of the melody and the honest, reflective lyrics. Without heavy production or big arrangements, Allen lets the song breathe. The passion in his voice shines through, showing his dedication to his craft and his respect for the original. This is more than just a cover. It is a personal and powerful tribute to a timeless piece of music, showing that great songs don't need to be dressed up to make an impact. Sometimes, the most moving performances come from just a voice, a guitar, and a genuine love for the art.   In addition to his successful music career, Allen Brooks also has extensive experience in multimedia. He graduated from The New York Film Academy in 2010, where he connected with influential figures in the film industry. These relationships allowed him to collaborate with talented professionals, leading him to explore various creative outlets. Over the years, Allen directed TV commercials, music videos, animations, and documentaries, showcasing his diverse skills beyond music performance. One of his recent major projects is the professional music video for his song "Dreams of Make Believe." Initially, Allen hired a company to produce the video back in 2023. Unfortunately, after months of hard work, the final results did not meet his expectations. With a clear vision and strong background in multimedia, Allen decided to shift gears. He fired the initial team and started fresh, bringing on board experts he knew would deliver the quality he envisioned. He eventually connected with a company called 4R2T, founded by an industry expert he met during his time at the Film Academy. This new collaboration proved to be exactly what Allen needed. 4R2T specializes in visual effects and CGI, often working on major motion pictures. Their expertise elevated the "Dreams of Make Believe" video to a professional and visually striking level, far surpassing the original concept. This successful partnership with 4R2T also extended to the music video for "Changes." Leveraging advanced visual effects software designed specifically by 4R2T, the videos now stand out as polished, professional pieces that reflect Allen's artistic vision. He openly expresses gratitude toward his collaborators, highlighting how their combined skills created an outcome he could not have achieved alone. Allen describes the experience as exciting and educational, emphasizing the value of collaboration with talented individuals who share his passion.  Allen Brooks continues to blend his musical journey with his multimedia interests seamlessly. His artistic dedication is evident in everything he produces, from music videos and animations to his powerful tracks. Each project reinforces his philosophy of authenticity and simplicity, proving that genuine emotion and passion are always at the core of great music.
