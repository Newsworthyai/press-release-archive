# FleetNow Releases 2025 Construction Equipment Trends Based on Mid-Year Buyer Demand

CLEVELAND, OH, July 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- FleetNow, an online marketplace for heavy equipment, has released its mid-year analysis of contractor demand across North America. Based on internal sales inquiry data from January through June, the report reveals notable shifts in equipment interest and buyer urgency.  Top Categories Holding Strong Boom lifts, scissor lifts, and telehandlers maintained the top three spots by lead count. However, demand for compact machines surged. Runabouts entered the top 10 with more than double the inquiries.  High Demand Per Unit While aerial equipment garners high overall interest, mini excavators and excavators are generating the most leads per listing—indicating tighter inventory and more serious buyers.  Advice for Buyers  Act early on boom lifts, scissor lifts, and telehandlers—clean, low-hour machines are moving quickly.  Compact machines like mini excavators are in high demand—delays may mean fewer choices or higher prices.  Be flexible on brand, hours, or specs to stay competitive in a tight market.  "Boom lifts, scissors, and telehandlers are always in demand. I recommend buying from a reputable rental yard or dealer—they're more likely to have fleet-maintained equipment with inspection records," said Jill Lackey, Marketing Manager at FleetNow.  Tips for Sellers  List online and often. Multiple platforms boost exposure.  Complete your listings with photos, inspections, and maintenance history.  Highlight compact equipment—especially mini excavators and skid steers.  Include mid-tier gear like trailers, wheel loaders, and towables—interest is growing.
