Excitingly, the K100 series launched on NAVEE's official website on October 9, 2025, starting at just $249.99. Centered on the core concept of "Connecting Childlike Curiosity with Smart Mobility, Safely Exploring Endless Fun," this series breaks through the functional limitations of traditional children's transportation tools. Deeply integrating stringent safety standards, innovative smart technology, and playful designs, it creates a dedicated "safe exploration companion" for children aged 6 to 14.  Smart DNA Infused: Tech-Powered Mobility, Understanding Kids and Parents Better  Smart NAVEE APP Control The K100 series of electric scooters feature seamless integration with the NAVEE app, allowing parents and children to easily and safely control the scooter and unlock more personalized features. These include, but are not limited to:  Customizable speed limit: Parents can adjust the maximum speed based on their child's age and riding skill level through the app. Speed limits can also be adjusted flexibly based on local driving conditions.

Apple Find My Integration The NAVEE K100 MAX electric scooter in the K100 series also supports Apple's "Find My" feature, enabling real-time tracking of the scooter's location and riding route. Parents can set safe riding zones to ensure children stay within designated areas. If your child strays outside the designated safe zone, you'll receive an immediate alert. This smart protection design allows parents to view their child's travel history anytime, providing peace of mind for both parties.  Intelligent Voice Assistant The K100 MAX kids' electric scooter also features an intelligent voice assistant that provides instant voice prompts, real-time updates, and safety reminders, keeping young riders informed and minimizing distractions.

Kid's Fun First: Turn Every Ride into a Happy Adventure  Built-in Bluetooth Speaker The K100 MAX kids' electric scooter features a Bluetooth speaker behind its display. By connecting to playback devices via Bluetooth, children can listen to their favorite music while riding, turning every outing into a mini mobile party.  Digital Pet Companion Inside the App The NAVEE APP also offers a cloud-based virtual pet feature specially designed for children, enriching their experience.  Colorful Design The scooter's exterior features vibrant, warm gradient colors. The bright orange and innocent sky blue are coated with non-toxic, scratch-resistant, eco-friendly paint. This dopamine-boosting color scheme ensures your child stands out on every journey.  RGB Ambient Light The scooter deck features side ambient lights with 256 RGB color variations that automatically change colors and rhythms based on the child's riding speed, keeping their journey full of energy.  4-inch LED Display The 4-inch LED screen displays speed, mode, battery level, and fun weather icons.

Weighing just 21 pounds, it's lightweight and easily fits into a car trunk or closet. Perfect for travel, storage, or carrying on the go.  Grows with Your Child's Needs Designed to grow with your child, the K100 Max and K100 Pro doesn't need to be replaced every year.

Safety Handbrake Design with 5% Gradeability The vehicle features a child-friendly drum brake system, making braking easy and safe for children. Furthermore, the thoughtfully designed brake levers (thermoplastic rubber handlebar grips) are ideal for small hands—they are easily accessible and require just the right amount of pressure to activate the brakes.

Three Riding Modes for Safe NAVEE K100 series Kids Electric Scooters include E (power-assist), D (steady cruise), and S (sport mode, which up to 12.4 mph) so parents can match speed to a child's confidence.   Trusted Quality: 7" Hollow Tires and IPX4 Water-resistance  The 7" maintenance-free hollow tires are fully puncture-proof.
