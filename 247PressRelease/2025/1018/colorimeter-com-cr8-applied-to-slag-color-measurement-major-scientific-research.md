# colorimeter.com CR8 Applied to Slag Color Measurement - Major Scientific Research

GUANGZHOU, CHINA, October 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Recently, Threenh Technology jointly released a major scientific research achievement with Peking University. On September 4, 2025, Threenh Technology (colorimeter.com) collaborated with the team from University of Science and Technology Beijing (State Key Laboratory of Advanced Metallurgy) and Beijing University of Science and Technology (Institute of Intelligent Aging) to publish a significant paper titled Synthesis and characterization of refining slag: From industrial waste to eco-friendly pigments in the journal Ceramics International.  This research achievement marks a major breakthrough in the field of environmental protection. By accurately measuring slag color data to analyze the relationship between its composition, temperature, and color, the research data shows that different colored pigments can be obtained by precisely controlling the basicity and firing temperature of slag. This provides a scientific basis for using slag as a raw material for pigment production, representing another major breakthrough in the environmental protection field and promising significant contributions to global environmental efforts.  For the analysis of color changes in slag samples under various ba- sicity and temperature conditions, this study utilized a CR8 spectrocolorimeter from colorimeter.com, in combination with the TS70 series colorimeters of verticar multifunctional modules, as shown in Fig,2.The spectrocolorimeter is based on the D/8 geometry, which entails diffuse illumination and 8° directional reception. It utilizes high-precision spectroscopic technology coupled with a full-spectrum LED light source, allowing for accurate measurement of the spectral reflectance of samples across the wave. length range of 400-700 nm.From these measurements, the colori- metric values (such as L.*, a*, b*) of the samples can be calculated. The observation light source is the D65 standard illuminant,with an observer angle of 10°, ensuring the consistency of the measurement results with human visual perception. The TS70 series of vertical multifunctional components, by mounting the instrument inverted, in conjunction with a light shield and a culture dish, ensures the stability of the light path and the uniformity of the samples during the measurement process. The slag samples were mechanically crushed and sieved to a size range of 0.425 mm-0.6 mm, and placed in a culture dish for spectral reflectance measurement using the instrument, with the chromaticity values and color difference values recorded. This method offers several advantages, including high-precision measurement, multifunctionality, convenience, and strong adaptability to various environments. It efficiently acquires experimental data and provides reliable technical support for an in-depth investigation into the mechanisms by which alkalinity and temperature affect the color of slag samples.  As a global leader in precision color measurement solutions, 3nh is pioneering a new era of sustainability with its CR8 Spectrocolorimeter—turning ore slag, a longstanding industrial waste challenge, into commercially viable, value-added pigments. This breakthrough not only showcases the power of advanced color testing but also aligns industrial innovation with environmental protection, setting a new standard for waste reuse.  Turning Industrial Waste into Valuable Resources Ore slag, an inevitable byproduct of steel, copper, and magnesium refining, has long plagued industries with its massive volume, environmental risks, and limited reuse options. Traditional slag recycling methods are energy-intensive, generating additional waste and relying on complex high-temperature processes to mix slag with cement—offering little in terms of value creation.  Now, new research is redefining slag's potential: by adjusting its mineral composition, adding targeted additives, and optimizing processing conditions, ore slag can be transformed into pigments spanning a rich color spectrum—from reddish yellow to bluish green. Unlike conventional colorants, which rely on resource-heavy mining, these slag-based pigments are a sustainable alternative that reduces reliance on virgin materials.  The CR8 Spectrocolorimeter: The Key to Color Accuracy & Viability For slag-based pigments to succeed commercially, color accuracy and batch consistency are non-negotiable—and the 3nh CR8 Spectrocolorimeter is engineered to deliver exactly that. Its specialized features are tailored to address the unique demands of slag pigment analysis: • D8 Geometry: Adheres to international standards with diffuse illumination and 8° directional viewing, ensuring consistent measurement across samples. • Full-Spectrum LED Technology: Provides stable light output across the 400–700 nm visible spectrum, eliminating light fluctuations that skew results. • High-Precision L, a, b Detection*: Captures ultra-fine color variations, enabling accurate classification of pigments and ensuring they meet commercial color standards. • User-Friendly Vertical Module: Designed for easy testing of powders and irregular slag samples, simplifying workflow for researchers and technicians. • D65 Illuminant Calibration: Matches human visual perception, ensuring pigment colors perform as expected in real-world applications (e.g., coatings, ceramics).  These features enable rigorous colorimetric analysis of slag pigments, linking critical processing factors—slag composition, firing temperature, particle size, and cooling method—to pigment quality. Without this precision, achieving consistent, market-ready pigments would be impossible.  Key Research Findings: Unlocking Slag Pigment Potential with CR8 Using the CR8 Spectrocolorimeter, researchers conducted in-depth analysis of slag samples with varying basicity (a measure of chemical composition) and firing temperatures, uncovering critical insights that guide pigment production:  1.Basicity Drives Color: Slag with lower basicity (_0.39) produces reddish yellow pigments but causes more crucible erosion during processing. In contrast, higher basicity slag shifts to a bluish green hue due to changes in its mineral phase.  2.Temperature Controls Brightness: Firing temperature directly impacts pigment lightness (L* value). Slag fired at 1100 °C yields lighter pigments compared to those processed at 1000 °C or 1200 °C.  By correlating processing conditions to pigment properties with precise, consistent data, the CR8 not only validates the research's credibility but also paves the way for large-scale industrial production of slag-based pigments.  Beyond Pigments: CR8's Role in Quality Assurance & Sustainability The CR8's impact extends beyond color measurement. Its ability to analyze slag color also provides valuable diagnostic insights: color variations can indicate changes in microstructure, erosion patterns, or the formation of new crystalline phases—critical for quality assurance and understanding material behavior. This makes the CR8 an indispensable tool for both research labs and large-scale manufacturing facilities.  By enabling slag-to-pigment recycling, the CR8 contributes to three core sustainability goals: • Reducing landfill waste by repurposing slag that would otherwise be discarded. • Minimizing the environmental footprint of colorant production by replacing mined materials with waste. • Powering the creation of eco-friendly products, from green ceramics and coatings to decorative materials.  Looking Ahead: Expanding the Boundaries of Slag Innovation The 3nh CR8 is just the beginning of slag's transformation. While its current focus is on pigment production, future applications could extend further—using color analysis to forecast material stability, corrosion resistance, and other industrial properties. This would open new doors for slag in high-performance applications, from construction materials to advanced composites.  "A reliable color measurement tool like the CR8 is changing how industries view metallurgical byproducts," says a 3nh representative. "It's not just about recycling waste—it's about creating new market value, reducing environmental impact, and reimagining what industrial waste can be." learn more https://www.threenh.com/Product_News/3nh-CR8-Ore-Slag-Color-Testing.html  With over 20 years of expertise in color measurement, 3nh is a trusted provider of spectrophotometers, colorimeters, and imaging solutions.
