# Exner Turbidity and Solids Sensors Receive 3A and EHEDG Hygienic Certifications

AUBURN, CA, July 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- South Fork Instruments announces that Exner turbidity and solids concentration sensors have received both 3A Sanitary Standards and European Hygienic Engineering & Design Group (EHEDG) certifications. These certifications validate the sensors' compliance with the most stringent hygienic design requirements for food and beverage processing applications.  The dual certifications address the growing demand for process monitoring instrumentation that can maintain product safety while providing accurate measurement data in sanitary environments. Food and beverage manufacturers, particularly breweries, require sensors that can withstand aggressive Clean-in-Place (CIP) cycles while preventing contamination risks.  "Achieving both 3A and EHEDG certifications represents a significant milestone for our customers in the food and beverage industry," said John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments. "These certifications validate that Exner sensors meet the highest standards for hygienic design, allowing our customers to implement real-time process monitoring without compromising their sanitary requirements."  The certified Exner sensors feature electropolished 316L stainless steel construction with surface finishes below 0.8 μm Ra, preventing bacterial adhesion. Key design features include:  - Complete drainability to eliminate contamination harboring points - Temperature range from 0-90°C for production and CIP operations - Chemical resistance to standard cleaning and sanitizing compounds - Factory calibration with solid-state reference standards  Applications include brewing wort clarification and filtration monitoring, dairy processing quality control, and pharmaceutical sterile manufacturing. The certifications enable manufacturers to implement continuous turbidity monitoring without creating contamination risks or compromising HACCP protocols.  Certified Exner turbidity and solids concentration sensors are available immediately through South Fork Instruments for customers across the Americas.
