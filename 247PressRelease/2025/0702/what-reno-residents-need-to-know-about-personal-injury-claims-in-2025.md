# What Reno Residents Need to Know About Personal Injury Claims in 2025

RENO, NV, July 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As personal injury incidents continue to impact Nevadans each year, residents of Reno face increasing complexity when navigating the legal landscape around injury claims. With changes in how insurance companies approach claims and growing concerns over fair treatment, understanding the current legal environment has become essential in 2025.  In Nevada, personal injury claims can stem from a wide range of incidentsâ€”car accidents, pedestrian injuries, slip-and-falls, and more. These claims typically involve compensation for medical expenses, lost income, and long-term physical or emotional hardship. Under Nevada law, claimants generally have two years from the date of injury to file a lawsuit, though early legal guidance can help preserve evidence and ensure procedural requirements are met.  While many injury cases are resolved through settlements, the process often begins with negotiations with insurance providers. Legal professionals caution that early offers from insurers may not always reflect the full extent of damages or long-term costs associated with an injury. In some instances, the actions of an insurance company, such as failing to investigate or acting in bad faith, may open the door to legal challenges beyond the original claim.  Recent developments have also highlighted how distinctions between standard claim disputes and insurance bad faith cases are increasingly relevant. In Nevada, legal practitioners who focus on bad faith litigation emphasize that their work does not involve filing claims directly but rather stepping in when insurers violate the terms of their policies or delay legitimate payments without cause.  Experts say that staying informed and seeking clarity about legal options early on can significantly influence the outcome of an injury case. Especially in situations where insurance conduct is questionable, knowing the difference between a simple claim and a bad faith dispute can change the legal strategy and the potential outcome.  Patrick Leverty, a respected attorney with Leverty & Associates Law, cautions injury victims against accepting early low-ball offers from insurance adjusters. "The financial impact of a personal injury is often not fully known until weeks or months later," Leverty explains. "We help ensure that injured individuals have a fair chance to recover what they're truly owed."
