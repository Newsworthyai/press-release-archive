# Pure Muscle, No Apologies: 1974 Ford Mustang II Drag Car Forms Part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, July 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Roaring out of the golden age of grassroots drag racing, this 1974 Ford Mustang II Drag Car is a bold and unapologetic tribute to pure American horsepower—and now a highlight of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. Originally acquired as a body-in-white shell in the mid-1970s, this Mustang was built for one purpose: speed.  Fitted with a 468ci Chevrolet big-block V8 in 1976, the car spent the late '70s and early '80s lighting up drag strips before being retired to storage for decades. The power plant features a Holley 1050 CFM carburetor, Edelbrock intake manifold, HVH carb spacer, Accel ignition, and open long-tube headers—an uncompromising combo for quarter-mile domination. Cooling is managed by an aluminum radiator with electric fan, while Moroso valve covers add classic race-ready flair . Power is delivered through a rugged Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission to a rear end housed within tubbed wheel wells, supported by a fully modified drag racing suspension. Braking is handled by front disc and rear drum brakes, ensuring the Mustang stops as strong as it storms. Outside, the Mustang still wears its 1980s-era white and orange livery, complete with sponsor graphics—a visual time capsule from racing's most unfiltered era. Staggered-width Centerline alloy wheels and a full roll cage underscore the car's authentic track heritage.  Inside, it's all business: a B&M floor shifter, fire extinguisher, toggle switch panel, and a two-spoke wheel facing a column-mounted AutoMeter tachometer. An aluminum dash insert houses water temp, oil pressure, and ammeter gauges.  "This drag car isn't just loud—it's legendary," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "You can feel the grit, the power, and the era it came from the moment you look at it."  Brash, brutal, and built for the strip, this 1974 Ford Mustang II Drag Car is a raw reminder of the horsepower wars that once ruled America's asphalt.
