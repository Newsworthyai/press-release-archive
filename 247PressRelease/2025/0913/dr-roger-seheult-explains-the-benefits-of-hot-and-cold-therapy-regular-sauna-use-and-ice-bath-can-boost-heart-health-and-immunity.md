# Dr. Roger Seheult Explains the Benefits of Hot and Cold Therapy- Regular Sauna Use and Ice Bath Can Boost Heart Health and Immunity

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, September 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Roger Seheult has highlighted the rising popularity of pairing heat with cold exposure, noting that ending a hot session with a short burst of cold — whether through an ice bath or a cold shower — delivers powerful benefits for both body and mind.  This contrast approach offers a wide range of advantages: it enhances circulation by alternating between vasodilation and vasoconstriction, accelerates recovery by flushing out metabolic waste, and strengthens the immune response through a process known as demargination. In addition, it helps lower inflammation, reduces pain, supports cardiovascular conditioning, and builds resilience by training the nervous system to adapt to stress.  Cold Plunging: An Ancient Practice with Modern Benefits  Cold plunging may be trending today, but its roots stretch back thousands of years. Across cultures, cold water has long been used for recovery, resilience, and even spiritual growth.  Ancient Traditions  Rome: Bathers moved from hot steam rooms to the frigidarium, a cold plunge pool believed to refresh circulation and energy.  Japan: Shinto misogi rituals involved cold rivers and waterfalls to purify body and spirit.  Nordic Countries: Saunas followed by icy lake plunges built strength, boosted immunity, and created social bonds — a tradition still alive today.  Russia: Banya steam sessions ended with snow rolls or ice dips, while Orthodox believers immersed in frozen rivers as acts of faith.  Indigenous Cultures: Cold immersion was part of rites of passage and healing, teaching clarity, humility, and respect for nature.  To make these benefits more accessible, Crocpad has developed its Ice Bath and Chiller system — a convenient solution designed for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and wellness seekers. The portable, durable tub delivers the perfect setup for cold immersion, while the high-performance chiller maintains consistent temperatures without the hassle of ice refills. With regular use, individuals can experience reduced muscle soreness, faster recovery, improved circulation, and greater mental resilience — all from the comfort of home.
