# International Leadership Expert Jeff Ogren Releases "Leading From Day One: The Essential Guide for New Supervisors" to Address Universal Workplace Challenge

ARLINGTON, VA, September 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The transition from individual contributor to supervisor represents one of the most challenging career moves professionals face, yet most organizations provide little to no leadership training for new managers. "Leading From Day One" addresses this critical gap with immediately applicable strategies based on real-world experience managing diverse teams across cultures and industries.  "New supervisors often feel overwhelmed and underprepared," said Ogren. "This playbook gives them the confidence and tools they need to become respected, effective leaders from day one."  The book provides step-by-step guidance for key challenges including building trust with former peers, setting clear expectations, handling difficult conversations, delegating effectively, and creating psychologically safe work environments. Each chapter combines research-backed principles with practical worksheets and reflection exercises that transform concepts into immediate action.  Ogren's approach reflects his experience as Deputy Director of Management Training at the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, where he developed leadership programs for professionals worldwide. His international career spans military service, diplomacy, and Peace Corps and living and working in eight countries.
