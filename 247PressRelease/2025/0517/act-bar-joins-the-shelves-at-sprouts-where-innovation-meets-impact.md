# Act Bar Joins the Shelves at Sprouts—Where Innovation Meets Impact

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Act Bar, the upcycled protein bar disrupting the snack aisle with purpose-driven innovation, is thrilled to announce its upcoming launch in Sprouts Farmers Market as part of their Innovation Program, beginning May 1st. Act Bars will be available at select Sprouts locations throughout Colorado and New Mexico, marking a major milestone for the growing brand.  "Saying we're excited would be an understatement," said Amelia Allen, founder of Act Bar. "Sprouts is a pioneer in health-forward retail, and their Innovation Program is the perfect home for a brand like ours that's committed to doing things differently—not just for our consumers, but for the planet and our communities."  Act Bar stands apart by crafting every bar with upcycled grains, an ingredient choice that helps fight food waste and saves three gallons of water per bar produced. But the impact doesn't stop there—every bar purchased also donates half a pound of fresh produce to a community in need through Act Bar's nonprofit partner, Brighter Bites.  With 12 grams of plant-based protein, clean ingredients, and bold flavor, Act Bar proves that snacks can be both powerful and purposeful.  As Amelia puts it, "We didn't just want to make another protein bar—we wanted to set a new standard. One where snacks can drive change: for sustainability, for hunger relief, and for how the industry shows up in the world. We're honored to share that mission with Sprouts and their shoppers."  Consumers can find Act Bars in the Innovation Set at Sprouts stores in Colorado and New Mexico starting May 1st.  Act Bar:  Act Bar is a purpose-driven protein bar redefining what it means to snack sustainably. Made with upcycled grains that help fight food waste and save three gallons of water per bar, Act Bar proves that better-for-you can also mean better for the planet. Every bar delivers 12 grams of plant-based protein and donates half a pound of fresh produce to a community in need through its nonprofit partner, Brighter Bites.
