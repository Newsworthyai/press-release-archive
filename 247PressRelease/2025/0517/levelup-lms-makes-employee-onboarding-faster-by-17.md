TORONTO, ON, May 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Levelup, one of the fastest-growing LMS platforms for corporate training, have recently released studies that found companies using their platform are able to onboard new employees at least 17% faster than others. The company has stated that the study is based on a survey conducted on more than 15 companies, which included both their existing clients as well as businesses using other LMS platforms and traditional 'classroom' based training.   The study included various parameters including 'time taken to complete orientation course', 'test scores on primary assessment', and several others. The company has stated that Levelup has fared considerably better than others in most parameters.   Speaking about the results of the study, Glorya Cornelius-Aldrin, Director of Marketing at Levelup, said "Our recent study reconfirms that Levelup remains one of the simplest and most effective LMS platforms for employee onboarding training, and corporate training in general."  Key Findings of the Study   One of the key findings of the study is companies who use Levelup as their employee onboarding LMS can complete their onboarding training 17% faster.   While companies using other LMS platforms reported to have completed their onboarding training in 50 hours on average, companies using Levelup were able to complete programs of the same length with 41.5 hours on average, which is around 17% quicker.   Apart from the time taken to complete the onboarding course, companies also reported that Levelup performed better than other LMS platforms included in the survey, on various other parameters as well.   Learner-Centric Features are Key to Its Success   Speaking about reasons behind the performance, Cornelius-Aldrin stated that the learner-centric features of Levelup are what gives it the edge over the rest. "At Levelup, it has always been our endeavor to make learning engaging for the corporate trainees. It's only when the trainees feel engaged with the courses, the organization can expect to achieve the desired goals."   The team at Levelup has claimed has the recent introduction of gamified learning has had a significant impact on boosting engagement levels. "With our new gamified learning features, trainees are feeling more engaged and motivated than ever. This helps organizations achieve a faster onboarding and ensure that people retain the information that they receive during their orientation," Cornelius-Aldrin said.   Apart from gamification, features like multimedia courses and flashcard courses have also been crucial in motivating their learners to complete their onboarding courses faster. While multimedia courses made it easier for them to grasp important concepts and policies more easily, Levelup's innovative flashcard courses made it easier for the trainees to revise key concepts and complete their assessments quickly.   Clients using Levelup also praised its features.
