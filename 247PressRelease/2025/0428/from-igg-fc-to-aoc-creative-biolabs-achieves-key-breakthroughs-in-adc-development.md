# From IgG FC to AOC: Creative Biolabs Achieves Key Breakthroughs in ADC Development

SHIRLEY, NY, April 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An innovation that combines precise targeting and efficient 'killing' is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), overcoming major ailments such as cancer. With experts in the field of ADC development, Creative Biolabs assists with full-chain solutions for biomedical research the world over.  During ADC development, Creative Biolabs has demonstrated significant innovation in engineering the Immunoglobulin G Fc (IgG Fc) region. As the most predominant antibody type in the human body, the structure and function of the Fc region are critically important in the efficacy of an ADC. "The glycosylation modification of the Fc region is a key factor affecting the binding efficiency of ADCs to cell receptors and mediating immune effects," pointed out an ADC development expert from Creative Biolabs. "By precisely regulating the glycosylation sites in the Fc region, we optimize the interaction between antibodies and complement proteins as well as Fc receptors, significantly enhancing the targeted killing ability and stability of ADCs."   Relying on its advanced glycosylation engineering technology platform, the company has successfully developed several IgG Fc modification products with excellent performance, providing solid support for the clinical transformation of ADC drugs. Representative model ADCs, including protein A-MMAF ADC and Fc-targeted constructs, have been developed for internal validation of glycoengineering strategies and drug conjugation performance.  The development of bispecific ADCs targeting two non-overlapping epitopes on the same or different receptors is a new key invention of Creative Biolabs. Facing the challenges of balancing efficacy and safety in traditional ADCs, bispecific ADCs open up an innovative treatment path by acting on two targets simultaneously. There are currently 17 approved ADCs available for marketing globally alongside over 100 in different phases of R&D in an increasingly competitive landscape of ADC development.  Creative Biolabs offers a fully integrated development service that covers the entire process from target screening and antibody design to drug conjugation. "We design dual complementary epitope structures targeting key cancer markers such as HER2 and EGFR, enabling ADCs to be more efficiently internalized by tumor cells and precisely release cytotoxic drugs," the expert introduced. The company provides the development of the following products: • c-MET-targeted Bispecific ADC • HER2-targeted Bispecific ADC • EGFR-targeted Bispecific ADC • CD38-targeted Bispecific ADC  When combining the specificity of antibodies and the gene-targeting capabilities of oligonucleotides, Creative Biolabs shines in the development of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOC). For instance, using DNA-PAINT imaging technology, AOCs label intracellular molecules for super-resolution imaging, which serves as an invaluable tool in elucidating disease mechanisms.   "The development of AOCs requires sophisticated conjugation technology and strict quality control," an expert stressed. "Our unique linker design and self-developed conjugation process allow for efficient loading and precise release of oligonucleotides without compromising antibody functionality. Currently, we provide custom AOC development services to over 50 global research institutions, aiding numerous leading-edge research projects with achieving breakthroughs."
