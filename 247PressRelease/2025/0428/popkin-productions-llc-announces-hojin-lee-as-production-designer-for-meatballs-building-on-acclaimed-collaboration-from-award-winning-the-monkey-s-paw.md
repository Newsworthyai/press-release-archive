BOCA RATON, FL, April 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Popkin Productions, LLC, the rising force in genre filmmaking and cinematic storytelling, is proud to announce the appointment of Hojin Lee as Production Designer for its upcoming feature film, Meatballs. This collaboration reunites Lee with founder, producer, and director Benjamin T. Popkin, following their celebrated work on The Monkey's Paw—the 2024 short horror film that won Best Horror Film at the Follywood Film Festival and was an official selection at both Shockfest and the New York International Film Awards.  A Legacy of Distinction in Independent Film Popkin Productions, led by award-winning filmmaker Benjamin T. Popkin, has quickly built a reputation for bold, visually driven storytelling. The company's standout project, The Monkey's Paw, received an impressive 8.9/10 IMDb rating and was praised for its suspenseful tone, meticulous production design, and inventive use of limited resources. The film's festival run included recognition at the Follywood Film Festival—known for spotlighting innovative and unconventional cinema—and Shockfest, a leading showcase for genre-defying horror and thriller films.  "I'm excited to work with Hojin Lee again. I trust her creative vision and aesthetic instincts completely. We've worked on several films together, and every time, her work elevates the story beyond expectation. She's my first choice when it comes to production design," said Benjamin T. Popkin, Founder of Popkin Productions.  About "Meatballs" Meatballs is a slow-burning body horror feature that follows two roommates as they experience grotesque physical transformations after exposure to a bioweapon. The film's claustrophobic, decaying apartment setting evolves in tandem with the characters' psychological and physical deterioration, demanding a production designer with both technical skill and a deep understanding of visual narrative.  Hojin Lee's Role and Creative Approach As Production Designer, Hojin Lee will: - Design and execute the apartment's transformation from everyday realism to disturbing, organic decay. - Collaborate closely with practical effects, makeup, and cinematography teams to synchronize set evolution with character arcs. - Fabricate and source key horror props, from mutated medical gear to contaminated food and biohazard elements. - Provide on-set adjustments to maximize tension through texture, lighting, and spatial manipulation.  Lee was chosen for her proven ability to create stylized horror environments on tight budgets and schedules. Her work on The Monkey's Paw was widely praised for building a disturbing, visually rich world that elevated the film's impact.  "This project pushed me to explore decay as a visual language. There's something deeply poetic and terrifying about watching a familiar space disintegrate along with its characters—and designing that arc in real time was creatively thrilling," said Hojin Lee.
