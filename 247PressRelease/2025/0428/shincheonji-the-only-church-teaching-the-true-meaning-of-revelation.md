# Shincheonji: The Only Church Teaching the True Meaning of Revelation

ATLANTA, GA, April 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Book of Revelation warns that anyone who adds to or takes away from its words will not enter heaven (Revelation 22:18–19). In today's world, where interpretations of Revelation vary widely, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, stands out as the only church where every believer is taught to fully understand the Book of Revelation.  Shincheonji requires all members to pass a graduation exam after completing intensive biblical education through the Zion Christian Mission Center. This education includes elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels, ensuring that members are deeply grounded in the Bible before becoming part of the church. Shincheonji has famously celebrated graduation ceremonies with over 100,000 students on four separate occasions, demonstrating the growing number of believers who are choosing to pursue a deeper knowledge of Scripture.  Chairman Man-Hee Lee, during his church visits across the nation, frequently reminds believers of the critical importance of Revelation 22:18–19. "One must not add to or take away from Revelation," he emphasizes. "Those who do will not enter heaven." He encourages believers to engrave the words of Revelation onto their hearts and minds, stressing the need for accurate understanding and faithful adherence to God's word.  In line with this message, Shincheonji's Education Department administers the "Seal of God Confirmation Test" to all members worldwide. Originally launched online during the COVID-19 pandemic, the test is now conducted in person at local churches. Its goal is for every member to become a "walking Bible," someone who knows and lives by the Word.  According to church representatives, the true meaning and fulfillment of Revelation can only be understood through the testimony of someone who has seen and heard the actual fulfillment take place. They claim that because most Christian leaders and believers have neither witnessed nor properly understood the fulfillment, they have unknowingly altered Revelation and thus violated its command. "Aside from Shincheonji believers, not one person in the global Christian community has kept Revelation intact," a representative stated.  The representative further explained that although Shincheonji is often labeled heretical by Catholic and Protestant denominations, it is the only church whose members truly understand Revelation. "Mainstream churches, including pastors and members, have distorted Revelation. Who, then, is truly orthodox, and who is truly heretical? Let the Bible itself be the judge."  The weekly Seal of God test covers the four Gospels and the entire Book of Revelation. It is not simply an academic exercise, but training to engrain God's word into the heart and uphold the New Covenant. From January to April of this year, the average test score among Shincheonji members was 99 points, with a participation rate of 97% and a 99.9% pass rate above 90 points—showing the high level of dedication and scriptural awareness among the congregation.  Church representatives also commented that many Christians today neither know nor pay attention to the prophecies of the Gospels or Revelation, yet are quick to label Shincheonji heretical. When asked to explain their accusations using the Bible, they often cannot provide a clear answer—mirroring the situation during Jesus' first coming.  Several former pastors who joined Shincheonji have openly testified about their experiences. One former pastor said, "Shincheonji teaches the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. Many of the members here knew the Bible better than I did as a pastor. I had to start my faith over from the beginning." Another, Pastor Choi, shared, "Although I used to preach the Bible, coming to Shincheonji showed me how little I actually understood. Churches should allow their congregations to hear Shincheonji's teachings for themselves before making any judgments."  Pastor Choi added, "It's negligence not to teach the Bible properly. Christian leaders should listen to these messages so that everyone can learn about God's final work."  In a time when confusion about Revelation abounds, Shincheonji offers a clear and urgent message: just as a thirsty person searches for water, believers seeking truth are gathering where God's word is being fulfilled. Now is the time for believers around the world to discern truth from falsehood through the New Testament and the Book of Revelation.  Related Link: http://scjus.org
