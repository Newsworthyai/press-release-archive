# Interventional radiologist Doctor Amanda Steinberger now a three-time Castle Connolly Top Doctor

LA JOLLA, CA, March 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Amanda L. Steinberger, DO, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, the third year she has received the esteemed Top Doctor designation. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen each year as Castle Connolly Top Doctors for their specialties in their regions.  An interventional radiologist who specializes in venous medicine, Dr. Steinberger is with La Jolla Vein & Vascular, a premier practice that delivers the most advanced minimally invasive vein care available.  Dr. Steinberger is an interventional radiologist, board-certified by the American Board of Radiology in interventional radiology and diagnostic radiology. She is also certified by the American Board of Venous & Lymphatic Medicine.  She focuses primarily on evaluating and treating superficial vein disease, which includes conditions such as varicose veins, venous reflux/insufficiency, spider veins, and venous thrombosis (blood clots in veins).   Recognized for both her skill in managing complex cases and her bedside manner, Dr. Steinberger says she is committed to providing safe, top-quality, comprehensive care.   "I am dedicated to achieving the best possible outcomes for my patients, and over the past year we've expanded our list of advanced vein treatments that allow me to do that," she says.  Dr. Steinberger performs all available minimally invasive procedures including thermal ablation, sclerotherapy, microphlebectomy, cosmetic laser, and now Cryo-laser and Cryo-sclerotherapy (CLaCS) treatment. The practice also boasts an accredited vascular ultrasound laboratory on site.  "CLaCs combines cosmetic sclerotherapy, which is the 'gold standard' in cosmetic treatment, with a laser to enhance results with less pain. We are the only facility in San Diego to offer this advanced technique for patients," Dr. Steinberger says.  The minimally invasive nature of the procedures Dr. Steinberger performs means that patients enjoy quicker recoveries compared to the more invasive surgical procedures that were offered in the past.  Dr. Steinberger earned her medical degree at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. She completed her internship and a four-year diagnostic radiology residency at Mercy Catholic Medical Center, serving as chief resident during her final year.  She completed a fellowship in vascular and interventional radiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Steinberger is co-authoring a chapter in the upcoming third edition of The Vein Book, 	one of the leading resources in venous and lymphatic medicine.  "Receiving this honor for the third year in a row means a lot to me," Dr. Steinberger says. "It shows that I am very active in the venous medicine community and am constantly networking with colleagues across the world to improve patient care."  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.
