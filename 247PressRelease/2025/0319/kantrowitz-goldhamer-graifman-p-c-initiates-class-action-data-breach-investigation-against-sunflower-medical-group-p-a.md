# Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C., Initiates Class-Action Data Breach Investigation Against Sunflower Medical Group, P.A.

KANSAS CITY, KS, March 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On January 7, 2025, Sunflower Medical Group, or "Sunflower," identified suspicious activity on the network connecting its four care centers. This activity spurred the healthcare corporation to enlist the services of a third-party forensic cyber investigator. The investigation confirmed Sunflower's suspicions of a foreign, malicious agent in the network.   Sunflower Medical Group is a Kansas-based medical group that specializes in internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology. Its offices are located in Kansas City, Lenexa, and Roeland Park.   The incursion wasn't spotted in time to prevent the theft of personal data from nearly all of Sunflower's patients. The forensic analyst estimated that it began on December 15, 2024, and maintained access until January 7, 2025.  The sensitive data that was stolen in this cyber attack includes: - Full names - Addresses - Social Security numbers - Driver's license numbers - Dates of birth - Health insurance information - Medical information  On March 7, 2025, Sunflower notified the Maine Attorney General that the above sensitive information had been compromised. It has since notified all patients who could have been potentially affected.
