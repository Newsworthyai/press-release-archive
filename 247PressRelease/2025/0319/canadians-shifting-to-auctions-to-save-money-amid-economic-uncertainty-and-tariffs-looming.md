# Canadians Shifting to Auctions to Save Money Amid Economic Uncertainty and Tariffs Looming

VANCOUVER, BC, March 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Many Canadians are turning to auctions to get the best deal on everything from furniture to food," says Jeff Schwarz, owner of DirectAuctions.ca and widely known as The Liquidator. "It's a big trend upwards as you can get the same items for cents on the dollar. For example, we have an upcoming $4M Moe's retail furniture auction. There is no reserve, meaning no set price. If a sofa goes for $50.00, it goes for $50.00! It too is a great way to buy Canadian products and buy within Canada to save on impending tariffs".  With retail markups making everyday purchases increasingly difficult for the average Canadian, auctions offer a high-value alternative. Unlike traditional stores, where prices are set by retailers, auctions allow consumers to dictate the price, often resulting in savings of 50-90% off retail prices.  The best part is convenience. Bidding is done online and you can place your maximum bet and walk away or you can bid live online when the auction is running. Items can be shipped anywhere in Canada so it too makes buying very convenient.  Beyond personal savings, auctions have also opened the door to new business opportunities. Many Canadians are buying items at auction and reselling them for a profit, whether through online marketplaces, flea markets, or local businesses.  Key benefits of buying at auction: Drastic Savings – Items often sell for a fraction of their retail value. No Retail Markups – Pay what you bid, not inflated store prices. Unique, High-Quality Inventory – Access to premium brands at unbeatable deals. Sustainability – Reducing waste by purchasing overstock and liquidated goods.  Upcoming $4M Moe's Furniture Auction – Open to All Canadians  For those looking to experience the power of auctions firsthand, DirectAuctions.ca is hosting a major Moe's furniture auction, featuring over $4 million in retail value with no reserves.
