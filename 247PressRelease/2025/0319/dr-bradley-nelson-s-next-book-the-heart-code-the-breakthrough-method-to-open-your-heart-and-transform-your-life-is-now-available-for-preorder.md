ST. GEORGE, UT, March 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Bradley Nelson's upcoming book, "The Heart Code: The Breakthrough Method to Open Your Heart and Transform Your Life," will be published Dec. 2 and is now available for preorder.  A veteran holistic physician and bestselling author of "The Emotion Code" and "The Body Code," Dr. Brad has trained and certified ~ 15,000 practitioners in 80 countries. These practitioners have learned to identify and release Trapped Emotions that can negatively impact health and relationships. He also uncovered what many consider a groundbreaking discovery in energy medicine — the Heart-Wall™, an energetic barrier made up of Trapped Emotions that can hinder people from fully giving and receiving love, often leading to feelings of loneliness, sadness, and emotional isolation.  Honing in on a central concept of "The Emotion Code," Dr. Nelson presents an expanded, deeper look at Heart-Walls in his next book. Based on the tens of thousands of stories that readers and patients shared with Dr. Nelson, "The Heart Code" offers an in-depth exploration into the mechanisms of Heart-Walls and practical guidance toward ultimately breaking down these barriers around our hearts.  In "The Heart Code," readers will gain the tools necessary to identify and release these emotional walls that prevent us from experiencing true fulfillment in every aspect of our lives: physical, emotional, spiritual, financial, and romantic.  With a compassionate, empowering, and prescriptive approach, "The Heart Code" takes readers on a journey of self-discovery and healing, helping unlock the full potential of your heart and enabling you to live life with greater authenticity, joy, and abundance.
