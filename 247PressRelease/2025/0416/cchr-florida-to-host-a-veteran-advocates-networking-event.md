# CCHR Florida to Host a Veteran Advocates Networking Event

CLEARWATER, FL, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Saturday, April 26th, an event designed to increase veteran advocacy will be held at the headquarters for CCHR Florida located in downtown Clearwater.   CCHR regularly holds seminars on topics covering the mental health rights of veterans as well as the dangers of psychiatric drugs often prescribed to those who seek help.  "Veterans can have special needs due to unique experiences and exposure to traumatic events," states Diane Stein, president of CCHR in Florida. "Many of them also face an uncertain return to civilian life. This sometimes leads to drug abuse, pain or loneliness after discharge from the military. It is estimated that one in ten veterans suffers from some sort of substance abuse which is higher than the general public."  According to an article published by the USO, "in 2021, research found that 30,177 active-duty personnel and veterans who served in the military after 9/11 have died by suicide - compared to the 7,057 service members killed in combat in those same 20 years."  How could it be that more than four times more veterans and soldiers have killed themselves, than soldiers that were killed in action? Is there a hidden influence that could have contributed to this terrible reality?  "Psychiatric treatment is the hidden influence," says Stein. "For years psychiatrists have been infiltrating the military with their various diagnoses and psychotropic drugs."  While a direct correlation cannot be made to account for all the suicides, it can be said that the "normal treatment" using psychiatric drugs has not helped the veterans and soldiers who are suffering.  "There are solutions that don't involve unproven and dangerous psychotropic drugs," states Stein. "But these alternative treatments don't generally have an abundance of advertising dollars backing them like the pharmaceutical industry. The psychotropic drug industry is one of the most lucrative in the world. For example, the global antipsychotic drugs market is projected to grow from $15.50 billion in 2022 to $24.74 billion by 2029. Advertising dollars for psychotropic drugs tend to drown out the voices of non-drug alternative treatments."  In addition to being an excellent opportunity to network and unite with fellow veteran advocates in the community, the event hopes to better educate veteran advocates on the dangers of the psychiatric drugs prescribed and to encourage people looking for help to seek out non-drug approaches for mental wellness.  "The men and women who serve our country deserve the best of care and the most accurate information available. CCHR is here to help educate veterans about the unseen dangers of prescription drugs for PTSD and suicide prevention," states Susan Devlin, CCHR FL, Community Education Director. "There are other options and people who want to help, many are vets themselves. And we are here to facilitate that help."  Please join CCHR on Saturday, April 26th from 5:00pm to 7:00pm for a discussion on mental health human rights. To reserve a seat please call 800-782-2878 or sign up online.  About CCHR: Initially established by the Church of Scientology and renowned psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz in 1969, CCHR's mission is to eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health. The Florida chapter of CCHR is an award-winning nonprofit in the area of mental health human rights and government relations. L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, first brought psychiatric imprisonment to wide public notice: "Thousands and thousands are seized without process of law, every week, over the 'free world' tortured, castrated, killed. All in the name of 'mental health,'" he wrote in March 1969.
