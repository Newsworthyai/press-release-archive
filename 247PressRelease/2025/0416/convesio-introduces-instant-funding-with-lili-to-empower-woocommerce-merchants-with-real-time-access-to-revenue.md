# Convesio Introduces Instant Funding with Lili to Empower WooCommerce Merchants with Real-Time Access to Revenue

NAPLES, FL, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Convesio, the all-in-one solution powering high-performance ecommerce on WordPress, announced a powerful enhancement to its ConvesioPay solution: Instant Funding powered by Lili. This partnership gives small and mid-sized merchants real-time access to their funds—at no additional cost—offering a major competitive advantage in managing cash flow and scaling operations.  Unlike traditional payment providers that charge fees for expedited transfers, ConvesioPay's Instant Funding ensures merchants are paid immediately, 24/7—even on weekends—with no hidden charges. This capability is especially critical for growing businesses that rely on fast reinvestment into inventory, marketing, or fulfillment to maintain momentum.  Running a small business—especially in the fast-paced world of ecommerce—is a 24/7 job," said Lilac Bar David, Co-founder and CEO of Lili. "We're proud to partner with Convesio to bring entrepreneurs a powerful all-in-one platform that simplifies finances, streamlines payments, and ensures around-the-clock access to their funds—so they can stay focused on what matters most: growing their business."  Seamlessly Integrated with the Tools Merchants Already Use  ConvesioPay is built for modern eCommerce, offering native integrations with WordPress, WooCommerce, and QuickBooks, streamlining every aspect of payment processing and collection. Now, with Instant Funding directly connected to a Lili business checking account, merchants have full control and visibility over their revenue from sale to bank deposit—all within a few clicks.  Why Instant Funding Matters for Merchants:  • No Fees: Competing platforms charge extra for fast payouts. Convesio and Lili offer it as a built-in benefit.  • 24/7 Access: Funds are available instantly—even after hours and on weekends.  • Smarter Growth: Real-time access means faster turnaround for reorders, campaigns, or operational needs.  "Cash flow is the heartbeat of any eCommerce business," said Tom Fanelli, CEO of Convesio. "Delays in receiving revenue can disrupt operations and slow growth. That's why we've partnered with Lili to offer real-time payouts—giving our merchants instant access to their earnings without the premium price tag."
