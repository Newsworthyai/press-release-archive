# What Does Trump Love More Than Money? Power, Says Bestselling Author Elizabeth Graham

WILMINGTON, NC, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Elizabeth Graham is an American who became a Russian and then returned to the U.S. with a warning for all Americans. The ebook version of her top-selling book, from 'Democracy to Democrazy', will be available at Amazon at no charge April 18 and April 19, 2025.  In a recent article posted on Substack, she wrote:  Wall Street has lost eleven trillion dollars due to Trump's preposterous tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs would strike a fatal blow to the global trading system. And while Mr. Trump is scheming and playing golf, Mr. Putin is sitting in the Kremlin laughing. Countries worldwide, who issued sanctions against Russian state-owned banks and against Russian assets, which froze up to at least one trillion dollars - are now caught up in the Trump-Putin planned global tariff scam. Putin is the man behind the man.  Just suppose that Trump is not responding to this economic crisis, because he deliberately created it for another purpose. "Trump recently declared a national economic emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) - granting himself sweeping authority over international trade. By declaring a national emergency, Trump unlocked access to over 120 statutory powers scattered throughout federal law. Many of these powers have nothing to do with trade and everything to do with expanding presidential authority." (anonymous)  Power is an aphrodisiac and it fuels many men especially those with a mental disease named narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Disease symptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism, and a sense of entitlement. Trump shares this distinction with Adolph Hitler – a man who brainwashed an entire nation with his lies, fraud, rip-offs, and criminal delusions. All of Germany - many people had already fled the country - became mass murderers and killed six million Jews in Europe. When Hitler invaded Poland, WWII began, resulting in civilian and military deaths that exceeded 50 million souls. Today, Trump is committed to invading – by force if necessary – the countries of Greenland, Panama, Canada, and Gaza.  Trump – with assistance from Musk and Putin - is fleecing the entire world's economy and at the same time, thousands of people in Africa are dying due to TB, HIV, and other diseases because Trump/Musk cut off funding to the USAID PEPFAR program that supplied their medications. This action has fueled a genocide and is now a "crime against humanity." Trump doesn't give a damn.  Why does this matter? Even when legal domestic powers are limited, a national emergency lets the president:  - Frame the issue as a national security crisis, justifying aggressive action.  - Bypass Congress and the courts by acting unilaterally.  - Sway public opinion using fear, urgency, and patriotic rhetoric is focused on foreign threats.  Once the emergency is declared, the president taps into a hidden arsenal of "domestic control powers." What began as a trade issue could quickly shift into civil liberties restrictions, mass surveillance, or even crackdowns under the legal shield of an "emergency." This isn't just about tariffs. It's about redefining the boundaries of executive power. At the speed of light, Mr. Trump is now a dictator on the same scale as Hitler was 100 years ago. By creating a "crisis" he cleared the legal path to unbridled power – which could have been his goal all along!  Graham's book, 'From Democracy To Democrazy', is now available at Amazon. The ebook version will be available at no charge at Amazon April 18 and 19th, 2025. Her new book titled 'Survival' will be published by the end of May 2025. More information is available at her website at https://democrazy2020.org/ or her Substack at https://egraham.substack.com.
