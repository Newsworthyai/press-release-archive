# Artemis Adolescent Healing Center Expands Services with Teen Residential Treatment Programs for Young People Struggling in Arizona

TUCSON, AZ, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With the expansion of their treatment options, Artemis Adolescent Healing Center strengthens their center's ability to provide comprehensive, individualized care for teens struggling with complex emotional, psychological, and co-occurring disorders.  As youth mental health needs rise across the country, Artemis Healing Center's enhanced offerings come at a critical time. The expansion adds dedicated residential beds, a multidisciplinary care team, and evidence-based modalities tailored specifically to the developmental needs of adolescents ages 13–17.  Offering Comprehensive Teen Dual Diagnosis Treatment  The new Teen Dual Diagnosis Treatment Program integrates mental health and substance use recovery through a structured therapeutic model that includes individual counseling, psychiatric support, family therapy, and skill-building groups. This approach ensures that neither condition is treated in isolation—recognizing the intricate ways mental health and addiction intersect during adolescence.  "We recognized a growing gap in the availability of high-quality, trauma-informed care for teens—particularly those experiencing both mental health and substance use challenges," said a spokesperson for Artemis. "Our new programs were built with that in mind. Whether a teen is battling depression, addiction, or both, we're now equipped to meet them where they are and guide them toward real healing."  Comprehensive and Compassionate Teen Depression Treatment  In addition, the center has launched an intensive Teen Depression Treatment Program, offering specialized care for teens facing persistent sadness, isolation, and hopelessness. The program emphasizes emotional regulation, self-esteem rebuilding, and suicide prevention through evidence-based practices like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and experiential modalities.  In doing so, Artemis Healing Center is combatting adolescent depression and ensuring the youths of today are able to take the right steps forward as the next leaders of tomorrow.  Providing Comfort and Structure Through Teen Residential Treatment Support  These services are offered within a newly enhanced Teen Residential Treatment setting, designed to provide a safe, supportive environment for youth requiring immersive inpatient care. The residential facility features programming specifically designed for adolescents, on-site support, and holistic therapies such as art, music, and mindfulness practice building.  An Ongoing Commitment to Teen Mental Health and Wellness  This expansion underscores Artemis Adolescent Healing Center's continued investment in youth behavioral health at a time when national data reflects increased demand and limited access.  "We are committed to being part of the solution," said a spokesperson. "Our adolescent programs are more than a clinical service—they're a lifeline for families in crisis."  The enhanced services are now accepting referrals and admissions. Licensed professionals, school counselors, and concerned family members are encouraged to contact Artemis confidentially for more information or to schedule a consultation.  Artemis Healing Center is a leading behavioral health provider in Arizona, offering individualized treatment for mental health and substance use disorders. With its home base in Tucson, and a reputation for clinical excellence, Artemis delivers trauma-informed, evidence-based care for adults and adolescents in both outpatient and residential settings. The center is committed to helping people and families navigate the path to lasting recovery with compassion, dignity, and integrity.
