# Shincheonji Church of Jesus in France Refutes Le Parisien Report…

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On April 9, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in France issued an official statement condemning an April 7 article in the French daily Le Parisien, stating that the article "seriously damaged the honor of the church and its members" by portraying the church in a distorted manner. Church officials criticized the report for excessively highlighting unilateral claims by former members while barely reflecting the actual nature of the faith community.  The controversial article, titled "They Treated Us Like Animals," portrayed Shincheonji Church as one of the "problematic evangelical groups" in France, based on the testimony of an anonymous former member. The article mentioned training camps, social isolation, and monetary demands, but included only two sentences representing the church's stance.  A church representative stated, "We submitted detailed, written answers totaling several thousand characters in response to 12 questions from the journalist, but only two sentences were quoted in the article." They criticized this as representing less than 1% of their response, denying readers the chance to gain a balanced perspective. "Given the report was published just four hours after we submitted our answers, it is clear this was a one-sided, pre-planned attack," they added.  The representative further stated, "If the written response was insufficient, the journalist could have visited the church and spoken directly with current believers. The church remains open to transparent communication with the media."  To share the authentic experiences of its members, the church released testimonies from current believers. Teresa (29), who has attended the church in Paris for six years, said, "Faith is something voluntary. Here, I've learned about God and how to live as a person of light." Axel (30), another member, said, "Before coming to Shincheonji, I was searching for the meaning of life. Through this church, I've come to understand what God desires. I've enjoyed my faith journey, traveled, and even met my wife here. I'm living a fulfilling life."  Regarding the article's title, "They Treated Us Like Animals," the church responded: "We were shocked and disturbed by this phrase. No one has ever been treated in such a way, nor do we perceive it that way. It appears to have been used merely to attract attention." They emphasized that the church does not threaten or stigmatize those who leave and that it respects individual choices even after departure.  In response to the claim that a woman had to break up with her boyfriend due to the church's influence, the church stated: "That is not true. The man in question was also a church member and reportedly wanted marriage. The woman, however, said she wasn't ready. The breakup was a personal decision unrelated to any church intervention." They stressed that dating and marriage are personal matters based on autonomy and responsibility.  The church also raised concerns that the article included claims about experiences the interviewee did not actually have. For example, a photo showing someone with their feet on a radiator was described as punishment, but the church explained, "The photo had no connection to discipline and was taken before the person even joined the church. The man in the photo, who remains a member, posed that way as a joke. He was shocked to see his image used without consent and misrepresented. He plans to file an official complaint."  The church added, "It's regrettable that the media cited and published such claims without verifying them, potentially reinforcing a biased perception that Shincheonji Church is an irrational group."  Addressing the "training camp" mentioned in the article, the church explained, "It was a short-term, fully voluntary program for those wishing to grow spiritually. It included morning prayers and Bible reflection and could be left at any time. There was no coercion or physical discipline involved. However, we recognize the potential for misunderstanding and have since discontinued the program."  Claims of data collection, internet restriction, and family isolation were also rejected: "These are completely false. Aside from basic consultation details, we collect no personal data. We've never restricted internet access or external relationships—rather, we encourage believers to lead exemplary lives in their families and communities."  On the use of the name "ECA Academy," the church said: "It was a temporary name used in 2019 for a Bible education program. Participants were informed upfront that it was affiliated with Shincheonji, and joining the church was entirely voluntary."  The Shincheonji Church in France urged the media to uphold the following principles: • Inclusive reporting that reflects diverse perspectives and experiences • Sufficient coverage of official responses from the church • Fair opportunities to share current members' actual experiences • Respect for religious freedom and dignity • Avoiding sensational language and prejudicial headlines  A church representative concluded, "Biased reports on specific religious communities stigmatize sincere believers and violate religious freedom and human rights. The media must pursue balanced and respectful reporting, free from sensationalism and hate. We hope that Le Parisien and all other media outlets uphold higher ethical standards and fairness in reporting on religion. Shincheonji Church will continue transparent communication to foster proper understanding."  Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony testifies to the revelation and things that have been seen and heard according to God's will and is working to heal all nations.
