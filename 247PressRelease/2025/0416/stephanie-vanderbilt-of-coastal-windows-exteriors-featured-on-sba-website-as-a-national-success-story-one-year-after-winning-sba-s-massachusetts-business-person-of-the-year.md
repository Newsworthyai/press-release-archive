# Stephanie Vanderbilt of Coastal Windows & Exteriors Featured on SBA Website as a National Success Story One Year After Winning SBA's Massachusetts Business Person of the Year

BEVERLY, MA, April 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Just one year after receiving the prestigious title of 2024 Massachusetts Small Business Person of the Year, Vanderbilt's inspiring entrepreneurial journey is being shared nationwide. Starting with no prior experience in home improvement, she launched her company in 2011 with nothing more than a desk above a warehouse and a powerful mission: to help homeowners make smarter, energy-efficient upgrades.  Early in her journey, Vanderbilt sought guidance from the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center (MSBDC), gaining valuable insights in finance, marketing, and business planning.  "I had no background in home improvement, but I knew I wanted to educate homeowners on energy efficiency," said Vanderbilt. "MSBDC provided the support I needed to grow Coastal Windows & Exteriors into the company it is today."  From humble beginnings, the company has now grown to more than 30 employees and continues to serve communities across Eastern Massachusetts, Southern New Hampshire, and Southern Maine. Coastal Windows & Exteriors is celebrated not only for its high-performance products—roofing, siding, windows, and doors—but also for its deep commitment to social responsibility. Programs like Roof for Heroes and the Freedom from Want Thanksgiving Project underscore Vanderbilt's mission to give back.  As a woman-owned, family-run business, Coastal Windows & Exteriors has earned multiple accolades, including the GAF President's Club Award, James Hardie Service Excellence Award, and BONS Editors' Choice Award.  Vanderbilt's feature on the SBA website reinforces her continued role as a leader in sustainable building practices, small business development, and women's empowerment in the trades.
