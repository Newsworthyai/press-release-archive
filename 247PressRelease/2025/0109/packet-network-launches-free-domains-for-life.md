# Packet Network Launches Free Domains For Life

PARIS, FRANCE, January 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Packet Network, a decentralized media network, has released a revolutionary blockchain-based domain name system (DNS) called PKT DNS. This system is unique because registered domain names are accessible from all web browsers without requiring special software or browser extensions. This paves the way for an open, free, censorship-resistant DNS that connects blockchain domains to the public internet.  A Globally Accessible Network  PKT DNS uses a third-level subdomain system. Registrants select a name, which appears before the .pkt second-level domain, for example yourname.pkt. Domains registered on PKT DNS have public DNS access because they are broadcast to more than 55 top-level domains currently associated with PKT DNS, such as yourname.pkt.live, yourname.pkt.tv, yourname.pkt.my and many more. This ensures seamless usability for general internet users without requiring special software. A list of accessible top-level domains on PKT DNS are listed here: https://pktnode.network/domains/. More top-level domains can be added to the list by owners of pkt. TLD domains.   True Domain Ownership  PKT DNS introduces a novel approach to domain registration and ownership. Traditional DNS requires registrants to pay an upfront fee, which has annual renewal costs in perpetuity. PKT DNS has no upfront cost, no renewal fee, and enables domain ownership for life. PKT domain owners also have full control over their PKT domains, including unlimited subdomains and custom DNS records.  How It Works  To register a domain on PKT DNS, registrants must stake a small amount of a PKT cryptocurrency on the Base blockchain. The PKT cryptocurrency can be purchased directly from mainstream web3 wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Each stake creates an NFT, which is a digital receipt that each registered domain is connected to. Once a domain is registered, the registrant controls the domain for life, at no upfront or ongoing cost. If a registrant transfers their NFT to another party, the domain ownership transfers with it. Unstaking relinquishes ownership of the domain, making it available for others to claim.  The amount that must be staked to claim a domain is based on the demand for domains at the time of registration. The value can range between a minimum of 1,000-50,000 PKT (~USD$1.00 to USD$50.00), as determined during registration. Since the stake remains in the custody of the registrant, there is no actual expense paid to any 3rd party. If the domain is relinquished, the stake is released and can be converted back into cash at the registrants discretion.   Mitigating Cybercrime and Bad Actors  PKT DNS has protections from misuse while fostering freedom and openness on the internet. To address this challenge:  Blacklisting: PKT DNS domains can be blacklisted by infrastructure operators to deter cybercriminal activity.  Name Server Flexibility: Infrastructure operators can choose whether to resolve blacklisted domains. Managed Oversight: The blacklist will initially be administered to protect the project's reputation and shield infrastructure operators from unnecessary risk until a decentralized governance system is established.  PKT DNS aims to strike a balance between innovation and responsible operation. This ensures a safe and reliable system for domain providers and internet users alike.  Why PKT DNS is a Game-Changer  While blockchain-based DNS systems have existed for years, PKT DNS stands apart by seamlessly integrating with the public DNS system. Previous projects required users to install special software, limiting adoption. PKT DNS overcomes this barrier through its unique public subdomain technology and decentralized staking system.  Key innovations include:  Dynamic Staking to balance demand and domain scarcity. Public Access to PKT DNS domains via traditional DNS systems. Responsible Oversight to protect infrastructure operators from liability.  PKT DNS offers domain registrants a community-driven internet infrastructure that is resistant to censorship and corporate control.  About Packet Network  Packet Network is a decentralized media network, built to empower global content creators and offer an alternative to traditional, corporate-controlled networks. Designed as a decentralized physical infrastructure project (DePIN), its technology and infrastructure supports the future of global content accessibility, digital distribution and ecommerce. Features include a decentralized domain name system (PKT DNS), a media platform built for discovery called Packet Hub, and open mesh internet access using local wifi hotspots.   Packet's native cryptocurrency, PKT, is built on Base blockchain. It uses a Stake-to-Earn protocol as an economic incentive for people to run the network's infrastructure and scale the network worldwide. Packet is an extension of the open-source cjdns mesh networking protocol. Cjdns provides the backbone of the Packet Network and enables users to get onto the internet peer-to-peer, without requiring a traditional internet service provider (ISP).
