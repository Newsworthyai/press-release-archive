SAN DIEGO, CA, January 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MediKeeper, a leading provider of customizable wellness portals to healthcare providers, insurance brokers, wellness companies, TPAs, and corporate employers, today announced their annual list of emerging trends in the Employee Wellness market for 2025.   MediKeeper's report highlights four key trends that will play a role in employee health and wellness. According to the author of the report, Dr. Tyler Amell, Chief Health and Strategy Officer, "With increasing stressors in 2024, the importance of investing in employee health to build both mental and physical resilience is paramount as we move into 2025."  The trends for 2025 are: •	Employee Health Costs Will Continue to Rise: Healthcare and disability costs are expected to increase significantly in 2025. Preventive wellness programs targeting chronic conditions like mental health and cardiometabolic diseases are critical to controlling these costs. •	Mental Health Risks Remain High: Stress, anxiety, burnout, and depression will continue to challenge employees and employers, fueled by global uncertainties, inflation, and workplace pressures. •	Flexibility Is the Motto for 2025: Workers demand adaptable environments, including hybrid work arrangements, enhanced health benefits, and AI integration to boost productivity. •	Worker Health and Safety Protections: The potential rollback of health and safety standards could negatively impact workplace health, underscoring the need for voluntary proactive measures with measurable impact.  The trends identified by MediKeeper were based on data generated from the 1,100 client organizations and 10 million lives covered by MediKeeper, as well as market and health trend analysis data, and published research evidence.
