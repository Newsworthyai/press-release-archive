# Classic rhyming picture books with positive messages uplift and reassure young children and increase self-esteem

RIVERSIDE, CA, January 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For children's author and licensed marriage and family therapist, Jamie Chin, she didn't have to look far for inspiration for her heartfelt, comforting and empowering children's stories. She looked to her own children, as well as her young clients she has seen in the past decade as a therapist.   From working with children and teenage clients, Chin understands how powerful mindfulness can be for them. With her picture book Look for the Magic, she encourages young readers to slow down and live in the moment. Chin says, "In a fast-paced and sometimes chaotic world, today's youth are experiencing unprecedented levels of anxiety and attention issues. Kids can learn to calm down and self soothe when they use their senses to ground themselves to the present moment. Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is going on in the here and nowâ€“and it's powerful." With soothing rhymes and painterly illustrations, the story embodies the message of compassion for ourselves and others through gratitude, self-empowerment, and appreciating nature.  With two daughters of her own, Chin's Dear Daughter: A Love Letter from Mother to Daughter, along with its companion version for dads, is a poignant story that celebrates the love between a daughter and parent, underscoring to girls that they are cherished and loved unconditionally. In a world where girls are pressured to look or act a certain way, the sentiment of this book says she is loved just the way she is.  As the recipient of the Family Choice Award, Readers' Favorite Book Award, and Gold Mom's Choice Award, Chin offers her books as a welcome resource to families and educators of young children looking to uplift and empower the young people in their lives. She is also the author of the upcoming picture book for adults, Away You Go, a book celebrating the enduring bond of a parent with their adult child.
