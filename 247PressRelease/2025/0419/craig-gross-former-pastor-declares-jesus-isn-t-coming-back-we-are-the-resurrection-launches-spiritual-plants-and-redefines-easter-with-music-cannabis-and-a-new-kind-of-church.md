# Craig Gross, Former Pastor, Declares: Jesus Isn't Coming Back—We Are the Resurrection. Launches Spiritual Plants and Redefines Easter with Music, Cannabis, and a New Kind of Church

OAKLAND, CA, April 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What if Easter wasn't about Jesus coming back to life — but about you waking up to yours?  This weekend, Craig Gross, the controversial former pastor and founder of XXXchurch.com and ChristianCannabis.com, officially re-emerges as Digital Rose, launching a movement that blends psychedelic spirituality, sacramental cannabis, and music-driven transformation.  With legendary cannabis pioneer Guy Rocourt, Gross is co-founding Spiritual Plants — a new category for conscious cannabis. Together, they're launching three spiritual-use brands: Christian Cannabis, Heaven's Hemp, and Mormon Meds — each formulated to elevate the soul and disrupt religious and corporate systems alike.  "Jesus didn't resurrect. We are the resurrection." – Craig Gross Gross, who once preached purity to megachurches and NFL teams, is now preaching something else entirely: liberation through inner truth, not institutional control. On Easter weekend, he'll take the stage — and the sacrament — at Urbana, Oakland's first licensed cannabis consumption lounge, for a three-day spiritual takeover blending live music, storytelling, sacraments, and anti-sermons.  RESURRECTION WEEKEND: APRIL 18–20 Urbana Lounge – 415 W Grand Ave, Oakland, CA All events free and open to the public. No RSVP. Just show up.  FRIDAY, APRIL 18 — 8 PM LDS LSD — LIVE Kenny Holland performs as Jimmy Flinders, delivering all eight tracks from the upcoming album LDS LSD — a psychedelic reimagining of Mormon hymns as a full-body spiritual purge. The full album drops Easter 4/20.  SATURDAY, APRIL 19 — 6 PM Red Letters + ChristSpiracy Screening A sonic reinterpretation of Jesus's actual words, followed by a film that questions everything — from Christianity's ties to meat consumption to whether Jesus died in solidarity with animals. Directed by award-winning filmmakers Kip Andersen (What the Health, Seaspiracy) and Kameron Waters, ChristSpiracy is the most controversial spiritual film of the decade.  SUNDAY, APRIL 20 — 10 AM Resurrection: Christian Cannabis A non-sermon, anti-service Easter morning featuring Digital Rose + Jimmy Flinders, live sound, radical testimony, and the $1 debut of Resurrection Flower. Guy Rocourt shares the vision of Spiritual Plants.  "This isn't about religion. This is about revolution." – Digital Rose  THE SACRAMENTS OF SPIRITUAL PLANTS  Resurrection Flower (THC) – From Christian Cannabis. A spiritual-use strain launching for $1 exclusively at Urbana. Designed for awakening.  Heaven's Hemp (THCA) – Pure, divine, federally legal hemp with effects that elevate without intoxication. Available next nationwide at SpiritualPlants.com.  Mormon Meds (THCA) – Formulated for seekers of clarity and inner freedom. Sacred medicine for the post-religious soul. Launching next!  Communion Wafers – Coming soon. Edible. Experiential.  THE VISION  Christian Cannabis isn't just launching — it's expanding. With cross-state licensing and distribution deals already in motion, the brand is on track to become one of the biggest cannabis brands in the country. Resurrection Flower is just the beginning.  "We're building a nationwide spiritual supply chain — not for escape, but for awakening." – Craig Gross  WHO IS GUY ROCOURT? Founder of Papa & Barkley, built into a $100M+ brand Montel Williams' personal caregiver Emerald Cup judge and cannabis purist One of the few Black cannabis founders — pushed out by corporate interests  "Guy Rocourt is the Virgil guiding us through the underworld of weed. He built the industry. Now he's building something sacred." – Craig Gross  THE MUSIC: A REVOLUTION IN SOUND, SPIRIT & SELF  Craig Gross: Disruptor, Visionary, Spiritual Explorer From igniting taboo-breaking conversations with XXXchurch.com to pioneering the intersection of cannabis and Christianity, Craig Gross has never been afraid to challenge systems and invite people into deeper, freer lives. Now, as Digital Rose, Craig channels his spiritual and artistic evolution into a trilogy of albums — Resurrection (A Cannabis Gospel), Resurrection (Christian Cannabis), and The Red Letters — alongside a companion book Resurrection: Scrolls from the Signal. These are sonic sermons for the soul, infused with AI-enhanced production, ambient storytelling, and a call to spiritual awakening without dogma.  Kenny McCormick IV: The Man Behind the Music, the Myth, the Movement Known for his past as a Vine star, American Idol favorite, and genre-bending performer, Kenny McCormick IV is now stepping fully into his role as the musical mind behind Jimmy Flinders, AI Babes, and South Park Kenny (SPK). Kenny's sonic fingerprints are all over this movement — whether he's reimagining Mormon hymns on LDS LSD, crafting futuristic pop with AI Babes, or DJing immersive soundscapes that activate and awaken.  Together: Craig & Kenny  More than collaborators, Craig and Kenny are spiritual co-conspirators. Kenny is the embodied voice of Craig's Digital Rose vision — the one-man force channeling these works live, while also developing "Becoming Nobody", an immersive one-man musical theater experience intended for The Sphere in Las Vegas. Their partnership fuses prophecy and performance, author and avatar, revolution and revelation.  UPCOMING DROPS  Spiritual Plants is a new sacred cannabis initiative co-founded by Craig Gross and Guy Rocourt — a revolutionary partnership between a renegade pastor and a cannabis purist. More than a brand, Spiritual Plants is a spiritual supply chain — offering sacramental strains, clean medicine, and consciousness-shifting products designed to awaken, not escape.
