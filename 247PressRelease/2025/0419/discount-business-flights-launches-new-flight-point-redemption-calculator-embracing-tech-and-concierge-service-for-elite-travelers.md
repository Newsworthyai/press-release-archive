# Discount Business Flights Launches New Flight Point Redemption Calculator, Embracing Tech and Concierge Service for Elite Travelers

LOS ANGELES, CA, April 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  Why It Matters Busy professionals are accumulating credit card rewards faster than ever—but most of those points go unused or undervalued. Why? Because award travel requires understanding transfer partners, navigating multiple portals, and a level of patience most travelers don't have.

New Launch: Point Redemption Calculator The newly launched Point Redemption Calculator is a fast, intuitive tool that lets travelers instantly estimate the real value of their Amex, Chase, or Capital One points toward international business class flights.  "While others use technology to replace people, we use it to enhance the booking experience," adds Discount Business Flights. "Our clients still want a real person guiding the process—someone with actual travel experience who understands how important choosing the right route and airline really matters."
