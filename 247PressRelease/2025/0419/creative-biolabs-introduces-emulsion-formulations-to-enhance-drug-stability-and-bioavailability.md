# Creative Biolabs Introduces Emulsion Formulations to Enhance Drug Stability and Bioavailability

SHIRLEY, NY, April 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Emulsions, being mixtures of immiscible liquids, such as water and oil, are of utmost significance in pharmaceutical applications by increasing drug compound solubility and stability. Creative Biolabs has long been a market pioneer in lipid delivery systems. Their newly released products are focused on simplifying the delivery of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. Their new products are designed to significantly enhance drug stability and bioavailability, capturing a market lead in the drug industry.  "Continued innovation is essential if we are to break through the drug delivery challenges of today," stated the chief scientific officer of Creative Biolabs. "Our new emulsion technology enhances the bioavailability of low-solubility drugs. We anticipate this innovation to improve the approach to formulation design and offer a competitive advantage in the fast-evolving pharmaceuticals sector."  Creative Biolabs utilizes cutting-edge techniques to formulate dry emulsions that can easily be reconstituted to O/W emulsions upon rehydration. Such a new formulation is specifically intended for poorly soluble drugs, thereby enhancing bioavailability upon oral administration.  To better address the diverse needs of drug delivery system development, Creative Biolabs broadens its service capacity to encompass advanced formulations such as nanoemulsions, microemulsions, and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEEDS). At Creative Biolabs, the company offers customized development solutions for each emulsion formulation, adjusting the characteristics and performance of the emulsions based on the specific requirements of individual projects. This includes thoughtful formulation planning, ingredient optimization, and robust stability testing to deliver top performance.   "Our custom emulsion formulation development is specifically designed to meet the special needs of drug delivery systems," a researcher at Creative Biolabs stated. "We understand that each pharmaceutical application has its challenges and conditions. Therefore, our scientists adopt the strategy of developing customized emulsions with enhanced solubility, enhanced bioavailability, and optimal stability for a wide range of drugs."  Creative Biolabs prides itself on applying advanced technologies and a robust team of skilled scientists to deliver quality emulsion formulations. Through rigid customization, the company addresses unique client needs, with each project being uniquely engineered for optimal performance.
