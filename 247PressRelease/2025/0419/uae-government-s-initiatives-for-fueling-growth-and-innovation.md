# UAE Government's Initiatives for Fueling Growth and Innovation

DUBAI, UAE, April 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The UAE government is taking bold steps to fuel economic growth while keeping sustainability as the primary concern. At the World Government Summit 2025, leaders unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at enriching innovation, environmental progress, and industrial transformation. The UAE is actively working to lower its carbon footprint by encouraging the adoption of affordable electric and hybrid vehicles.  Let's take a closer look at how these plans are shaping the future.  The National Demand Side Management (DSM), one of the UAE's greatest programs, is already making an impact. By 2023, it had cut 11.2 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Besides, this program also focuses on key industries like transport, agriculture, and construction, ensuring smarter energy use and economic efficiency.  "Under the guidance of our leadership, the UAE continues to focus on sustainable growth by doubling its efforts," said Ohood Bint Khalfan Al Roumi, Minister of State for Government Development and the Future.  The UAE government is also strengthening its global cooperation. The launch of the third cohort of the Global Councils on Sustainable Development Goals brings together leaders from 17 partner countries. Their primary goal here is to drive collaboration in energy, investment, technology, and environmental protection.  New policies are giving industries in the UAE a sustainability boost. The 'Green Industries' initiative, launched by the Environment Agencyâ€”Abu Dhabi, rewards businesses that reduce pollution and optimise resources. Additionally, more companies are now joining in, proving that going green is good for business.  The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) is also making a big impact beyond the UAE. So far, it has contributed AED 229 billion, expanding its investments to 107 countries to support key industries and sustainable projects.  On this account, Director General of ADFD, Mohamed Saif Al Suwaidi, said, "We are committed to strengthening the economy and supporting Emirati industries."  Fueling Innovation in Energy The UAE's track record in energy innovation is impressive. Since the 1990s, it has dramatically reduced natural gas flaring. ADNOC achieved a 76.4% reduction by 2013. Apart from that, the government has also made 'green diesel' mandatory for all commercial vehicles in UAE, making the UAE a leader in clean fuel adoption.  A government spokesperson emphasised the country's vision, saying, "We are driving growth through digital transformation, energy efficiency, and sustainability. Our economy is built to compete globally."  The UAE is working towards its Vision 2030 targets, which include:  - 30% reduction in energy demand across Dubai - 30% drop in nationwide carbon emissions - Projected savings of AED 10 billion
