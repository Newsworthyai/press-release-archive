# US Kidney Research Corp Achieves Milestone in Waterless Blood Purification Technology

SACRAMENTO, CA, March 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- US Kidney Research Corporation (USKRC) is developing the world's first waterless blood purification device, a groundbreaking technology with the potential to globally replace traditional dialysis machines. Recent scientific advancements in the device's ion transport system, a crucial component responsible for removing excess ions from the blood, directing them to the urine, and restoring proper ion balance to the bloodstream, are moving it closer to completion. Ions are essential for maintaining proper physiological function. In individuals with kidney disease, the kidneys struggle to filter out excess ions like sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, leading to dangerous imbalances.  This achievement represents a significant breakthrough, as it is the first successful development of a waterless transport system for a medical blood purification device, a feat that has not been previously accomplished. This breakthrough is a critical milestone toward Us Kidney Research Corporation's ultimate goal of creating an implantable artificial kidney, which could greatly improve the quality of life for millions of patients worldwide.   CEO Roland Ludlow stated, "Creating an ion transport system is an extremely complex scientific challenge. After years of research and extensive experimentation, our scientists have discovered the method needed to complete the task. Breaking through this barrier is a major leap forward."   Waterless Advantages: Unlike water dependent dialysis systems that rely on disposables such as a dialyzer and dialysate solution, as well as a reverse osmosis water purification infrastructure, a waterless blood purifying device eliminates the need for these components, leading to substantial cost savings for healthcare providers. Additionally, the device will feature advanced technology, including real-time patient monitoring and precise control of electrolyte, urea, and fluid removal, resulting in enhanced accuracy and improved patient outcomes.  Ecological Benefits: A waterless blood purifying device will help address environmental challenges and reduce the carbon footprint by eliminating the billions of gallons of contaminated water created from dialysis, reduce dialyzer plastic waste, and lower transport and energy costs associated with production.  US Kidney Research Corporation is also advancing their NC-ILM ultrafilter membrane technology. NC-ILMs demonstrated superior performance over conventional membranes, making them ideal for use in dialyzers and water purification. They offer up to 100 times higher flux, 99.6% protein rejection, efficient toxin removal, and minimal protein loss. NC-ILMs exhibited excellent anti-fouling properties, operating for over five hours in blood samples without the need for systemic anticoagulation. Studies also proved biocompatibility, highlighting the membranes potential for advanced renal disease treatment and industrial applications.  Mission & Goals  US Kidney Research Corporation is committed to:  •	Completing its flagship waterless blood purifying device. •	Developing an implantable artificial kidney using the same cutting-edge technology. •	Advancing several related renal care products currently in development.  Expert Collaboration  Us Kidney Research Corporation's innovations are supported by a distinguished team of researchers and scientists from the University of Arkansas (UA), along with Dr. Ira Kurtz, who serves as the science and medical advisor and a board member for US Kidney Research Corporation. Dr. Kurtz is the Chief of Nephrology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and a leading expert in the field of kidney disease.   Both Dr. Kurtz and the team of researchers, headed by Dr. Jamie Hestekin at UA, are instrumental in advancing the development of a viable, long-term solution for kidney disease patients, driving progress toward transformative treatments.  US Kidney Research Corporation (USKRC) is a pioneering leader in artificial kidney research and development. Recognized by esteemed organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology (ASN), KidneyX, and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), USKRC is revolutionizing the future of kidney treatment, setting a new standard in kidney treatment, and offering hope for a future beyond dialysis. USKRC was founded in 2015 and is registered as a C-Corporation in Delaware.
