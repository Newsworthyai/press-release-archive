# FINAL DAYS TO REGISTER FOR THE ANNUAL HUNGER WALK RUN HOSTED BY THE ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK

ATLANTA, GA, March 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Atlanta Community Food Bank invites the community to register for the 41st annual Hunger Walk Run ahead of the March 7 registration deadline. The event, taking place from noon to 4 p.m. on March 9 at The Home Depot Backyard, aims to raise awareness and funds to combat hunger in metro Atlanta and North Georgia, where food assistance needs have reached an all-time high.  "In these challenging times, our annual Hunger Walk Run unites the community to make an impact in the fight against hunger across Atlanta and beyond," said Kyle Waide, President and CEO of the Atlanta Community Food Bank. "Food insecurity is all around us, and the need is greater than ever. Every person who participates helps provide nutritious food and vital resources to children, families, seniors, and others in need."  Each registered walker provides 90 meals, while each runner contributes 120 meals for those struggling with food insecurity. With 1 in 5 children in Georgia facing hunger, every registration has a significant impact. Over the past 40 years, the Hunger Walk Run has raised more than $15.5 million for hunger relief, equating to over 46 million meals provided. For neighbors unable to participate, they can still support here.  Online registration is available until March 7 at noon and costs $30 for walkers and $40 for runners. Participants can also register on the day of the event, although the rate will be higher. The event is open to individuals and teams of all ages and abilities and will feature music, food vendors, warm-ups, and more. Participants are encouraged to download the free Hunger Walk Run app for updates, available on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.  The Hunger Walk Run supports the Atlanta Community Food Bank and local nonprofit organizations that run food pantries, shelters, community kitchens, senior centers, and childcare centers throughout metro Atlanta and North Georgia. Participants will have the opportunity to support a benefiting partner of their choice, allowing for tailored giving while participating in broader community hunger relief efforts.  The Atlanta Community Food Bank, the fourth largest food bank in the country by distribution volume, serves over 715,000 food-insecure neighbors and works with more than 700 nonprofit partners to deliver healthy and nutritious food to the communities in need.
