VANCOUVER, BC, March 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The prospect of a mouth full of metal isn't attractive, even for those adults who want to straighten their smiles.

For more, go to https://www.metrotownortho.com/procedures/orthodontics/invisalign/  What is Invisalign?  The Invisalign treatment consists of a series of custom-made aligning trays. A dentist changes the trays every several weeks to fit the new tooth configuration. Many patients report complete satisfaction with the Invisalign treatment and its stunning results.  Correct bite problems with Invisalign in Burnaby  Invisalign corrects the same dental problems as traditional braces; this includes:  •	Overcrowding – too little space prevents teeth from aligning normally in the mouth, leading to tooth decay and increasing the likelihood of gum disease. •	Large gaps between teeth – missing teeth or abnormal jaw development can lead to gaping. •	Crossbite – upper teeth that bite inside lower teeth can lead to uneven wear, bone erosion, and gum disease. •	Overbite – upper teeth that project further or completely cover and the lower teeth, can lead to jaw pain and temporomandibular disorder. •	Underbite – lower teeth that project further or completely cover the upper teeth can lead to jaw pain and temporomandibular disorder.  Advantages of Invisalign  In addition to the reduced visual impact, Invisalign aligning trays can be temporarily removed for important occasions, meaning that treatment duration is patient controlled. Although this may require some discipline, Invisalign trays are comfortable and nearly invisible, working to straighten teeth when they're in place.  Starting the Invisalign Treatment in Burnaby  The Invisalign treatment starts with taking a three-dimensional digital image of the entire jaw. These images allow the dentist to assess how the teeth move and view the jaw from different angles. It also allows the dentist to project what the face and jaw will look like. In essence, technology can show how Invisalign can impact the aesthetics of the face and jaw for more seamless results.  As a comfortable, effective treatment, Invisalign is a revolutionary teeth straightening treatment that works well for professionals.
