WEST PALM BEACH, FL, March 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill®, the fastest-growing Mediterranean food franchise, is celebrating another year of remarkable growth in 2024 where it opened 19 new restaurants across the U.S. as well as its first international location in Canada and saw a 46% surge in systemwide sales year-over-year. The brand has more than doubled its footprint in just two years' time and plans to open 40 new restaurants domestically and internationally in 2025, aiming to surpass 100 operational units by year-end.  Among the 40 new restaurants, The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill will open its first locations in Louisiana, North Carolina, and Wisconsin and strengthen its presence in states like Florida, California, and Texas. Additionally, with the signing of 27 franchise agreements along with master licenses for Western Canada and Egypt, the brand is positioned for sustained domestic and international growth in the coming years.  "2024 was a milestone year for The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill as we expanded our footprint in the U.S. and celebrated our first international opening in Canada. Our rapid growth and record-breaking sales are a testament to the strength of our brand, the passion of our franchise owners, and the growing demand for high-quality Mediterranean cuisine," said Bob Andersen, President of The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill. "In 2025, we are excited to bring The Great Greek experience to new communities, and we remain committed to delivering exceptional food and hospitality wherever we go."  At the heart of The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill's success is its culinary-driven food experience, featuring authentic, high-quality ingredients and freshly prepared Mediterranean dishes made to order. Originally founded by a culinary-trained father and son duo, the brand has preserved the family's recipes and delivers meals in a staged format with real plateware and utensils, creating an elevated fast-casual dining experience that rivals full-service restaurants.  Since franchising in 2019, The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill has seen exponential growth, reaching $73 million in systemwide sales in 2024. While the brand prides itself on its dine-in experience, the communal nature and quality of its food has translated to off-premises success as well, with catering sales up 43% last year and takeout orders through third-party delivery partners on the rise.   The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill continues to be regarded as a standout franchise concept, recently landing at #15 on Franchise Times' Fast & Serious list of the 40 smartest-growing franchise brands and ranking on Franchise Direct's Top 100 Franchises of 2025. The Great Greek has also been recognized as a Top Mover & Shaker by Fast Casual for two years in a row.
