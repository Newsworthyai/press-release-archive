# Trauterose: One Woman's Epic Journey Of Survival And Courage In Post-War Germany

WILMINGTON, NC, March 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- While there have been many WWII memoirs published, one stands out due to its unique insight: 'Trauterose: Growing Up in Postwar Munich' by Elisabeth Haggblade. It is an extraordinary memoir and a seminal work on post-Hitler Germany, distinguished not only by the author's intimate encounters with historical figures, but also by its expansive global perspective.  'Trauterose' garnered critical acclaim, winning the 2024 IndieReader Discovery Award in the Memoir category and securing First Place Non-Fiction in The Authors Show 2024 Book Cover Awards. It is a compelling story that transcends the ordinary and offers a fresh, profound look into a pivotal era in our history.  'Trauterose' is the compelling first-person account of Elisabeth Haggblade, who was orphaned at birth at the height of World War II and spent the first eleven years of her life under the care of a former S.S. officer and his family.  Like many she knew and met during her formative years, Elisabeth was marked both physically and psychologically by the traumatic events of the war and its aftermath, where negotiating daily life during the most tenuous time in Germany's history often felt like a balancing act. Yet through it all, faith and the help of others prevailed.  One person aiding and delivering faith was the late Pope Benedict XVI,  known then as Herr Joseph Ratzinger, teacher of catechism in our fourth-grade class in the 1950s.  After he left our school, his hand-written letter spelled out the proper path to follow in growing up :  "If one buttons one's coat the wrong way, one would have to undo all of it and start over again to make it right.  So it is with life," admonishing us "to choose the right beginning."  In short, 'Trauterose' is the account of one person's search for humanity in existence—a cautionary tale on the inherited guilt created by rampant nationalism, and a painfully honest and often humorous view of the world through the eyes of a young woman who found her way to freedom and purpose.  Readers and reviewers have expressed praise for Trauterose. Craig Jones of IndieReader wrote, "TRAUTEROSE (Growing Up in Postwar Munich) by Elisabeth Haggblade offers an uncompromising, moving, and elegiac memoir of a deprived childhood in postwar Germany." Midwest Book Review said, "Libraries seeking powerful, personal memoirs that hold political and social lessons and insights will find Trauterose a study in adaptation, survival, and growth. It also deserves attention from young adult and adult book clubs seeking memoirs that reflect not just individual experience, but a sense of the culture and times."  One Amazon review stated, "The book is extremely well written, and I would recommend it highly." Another said, "I highly recommend this book. It will touch your heart." Another wrote, "It offers an unforgettable window into a time and place that few Americans know about."
