# Elliott Broidy Warns Of Alarming 21% Surge In Global Antisemitism As Jewish High Holy Days Approach

BOCA RATON, FL, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As Jewish communities worldwide prepare to observe the High Holy Days, Elliott Broidy, Co-Chairman of the Fund to End Antisemitism, Extremism, and Hate, is sounding the alarm about an alarming 21.2% surge in global antisemitic incidents, citing new data that reveals the oldest hatred is metastasizing beyond college campuses into healthcare, entertainment, and other critical sectors of society.  According to the latest report from Combat Antisemitism Movement's Antisemitism Research Center, 554 antisemitic incidents were recorded worldwide in July 2025 alone—an average of nearly 18 incidents per day. This represents a dramatic increase from the 457 incidents documented in July 2024, underscoring what Broidy calls "a crisis that demands immediate, coordinated action from government, institutions, and civil society."  "These numbers demonstrate a clear and present danger to Jewish communities and democratic values worldwide," said Broidy, Chairman and CEO of Broidy Capital Holdings and a longtime advocate for combating extremism. "What we're witnessing is not random hatred but a systematic campaign to demonize Israel and, by extension, Jewish people everywhere."  Campus Crisis Spreading Beyond Universities  While U.S. campus incidents temporarily decreased during July's summer break—recording only nine incidents compared to record-high levels during the 2024-2025 academic year—Broidy warns that the toxic ideologies incubated in university settings are now spreading into other professional spheres.  "The battle to save institutions like Harvard from themselves is far from over," Broidy stated, referencing his recent commentary on Harvard University's ongoing legal battle with the Trump administration over frozen federal research funding. "Harvard's own commissioned report documented how the university 'mainstreamed and normalized' antisemitism, allowed 'politicized instruction' that made opposition to Israel a requirement for classroom participation, and created an environment where Jewish students face institutional bias."  Broidy noted that Harvard's refusal to implement meaningful reforms—despite receiving billions in federal funding—illustrates the depth of the problem. "When elite institutions tolerate materials equating opposition to BDS with 'coded genocide' and allow medical students to 'discourage Zionist students from coming here,' we shouldn't be surprised when this hatred appears in professional healthcare settings," he said.  Healthcare Sector Shows Disturbing Antisemitic Trends  In a stark illustration of how campus-bred antisemitism is infiltrating critical sectors, Elliott Broidy highlighted recent shocking incidents in healthcare settings. In Italy, hospital staff in Tuscany were captured on video proudly discarding life-saving Israeli-made medicine, while in Australia, nurses made headlines for declaring they wouldn't treat Israeli patients—with one boasting of killing Israeli patients and making throat-slitting gestures.  "These healthcare professionals would rather risk patients' lives than accept lifesaving treatment from Israel," Broidy observed in his recent op-ed, "The Demonization of Israel: The Newest Form of the Oldest Hatred." "This is pathological hatred that has overpowered all reason and professional ethics."  A Pattern of Systematic Dehumanization  Elliott Broidy argues that these incidents reflect a broader pattern of systematic dehumanization that extends across multiple sectors—from healthcare and academia to entertainment and international law.  "What we're seeing is not political disagreement but something approaching the theological in its intensity," Broidy explained. "To these individuals, Israelis are not human beings deserving of compassion or medical care—they are demons to be destroyed. This mindset drove the hate-fests disguised as 'protests' immediately after October 7th, before Israeli victims' bodies had turned cold."  Private Sector Initiative: The Auschwitz Research Center  Elliott Broidy emphasized that government action alone cannot address this crisis – combatting antisemitism will require continued support from private initiatives designed to combat extremism and educate future generations:  "We need cultural change driven by private initiatives to instruct the next generation about the historic dangers of ideologies based on racial hatred," Broidy stated. "This is why I am proud to support and fundraise for the Auschwitz Research Center on Hate, Extremism, and Radicalization (ARCHER) at House 88."  ARCHER aims to expose and shut down the inciters of antisemitism, recruiters to violence, perpetrators of terrorism, and the networks that finance this activity. The initiative represents what Broidy sees as essential private sector leadership in combating hate when institutions fail to act.  Call for Immediate Action  As Jewish communities prepare for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur—the holiest days of the Jewish calendar focused on reflection, repentance, and renewal—Elliott Broidy called for urgent action from multiple sectors:  Educational Institutions: Universities must implement meaningful reforms to restore academic freedom and eliminate discriminatory environments. "Federal funding should be contingent on compliance with civil rights law," Broidy stated.  Healthcare Systems: Medical institutions must enforce professional standards that prohibit discrimination based on patient nationality or the origin of medical treatments.  Technology Platforms: Social media companies must address the sophisticated disinformation campaigns that fuel antisemitic sentiment, particularly those originating from state actors like Iran.  Government Action: Continued enforcement of civil rights protections and adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism by more jurisdictions.  "The battle for truth is being fought on platforms we use daily, in classrooms that shape future leaders, and in hospitals where lives hang in the balance," Broidy concluded. "Unless we fight back with everything we can muster, this hatred will continue to corrode the very professions meant to uphold life, truth, culture, and justice."
