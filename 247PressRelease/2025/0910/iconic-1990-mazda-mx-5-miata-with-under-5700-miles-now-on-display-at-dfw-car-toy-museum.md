# Iconic 1990 Mazda MX-5 Miata with Under 5,700 Miles Now on Display at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is delighted to present a true automotive icon — a 1990 Mazda MX-5 Miata, now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. With fewer than 5,700 original miles, this early-production NA Miata offers visitors a pristine example of one of the most beloved sports cars of all time.  Launched in 1989 for the 1990 model year, the original Miata rekindled the spirit of the classic British roadster with unmatched reliability and driving enjoyment. Lightweight, perfectly balanced, and endlessly engaging, the Miata quickly became a global phenomenon — and this meticulously preserved example highlights why.  Powered by a 1.6-liter DOHC inline-four, factory rated at 116 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, the car sends power to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and an optional limited-slip differential — the ideal combination for spirited driving. Chrome exhaust tip, color-keyed bumpers and mirror caps, and signature pop-up headlights complete its classic profile.  Inside the cabin, period-correct features include a cassette stereo with headrest-integrated  speakers, and air conditioning upgraded to R134 refrigerant in 2021. A leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer, 8,000-rpm tachometer, and supporting gauges for fuel, oil pressure, and coolant temperature.  "The original Miata changed the sports car world forever — offering driving joy in its purest form," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "Finding one with such remarkably low mileage and in this condition is extremely rare. We're proud to showcase this pristine example for our visitors to enjoy."
