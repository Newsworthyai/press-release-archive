# New "Retirement Red Flags" Checklist Helps Retirees Protect Their Savings

DES MOINES, IA, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Retirement Red Flags, a retirement education site, unveiled a free, research-informed Retirement Red Flags Checklist. The resource is designed to help retirees spot hidden risks in their plan so they can protect their retirement savings in a rapidly-changing economy.  "It isn't retirement advice; it's retirement education to help retirees protect their financial future," said Nate Crannell, founder of Retirement Red Flags. "Through our retirement podcasts and guides, we explain complex topics like IRMAA surcharges, the Social Security tax torpedo, and required minimum distributions (RMDs) so people can identify red flags early and make more informed decisions."  The Retirement Red Flags platform includes free retirement podcasts, practical guides, expert articles, and an active private Facebook community. Resources are built to educate, not overwhelm, so retirees can ask better questions, coordinate decisions, and navigate retirement with more confidence.  The Checklist Focuses on Questions Retirees Are Asking  • How do I protect my retirement savings during market volatility?  • How are Social Security benefits taxed in my state, and what is the "tax torpedo"?  • What are the current RMD rules, and how do I avoid penalties for missed Required Minimum Distributions?  • What are Medicare IRMAA surcharges, and how can I reduce premium surprises?  • What is the best withdrawal order for my 401k, IRAs, and taxable accounts?  • What are the common estate planning mistakes, and how do I avoid them?  • What legal documents do I need to protect my plan if something happens, such as powers of attorney and health care directives?  "Retirement planning isn't about predicting markets. It is about reducing avoidable risks," the Retirement Red Flags Team added. "Use the checklist as a conversation starter with family and trusted professionals."
