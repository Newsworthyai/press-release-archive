# Peter Winkelmann and Anja Racić to Lead Queen's Fools' Bold New Immersive Chaos Ritual, HAG

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Something wicked (and deeply weird) this way comes.   The Queen's Fools Theatre Company is psyched to announce that international performance weirdos (we mean that lovingly) Peter Winkelmann and Anja Racić will be leading the charge in HAG—our new immersive fever dream of a show, opening October 9th, 2025 in Los Angeles. Also, not to brag (but we're definitely bragging), the entire run sold out in twelve hours. So.  What Even Is HAG? HAG is not your grandma's theatre production (unless your grandma is a chaos witch). It's immersive. It's experimental. It's audience-driven. And it's built on a slippery mix of improv, research, and the kind of rehearsal process that scares traditional dramaturgs. It evolves every night, based on who shows up and how weird they're willing to get.  About Peter & Anja (Our Brave HAGs-in-Chief) In a show that laughs in the face of scripts and embraces unpredictability, Peter and Anja aren't just the leads—they're co-conspirators. They've been in it from the jump, workshopping the piece through live audience test runs and letting the show grow in the wild.  They're not just showing up and hitting their marks either. Peter and Anja are also helping spread the HAG gospel—engaging with the LA immersive scene, dragging people into the madness (with consent), and helping shape the production from the inside out.  A Little Street Cred Queen's Fools has already made a name for itself by doing the kind of immersive theatre that leaves audiences wondering what just happened—and when they can do it again. We've been featured in places like No Proscenium and Last Call Theatre for work described as "unlike any other." Which, let's be honest, is the nicest way to say "this broke my brain but I liked it." Catch up on the chaos:  - Queen's Fools Website  - Last Call Theatre Review – "Unlike Any Other Midsummer"  - No Proscenium Fringe Coverage  - No Proscenium podcast Feature on Festival Season  Leadership Says Things "Peter and Anja bring the exact combination of consistency, experience, and fearless creativity that HAG needs to thrive. Every night will be a living, breathing, unrepeatable piece of theatre—and they're the kind of performers who live for that kind of beautiful uncertainty," said Mason Conrad, CEO of Queen's Fools Theatre Company.  (Yes, we have a CEO. No, he doesn't own a suit.)  About Queen's Fools  We're a Los Angeles-based theatre company dedicated to making immersive and experimental performance that doesn't suck. We like improvisation, collaboration, and throwing audiences into the deep end—gently. Our goal is to make theatre that's alive, weird, and never the same twice.
