# Phoenix Foundry Announces Peter Winkelmann in Lead Role of Aurora 7

LOS ANGELES, CA, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Phoenix Foundry proudly announces that acclaimed actor Peter Winkelmann is the first actor attached to a lead role in its upcoming feature film Aurora 7. Filming is set to begin on April 1, 2026, with the production running for eight months.  Aurora 7 is an ambitious and intelligent science fiction horror film that blends elements of existential dread, thriller tension, and speculative sci-fi into a story that feels as intimate as a stage play while delivering the sweep of a much larger cinematic project. Designed to push the limits of what can be achieved within the ultra-low budget filmmaking category, the film promises both intellectual depth and emotional resonance.  Peter Winkelmann as Ty Winkelmann has been cast in the lead role of Ty, a character central to the film's exploration of human survival, fear, and connection against a backdrop of science fiction and horror. The role demands exceptional range and precision, as Ty is both an emotional anchor and the narrative guide through the story's shifting layers of suspense and intensity.  Impact on the Production Peter's casting strengthens Aurora 7's ability to deliver a performance-driven film experience. Unlike many genre films where spectacle can dominate, Aurora 7 will rely heavily on Winkelmann's craft as an actor, his ability to shape tension, and his command of character to sustain momentum. His central performance will be decisive in setting the standard for the film's tone and authenticity.  "Peter brings a unique level of intensity and emotional truth to the role of Ty. His dedication to performance will ensure that Aurora 7 resonates with audiences far beyond expectations for a project of this budget scale," said Jud Grubbs, CEO of Phoenix Foundry.
