# Hey Vancouver–Meet the DoorDash of Document Scanning

VANCOUVER, BC, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Over the course of 50 years in Vancouver's document conversion space, MCS has served many thousands of companies, from Mom and Pop home-based businesses to monolithic multinationals. Businesses generate paper records, whatever the size, and many embrace document scanning and digitization as a regular component of record-keeping. For more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/scan-your-paper-files-at-your-place-sure-why-not/  One thing that all firms have in common is the need for their paper files to be treated confidentially. In the overwhelming majority of these situations, Micro Com's clients have a high level of comfort sending materials to its Burnaby-based facility. However, a small percentage prefer to have an onsite scanning environment set up with all work completed on premises.  Micro Com has offered on-site scanning since 1992–way before DoorDash and InstaCart popularized door-to-door. The process involves assembling a trained team of staff who will arrive with the appropriate hardware and reassemble it in the customer's space.  Metrics and equipment are dictated by project requirements and timelines.  Some businesses prefer to undertake these tasks with a large team and complete them quickly, while others are happier with a slower pace. The customer is always right, so Micro Com can adjust output to meet client expectations and schedules.  Onsite Scanning Services in Vancouver  Micro Com Systems provides all the necessary equipment for on-site scanning. All that's required is sufficient space for people, desks, chairs and access to the files.   Depending on security, Micro Com can arrange to transfer the completed scans and metadata via any means for optimal security: external hard drives, thumb drives, DVD, etc. The team operates completely autonomously, offering a made-to-measure onsite scanning service that meets client needs door-to-door – no tipping required.

Their list of products and services include: Document Imaging & Management, Archival & Book Scanning, Medical Imaging, OCR, Large Format Scanning, Microfilm Scanning, Aperture Card Scanning, Enterprise Report Management (ERM), High Speed Printing, Capture Software, and Capture Equipment.
