# INTERNATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION ANNOUNCES SUPPORT OF TEXAS PROPOSITION 4

IRVING, TX, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Plastics Pipe Institute, Inc. (PPI), the major trade association representing all segments of the plastic pipe industry, has endorsed Proposition 4, the November 2025 ballot measure that will provide long-term, dedicated funding for the Texas water infrastructure. The not-for-profit group also urges Texans to vote YES on Proposition 4 to strengthen the state's water systems and prepare for the future.   "Texas leaders took the proper first step by passing legislation to address our state's growing water challenges," said David M. Fink, president, PPI. "By advancing Proposition 4 to the voters, the Legislature and Governor Abbott have shown foresight and responsibility in ensuring Texas is prepared for both population growth and recurring drought. I don't think that ever before in our association's 75-year history have we seen such a dire situation.  "Plastic piping is a proven solution to help Texas achieve the goals of Proposition 4," Fink continued. "Those systems reduce water loss, especially in seismically sensitive areas, resist corrosion and last longer than traditional materials â€” meaning less taxpayer money spent on repairs and more water delivered where it's needed. There's also another environmental benefit. Millions of pounds of recycled materials are used, for example, to manufacturer large diameter corrugated stormwater drainage pipe. Our members are committed to sustainability and innovation," Fink continued, "and many are already leading the way in recycling, material recovery, and product design to support circularity.  "PPI and our members are ready to help expand this proven technology in Texas," he summed up, "ensuring that every dollar invested through Proposition 4 builds infrastructure that is durable, efficient, and sustainable for decades to come."
