# Carlsbad Department of Development to Host Franchise Expo

CARLSBAD, NM, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Carlsbad Department of Development (CDOD) is proud to announce the inaugural Carlsbad Franchise Expo, set for October 15, 2025, from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM at the Pecos River Village Conference Center. The event is designed to connect community members eager to invest locally with franchise brands and territory owners seeking to expand into one of New Mexico's fastest-growing markets.  Alongside expo networking opportunities, attendees will have access to two educational modules covering how to start a business, what it means to buy into a franchise, and strategies for long-term success. Lunch will be provided to all registered participants. Registration is free and available at https://www.developcarlsbad.org/site-selectors/franchise-expo-2025  "Carlsbad is poised to grow," said Jeff Campbell, Director of Marketing and Business Development. "There are many opportunities for local investors to step up and be a part of the solution to fill in the gaps in our market as determined in part by our leakage study. Keep dollars in Carlsbad while building community wealth."  Carlsbad's strong growth and unmet market demand provide fertile ground for franchise development. A recent leakage analysis conducted with Retail Strategies, a national firm that helps communities attract brands, identified key commercial gaps where consumer dollars are leaving the area.  "This expo isn't just about bringing national brands here, it's about empowering local investors and entrepreneurs to seize opportunities, while giving franchise systems a direct line into Carlsbad's growing economy," said Kristen Gamboa, Executive Director of the Carlsbad Department of Development. "We want to grow with franchise partners and with our community."  The CDOD is confident the Franchise Expo will be a powerful platform to attract new businesses, empower local investors, and strengthen Carlsbad's position as a hub for commerce and growth in New Mexico.
