# Shanghai Conservatory of Music Press

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Budapest, Vienna, and Munich, July 20–28, 2025 — Supported by the Shanghai Municipal "Chinese Culture Going Global" Special Fund, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Press successfully concluded the International Promotion of Selected Chinese Piano Pieces project and the 2025 Music Traveler – European Tour of Chinese Piano Works Summer Program. The initiative marked a significant step forward in presenting Chinese musical culture on the international stage.  Compiled by renowned piano educator Professor Dan Zhaoyi, Selected Chinese Piano Pieces is highly regarded for its artistic and pedagogical value. Following its 2021 English edition published in New Zealand, the collection has now been officially released in four languages—English, German, French, and Hungarian—by Editio Musica Budapest, making it widely available across Europe. Building on this achievement, the Press organized a series of events including a multilingual book launch, concerts, and master classes, creating a new model for global promotion of Chinese piano music.  On July 21, the book launch was held at the House of Music in Budapest, followed by a concert where 14 Chinese teachers and students performed works such as Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon, Jasmine Flower, and Pictures of Bashu. Hungarian musicians Gábor Gadó (cello) and Péter Jéger (piano) joined in with moving renditions of The Blooming of the Mountain Azaleas and My Motherland and Me, reflecting their deep appreciation of Chinese culture.  During the program, participants attended master classes with leading European musicians, including Imre Hargitai, Anikó Novák, Markus Prause, and Zhang Liming, and met Professor Walter Fleischmann, a legendary figure of the Viennese Piano School. In Munich, the delegation visited G. Henle Verlag, where President Dr. Norbert Gertsch shared the German tradition of musical craftsmanship. Students even performed Chinese works on a piano once played by Evgeny Kissin.  This nine-day program left lasting impressions on both Chinese participants and European audiences. Experts and musicians praised the professionalism and enthusiasm of the delegation, affirming the cultural and artistic value of Chinese piano works. The success of this initiative demonstrates Shanghai's commitment to cultural exchange and to bringing Chinese music to the world.
