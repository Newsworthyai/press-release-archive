ATLANTA, GA, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, expands its reach in schools across the region through youth wellness programs that increase dairy milk consumption. This year, the organization awarded Dairy Optimization (DO), Fuel Up, and GENYOUth grants, benefiting nearly 375,000 students in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.   "Dairy nutrition education in schools plays a vital role in shaping healthy habits early," said Laura Buxenbaum, VP Health and Wellness at The Dairy Alliance. "These grants give schools the resources to serve milk in fresh and engaging ways, whether through smoothies, milk dispensers, or other fun programs, while providing students with the energy and nutrition they need to learn, grow, and excel. By combining our expertise, the dedication of local dairy farmers, and the commitment of schools to student health, we create lasting change that supports both kids and communities across the Southeast."   The Dairy Alliance awarded 124 Dairy Optimization (DO) grants in spring 2025, funding programs such as Moo Brew, Smoothies, and Milk Dispensers to enhance the school milk experience for more than 80,000 students.

The Dairy Alliance Youth Wellness team trains school nutrition staff to use grant-funded equipment and implement programs effectively. The team delivers dairy nutrition education to help students understand the benefits of milk and dairy foods for building strong bones and bodies. Milk delivers 13 essential nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, and protein.
