# What To Do Before the Painters Arrive: Tips from Pedigree's Residential House Painters in Vancouver

VANCOUVER, BC, September 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There's no home pick-me-up like a fresh coat of paint. As home painters in Vancouver, the award-winning team at Pedigree has a few tips for homeowners wondering how to best prepare for interior painting. For more, go to https://www.pedigreepainting.com/blog/white-rock-painters-residential-interior-painting-preparation-guide-what-to-do-before-the-painters-arrive  Prepping for residential interior painting may seem like a small step, but the truth is that it can make for a hassle-free, speedy, and more certain process. While working with proven professionals takes a certain weight off the shoulders, the role of the homeowner doesn't end with signing the contract. Some basic planning and preparation will go a long way to better final results that meet timelines and project expectations, while ensuring belongings remain safe and clean.  Preparation for Residential Interior Painting  Many of the delays and miscommunications that accompany house painting are the result of a simple lack of prep. When painters arrive and rooms are still full of furniture, or walls haven't been cleared of decorations, things slow down, and, in some cases, painters may have to scramble to meet timelines, potentially impacting the quality of the work.  Declutter and Protect Belongings  Preparation is a lot like setting the stage: the cleaner and more clutter-free the home, the more professional and efficient the outcomes will be. After hiring residential painters in Vancouver, start by focusing on areas of work. Remove or cover anything that could get in the way or potentially get damaged.  Objectives  Some items must be removed when house painting: wall hangings, photos, mirrors, and clocks. Take down curtains and blinds, especially if the window frames need to be painted. Move furniture out of the room when possible or place items in the center.  Store small objects like plants and electronics away from the painting area. Cover flooring with drop cloths or allow the painters to do this upon arrival.  Taking these steps will create a safe and accessible space, allowing the painters to complete their job without interruption and with minimal risk to belongings and furniture.  Clean Walls and Fix Minor Issues in Advance  Paint adheres best to clean, smooth surfaces. If the walls are dusty, greasy, or full of nail holes and bumps, it will affect how evenly the paint goes on and how long it lasts. While most professional painters in Vancouver will undertake basic prep like sanding and priming, it's helpful to take care of small tasks ahead of time.  Give walls a quick wipe-down with a damp cloth (especially in kitchens and bathrooms). For holes or scuffs, ask whether the painters will patch them up or if they should be addressed before arrival. A little communication goes a long way.  Make a Plan for Pets, Kids, and Daily Routines  Residential interior painting can disrupt day-to-day life, especially if it involves multiple rooms. Think ahead: will family members be in the house while work is being done? Is there a place where kids and pets can stay safe and out of the way?  If home painters are working room by room, it might make sense to adjust their routines to avoid overlapping work areas. Planning will reduce frustration and make the whole experience much more manageable.  Communicate Details and Preferences in Advance  Even the best residential house painting team can't read your mind. Any specific concerns or preferences should be shared before starting the project, for example:  • Paint finishes and colour choices (confirm samples if needed) • Areas to avoid (for example, custom wallpaper that shouldn't be painted over) • Preferred hours for the crew to be on-site • Concerns about odour, ventilation, or furniture handling  A quick conversation or checklist can go a long way toward ensuring your expectations align with the contractor's process.  Leave it to Vancouver's Painting Pros.  When painting day arrives, it's best to be around and welcome the team, walking them through the space. Discuss any last-minute details or concerns, then give the painters space to work. Trusting the contractors to do their job and give them space to work, but feel free to check in. With collaboration and effective management, the job will be completed quickly and efficiently.
