# Witness the Legacy: 1914 Benz 18/45 Four Passenger Runabout Showcases Pre-War Elegance at DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, April 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to present a remarkable piece of pre-war automotive history—the 1914 Benz 18/45 Four Passenger Runabout—now on display as part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection. This rare and exquisite vehicle represents the golden era of luxury motoring and stands as a testament to the engineering brilliance of Karl Benz, one of the most influential figures in the early automotive industry.  By the early 20th century, the automobile had evolved beyond its horse-drawn carriage roots, with Benz playing a critical role in pioneering superior craftsmanship and engineering. Unlike mass-produced vehicles of its time, the Benz 18/45 catered to the elite, offering superior performance, exquisite design, and unparalleled luxury. With a chassis price of $3,250 in 1911, this model was a true status symbol, rivaling the likes of Rolls-Royce in exclusivity.  Under the hood, the Benz 18/45 is powered by an efficient 4.9-liter four-cylinder L-Head engine, producing 45 horsepower—a remarkable feat for its time. The V-shaped radiator, a signature feature of select 18/45 models, adds to its distinctive and iconic aesthetic. Power is routed through a smooth-shifting Benz four-speed transmission, ensuring a driving experience that was both refined and powerful for the era.  The Benz 18/45 owes much of its legendary status to the company's racing pedigree. The famous Blitzen Benz, with its 21-liter engine, set multiple land speed records, including an astonishing 141.7 mph run at Ormond Beach, Florida, a record that stood until 1919. This legacy of performance and innovation is deeply embedded in every Benz automobile of the era, including the 18/45.  This particular 1914 Benz 18/45 Four Passenger Runabout is a stunning example of pre-war automotive design, featuring attractive brass lights, accessories, and unique non-standard coachwork that enhances its sporty, nimble feel. Unlike the heavy-bodied vehicles typical of the time, this Benz remains surprisingly spirited, making it a true standout among classic automobiles.  Now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, this historic automobile is one of over 200 incredible vehicles available for enthusiasts and visitors to admire. With free admission and a dog-friendly atmosphere, the museum provides a unique opportunity to step back in time and witness the evolution of automotive excellence.
