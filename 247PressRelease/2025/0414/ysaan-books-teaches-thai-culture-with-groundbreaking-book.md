# Ysaan Books Teaches Thai Culture with Groundbreaking Book

SAKON NAKHON, THAILAND, April 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Independent publisher Ysaan Books in Sakon Nakhon has announced the release of "Discover Thai Culture through Poetry: Cross-Cultural Poems for Creative Learning," a one-of-a-kind educational resource authored by Ajarn David."   This groundbreaking book offers a compelling approach to teaching Thai culture and values through poetry, while simultaneously developing students' critical and creative thinking skills. To celebrate the book's publication, Ysaan Books is offering the eBook Kindle version free from April 14th - 16th on Amazon.  Blending lyrical expression with real-world cultural insights, this activity-based textbook invites readers into the everyday rhythms, beliefs, and traditions of Thailand through the lens of 40 original Thai poems in English, each accompanied by a black and white illustration.   These free verse poems are drawn from the author's previously published collection, "Poems from Sakon Nakhon," a heartfelt work of 91 pieces inspired by rural Thai life, Buddhist philosophy, and the human experience in Isaan—the culturally rich Northeast region of Thailand.  Using Thai Culture to Enhance Thinking Skills  Unlike conventional cultural textbooks that rely on dry facts or textbook-style summaries, "Discover Thai Culture through Poetry" immerses learners in the lived texture of Thai life. Each poem is paired with context-building commentary, open-ended reflection questions, and hands-on creative activities that encourage deeper engagement and personal exploration. The result is a dynamic learning experience that promotes empathy, intercultural awareness, and intellectual curiosity.  "This book is meant to spark conversation, reflection, and a sense of connection across cultures," said Ajarn David. "Poetry has the power to communicate subtle truths and shared emotions that a simple textbook can't always reach. I wanted students to not just study Thailand, but to feel it—through stories, imagery, and reflection."  This innovative Thai culture workbook is tailored for high school students, university learners, and homeschoolers, and is well-suited for interdisciplinary use in classrooms focused on global studies, literature, creative writing, Thai language, and Southeast Asian culture.   Teachers will appreciate the flexibility of its format, while students will be drawn to the authenticity and accessibility of the poetic content. In addition, a "Teacher's Edition" of the book, with sample answers, is available to guide teachers through the engaging cross-cultural education.  "Ajarn David has created something truly original," said a spokesperson for Ysaan Books. "This textbook stands at the crossroads of literature and global multicultural education. It reflects our mission to support voices that deepen our understanding of regional Thai culture in a way that's both beautiful and practical."  Ysaan Books emphasizes that the book is ideal for educators seeking to integrate global competence into their curriculum in a meaningful and humanistic way. It also offers an excellent resource for readers of all ages interested in exploring Thailand beyond tourist brochures and into the heart of everyday life, seen through a poetic lens.
