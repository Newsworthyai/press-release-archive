# Attorney Laura Wilson Selected to Serve on Lucas County Child Protection Task Force

TOLEDO, OH, June 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Laura Wilson, attorney at Schaffer & Associates LPA, has been appointed to the newly established Lucas County Child Protection Task Force. The Board of Lucas County Commissioners created this task force following the tragic death of Kei'Mani Latigue, a young girl killed by her father despite prior warnings to Lucas County Children Services. According to an agency spokesperson, multiple reports about the teen were investigated, but evidence that would lead to removal from the home was not found.  The task force aims to review and address systemic, procedural, and operational challenges in the local child protection system. Its work will focus on identifying ways to improve the services and partnerships necessary to protect children and support families in the community.  Wilson joins 26 other individuals selected from various sectors, including system professionals, mandatory reporters, community leaders, and public safety officials. The group will collaborate with Casey Family Programs to assess the effectiveness of existing child protection policies and procedures.  Wilson, who has a background in legal advocacy for families and children, will contribute to efforts aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of children in Lucas County. She will collaborate with the task force to recommend necessary reforms and improvements.  The first meeting took place on May 28, 2025, to establish goals and expectations. The community's engagement in child welfare issues, as evidenced by over 200 applications for task force membership, has been acknowledged by the Board of Lucas County Commissioners as a positive step toward strengthening the child protection system.
