# FRACTURED TO FREEDOM – Unlock Your Healing Journey: A Practical Guide to Reclaiming Inner Peace and Vibrant Well-being

SAN JOSE, CA, June 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Independence Day is often marked by outward symbols of freedom like flags, parades, and bursts of fireworks. But Fractured to Freedom, launching July 4, turns the spotlight inward. It challenges the idea that freedom must be loud or celebrated in spectacle. Instead, it suggests that true independence begins quietly, when we reclaim the parts of ourselves lost to pain, fear, or silence.  The timing of this release is intentional. For many, healing is its own form of liberation. It does not unfold in a single dramatic moment, but gradually, in the decision to let go, to tell the truth, and to live without emotional armor. While the country honors collective liberty, Fractured to Freedom holds space for personal release, for the kind of freedom that does not need fireworks to matter. It asks us to consider what if independence means simply learning to breathe with ease, love with openness, and live without apology.  "This book is more than a story; it's a deeply personal invitation to take full responsibility for your well-being and actively participate in your own healing," Perry explains. "My journey wasn't linear, but every stumble became a vital lesson. Releasing this on July 4th means something real to me—not because of fireworks, but because I know what it's like to be trapped in your own story and to finally find your way out."  About the Book Fractured To Freedom is a comprehensive and interactive guide to holistic healing, meticulously structured into nine insightful sections designed for personal growth. It begins with Al Perry's raw and inspiring personal narrative, detailing his transformation from a "fractured" individual to a skilled healer and teacher. The book then systematically introduces readers to a range of powerful, actionable tools and concepts, complemented by dedicated journal lines and prompts for immediate application and deeper self-reflection: • Creating a Healthy Mindset: Daily practices for cultivating gratitude, conscious breathing, and intentional living. • The Mystical Dance of Fascia: Exploring the body's connective tissue and gentle "Yin Stretches" to release stored tension. • Energy Anatomy: Understanding Chakras, auras, meridians, and how pain can reveal energetic imbalances. • Personalized Nutrition: Mindful eating, sugar awareness, and the importance of individualized nourishment. • Meditation: Quiet techniques for cultivating presence, including the "One-Minute Reset Meditation." • Mastering Sleep Hygiene: Practical ways to support deep, restorative rest. • Transforming Emotional Energy: Applying Taoist Five Element theory and Qigong to reshape emotional experience.  Al Perry offers readers an honest and grounded guide to healing, blending ancient Taoist wisdom with practical insight. His approach emphasizes that freedom doesn't always announce itself with noise. Sometimes, it whispers through stillness, breath, or the courage to show up differently.  Reader Reflections "Al Perry's wisdom is a beacon of light for anyone feeling lost or in pain. His story is incredibly relatable, and the tools he provides, especially with the journal prompts, are truly transformative. This book is a must-read for anyone seeking genuine healing and practical steps for a better life."  About the Author Al Perry has spent over 36 years helping others heal from emotional, physical, and energetic pain.
