# Brisa Therapeutics Joins Heart of the Big Bend Podcast to Explore Nature's Role in Mental and Emotional Wellness

ALPINE, TX, June 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a powerful new episode of the award-winning Heart of the Big Bend podcast, hosted by Chris Ruggia on KVLF/KALP Radio Alpine, Toni and Jacque of Brisa Therapeutics joined the mic to share transformative insights about the intersection of mental health and the natural world.  The episode, titled Desert Magic: Mental / Emotional Health and the Outdoors, explores how environments like the Big Bend region serve as more than a visual escape—they function as active participants in emotional healing, nervous system regulation, and personal restoration.  Nature, Neuroscience & Nervous System Healing Drawing from their clinical experience and integrative therapeutic work, the Brisa team walked listeners through concepts including: • Bilateral stimulation in nature (e.g., walking rhythms, eye movement across landscapes) • How the desert uniquely supports EMDR-style healing and grounding • The neuroscience behind nervous system resets when immersed in wide, open spaces • Why emotional regulation and self-connection are easier in environments like Alpine, TX  "It's not just about being outside—it's about what being outside does to the brain," noted Toni.   "Nature speaks directly to the body's rhythm and restores what busy life disrupts."  The conversation also included reflections on trauma-informed care, resilience, and the Brisa team's own experience creating spaces for healing in both clinical and natural settings.
