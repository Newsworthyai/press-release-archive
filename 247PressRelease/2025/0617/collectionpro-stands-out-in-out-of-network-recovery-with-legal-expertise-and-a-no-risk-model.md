# CollectionPro Stands Out in Out-of-Network Recovery with Legal Expertise and a No-Risk Model

NEW YORK, NY, June 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an evolving healthcare payment landscape marked by shrinking reimbursements and mounting payer pushbacks, providers are turning to smarter, more aggressive solutions to protect their bottom line. One company that has emerged as a powerful ally in the Out-of-Network (OON) collections space is CollectionPro Services LLC, blending legal firepower with practical revenue cycle strategies — and doing so with zero financial risk to the provider.  With a multi-state licensed in-house attorney based at Carnegie Hall Tower, 59th Floor, New York, CollectionPro brings deep expertise in navigating the No Surprises Act (NSA). Having managed over 10,000 arbitration cases with a 92% success rate, this legal-first approach offers healthcare providers a decisive edge — particularly in complex disputes and long-overdue out-of-network payments.  What truly distinguishes CollectionPro is its flat 10% contingency model. Providers pay nothing unless a recovery is made — a performance-based structure that applies across specialties, including challenging areas like anesthesia, emergency care, neonatology, and air ambulance services. There are absolutely no setup fees, no binding contracts, and no hidden costs, ensuring complete transparency and flexibility.  Furthermore, CollectionPro covers all administrative and arbitration fees upfront — costs that typically range from $115 to $1,200 per case. By removing this common barrier, the company empowers providers to pursue underpayment disputes with greater confidence and zero out-of-pocket expense.  Additionally, the company specializes in reviving previously denied or overlooked OON claims. Under NSA guidelines, claims dated January 1, 2022 or later, are eligible for arbitration — even if they've already been rejected by payers. CollectionPro regularly helps providers reclaim revenue thought to be lost, leveraging both legal insight and strategic case review to deliver meaningful results.  "Our goal has always been to level the playing field for providers," said the spokesperson of CollectionPro. "We don't just manage claims — we fight for every dollar that's rightfully owed," he added.  With real-time reporting dashboards, transparent communications, and full HIPAA compliance, CollectionPro is already working with a growing number of hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and physician groups across the country. The company has become quiet an effective force behind recovering millions and improving financial outcomes without disrupting practice operations.  About CollectionPro: CollectionPro Services LLC is a New York-based firm specializing in revenue collection solutions for healthcare providers across the United States. Founded to address the challenges of securing fair reimbursements from payers, while offering expert assistance in Out-of-Network (OON) claims resolution, No Surprises Act (NSA) arbitration services, and comprehensive Accounts Receivable (AR) and claims management services, their services include managing A/R from payers like Medicare and commercial insurers, addressing denials, underpayments, and long adjudication cycles to optimize collections.
