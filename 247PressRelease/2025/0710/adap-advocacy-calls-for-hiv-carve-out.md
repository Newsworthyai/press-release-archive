# ADAP Advocacy Calls for HIV Carve-Out

WASHINGTON, DC, July 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy has submitted public comments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the proposed guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program ("Negotiation Program"), established under the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), calling for a carve-out on HIV antiretroviral therapies. ADAP Advocacy has requested this carve-out exemption due to the serious nature of the threat facing People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), should HIV medications be selected as part of the Negotiation Program.  Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, stated: "CMS is playing with fire if it targets HIV medications as part of its drug price negotiations, potentially putting the lives of PLWHA at risk. Patients who lose access to HIV medications may fall out of treatment entirely, placing them at risk of dying from opportunistic infections or having their HIV mutate to develop resistance to the medications used to achieve viral suppression. The cornerstone of the progress we've made in combating the HIV epidemic is adopting a 'treatment as prevention' approach, which saves money by preventing expensive health complications, as well as new HIV infections."
