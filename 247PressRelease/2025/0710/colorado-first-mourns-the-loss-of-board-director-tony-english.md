# Colorado FIRST Mourns the Loss of Board Director Tony English

DENVER, CO, July 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It is with deep sorrow that Colorado FIRST announces the passing of Board Director and Executive Director Tony English on June 16, 2025. Tony was a tireless advocate for STEM education, a visionary leader, and a beloved member of the Colorado FIRST community. His legacy will continue to shape and inspire generations of students across Colorado.  Tony was a mechanical engineer, Army veteran, and co-owner of Neaera Consulting Group, where he led cutting-edge work in connected and automated vehicle systems. He began his journey with FIRST in 2006 by launching a FIRST® LEGO® League team for his three children. That humble beginning grew into Team 4499 "The Highlanders", a FIRST® Robotics Competition team that has impacted over 150 students—many of whom have gone on to pursue STEM degrees and careers.  Tony's passion, mentorship, and leadership earned national recognition in 2015 when he received the Woody Flowers Finalist Award. He joined the Colorado FIRST Board of Directors in May 2022, with a clear mission: to expand access to FIRST programs and ensure more students across the state would be inspired by STEM.  The Colorado FIRST Board has unanimously appointed Debbie English to serve as Executive Director and Board Member. A long-standing Program Leader for Colorado FIRST and current Program Delivery Partner for the FIRST Robotics Competition, Debbie has demonstrated unwavering dedication to advancing STEM opportunities for Colorado's youth. Her deep commitment, leadership, and shared vision with her late husband, Tony, make her exceptionally well-suited to guide Colorado FIRST into its next chapter.  "We are heartbroken by Tony's passing," said the Colorado FIRST Board in a joint statement. "He brought unmatched energy, wisdom, and kindness to our mission. We are honored that Debbie will continue his work, and we know she will lead with the same heart and dedication that Tony embodied every day."  Tony's legacy will forever be a part of Colorado FIRST. We will miss him deeply—and carry his vision forward with purpose.
