WEATHERFORD, TX, July 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Beauty has always been a passion for Marquita Montgomery, who has been styling hair since she was 12 years old.   "Growing up, I learned so many skills from my sister, who is a stylist," Montgomery said. "I was always doing hair, practicing on friends and family – not just for fun, but because it made people smile."  Even as a child, Montgomery dreamed of being a business owner, so she focused on getting her education. After graduation from Ogle School of Beauty in Fort Worth, she was ready to make her dream a reality.  Now, she's done exactly that. Montgomery recently opened her own business – M5 Crown Of Beauty LLC in the Salon and Spa Galleria Weatherford. At her salon, Montgomery offers a variety of beauty services, including shampoos, deep conditioning treatments; cuts and trims; color and highlights; perms and relaxers; silk press; braids and twists; and extensions.  Montgomery specializes in enhancing the natural beauty of all hair types, with a focus on healthy hair, personalized style, and providing a superior salon experience. M5 Crown Of Beauty LLC was borne from her own journey of learning to love and care for textured hair.  "People struggle with decisions and insecurities in regards to their hair," Montgomery said. "I would love to be a part of restoring their confidence. Every service I offer is rooted in personal experience, passion, and the belief that healthy hair is more than a look. It's a reflection of self-love," she added.  Through exceptional service, professionalism and a caring touch, Montgomery strives to create an experience where beauty meets boldness, and every crown is honored with purpose.  "My mission is to empower every client who walks through my door to feel seen, valued, and confidently crowned" Montgomery said. "At M5 Crown of Beauty LLC, I don't just style hair – I bring your vision to life."   For anyone curious about her business name, Montgomery explained that the 'M' honors her family's last name, while the '5' represents her family: herself, her husband and their three daughters.  "And Crown Of Beauty comes from me reminding my daughters that their hair is their crown and each crown is unique," Montgomery said. "At M5 Crown Of Beauty, I want to create a space where crowns are honored, stories are shared, and confidence is restored strand by strand," she added.
