# New Epic Fantasy Series Unleashed with the Upcoming Release of Defenders of the Five Realms: Book One – The Dark Witch

WINTHROP, MA, July 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A thrilling new fantasy saga is set to unfold with the release of The Dark Witch, the first book in the series' opening trilogy, launching the ongoing Defenders of the Five Realms series. Crafted for fans of immersive world-building, powerful magic, and high-stakes adventure, this gripping debut sets the stage for a sweeping battle between light and darkness — and the heroes who rise to face it.  The Dark Witch invites readers into a richly imagined universe, filled with unforgettable characters, fierce magic, and legendary lore that will captivate fantasy lovers from the first page to the last.  At the heart of the story is Amanda Tyler, an eleven-year-old girl living in Salem, Massachusetts—unaware that her parents are overthrown royalty from another world. Years ago, they escaped to Earth through a hidden portal, but now their past has caught up with them. Evil forces seeking to prevent an ancient prophecy have found Amanda, and their mission is clear: destroy her before she can fulfill her destiny.  When Amanda is torn from her home and thrust into a dangerous fantasy realm by a mysterious sorceress, she must navigate treacherous terrain, outwit deadly enemies, and awaken the powerful magic that lies dormant within her. With her family's fate—and the fate of the realms—on the line, Amanda begins a journey of transformation that will test her courage, strength, and spirit like never before.  Growing up as a self-described nerd, Gary Pelletier often turned to storytelling as a refuge from bullying and everyday challenges. What began as imaginative play with action figures and hand-built dioramas quickly evolved into a lifelong passion for creating new worlds. In fourth grade, a story about a boy and Bigfoot earned him his first "A" in English—and lit a spark that never faded.  Throughout his youth, he filled notebooks with stories of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. In his teens, he discovered Dungeons & Dragons, using his growing library of tales to craft original campaigns for friends who couldn't get enough of his adventures. Many of the characters and events in the Defenders of the Five Realms series trace their origins back to those early stories. Today, that same spirit of adventure and imagination drives his writing—offering readers an escape into magical worlds where courage, friendship, and destiny await.
