# Kixx Goldman Announces Giveaway Of Bestselling Ebook, 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard', New Article On Thinking Out Of The Box

WILMINGTON, NC, May 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Kixx Goldman has announced that her bestselling ebook, 'Speak From Your Heart And Be Heard: Stories Of Courage And Healing' will be available at no charge May 8 through May 9, 2025 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Dr.-Kixx-Goldman/author/B07XCZ9SXS?. She also announced an article about the importance of learning to think out of the box.  "Thinking out of the box" is a phrase we hear quite often. It is a metaphor for a way to challenge old ideas, and see things from a different perspective, problem solve and develop creative and innovative solutions. Thinking out of the box is more important than ever today, when navigating situations that are subject to rapid change and unpredictability. Above all, it allows us to connect with the intuitive voice that lies within us all. This voice might ask us to color outside the lines, and see possibility where others see boundaries.  Kixx addressed this subject in an article titled,"Thinking Out of the Box", posted on her website at https://drkixxgoldman.com. In that article she wrote in part:  "The World Is a Safer Place." Those are the words of Catherine Oxenberg, a woman whom I admire greatly, spoken after the sentencing of Nxivm Cult leader, Keith Raniere. (Christine Pelisek Published on October 27, 2020 08:51PM EDT)  Catherine Oxenberg is the former Dynasty star, who fought to free her daughter from the Nexium cult. She is known for her tenacity. In 2020, she was confronted with a period of severe physical pain. Finally, with the help of a doctor, she was able to make the connection between all of her past traumatic experiences and the sudden onset of pain and depression, and following that, made a wise treatment choice. (By David Walters Published on June 20, 2023 03:38PM EDT)  What came to mind when I first learned about Catherine Oxenberg and her courage and triumph over travails, was the notion of "thinking out of the box."  I believe the ability to think out of the box gives us a certain degree of flexibility and can lead to problem solving and innovative, creative solutions.  Two women are striking models. They thought out of the box. The first is the courageous bush nurse Sister Elizabeth Kenny,whose life spanned the 19th and 20th centuries.  The other is therapist Rachel Stern, the main character in my story, "Monitored."  Sister Kenny developed a new and controversial approach for treating victims of Polio, previously known as Infantile Paralysis. She lived in Australia during the time of the Polio epidemics and later moved to Minnesota and opened a clinic where her revolutionary methods were applied. Kenny's story inspired me to share my story of therapist Rachel. One could say the two women were of a like-minded persuasion. (Some would say Sister Kenny's story has some parallels with the recent pandemic.)  As a young woman, I heard nurse Kenny's name many times and became curious. A couple of years ago, I noticed a 1946 movie on TCM: Sister Kenny. I was riveted as I watched and thus began my fascination. ("Sister" is a title of courtesy which applies to a more highly qualified nurse.)  I wrote about Rachel Stern and her client, Erik, in my story "Monitored." It is based upon real events in my life, which have been fictionalized. Rachel's therapeutic model is similar to mine. We've both helped clients heal using experiential and emotionally focused therapies.  Elizabeth Kenny and Rachel Stern were of a like-minded persuasion. Some would say Sister Kenny's story has some parallels with the recent pandemic.  Both women bucked the tide of their times, stood up to the establishment and thought out of the box. Their outlooks and therapeutic approaches were innovative and vital to their worlds.  The full text of the piece is available at https://drkixxgoldman.com/inspirational-stories/thinking-out-of-the-box/.  In her bestselling ebook, Dr. Kixx takes readers on a journey that is an illuminating exploration into intuition, resilience, and emotional honesty. Through a collection of eight realistic but fictional stories, she begins to show us key strategies for navigating life's challenges with courage and authenticity. Every one of the stories serves as a compelling testament to the transformative power of honoring one's own inner voice. The key word here is "own". Every form of trauma is unique to the individual, and thus requires an individual approach. The author has a talent that allows her to help guide readers to discover their own paths, without resorting to preaching or promising.  From the struggles of devoted fathers and resilient teachers to the courageous defiance of therapists and survivors, the characters in "Speak from Your Heart" exemplify the resilience of the human spirit and will. Through these stories, readers are reminded of the inherent strength that lies within each of us, inspiring us to heal and reclaim our power. "Speak from Your Heart" is not just a book—it's a beacon of hope and healing, offering readers real insight for navigating life with grace and resilience.  The eight engaging fictional stories in this collection are personal, drawn from experiences in Dr. Kixx's life and the lives of her clients. The characters are tested by everyday traumas...  • A devoted father and his daughter find hope in rewriting their past. • With remarkable grit, a teacher escapes a surprise attack. • To heal his childhood wounds, a man must conquer his fears. • A therapist defies the establishment to protect her clients. • As she confronts the church, a therapist regains her standing. • A woman learns the risks of not speaking out. • By sharing her story and bonding with peers, a woman overcomes her trauma.  As the characters in these stories find the courage to triumph over their challenges, they heal and grow.  Inspired by real life people, characters show readers how to find the courage to transform difficult and traumatic life experiences, speak their truth and reclaim their power.  'Speak From Your Heart and Be Heard: Stories Of Courage And Healing' has received rave reviews from readers and reviewers. Leslie S. Greenberg, PhD, distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, Dept. of Psychology, York University said, " In each story, the characters' resilience is illustrated by how they transform difficult life stories into constructive final narratives. They find the courage to triumph over challenges to heal and they grow. The message of the book: speaking one's truth makes for desired change and healing."  In her review, Liz Moulden said, "The short stories from Speak from Your Heart and Be Heard have given me a second chance and a voice, the voice I never had. What's exciting about this book is each main character in these short stories experienced some kind of abuse/ trauma but each finds their inner voice. With help, they're able to heal. Anyone who has ever experienced abuse or trauma as I have will be able to see snapshots of themselves in these stories."
