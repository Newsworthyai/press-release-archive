# Waterloo Records Announces Newest Subsidiary: Waterloo Sound

AUSTIN, TX, August 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new chapter in Austin's creative landscape begins with the launch of Waterloo Sound, a next-generation post-production studio located within the newly reimagined Waterloo Records. Structured and created to support immersive audio, video post, and vinyl mastering, Waterloo Sound offers artists, engineers, and content creators a flexible, high-performance environment tailored to today's most demanding creative workflows — incorporating music, film, gaming and multimedia storytelling.  "From the grit of outlaw country to the precision of immersive sound, Austin has always redefined the rules," said Emily Gianopoulos, Partner at Waterloo Sound. "Our goal with Waterloo Sound is to carry that same energy forward and give creators a home for what comes next."  Waterloo Sound is built on the Nu•Studio System, a modular, reconfigurable studio platform developed by Grammy® Award-winning engineer Chad Franscoviak. Making its first commercial debut at Waterloo Sound, Nu•Studio delivers Dolby Atmos® and Dolby Vision®-calibrated capabilities for spatial audio production, high-resolution visual playback, remote collaboration, and real-time review. It's a comprehensive toolkit for modern creators working across formats and disciplines.  "Our partnership with Waterloo Sound goes beyond building a studio — it's about bringing a shared vision to life, one rooted in both innovation and musical heritage," said Franscoviak. "This is our first Nu•Studio System in the wild, and launching it here with a team equally committed to progress makes this moment especially meaningful for all of us."  In addition to its immersive toolset, Waterloo Sound includes a vinyl lacquer cutting lathe, enabling high-quality record mastering on site. This makes it one of the only studios in the U.S. to offer both spatial audio post-production and analog vinyl production in one location.  "I'm very excited to be a part of the team in making Waterloo Sound available to the creative community," adds Jon Niess, a mastering engineer and advisor to Nu•Studio, who has mastered vinyl records and mixed ATMOS in Austin for the last 15 years. "Having spent considerable time in Nu•Studio's R&D space in Bozeman, MT with Chad, I can attest to the incredible quality of the sound inside the studio; it is a completely unique, beautiful environment. I'm thrilled at the prospect ofmastering vinyl and mixing ATMOS projects at Waterloo Sound."  Waterloo Sound ocially opens August 30th, inside the newly expanded Waterloo Records located at 1105 N. Lamar Blvd. As a natural extension of Waterloo's long-standing commitment to artists and independent culture, the studio introduces a new space that nurtures Austin's creative roots while supporting the future of modern production.

Co-Owned by Trey Watson and Caren Kelleher, Waterloo Records is expanding its legacy with this next-generation studio. "Waterloo Sound is an asset that is going to elevate the overall allure and attraction of Waterloo Records," said Watson. "I'm enthused about adding this project to deliver something to Austin and the music community that aids in and continues the Waterloo story. It's really something special and I'm just happy to be a part of it!"  The expanded floorplan will also bring new experiences for Waterloo Records patrons.
