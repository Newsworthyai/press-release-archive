# Sculpture in Motion: Legendary 1994 Jaguar XJ220 Joins DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, August 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A masterpiece of British engineering and automotive art now graces the halls of the DFW Car & Toy Museum: the 1994 Jaguar XJ220, finished in striking Le Mans Blue and part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection.  This isn't just any XJ220 — this is chassis number 617, the very last XJ220 ever constructed, originally completed on March 28, 1994, and one of the select few cars retained by Jaguar for its private collection.  Described as "pure automotive sculpture" and "a Rodin on wheels," the Jaguar XJ220 remains one of the most visually stunning and technologically advanced supercars ever created. Initially conceived as a no-compromise racing prototype, the car's debut at the 1988 Birmingham Auto Show sparked an overwhelming demand that led Jaguar to greenlight limited production.  "The XJ220 embodies everything we love about automotive passion and innovation," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "From its record-breaking speed to its exquisite design, this car represents a bold era when Jaguar set out to prove it could match—and surpass—its German and Italian rivals."  Powered by a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, the XJ220 was capable of delivering on its promise of blistering speed and refined luxury. Its name honors its targeted top speed—220 mph—which the car nearly achieved during testing at Nardò, Italy. It also proved quicker to 60 mph than the Ferrari F40 and Lamborghini Diablo, and set a new lap record for production cars at the Nürburgring.  Automotive journalist Galvin Green perfectly captured the XJ220's appeal in CAR Magazine: "Here is a 200mph monster that will fusslessly transport you, and friend, to the south of France with ease… nothing about driving the XJ220 is difficult."  Finished in Le Mans Blue over Smoke Grey leather, this XJ220 remains a pinnacle of Jaguar's supercar legacy. Visitors to the DFW Car & Toy Museum can now view this extraordinary car in person—an ultra-rare chance to stand before the final chapter of the XJ220 story.  Alongside more than 200 rare cars and thousands of collectible toys, the XJ220 now takes its place among the museum's most coveted highlights.  The DFW Car & Toy Museum is one of Texas' top free attractions for automotive enthusiasts, collectors, and families alike.
