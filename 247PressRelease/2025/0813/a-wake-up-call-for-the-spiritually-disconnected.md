# A Wake-Up Call for the Spiritually Disconnected

BEVERLY HILLS, CA, August 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A bold and deeply moving spiritual memoir is making waves in the Christian literary world. I'm Sorry God by Shera Hastings is more than just a personal story, it's a powerful invitation to grace, an unapologetic call to repentance, and a heartfelt guide toward salvation and spiritual maturity through Jesus Christ.  In a world searching for hope, I'm Sorry God arrives as a timely reminder that no one is too far gone for God's forgiveness. Through raw vulnerability and unwavering faith, the author delivers a stirring testimony of how Jesus Christ pulled her from the depths of sin and placed her firmly on the path of redemption. Readers will witness the beauty and pain of spiritual transformation as Hastings recounts her journey from spiritual confusion to clarity, from brokenness to healing, and from doubt to divine revelation.  What sets this book apart is its fearless authenticity. Hastings openly confesses that she is not a theologian, not a religious authority, and not a perfect Christian. Instead, she positions herself as a disciple, an everyday believer led by the Holy Spirit, driven to share the Good News with humility and urgency. This unfiltered honesty allows readers from all backgrounds, Christians, seekers, skeptics, and even those of other faiths, to see themselves in her struggle and feel welcomed into her breakthrough.  God meets us where we are, not where others expect us to be. Whether you're wrestling with addiction, spiritual apathy, or confusion about what it means to follow Christ, this book dares to offer hope grounded in scripture, revelation, and personal experience.  Far from a traditional spiritual self-help manual, I'm Sorry God is a heartfelt offering designed to plant seeds in the souls of the lost and ignite a deeper hunger in those already on the path. It's a call to action for readers to move beyond surface-level faith and pursue an intimate, obedient relationship with God. In a society flooded with watered-down messages and instant-gratification religion, Hastings delivers a refreshing reminder that true discipleship requires work, sacrifice, and a willingness to be tested.  At its core, I'm Sorry God is not about the author, it's about the Author of Life. Through each chapter, readers are challenged to reflect, repent, and rejoice in the promises of God. The message is clear: Jesus Christ already won the ultimate victory, and now it's up to each of us to accept the invitation to walk in that truth.  For those seeking clarity, peace, and purpose in their walk with God, or simply looking for inspiration to start that walk, I'm Sorry God is an essential read. This book is not a conclusion, but a beginning: a seed planted with love, ready to grow in the hearts of all who are willing to seek the truth.  "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand."  I'm Sorry God is coming soon to bookstores near you! For more information or to connect with Shera Hastings' growing ministry, visit www.imsorrygodbook.com
