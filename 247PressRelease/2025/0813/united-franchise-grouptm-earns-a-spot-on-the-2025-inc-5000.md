# United Franchise Group™ Earns a Spot on the 2025 Inc. 5000

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, August 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that United Franchise Group™ has earned a coveted spot on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy's most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.   "We are honored to once again be recognized by Inc. as one of America's fastest-growing private companies," said Ray Titus, CEO of United Franchise Group. "This achievement is a testament to the strength of our brands, the dedication of our franchise owners, and the commitment of our entire team to driving sustainable growth around the world. As we approach 40 years in franchising, this recognition reinforces our mission to empower entrepreneurs and build businesses that make a lasting impact."  This year's Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.   For the full list, company profiles, and a searchable database by industry and location, visit: www.inc.com/inc5000.   "Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company's tenacity and clarity of vision," says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. "These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn't just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy."  Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
