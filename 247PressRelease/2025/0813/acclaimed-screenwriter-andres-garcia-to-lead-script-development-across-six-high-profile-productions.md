These productions bring together a distinguished roster of collaborators, including producer Andres Garcia Aguirre, acclaimed cinematographer Andres Bernal, and other highly regarded department heads with a track record of outstanding, award-worthy work.  "Andres consistently finds the heartbeat of a story," says Brennan.
