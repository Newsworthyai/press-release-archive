# RS Global Group Announce New China Innovative Companies Fund

TAIPEI, TAIWAN, August 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- RS Global Group, the wealth management specialists headquartered in Taiwan, is launching a new China Innovative Companies Fund ("The Fund"), which will focus on achieving long term capital appreciation from China's small- to mid-cap entrepreneurial companies.   The Fund will seek to invest in some of China's lesser known but highly innovative companies within industries which are leveraged to benefit from China's dynamic growing economy driven by an ever-increasing domestic consumer demand.  The Fund will concentrate on companies with innovative management and sound fundamentals, and which have shown capital efficiency and resilience throughout recent turbulent economic cycles.   The Fund will invest 80% of its total net assets in equities of innovative companies located in the People's Republic of China, its administrative and other districts, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the remainder of its net assets on a worldwide basis.   The Fund will carry the normal risks of investing in international, emerging and frontier market securities, such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, and a high level of volatility due to the regulatory environment and the potential actions by governmental regulatory authorities, which could negatively impact performance.   The Fund will only be made available to institutional entities and accredited investors.
