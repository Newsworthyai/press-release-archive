These gates act as a deterrent to unauthorized entry, securing premises by limiting access. With integrated security features such as keypads, intercoms, and remote controls, automated aluminum gates ensure that only authorized individuals can enter the property.   Aluminum gates are particularly advantageous given Vancouver's weather conditions. Aluminum is lightweight and durable with corrosion-resistant properties. In other words, it's easier to install with fewer weight and motor requirements, and it can withstand harsh weather conditions without rusting or warping.  Considerations for Gate Installation  Before installing automated aluminum gates in Vancouver, several factors must be assessed to ensure smooth, functional installation. Lot size, for example, will determine the type of gate needed for installation, typically electric or swinging. Sliding gates require space along the fence line to slide open parallel to the fence, making them suitable for properties with limited space in front.   All automatic gates also require a reliable power source. Planning for electrical access near the installation is crucial. In some cases, solar panels may be used as an alternative power source in areas where the power supply is inconsistent.   Prepping the foundation for automatic gate installation is also essential. Foundations must be robust to support the gate's weight and movement, often involving pouring concrete foundations that are capable of supporting the gate's structure without shifting.  Preparing for Installation  To prepare for the installation of an automatic aluminum gate, property owners should take several steps. Have a professional assess the site to determine the best type of gate for the property's layout and the specific installation challenges it may present. Ensure that the installation is clear of debris, vehicles, and unnecessary objects to provide a clean and safe environment for the technician.
