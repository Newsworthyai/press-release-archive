# flinkey supercharges Ride-Hailing Operations with Digital Vehicle Access Solution

VELBERT, GERMANY, July 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In today's rapidly evolving ride-hailing industry, flinkey - developed by WITTE:digital - offers a mounting-free, digital keyless access solution designed to help operators overcome common hurdles such as manual key handovers and limited vehicle availability. Through a discreet in-vehicle key box and an intuitive mobile app, ride-hailing providers can substantially reduce administrative overhead, improve driver convenience, and optimize fleet performance.  flinkey adds new approach to ride-hailing vehicle access   Currently, many ride-hailing operators rely on time-consuming key handovers, scheduling constraints, and face-to-face interactions. These processes can slow down vehicle allocation, restrict 24/7 access, and drive up costs. By contrast, flinkey enables a fully digital approach to vehicle handovers-keys are accessed and returned virtually, and the physical key is secured in the car. This process allows operators to dynamically manage fleets across multiple locations without sacrificing flexibility or security.  "We see a significant increase of requests and implementations by ride-hailing providers. All of them eager to adopt digital vehicle keys for a faster expansion of their business," states Annika Sänger-Acevedo, Director Sales & Business Development at WITTE:digital.   Tangible benefits for ride-hailing providers  Operators report the following advantages:  • Administrative work reduces as digital handovers minimize paperwork and staff time by replacing cumbersome, face-to-face processes. • Enabling drivers to unlock and return vehicles anytime via a mobile app opens up for expanded operational windows, 24/7 fleet availability and increased revenue potential. • User satisfaction improves since contactless key management eliminates waiting times, empowers drivers to pick up vehicles at their convenience, and enhances the overall service quality. • Centralised control and real-time insights are possible thanks to detailed logging of vehicle access  • The retrofit-friendly and mounting-free solution enables scalability at maximum ease of installation allowing immediate fleet expansion.  Michael Tüllmann, Head of WITTE:digital invites fleet managers to benefit from fewer delays and better resource allocation: "We believe the future of ride-hailing lies in fast, driver-friendly fleet access. With flinkey, operators can eliminate lengthy handovers, streamline day-to-day vehicle operations, and provide a smoother user experience."
