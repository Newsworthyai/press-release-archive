# Roaring Into the Spotlight: 1930 Ford Model A Hot Rod on Display at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, July 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Visitors to the DFW Car & Toy Museum can now feast their eyes on a bold piece of American hot rod history: a 1930 Ford Model A five-window coupe, reborn as a custom-built street rod and powered by a roaring 302ci V8. Part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection, this Model A Hot Rod exemplifies the blend of nostalgia and performance that defines the golden era of car customization.  The coupe's body sits on a Z'd, partially boxed frame with Model B-style front suspension enhanced by disc brake spindles, a panhard bar, radius rods, and shocks. In the rear, ladder bars and coil overs ensure a stable yet aggressive ride. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums—true to hot rod form.  The engine, rebuilt in 2018, is outfitted with Billet Specialties valve covers, billet pulleys, MSD ignition, Patriot "outside chassis" headers, and dual Edelbrock carburetors. Power routes to the rear wheels through a C10 three-speed automatic transmission mounted to a tubular crossmember.  Inside, a four-spoke steering wheel frames a VDO gauge cluster, offering a classic-meets-modern view of vital performance stats including oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level.  "This car is loud, proud, and unapologetically fun—just the way a hot rod should be," says Ron Sturgeon, museum founder and collector. "It's a celebration of American ingenuity and craftsmanship."  The 1930 Ford Model A Hot Rod is now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum in Fort Worth. Admission is free, and visitors of all ages are welcome.
