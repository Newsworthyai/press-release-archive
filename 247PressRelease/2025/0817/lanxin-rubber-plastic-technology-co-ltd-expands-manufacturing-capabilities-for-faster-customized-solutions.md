# Lanxin Rubber &amp; Plastic Technology Co., Ltd., Expands Manufacturing Capabilities for Faster Customized Solutions

ALBANY, NY, August 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In August 2025, Lanxin Rubber & Plastic Technology Co., Ltd. as a custom rubber products manufacturer, further strengthened its innovation capabilities by adding four state-of-the-art 250T silicone molding machines. These new machines enable the integration of liquid injection molding and compression molding, opening new possibilities for enhanced efficiency and precision. This upgrade reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering superior quality, faster turnaround, and greater competitiveness to our global customers.  Traditional solid silicone processing and liquid silicone molding each have their advantages and limitations. Solid silicone processing is ideal for small-to-medium batch, multi-variant customization, offering low mold costs and flexible color changes, making it widely used in seals, gaskets, and tubing. However, it requires higher manual involvement and has a relatively longer production cycle. Liquid silicone molding, on the other hand, uses fully automated injection to achieve high-precision, fast, and large-scale production with minimal waste and excellent stability, making it perfect for medical devices, baby products, electronic components, and precision automotive parts. Its drawbacks include higher mold investment, higher product cost, and less flexibility in color changes. To combine the strengths of both methods and better serve diverse customer needs, Lanxin Rubber & Plastic Technology Co., Ltd. has added four brand-new 250T silicone molding machines, enabling more efficient, precise, and flexible production.   These new machines use liquid silicone, replacing traditional solid materials, offering better cost-efficiency and superior product quality. With excellent flowability, they can produce complex structures and large-size silicone parts with precise mold filling, minimized parting lines, and enhanced overall integrity and accuracy. High-efficiency automation ensures short molding cycles for large-scale production, while the fully enclosed injection process reduces contamination risks and labor costs. In addition, these machines support diverse customization, allowing adjustments in hardness, color, and special properties such as flame retardancy, conductivity, or high transparency, meeting the needs of various industries.  "This expansion represents more than just new equipment - it's our commitment to advancing both quality and cost-efficiency," explained Liu Jun, Application Engineer at Lanxin. "By optimizing manufacturing processes without compromising quality standards, we enable customers to accelerate time-to-market and enhance their competitive edge. Our goal is to be their strategic partner for sustainable growth."
