One reviewer said, "You wrote a novel about a man with a past so messy, he literally hides in a stranger's attic while trying to do the right thing. It's emotional. Unconventional. Thoughtful. There's rare disease rep, ethical drama, and a wildly underrated whistleblower story wrapped in quiet literary suspense."  In a story about Richard McMaster, printed by The Hudson Weekly, Dennis Keller said, "There have been multiple authors that have made a significant contribution to the world of literacy. In the current era, we have come across several first-time authors with the gift of writing. Richard McMaster is an accomplished author whose works have been praised for their depth, complexity, and emotional resonance."  Keller continued with "Richard McMaster never falls into the trap of presenting his characters as simplistic archetypes or caricatures, instead allowing them to emerge as fully-formed individuals with their unique voices and perspectives.  "In addition to his skillful characterization, he is also a master of plot and pacing. The structure of his novels keep readers engaged and invested in the story while also allowing for moments of quiet reflection and contemplation. The author's writing is often described as 'page-turning' or 'gripping,' but it is also imbued with a sense of thoughtfulness and depth that elevates his work beyond mere genre fiction."  Other books by Richard McMaster include his bestselling historical fiction novel, 'Aaron's War', which details the struggles of a Jewish soldier's experience in WWII. It explores coming-of-age, antisemitism, forbidden marriage, PTSD, and substance abuse, resulting in a powerful story that takes the reader's breath away with its dramatic tale of love, bravery, and sacrifice.  Aaron Vanko, an innocent Iowa farm boy, faces the ultimate test that countless veterans have grappled with throughout history: the harrowing decision to take another's life in the name of duty.  But just as Aaron prepares to embark on this mission, a stunning revelation threatens to upend his entire world: he learns of his Jewish heritage, a discovery that shatters his sense of identity and his relationship with the love of his life.  Despite his fears, Aaron moves ahead, fueled by an unwavering sense of duty and patriotism. But now, he must wage war on two fronts - battling the enemy outside who seek to eradicate the Jewish race, and the inner with ethical dilemma that rages within his own soul.  Aaron is taken on an unforgettable journey of self-discovery, courage, and sacrifice, as he confronts the darkest corners of human nature and emerges forever changed.  Readers and reviewers have praised 'Aaron's War'. USA Today bestselling author Holly Roberts called Aarons War, "A coming of age story that grips your soul and takes you on a thought-provoking journey." Tom Porter, author of All I Need To Know About Business I Learned From A Duck stated, "An engaging, informative and thought-provoking tale of survival, love and faith. Make room for Richard McMaster on your list of up-and-coming authors." Lynn M. Safris said, "The descriptions and details given throughout this author's writing draw the reader into each page, making Aaron's journey feel like their own. I believe this book would appeal to a wide audience of readers. I truly enjoyed reading Aaron's War and I highly recommend this book."  Another of his books, 'Voyage Of Life,' is an exploration of overcoming obstacles that leaves readers deeply moved and inspired. It is a must-read for anyone seeking an inspirational journey through the lens of the "Baby Boomer" generation. A captivating love story, 'Voyage Of Life' captures the essence of the coming-of-age 60's with a twist, as the story is told as Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life paintings are portrayed by the women woman Sean Buchanan loves; childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings are a metaphor for Sean's lifeâ€”the verdant landscape and calm waters of childhood turn turbulent in youth, and then early in manhood, the rocky shores of manhood open to a promising sky of old age when he believes that his one true love left him for another man.  The breathtaking story also unfolds mysteries around losing a father, mother, wife, son, and friends and Sean's perseverance in life and, in the end, reuniting with his first love.  McMaster considers Voyage Of Life to be one of his signature works. Readers and reviewers agree.  One reader's review stated, "While reading, you will smile, you will hesitate thinking, oh no, and you will cry, but there is a surprise toward the end. This is one of the best romantic books I have read."  He is also the author of 'A Love Divided By Time', described as "one part The Notebook, one part suspenseful psychopath story, and one part Somewhere in Time." In that book, Forrest and Allie believed they found love in a previous life and being born again was a game of hide-and-seek to find each other in plain sight, seeking their better halves, united and whole. When tragedy strikes, Forrest makes a pact to find her killer, raise their daughter and find peace by joining her in the ever after.
