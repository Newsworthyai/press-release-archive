# The Office of Count Jonathan of Aquitaine Launches Centre for Education and Diplomacy in Avignon

AVIGNON, FRANCE, August 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Office of Count Jonathan of Aquitaine has formally established the Centre for Education and Diplomacy, a nonprofit initiative devoted to advancing education, intercultural exchange, and humanitarian diplomacy on the global stage.  This Centre represents the continuation of nearly two decades of work since the Republic of Aquitaine was reestablished in 2006 under the sovereignty of His Royal Highness Thomas II, Grand Duke of Aquitaine. It now formalizes those efforts into an enduring institution that will serve as a visible civil society pillar of the Republic.  Heritage and Legal Foundations  The Republic of Aquitaine is a sovereign government-in-exile, reconstituted with a Declaration of Sovereignty and authenticated under the Hague Apostille Convention of 1961. Its legitimacy rests on the declaratory theory of statehood, which affirms that sovereignty is grounded in objective legal criteria, not the political recognition of others.  The creation of the Centre for Education and Diplomacy is both a practical and symbolic expression of this principle. By establishing a nonprofit entity dedicated to international cooperation, the Republic of Aquitaine demonstrates that its sovereignty is not abstract but actively expressed in education, diplomacy, and humanitarian service.  Count Jonathan of Aquitaine explained:  "Education and diplomacy are not luxuries—they are the means by which nations, peoples, and communities come to understand one another. This Centre is not only about continuing our legacy but about expanding it. We act from principle and from duty, in alignment with international law and the values enshrined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals."  Mission and Strategic Objectives  The Centre for Education and Diplomacy will operate with three interconnected mandates:  Educational Advancement  Supporting heritage-based programs that preserve and transmit Aquitaine's cultural legacy while fostering global dialogue.  Sponsoring research and publications on international law, sovereignty, and cultural identity.  Developing partnerships with universities, schools, and cultural institutions to promote cross-border academic exchange.  Diplomatic Engagement  Hosting forums, lectures, and symposia dedicated to conflict resolution, mediation, and intercultural understanding.  Strengthening ties with international organizations, with particular focus on UN frameworks and UNESCO programs.  Serving as a neutral platform for dialogue between cultural, academic, and diplomatic communities.  Humanitarian Service  Supporting relief and educational initiatives in under-served communities.  Advocating for peace and self-determination in line with international humanitarian law.  Partnering with NGOs and civic organizations on joint projects.  Location and Symbolism  The Centre is headquartered in Avignon, France, a city of deep historical and cultural resonance. Avignon's heritage as a seat of international diplomacy—most famously during the Papal residence of the 14th century—makes it an ideal setting for the Centre's mission.  The decision to situate the Centre in Avignon underscores the Republic's view that diplomacy and education are best nurtured in places where history, culture, and international exchange are already intertwined.  Operational Integrity  The Centre for Education and Diplomacy has been launched as a fully independent, self-funded nonprofit, reflecting the Republic of Aquitaine's long-standing commitment to transparency and independence. No external government financing has been sought or accepted, preserving its impartiality in international engagement.  Preparations are underway to expand collaborative partnerships with universities, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations. Specific emphasis will be placed on building frameworks for joint action with UN agencies and other international institutions.  A Legacy of Continuity Since 2006  Since its reestablishment in 2006, the Republic of Aquitaine has pursued three core missions:  Education – preserving and transmitting Aquitaine's cultural and intellectual heritage.  Diplomacy – engaging constructively with international actors.  Humanitarian Service – contributing to global well-being through charitable and civic initiatives.  The new Centre embodies this legacy and transforms it into a permanent institutional presence. It represents not only continuity but also expansion, ensuring that the Republic's values and commitments are carried forward into future generations.  Looking Ahead  The Centre's inaugural programs are expected to include:  An International Lecture Series on education and diplomacy, to be launched in late 2025.  A Heritage and Sovereignty Publication Initiative, supporting academic papers on international law and cultural preservation.  A Youth Ambassadors Program, encouraging intercultural dialogue and diplomatic training among young leaders.  These efforts reflect the Republic of Aquitaine's enduring vision: to be a constructive, principled, and sovereign voice in global civil society.  About the Republic of Aquitaine  The Republic of Aquitaine is a sovereign government-in-exile, reconstituted in 2006 and guided by its Head of State, His Royal Highness Thomas II, Grand Duke of Aquitaine. It operates as a non-territorial constitutional monarchy with a focus on education, diplomacy, and humanitarian service.  The Republic's legal framework is grounded in its Declaration of Sovereignty, its constitutional charter, and international law, particularly the Hague Apostille Convention of 1961. Its existence reflects the enduring continuity of Aquitaine's historic legacy and its commitment to lawful, peaceful engagement with the global community.
