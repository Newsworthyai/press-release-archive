# Have I Ever Told You My Duck Story? … And Eight Other Short Stories

PETERBOROUGH, ON, August 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Edward Kenneth Loyst, acclaimed for his vivid imagination and unique storytelling style, releases his third book: Have I Ever Told You My Duck Story? … And Eight Other Short Stories, a literary mosaic of humor, heart, suspense, and adventure.  This carefully crafted collection of nine short stories offers something for every reader. Whether you're drawn to touching family memories, coming-of-age reflections, wild adventures, or late-night thrillers, Loyst delivers each tale with emotional punch and literary finesse.  The title story, The Duck Story, invites readers into a heartfelt family tale, drawn from the author's own life. In Turtle Tails, sibling rivalry and contrasting childhood memories become the lens for understanding time and change. The Dogs' Tail Knife explores the myths and mishaps of adolescence, while A Toast to Dad casts new light on the complexities of family roles and intergenerational bonds.  Loyst's darker storytelling emerges as the chapters unfold, like Suicide by Cop, a gripping narrative that lingers in the reader's consciousness, and How to Dig a Grave, a somber but poignant account rooted in truth. Ghost Town shifts gears, plunging the reader into a fast-paced wilderness adventure downriver, filled with danger and discovery.  Then comes the final story, The Russian Affair, a full-bodied thriller that could stand as a novel in its own right. Tense, layered, and thought-provoking, it's the kind of story that keeps readers wide-eyed long after midnight.  Each story in the collection showcases Loyst's cryptic wit and accessible writing style, which was honed during the creation of his 700-page epic historical novel, Kennebec Corners. In fact, these short stories were originally embedded within that sweeping fictional saga about the Thomas family, spanning from 1786 to 2025. Now, as standalone pieces, they reveal themselves anew: sharp, compelling, and unflinchingly human.  Whether you're looking for an easy-to-read vacation book or a meaningful anthology that lingers in your thoughts, Loyst delivers both entertainment and insight in equal measure.  Edward Kenneth Loyst is a former entrepreneur who built and sold multiple companies. A lifelong creative, Loyst is also a sculptor, working in mediums like limestone, marble, bronze, and clay. Though he rarely exhibits or sells his art, he is preparing a forthcoming coffee table book showcasing over 100 of his original stone carvings. Have I Ever Told You My Duck Story? is his third book, following the success of his business memoir Portrait of an Entrepreneur and the historical novel Kennebec Corners.  Available now on Amazon, Have I Ever Told You My Duck Story? is more than just a short story collection; it's an entryway into a larger literary universe that fans of character-driven fiction, history, and psychological drama will relish.  Both Kennebec Corners and Have I Ever Told You My Duck Story? are available in eBook and Paperback formats for immediate purchase and delivery. Readers can order directly through www.edwardkennethloyst.com or find the titles on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca.
