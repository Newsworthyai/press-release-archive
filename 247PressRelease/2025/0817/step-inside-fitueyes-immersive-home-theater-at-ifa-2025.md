# Step Inside FITUEYES' Immersive Home Theater at IFA 2025

BERLIN, GERMANY, August 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- FITUEYES, the global audiovisual furniture brand known for blending aesthetics and functionality, returns to IFA with a fresh vision for modern living. This year's showcase invites visitors to step inside an immersive home theater space, where the brand's signature TV stands and record player stands redefine how AV furniture can shape atmosphere and style.  The presentation unfolds under FITUEYES' 2025 design theme "Find ( )" — a minimalist and profound exploration of spatial purity. White, as the central visual element, symbolizes the origin of design and reflects the brand's belief in stripping away excess to return to what truly matters.  Immersive Home Theater Experience Instead of simply displaying products, FITUEYES has crafted a complete living environment that demonstrates the emotional impact of AV furniture. The home theater space integrates clean lines, balanced proportions, and a harmonious color palette, showing how a well-designed TV stand can anchor the visual flow of a room.  A curated record player stand installation adds a tactile dimension to the space, blending retro audio culture with modern design. This arrangement shows that audiovisual furniture can be both highly functional and a meaningful part of a home's character.  Expanding the FITUEYES Collection Alongside the immersive space, FITUEYES will debut new designs that expand its product scope. Highlights include: Eiffel Gaming Edition TV Stand – Designed specifically for gamers, combining bold black line aesthetics with rock-solid structural integrity. Eiffel Gaming Edition Storage Stand – Store your gear, display your passion — elevate every gaming session. FITUEYES' First Wall-Mounted TV Stand – A category breakthrough, expanding from floor-standing to wall-mounted solutions while maintaining signature aesthetics and easy installation.  Four Signature Series on Display IFA visitors will also be able to explore the brand's four core series: Eiffel Series – Inspired by the Eiffel Tower's architectural form and timeless elegance. Master Series – Comfort-oriented designs that create personal sanctuaries. Picasso Series – Easel-style stands that frame televisions as works of art. Cantor Series – Italian craftsmanship expressed through luxurious materials and refined details.
