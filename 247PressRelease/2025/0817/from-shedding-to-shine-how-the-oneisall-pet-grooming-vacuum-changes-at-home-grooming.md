# From Shedding to Shine: How the oneisall Pet Grooming Vacuum Changes At-Home Grooming

ALBANY, NY, August 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For many pet owners, grooming isn't just about looks—it's about comfort, hygiene, and keeping a clean home. The Oneisall pet grooming vacuum offers a simple way to manage shedding, maintain coat health, and reduce grooming costs, all from the comfort of home.  Better for Pets: Comfort and Hygiene Traditional grooming can leave pets stressed due to noise, rough handling, or prolonged sessions. Pet grooming vacuums combine gentle suction with soft-bristled brushes, removing loose hair while massaging the coat. This helps: Prevent tangles and mats that can cause discomfort Reduce skin irritation by removing dirt and dander Keep coats healthier and shinier between full grooming appointments  Better for Owners: A Cleaner, Easier Home Pet hair can quickly take over sofas, carpets, and clothes. With a grooming vacuum, loose fur is collected directly into a dust cup before it spreads. This means: Less time spent vacuuming floors and furniture Reduced allergens in the air for a healthier environment Easier grooming even for large or double-coated breeds  Better for Budgets: Lower Grooming Costs According to the American Pet Products Association, professional grooming costs average $50–$90 per session, and many breeds need grooming every 4–6 weeks. That adds up to $800–$1,000 annually. Using a pet grooming vacuum at home can: Cut salon visits by half or more Keep coats in top condition between appointments Save hundreds of dollars each year without sacrificing care quality  Pet Owner Experience "I used to dread grooming days because my Golden Retriever would leave fur all over the living room, and the cleanup took longer than the grooming itself," says Emily R., a oneisall customer from Texas. "With the pet grooming vacuum, I can groom him right in the living room without worrying about the mess. It's quieter than my regular vacuum, and he actually sits still for the whole session. I've also cut down our grooming salon visits from every month to every three months, which has saved me a lot over the past year."  About Oneisall The story of Oneisall began in 2012, when our founder, Terry, rescued an abused border collie named Niuniu, who was terrified of pet salons. To ease her fear, Terry began grooming her at home—but found that the clippers available were too expensive, too loud, or not effective enough. Determined to create a better solution, he founded oneisall with a mission to design quiet, efficient, and affordable grooming tools for pets like Niuniu.  What started as a single innovation has grown into a trusted brand serving millions of pet families worldwide. Today, oneisall offers a full range of pet care solutions, from grooming vacuums to feeding tools—all created with the same dedication and compassion that began with Niuniu's story.
