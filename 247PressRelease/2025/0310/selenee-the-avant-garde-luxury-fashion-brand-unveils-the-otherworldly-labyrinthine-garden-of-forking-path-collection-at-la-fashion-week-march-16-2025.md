# SELENEE, THE AVANT-GARDE LUXURY FASHION BRAND, UNVEILS THE OTHERWORLDLY LABYRINTHINE "GARDEN OF FORKING PATH" COLLECTION
AT LA FASHION WEEK -- MARCH 16, 2025

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- SELENEE, the avant-garde luxury fashion brand, will unveil its highly anticipated collection "The Garden of Forking Path" during LA Fashion Week on March 16, 2025, 5:00 PM (PST) at Neue House Hollywood, 6121 W Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, beginning with a red carpet. The show's fusion of fashion and visual art will provide guests with an emotional resonance about individuality and dreams, showcasing a range of unique and groundbreaking pieces for women and men.  The design of the Garden of Forking Path was inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short story of the same name and the exploration of "Infinite Possibilities in a Maze." The collection depicts a labyrinthine world that symbolizes time, space, and destiny intertwining. Through silhouette, materials, and details of the clothing, the theme of "forking paths" and "multiple possibilities" is showcased.  From classic plaid wool to flowing fabrics, SELENEE utilizes a classic gray and black palette with a combination of sharp lines and flowing curves that capture the mysterious essence of a labyrinth. A collision of vintage and modern sensibilities is evident through plaid fabrics meeting three-dimensional tailoring, reflecting the theme of time intertwining. Corseted coats, exaggerated shoulders, suit dresses, checkered pants, wool blousons, leather sweatshirts, capes, and dresses define this season's collection. Pieces are available on the SELENEE website and range from $480.00 to $5,800.   Since its 2023 inception, the brand has been known for experimental silhouettes, and the Garden of Forking Path accelerates this with bold three-dimensional designs and exaggerated contours, exploring the infinite possibilities of material language. This is also expressed in intricate and stunning design details such as cuffs featuring a split design, mimicking the branches of the labyrinth, and a layered skirt that embodies the imagery of multiple intersecting spaces.  "Every path is a choice, giving rise to infinite possibilities. Los Angeles is the perfect setting for this collection as it's not only where my dreams began, but also where many of my friends, like me, have found the courage to pursue their dreams again," said Motong Yang, Selenee's Artistic Director. "This show is not only a fulfillment of my original aspirations but also a way to inspire those who once put their dreams on hold due to reality, encouraging them to take a bold step forward. It is for the dreams we once left behind and for the better versions of ourselves."   The show integrates installation art and performance art into an interactive experience, allowing the audience to go beyond passive viewing and deeply connect with the brand's message. SELENEE's underlying philosophy of good design is a result of both aesthetics and responsible and sustainable practices challenge the status quo while embracing innovation.  SELENEE is a cross-disciplinary art brand that merges fashion with art and technology, breaking traditional boundaries and setting new trends. MT Yang, the founder and artistic director of SELENEE, is an installation artist and visual artist who is committed to exploring breakthrough creativity across disciplines. She believes that art combines opposing forces, integrates seemingly contrasting dimensions, highlights individuality and commonality, ultimately achieving a perfect balance. Visit www.selenee.co.
