# Author Erika Fair Introduces the First Novel In Her New Book Series, "The Lonely Raven Trilogy"

MAGNOLIA, TX, March 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fallon has received premonitions since she was a child—visions that have driven her to steer countless strangers and acquaintances from looming dangers. But these powers have come at a great cost. After enduring heart-wrenching losses during her teenage years, Fallon has lived a solitary life for over a decade, her only anchor being her childhood best friend.  That is, until a series of intense premonitions draws a group of new people into her life, people who start to feel like family. But something deeper is stirring. The raven tattoo on her wrist has begun to tingle, and a raven has started appearing in her visions. Worse still, Fallon is haunted by the memory of someone from her past, someone she loved, and she believes abandoned her—a person to whom the raven seems inexplicably tied.  As the visions grow more urgent, Fallon must decipher their meaning to protect those she cares about. She must face the shadows of her past to safeguard the future of those she loves—and discover whether the raven is an ally or a threat.   Author Erika Fair was born and raised in Texas, where she lives with her husband and son. She graduated from The University of Texas at Austin and stayed in Austin as long as she could. When she is not forcing her favorite music upon her family or writing, she can usually be found hiking or planning future travels. "The Secret Girl" is her first novel.  The gripping first installment of "The Lonely Raven Trilogy" has received glowing reviews from readers across the US. Erika's new book is written to share the importance of continuing on even when you feel weak, of finding family in unusual places and knowing we're all on this journey together.
