It comes with a simple interface and offers seamless user experience, making the creation process faster and smoother.  Users are allowed to create a microsite according to their requirements. They can insert anything they want in the minisite, including text, images, videos, animations, buttons, and many other elements. FlipHTML5 enables extensive customization and supports users in making a personalized microsite that aligns with their brands and styles.  To streamline users' workflow, the minisite builder provides a collection of pre-made elements in the Library section, such as titles, images and texts, forms, lists, buttons, etc. Users may quickly pick a design and customize it as per their preference.
