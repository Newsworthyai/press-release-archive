# A Rare Italian Gem: 1967 Autobianchi Bianchina Panoramica is on Display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, April 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is excited to showcase a stunning piece of Italian automotive history—the 1967 Autobianchi Bianchina Panoramica—now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. This charming microcar, based on the legendary Fiat 500, is a testament to compact engineering and timeless European design.  The Autobianchi Bianchina enjoyed a 13-year production run beginning in 1957, offering an elegant and practical solution for city driving. Powering this stylish classic is a 499cc horizontal twin engine, accessed through a hatch in the rear cargo floor, which sends power to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle. Stopping is handled by four-wheel drum brakes, ensuring a reliable and authentic driving experience.  This Bianchina Panoramica retains its classic charm with functional and stylish details, including hand-crank front windows, sliding rear windows, an ashtray, and a black rubber floor mat covering the footwells. A two-spoke steering wheel with a perforated leather cover sits in front of a 120-km/h speedometer and auxiliary gauges, while the five-digit mechanical odometer displays approximately 20,000 kilometers (~12,000 miles), preserving its low-mileage appeal. Additionally, the fuel tank and battery are housed in the front trunk, maximizing space efficiency.  Now proudly displayed at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, this delightful Italian classic is among over 200 exceptional vehicles available for visitors to admire. Whether you're a dedicated car enthusiast or simply appreciate timeless design, the Bianchina Panoramica is a must-see.
