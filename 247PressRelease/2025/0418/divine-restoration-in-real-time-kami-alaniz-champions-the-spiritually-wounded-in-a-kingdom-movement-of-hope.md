# Divine Restoration in Real Time: Kami Alaniz Champions the Spiritually Wounded in a Kingdom Movement of Hope

ORANGE GROVE, TX, April 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a world that is growing increasingly complicated and often uncertain, there is one truth that remains unwavering: God's desire to see His children whole, healed, and walking boldly in their divine purpose. For those who have ever felt overlooked, broken, or burdened by life's battles, Kami Alaniz brings a radiant message of restoration—one born not from theory, but from a personal testimony shaped by pain, faith, and powerful transformation.  As the founder of Helping People Like Me Ministry – A Just Brooke, LLC Kingdom Initiative, Kami's calling is clear: to reach into the hearts of those who feel "stuck" and remind them that God has not forgotten them. This is not just a ministry—it is a movement. It is a divine invitation to step into healing, identity, and the fullness of what God has prepared.  We are honored to present Part One of an exclusive eight-part interview series with Kami Alaniz. Through this series, Kami speaks with transparency and fire, offering sacred insight and practical tools for those ready to reclaim their lives—body, mind, and spirit.  May this first chapter open your heart, stir your soul, and remind you that your breakthrough is closer than you think.  "The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners." – Isaiah 61:1  TSR NEWS GROUP: Your ministry, Helping People Like Me, speaks volumes through its very name—who exactly are the people you are speaking for, and what moment in your own life ignited the fire to become their voice and their guide?  Kami Alaniz: Helping People Like Me is a ministry born from my own life experiences. I speak for individuals who have faced profound challenges—be it health crises, personal betrayals, or emotional turmoil—and feel stuck or lost. My journey through misdiagnoses, personal losses, and the weight of single motherhood ignited a passion to guide others toward healing and rediscovery. This ministry is a beacon for those yearning to transform their pain into purpose.  Some of the things I have been through include being born to teenage parents who later divorced. I was adopted by my dad, who raised me and is one of the best things that could've ever happened to me. When I was three years old, I sat alone in the ICU waiting room, playing with my bracelets, while my mom went in to see my brother, who had been born with a congenital heart defect. That was just the beginning of many events in my life that shaped me.  There was a "bad date night" in high school that haunted me for years. Infertility problems. An unfaithful first husband whose affair began while we were in Houston awaiting my brother's heart transplant. We lost my brother 30 hours after his surgery. A few months later, I discovered my husband's affair and learned he was expecting a baby. I divorced him. My son and I moved to a new city, and I began my life as an "official single mom"—although I had already felt like one during that marriage.  In just three and a half years, I lost my brother, my husband, my Papa, my great-grandma, became a single mom, and moved to a different city. A few years later, I met my soulmate. We planned to marry but broke up instead. I entered a short-lived marriage with a con artist who later threatened to kill us. My son and I had to move again, this time to a home near the police station for safety.  I was finally diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease after years of going from doctor to doctor. By the time I was correctly diagnosed, my thyroid was so compromised I almost died. About a year later, I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor—one that God immaculately healed.  As all these events piled up, I found myself feeling stuck and dealing with a lifetime of emotions I had never really dealt with. I was always very shy and an introvert, a rule follower. I learned to pray with intent early in life. Raised in a Christian family. Attended church. Saved when I was in second grade. Studious. I would get through all these things as they happened, but it was when they were all over, when I had a moment to breathe and think, I would ask myself: How could all this have happened to me? People close to me would also sit and marvel with me at all the strange events in my life. I didn't know what was happening. The spiritual battles were real, but I didn't yet understand them.  I would go to church, and while the sermons were beautiful, I often thought, "That's great—for someone else." Surely, they didn't apply to me. Or, if I felt moved, the momentum wouldn't last. Even though God worked many miracles in my life, Satan would come in and destroy things quickly after. But I knew I had a calling. Which made things even more confusing, because in my naïve thinking I thought I would be sheltered and my life would be glitz and glam.  It was a few days after my brother's death that I first heard God speak so clearly: "Help People Like You." At the time, I thought that meant using my RN degree to work with transplant patients. But that wasn't it. Years later, during my second divorce, I was on the phone with an Allstate investigator helping me with some issues. As I hung up, I heard it again: "Help People Like You."  I looked around and said, "God, I don't know if You know this, but I can't even help myself right now. I have nothing to offer other people." And again, I heard Him: "Help People Like You."  I responded, "Okay, God. When my life is better, I will help people like me." And in my spirit, I saw a vision—me standing on a stage helping people like me. I didn't know how, or when, but I believed Him.  God continued to work through me. As a single mom, I held a full-time RN job, one business taking on-call for six doctors, and served as their on-call administrator as a second job. And as a second business, I even opened my own answering service. God worked through me to meet His people's needs, and I was highly favored—by everyone except four people. Satan used those four to slowly strip everything away. The spiritual warfare was intense, and again, I found myself stuck.  Later, I moved to Pecos, Texas, and that's when everything started to make sense. I reset. I rediscovered myself. God gave me my "aha" moment: I didn't need a perfect life to begin helping others. I just needed to open up and share what I had been through.  I thought back to when I was getting certified in NLP. I worked closely with my partner, Fidel, and one day he said, "There's a part of you that's extremely confident—nothing stands in your way. You open businesses, you make impossible things happen. You're like a freight train." He asked me to give that part a name. I said, "Okay, Brooke." He asked, "Does Brooke have a first or last name?" I said, "Nope. Just Brooke." That was the confident, bold, unshakable version of me.  So, when God gave me my "aha" moment, Just Brooke was born. Because that "Just Brooke" inside me had so much love and confidence that others could borrow it until they remembered it in themselves.  Recently, I felt God telling me the name didn't fully capture the heart of the ministry. Back when I started Just Brooke, I hadn't asked God what to name it. One morning, He woke me up—He frequently speaks to me early in the morning—and this time, the name Helping People Like Me Ministry was the first thing I saw written in my mind when I woke up. He showed me a vision and spoke so clearly: "This is My ministry, and what you were called to do, and this is what you will call it."  God put it on my heart that week: "I did not put you through all this. And get you out of all this. So, you would have firsthand knowledge of how it feels and how to get out of these situations for you to call it anything other than Helping People Like Me Ministry. I gave you a ministry—and that is what you will name it. All those years you were waiting on Me to show you what I meant by 'Helping People Like You' and you thought I was just not answering you… you were already living it."  And that's how Helping People Like Me Ministry—A Just Brooke, LLC Kingdom Initiative came to be. God and I have created videos, eBooks, courses, coaching programs, and more—because some people need help for a moment, some for a weekend, some for 30, 60, or 90 consecutive days. No matter where a person is, we are here to help them remove blocks, reset, rediscover themselves, and live their prophetic dream life.  I am honored to walk beside anyone ready to step into all that God has for them.  TSR NEWS GROUP: You transitioned from a career in the medical field to full-time ministry—how did that calling unfold, and what message do you have for those who feel a pull to step into their divine purpose, even when the path ahead feels uncertain?  Kami Alaniz: I am in a transition phase now. I work as a traveling RN/case manager, which has allowed me time to work with the Holy Spirit to create resources for Helping People Like Me Ministry. My transition from nursing to ministry is a divine calling that emerged from my own healing journey. As I navigated through personal and professional challenges, I realized that my true purpose is to help others find their path to healing and fulfillment. I look very forward to the day when others will look at me and say God is the only explanation for her prosperity and ministry.  To those feeling a pull toward their divine purpose, I say: Trust in the journey. Even when the path is unclear, stepping forward in faith will lead you to where you're meant to be.  I listen to church 1.5–2 hours daily, Monday through Friday and most Saturdays, and attend church on Sundays. I would suggest you find some sort of church or worship schedule that works for you. What I have found is, more than glitz and glam, it seems to be increased spiritual warfare, so be prepared. God may give you dreams a few nights in a row. Then the next night, Satan may give you a dream. Realize what it is and do not fall for his lies. He is sneaky and was causing me confusion for a bit.  I did not grow up fasting but have learned a lot about fasting these last couple of months. In Matthew 6:1–18, Jesus talks about Giving, Prayer, Fasting. Before reading or hearing a church service on this topic, God did wake me up one morning and put it in my heart to do these things. Once I started fasting for the first time, returned to giving, and prayed more consistently, I heard from God easier.  TSR NEWS GROUP: Faith, healing, and transformation are powerful themes in your work—how does your ministry help people reclaim their identity and walk boldly in the freedom God has already prepared for them?  Kami Alaniz: Through Helping People Like Me, I offer tools and guidance to help individuals peel back the layers of pain and rediscover their true selves. By integrating the tools I created with over three decades of helping patients as an RN to be successful in their lives—combined with my certification as a practitioner in neurolinguistic programming, and most importantly, the fact that I have firsthand understanding of how the "stuck" person feels in a vast amount of situations—which allows me to talk to the "victim" in you from the heart and with understanding, while incorporating inspirational and nurturing teachings with understanding from the healed person in me and led by the Holy Spirit—we work together to break free from limiting beliefs and embrace the freedom that God has already bestowed upon them. It's about reclaiming one's identity and walking confidently in the purpose they've been given.  TSR NEWS GROUP: In a world full of noise, distractions, and brokenness, Helping People Like Me Ministry offers a message of clarity and hope—what does it mean to truly "transform," and how can people begin that journey today?  Kami Alaniz: True transformation is about more than just change; it's about renewal. It's a process of shedding old wounds and embracing a new identity rooted in faith and purpose. To begin this journey, one must first acknowledge their pain, seek guidance, and commit to the process of healing. Through our ministry's resources—be it courses, coaching, weekend classes, or community support—we provide a roadmap for individuals to embark on this transformative journey.   Imagine for a second you are the person going through any of the things I have been through. You may feel sad, in a way alone, distracted from the "current world" because those memories keep you focused on what is lost or went wrong. You might not talk about it, or you might talk about it often, but it does not make you feel better. No one understands how you are feeling.  I do understand. I understand there may be many great things going on in your life, but that "situation" is pulling your focus away. I understand how it feels to be in your situation. I understand those voices you hear that say you are not good enough or other negative thoughts. Those voices or thoughts are not from God. I also understand God wants good for you. When I was "stuck," it was such a confusing time. Some things would go great—I had a ton of God's favor. Other times I'd hear or think that "you aren't good enough" voice/thought from the dark side. I can help you identify between the two.  John 10:10 – "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly."  Exodus 34:5-7 (NIV) – Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed His name, the Lord. And He passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,  maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished; He punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation."  As much as any of us do not want to admit it, when we are stuck, it affects more than just us. We can change that today.  Visit my website: www.JustBrooke.net. That will pull up my Helping People Like Me Ministry page. I have included much information about my:  · 2-day in-person and virtual classes  · 60-day transformational courses  · 30-day transformational bundles  · 3-30 bundles  · Coaching  · E-books  I found when I was stuck—and others I have worked with are stuck—we needed more information as opposed to less information to make an "informed decision." That is part of being stuck. This moment is deeply significant—God isn't just...  TSR NEWS GROUP: Looking ahead, what is your vision for the next chapter of Helping People Like Me Ministry, and how can those inspired by your story become part of this Kingdom-driven movement of restoration, purpose, and faith?  Kami Alaniz: The vision for Helping People Like Me is to expand our reach. We have created a movement where individuals are empowered to heal, grow, and lead others on their own journeys of transformation. Those inspired by our mission can join us by participating in our programs, sharing our message, and becoming ambassadors of hope in their own communities.  I would really like to begin speaking in churches across the USA—not as a pastor, because I am not a pastor—but as a guide with a testimony and a heart to help. My desire is to share my story with congregations: how Satan often works behind the scenes in our lives without us even realizing it, planting seeds of confusion, pain, and discouragement.  Satan destroys our jobs, careers, relationships, and marriages—and he often does it subtly. People don't even recognize it's him until the damage has already been done. I want to bring that awareness to light and then walk people through how to stand in the authority God has given them.  I want to equip people with spiritual insight—to help them see the strategies of the enemy and how to stand against them. I will walk them through how to prevent certain problems, how to heal from others, and even how to avoid or lessen the impact of some health issues—emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually.  During these talks, I would also guide the congregation through removing a couple of blocks—live and in the moment. For those who feel they need more support, they will be invited back for the 2-day in-person class or invited for deeper transformational opportunities: a 2-day in-person or virtual class, 30-60-90 day programs, 1:1 coaching, e-books, and other resources.  My goal is to bring encouragement and freedom to the whole congregation, but especially to reach those who feel "stuck"—the ones who believe the blessings, the sermons, the breakthroughs are for everyone but them. I want to tell them, "Yes, God's promises are for YOU too."  Ultimately, I want to help reignite a thirst for church and for the power of God—to help people engage more deeply, listen intently to the preacher, and attend church with expectation again.  Once this is rooted across churches in the USA, my heart is to expand globally, carrying this same message of healing, awakening, and restoration across nations. This is part of the ministry God gave me when He said, "Help People Like You."  And now, through Helping People Like Me Ministry – A Just Brooke, LLC Kingdom Initiative, I'm walking in obedience to that call.  As we close this first installment of the eight-part series, we invite you to pause, breathe, and reflect on what the Spirit is stirring within you. The stories Kami shares are not just words on a page—they are living testimonies of God's redemptive power, proof that no pain is wasted, and no person is too far gone to be transformed by His grace.  If your soul felt seen, if your heart felt nudged, know this: God is reaching for you right now. He is calling you out of the shadows of confusion and into the clarity of purpose. He is declaring over you a new season—a season of breakthrough, of freedom, of awakening.  This is only the beginning.  We encourage you to stay connected as the journey continues in Part Two, where Kami will go deeper into the spiritual and emotional restoration that defines her ministry. Whether you are a longtime supporter or just discovering this divine movement, there is a place for you here. There is healing for you here.  Let us walk this path together, hand in hand with our Heavenly Father—toward wholeness, toward calling, toward the Kingdom life you were always meant to live.  If something within you was stirred today—if a part of your spirit felt seen, heard, or gently called—don't let this moment pass you by. You are not alone. There is a community waiting to walk with you, a ministry built to nurture your healing, and a voice—Kami Alaniz's voice—that was called for such a time as this.  Whether you're standing at the edge of a breakthrough or searching for your next step, know that Helping People Like Me Ministry – A Just Brooke, LLC Kingdom Initiative was created with you in mind. This is more than coaching. It is a Kingdom movement. A place for the wounded to become warriors. A space where purpose is reignited, and hearts are restored.
