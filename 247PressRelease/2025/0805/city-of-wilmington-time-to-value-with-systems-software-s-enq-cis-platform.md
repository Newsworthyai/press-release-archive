# City of Wilmington Time to Value with Systems &amp; Software's enQ CIS Platform

WINOOSKI, VT, August 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The City of Wilmington has gone live with Systems & Software's enQ CIS platform—completing a full implementation, realizing measurable ROI, and achieving their first-ever on-time property tax distribution. After an extensive vendor evaluation to replace their aging MUNIS platform, the City selected enQ CIS for its ability to unify utility billing, property tax, licenses, and inspection fees into one modern, user-friendly system.  "I cannot say enough how pleased we are with the performance of Systems & Software," said J. Brett Taylor, Director of Finance for the City of Wilmington. "enQ CIS is an intuitive, easy-to-navigate system, which allows customers and agents to view property information and billing in a simple, searchable, and transparent way. The highly automated system will require fewer steps, more accurate data, and greater transparency. The S&S team was highly skilled, flexible, and accommodating—without sacrificing the quality of the product."  "We are honored to support the City of Wilmington in this major milestone," said Adam Smith, Executive Vice President at Systems & Software. "From day one, the City made it clear that their priority was improving the customer experience. Our enQ CIS platform helps them do exactly that—streamlining operations while delivering transparency and convenience to the people they serve."  The project included seamless integration with Paymentus, the City's long-standing credit card processing partner, to offer modern payment methods such as Venmo, Walmart Pay, autopay, text-to-pay, and email/SMS billing reminders. The go-live required conversion of financial and account data from the legacy system with minimal disruption to residents. Systems & Software's enQ CIS platform met all of these objectives—and more.
