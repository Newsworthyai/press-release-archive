# Global Retail Expert Mitch Gould, Celebrates 40 Years of Success Supplying Products For Retail Giants Amazon, Walmart &amp; More

BOCA RATON, FL, August 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When Nutritional Products International founder and CEO Mitch Gould got his start in retail distribution, he didn't know it would lead to working with the world's largest retailers, WWE wrestling heroes, and even Hollywood royalty, but he did just that.   It all started with him selling consumer products to Home Depot.   "It was a very exciting time as Home Depot began its nationwide expansion," Gould said.  He gained a reputation as an incredible marketer and continued to sell consumer products, valued at tens of millions in revenue, to countless classic chain store brands, including Lowe's, Costco, Walgreens, CVS, and the biggest retail company in the world â€“ Walmart.   He also began to make a lot of traction with health and nutrition-based businesses such as Vitamin Shoppe and GNC, and this took his career to new heights.   "I represented some of the biggest names in consumer products and eventually, my career spanned into nutrition and sports nutrition, which is when I represented icons in body building, wrestling, and action heroes," he said.   "It was an amazing experience to work with Bob Wall, Hulk Hogan, Steven Seagal."  With a number of successes under his belt, when Amazon decided to expand into health and wellness, and sports nutrition, they reached out to Gould's company to make it happen and he knocked it out of the park.   Nutritional Products International (NPI) played a significant role in building Amazon's sports nutrition categories and partnered with Muscle Foods to bring major brands onboard.   While this was an incredible highlight in Gould's career, things were just getting started.   After working with a number of international companies, he noticed that they were all running into some of the same problems as they transitioned into the American retail market.   "I noticed a void in the marketplace. Companies from abroad, particularly Europe, were coming into America and losing millions of dollars," Gould said.   These businesses were dealing with unexpected laws, fees, and gatekeepers; a lot of them were blindsided by the unstated norms in American retail protocol.  Gould developed the Evolution of Distribution, an all-inclusive system that provides international brands with a simple turnkey solution for importing, distributing, and marketing their products.   Gould takes pride in using his experience to guide these businesses through every tough spot he's had to overcome over the years and leading them to success.   NPI works intimately with Gould's PR company, InHealth Media, as a cost-effective public relations firm. IHM provides distribution to thousands of prominent media outlets in the United States.
