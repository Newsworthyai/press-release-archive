# Top Orange County Philanthropists Announced for 40th Annual National Philanthropy Day Awards

IRVINE, CA, August 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Visionary Orange County philanthropists, businesses and groups in eight categories will be honored at the 40th Annual National Philanthropy Day, Orange County Awards Luncheon, taking place Thursday, Nov. 13, at the Grove of Anaheim. This year's theme is "Celebrating 40 Years of Generosity and Impact."   National Philanthropy Day, now celebrated worldwide, was conceived by Orange County businessman and philanthropist Douglas Freeman. Through Freeman's tireless efforts, in 1986 President Ronald Reagan formally recognized the observance, proclaiming the third Thursday of November a day to honor giving. Today, more than 140 Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) chapters in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe and China take part in the celebration.  "From the beginning, the vision was to honor those making a difference — and to encourage others to give back," said Freeman, of Newport Beach, who turns 80 on Nov. 13 and remains deeply involved in local philanthropic efforts. "I'm proud of how the movement has grown, and even more so of the impact it continues to have in our communities."  Presented by the AFP Orange County Chapter and organized by a volunteer committee, National Philanthropy Day is the region's premier event honoring philanthropy, with more than 1,000 honorees recognized since its inception. This year, Orange County Business Journal is the event's Presenting Sponsor, PBS SoCal is Broadcast Media Sponsor and the Orange County Register is Community Media Sponsor. The effort is Chaired by Kathy Ruvolo, retired UC Irvine Executive Fundraiser, of Aliso Viejo, and Co-Chaired by Matthew Wadlinger, Chief Brand Officer at CASA Orange County, of Long Beach. Longtime Orange County automotive industry executive and philanthropist Donnie Crevier, of Laguna Beach, serves as Honorary Chair, while PBS SoCal's Maria Hall-Brown returns as host of the Nov. 13 event.
