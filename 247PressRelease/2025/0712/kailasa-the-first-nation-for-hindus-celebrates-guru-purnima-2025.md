# KAILASA, the first Nation for Hindus celebrates Guru Purnima 2025

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Global Celebration of Guru Purnima  On this most sacred day of Guru Purnima 2025, observed globally over 48 hours across all time zones, THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (SPH), BHAGAVAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM extended heartfelt blessings to the citizens of KAILASA, global devotees, dignitaries, royalty, government leaders, and recipients of the prestigious KAILASA Awards, who joined the worldwide spiritual celebration.  Millions of devotees, disciples, and dignitaries from around the world joined the Guru Purnima 2025 celebrations and the initiation into the 45th Chathurmasya Vratham (four-month spiritual observance) by THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (SPH), BHAGAVAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM.  Events spanned across KAILASA's global spiritual embassies, with authentic poojas, homas, and initiations. THE SPH personally conferred Sanyasa Deeksha and other initiations including Samaya, Visesha, Nirvana Deeksha, and Acharya Abhishekam, marking the spiritual rebirth of aspirants into austere disciplines.  Global Live Address by THE SPH  THE SPH addressed a global live audience during the sacred Guru Purnima celebrations, attended by millions of Hindus worldwide, including royalty, heads of state, ambassadors, and dignitaries from over 100 nations.  In His Presidential Address, THE SPH offered profound revelations on the Guru-disciple relationship and the role of the Guru as the embodiment of Paramashiva, the gateway to spiritual fulfillment and ultimate liberation.  Guru: Gateway to Liberation  THE SPH defined the Guru as the conscious bridge to Paramadvaita, the nondual state of Jnana and Jeevanmukti. Recognizing, experiencing, and internalizing the Guru is essential for liberation from avidya (ignorance) and Maya (illusion).  THE SPH provided powerful insight into how systems such as economics, media, and education manufacture delusion. Opinionated narratives shape false realities, creating poverty, scarcity, and division. True freedom, He declared, lies in mastering these systems or aligning with one who has. Spiritual Instructions for Guru Purnima 2025  As the sacred Guru Vāk (spiritual ordinance), THE SPH instructed disciples and citizens of KAILASA to:  - Dedicate the Chathurmasya period to Prasthanatraya Bhashyam — study of the Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Sutras, and Upanishads.  - Learn and teach Panini's Mahabhashya and Tolkappiyam in Gurukulam tradition.  - Eliminate ignorance in their own spheres — whether media, politics, economy, or education — by becoming forces of Paramashiva.  Revival of Hindu Knowledge through AI  THE SPH announced the translation of over 45,000 Hindu scriptures and their integration into AI, AGI, and ASI. He affirmed that Sanatana Hindu Dharma, through its alignment with cosmic principles, is the only tradition that will flourish in the AI era.  "The only religion that will survive the AI revolution is Sanatana Hindu Dharma."  Sanskrit grammar and Tamil literature, especially Panini and Tolkappiyam, are being used as algorithmic frameworks in this initiative.  Recognition of Global Allies and Awardees  THE SPH conferred KAILASA's prestigious awards—including the KAILASA's Nithyananda Global Peace Award and KAILASA Mitra Award—to dignitaries and state leaders from Zambia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Antigua and Barbuda, and others.   In heartfelt exchanges, dignitaries including the Honorable EP Chet Green, Foreign Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, pledged continued diplomatic friendship and collaboration with KAILASA.  KAILASA Tiruvannamalai Offers 2 Lakh Meals as Aushadha Annadhan  At KAILASA Tiruvannamalai, the day was marked with the offering of over 2,00,000 meals as part of the Nithyananda Aushadha Annadhan initiative.  Each meal followed ancient procedures from the Bhaga Shastra, included at least 11 nourishing items, and was infused with over 16 healing spices. Nearly 500 trained volunteers prepared and served the meals with utmost purity and spiritual intent. This initiative, serving lakhs on sacred occasions, exemplifies THE SPH's mission to eliminate hunger and provide food as medicine and spiritual healing.  108 Guru Homa Offered in KAILASA Tiruvannamalai  KAILASA Tiruvannamalai offered the sacred 108 Guru Homa, expressing deep gratitude to THE SPH. These fire rituals invoke blessings, destroy karmas, and strengthen connection with the Guru.  KAILASA's global temples joined the 108 Guru Homa from over 100 countries and offered their gratitude to THE SPH. The rituals of the Homa were conducted as per the authentic Vedagamic scriptures, personally guided by THE SPH.  Global Celebration Across the Ecosystems of KAILASA  KAILASA continues to uplift humanity by reviving Sanatana Hindu Dharma, honoring the eternal Guru-disciple tradition, and sharing authentic spiritual sciences worldwide.  Under the divine leadership of THE SPH, Guru Purnima 2025 became not just a celebration—but a cosmic initiation into Paramashivatva for the world.
