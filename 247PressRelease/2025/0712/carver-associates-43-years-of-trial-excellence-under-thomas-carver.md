# Carver &amp; Associates: 43 Years of Trial Excellence Under Thomas Carver

SPRINGFIELD, MO, July 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Carver & Associates, a criminal defense and litigation firm based in Springfield, Missouri (Google Maps), remains dedicated to representing "good people facing bad situations" with relentless advocacy and courtroom experience. At the helm is Thomas D. Carver, a former president of the Missouri Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and seasoned litigator with over 43 years of practice, including representation of nearly 300 clients in federal criminal cases, plus numerous state-level matters.  Thomas has personally tried a wide spectrum of cases—from capital murder prosecutions to intricate white-collar, drug, sex, and federal offenses—across local and federal courts in Missouri and Kansas. He's argued more than 70 appeals before Missouri's Supreme Court and the U.S. Eighth and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals, and even petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review.  "A lot of people who come to see me, symbolically come carrying a big bag of rocks on their shoulder. My job is to take it off their shoulder and to put it on mine. I take great pride in accepting their burden as my own and try as hard as I can to lighten their load. A federal judge once commented to me, when reflecting on why lawyers take on the challenges of criminal defense, that many times a lawyer is the only person between the client and the wolf at the door. It is with that spirit and attitude that I try to serve my clients," said Thomas Carver.  You can view Attorney Carver's full profile on Avvo, where he holds an "Excellent" (8.6) rating and a perfect 5.0 client review score.
