# Women Are In Danger Of Losing Some Of Their Most Precious Rights In Today's Political Climate Says Bestselling Author Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein

WILMINGTON, NC, July 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Boomer generation, specifically as the result of their feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, ignited a revolution in society. This powerful wave of activism began to shatter glass ceilings and pave the way for women to make real progress in education, politics, and the workplace. By the 21st century, female Boomers had ascended to the highest echelons of power, becoming CEOs of major corporations, holding high-ranking positions in government, and making indelible contributions to a myriad of professions.  It was a long and difficult fight. That is the subject of bestselling author Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein's latest book, 'Women's Freedom, Unfinished Love Stories'. In the current political climate however, women may be in danger of losing many of those hard-fought victories.  'When I decided to write this book, the country was just beginning to experience the astonishing results of decisions being made that were contrary to the way women had been living for the last 50 years," Dr. Holstein stated. "I was in shock, as many women were, to see mostly men in high places making legal decisions for women about their bodies. I was horrified. I'm a positive psychologist and a woman. I have spent my working life helping hundreds of women to reach their potential in many areas of their lives, including personal decisions about their bodies. Now I was seeing women going backwards because of sudden legal decisions happening, led primarily by men.  "What I worried about at the time was women going backwards in terms of their rights to make personal decisions. If this continued to happen, their sense of self-worth may well weaken, and they could gradually lose the courage to stand up for themselves. We could be headed back to the dark ages. What could I do to try to get the message out to make the women of our great country and hopefully the men rise to the occasion and make sure that the rights to make decisions about our lives be left to the individual person and the professionals who could most help that person in a complicated decision?  "I finally came to the conclusion that an historical novel about women on the brink of being able to break the glass ceiling and to protect themselves and make decisions - when to have children or even not to, to become openly gay if that was what was right for them - that telling the stories of three college age women in the 1960s was the way to go. I knew I could bring these three young women to life with my writing skills and my training as a psychologist.  "We were the flower children and the businesswoman and the women politicians and the doctors and the chemists and the lawyers and the housewives who managed to achieve freedoms unlike any before in human history. We expected women to be free going forward, and not to slip backwards."  "I hope all women and men will understand how important this freedom is. If you have daughters or a mother or a wife or a woman friend you know how important we all are to each other. We create love stories with friends and family as we allow others to flourish. The three girls in my book all find ways to flower as they leave college and go into the world at large. But we must remember they are part of an historical fiction book. People in our lives are not. They are real. Let's make sure women get to maintain their freedom, continue to make marvelous discoveries and bring magic and miracles into our world now and in the future."  In 'Women's Freedom', Holstein explores the struggles and desires of young women in the 1960s: the complexities of sexuality, identity, and self-discovery. She introduces readers to three college students navigating the intricacies of their sexual energies and the paths to their futures. Their journeys are a mirror to the experiences of women throughout history, highlighting the universal longings and challenges that have shaped previous generations.
