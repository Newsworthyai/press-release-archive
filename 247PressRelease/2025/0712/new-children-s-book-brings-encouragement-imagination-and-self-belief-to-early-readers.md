# New Children's Book Brings Encouragement, Imagination, and Self-Belief to Early Readers

MONTREAL, QC, July 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Her newly released book, Penny & Musical: Penny Makes a Friend, is now available in paperback on Amazon and Kindle. It's already gaining attention for its heartfelt message and warm, relatable characters. Targeted toward children ages 3 to 8, Penny Makes a Friend tells the story of a shy little girl named Penny who finds courage through the help of a magical teddy bear named Musical.   When Penny picks up the bear at a neighborhood garage sale, she has no idea how much her life is about to change. With Musical by her side, Penny slowly learns that the things she fears — like making friends or speaking in front of her class — aren't so scary after all.  "It's loosely based on my childhood," Eve shares. "I was always the quiet one, the shy one. I didn't always feel like I could be myself, and I know there are so many kids out there who feel the same way.   I wanted to create a story that reminds them they're not alone — and that who they are is more than enough." What makes Penny & Musical unique is its structure as a growing series. Each new book will introduce a different stuffed animal character, all with their own quirks, personalities, and life lessons. While Penny & Musical are at the heart of the series, it's the ensemble of magical friends who help her — and early readers — navigate emotional challenges with warmth and imagination. With the first book already out, Eve has plans to continue building the Penny universe with stories that encourage children to embrace their imagination, build confidence, and find happiness in who they are, even if they don't quite fit the mold.   The themes of friendship, self-belief, and courage run strong throughout Penny Makes a Friend, but the book also tackles real-world moments that many parents will recognize: the quiet child who clings to their parent at a birthday party, the little one who's terrified of raising their hand in class, or the kind kid who struggles to make a connection in a noisy world. These moments are illustrated with heart, humor, and a dose of magical realism that keeps young readers engaged.  In addition to writing, Eve is also active on TikTok (@evelackman), where she shares parenting content, book updates, and insights into child development — all through the lens of her characters. Her content often resonates with parents navigating the emotional complexities of early childhood, offering practical ideas and supportive messages rooted in empathy. "I think stories are one of the best ways to help children grow emotionally," Eve says. "When kids see characters they can relate to, like Penny, it gives them hope and confidence to believe in themselves."   Penny and Musical: Penny Makes a Friend is now available in paperback on Amazon and Kindle! Whether you're a parent of a shy child, a teacher looking to spark class discussions about emotions, or simply someone who believes in the magic of stuffed animals and imagination, this heartwarming story delivers a lasting impact. To make the experience even more meaningful, it also includes after-story questions you can share with your kids to help them better understand and express their emotions.  Eve is a children's book author and advocate for emotional development in early childhood. Her stories are inspired by her journey as a shy, imaginative child and her passion for helping others feel seen, heard, and valued. Through her books and social media presence, Eve continues to build a community that celebrates uniqueness and emotional bravery.
