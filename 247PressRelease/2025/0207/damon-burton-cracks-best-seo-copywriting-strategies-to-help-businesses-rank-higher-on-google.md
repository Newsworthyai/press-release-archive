# Damon Burton Cracks Best SEO Copywriting Strategies to Help Businesses Rank Higher on Google

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, February 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Damon Burton's latest SEO copywriting study reveals which content performs best on search engines, and lays out variables supporting the success of top ranking content.  "There are so many methods and tools out there to help people create high-ranking content, but it's hard to know what strategy works when," said Burton. "This study eliminates 'tools' from the equation and lays down guidelines to aim for top-ranking creating content based on copywriting methodology."   Burton's team gathered the top 8 search engine results for 205 queries (for a total of 1,640 results). They then analyzed different copywriting structures of the top-ranking websites relating to their syntax, readability, word choice, length, etc., including the following analysis metrics:  - Automated Readability Index - Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease - Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level - Coleman-Liau Index - Gunning Fog Score - Number of Words - Number of Sentences - Percent of Complex Words - Average Words per Sentence  The results showed which aspects of copywriting correlated with top search engine rankings and revealed the following:   Useful Metrics: Results of the Gunning Fog Index and Automated Readability Index correlated most closely with the best search engine rankings.   Word Count: Long-form content ranked higher than short-form content (with the most successful content averaging between 1,700 and 2,300 words).  Sentence Count and Length: A higher number of sentences correlated with a higher rank, but a higher number of words per sentence correlated with a lower rank, suggesting that sentences should be as short and concise as possible. (The average word count per sentence of ranking content was 9.3 words.)   Word Complexity: Multi-syllable words don't appear to drag rank down. While it is generally assumed among the search engine optimization community that Google prioritizes familiar words, if the familiar word that fits best happens to be long, don't sweat it.
