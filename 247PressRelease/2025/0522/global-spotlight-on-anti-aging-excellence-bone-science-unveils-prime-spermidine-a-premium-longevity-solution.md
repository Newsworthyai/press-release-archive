# Global Spotlight on Anti-Aging Excellence : Bone Science Unveils 'Prime Spermidine' – A Premium Longevity Solution

NEW YORK, NY, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bone Science, a leading U.S. premium healthcare brand, announces the launch of its new anti-aging formula, 'Prime Spermidine,' capturing the attention of wellness-focused consumers worldwide. As the era of 'Well-Aging' takes center stage, spermidine has emerged as a key longevity ingredient, backed by cutting-edge science and growing global recognition.  At the forefront of anti-aging research, spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine compound in the body that plays a vital role in autophagy – the body's cellular renewal process that clears out damaged components to maintain optimal cell function. This mechanism has been associated with immune enhancement, cognitive function preservation, cardiovascular health, and overall age-related vitality.  Recently, Harvard Medical School's Dr. David Sinclair spotlighted the synergistic benefits of combining NMN with spermidine, accelerating consumer interest in this powerful longevity duo.  [High-Purity, Plant-Based Spermidine – Not From Yeast]  Prime Spermidine harnesses plant-derived spermidine from wheat germ, maintaining a structure identical to the natural form, and is manufactured in the U.S. using GRAS-certified ingredients in state-of-the-art cGMP and NSF-certified facilities.  Unlike conventional yeast-based sources, Prime Spermidine offers improved purity, stability, and high-dose absorption, delivering over 10mg per day.  (This product contains wheat germ extract, which may trigger allergic reactions. Individuals with gluten intolerance should consult a healthcare provider before use.)  [4X Absorption Formula: Superior Bioavailability]  To maximize bioavailability, Bone Science's proprietary "4X Formula" integrates spermidine with three powerful absorption enhancers:  • Liposomal Vitamin C • Phytosome Quercetin • Bioperine®  This innovative formulation has the potential to increase absorption by up to 233% and enhance bioavailability by up to 20 times. Actual results may vary depending on individual factors.  Prime Spermidine utilizes globally patented, pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, ensuring both efficacy and long-term safety for daily use.  A Bone Science spokesperson stated, "Spermidine is scientifically grounded in its anti-aging mechanisms and offers remarkable synergy when paired with NMN. As the longevity market evolves, Prime Spermidine is well-positioned as a premium option in advanced nutritional science."  He also pointed out, "Our formula mirrors the natural form, delivers superior absorption, and upholds the highest standards of safety—these are critical factors for discerning consumers committed to aging well."  Prime Spermidine is now available through the official Bone Science website and authorized retailers.  https://thebonescience.com
