# Our Children Must Be Our Focus Says Jody Sharpe, Bestselling Author Of 'Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder'

WILMINGTON, NC, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When we look at our headlines today, we must ask what might be one of the most important questions members of our generation could ever ask: "Is this the world we want to offer our children?"  The world has never been perfect, and here we are not talking about war, disease, famine and all the other problems we have experienced for centuries. Instead we need to look at how bullying has become a part of our culture. From the lowest form of playground antics to the bullying found at the highest levels of government, bullying has become acceptable. And that should never be.  In a recent article titled "Angels Inspiration: Our Children Our Focus," Sharpe wrote in part:  In these times when misguided adults are causing chaos in our world, the angels have inspired me to write this post. Our children in the world need to be our focus at this time. What are they hearing in their homes, what kind of words are they listening to? Is it intolerance or is it about teaching kindness?  Children should be witnessing love and togetherness. Instead our media is covering bullying, man's inhumanity to man. We need to see the truth how chaos and bullying destroy. We need to be covering the important way to live like helping those in need.  I wrote two books about children. One was the book about my work as a teacher with children who had special needs. Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder.  These children impacted my life with their no agenda ways and with only love in their hearts. The other book was my children's book, When The Angel Sent Butterflies, inspired by my grandchildren. An angel comes to help the character Kate with her fear of bees.  We adults need to think about the impact of words and the actions we are taking. Actions our children are seeing daily on TV or words they are hearing at home. The children are listening and watching.  The full text of the article is available at http://jodysharpe.com/tuesdays-with-the-angels-angels-inspiration-our-children-our-focus/.  Sharpe also announced that the ebook version of book 6 in the Mystic Bay Series, '20 Moon Rd., An Angel's Tale' recently achieved bestseller status. The book took First Place nationally in the novella category in the 2023 in the NFPW Professional Communication Contest.  In '20 Moon Rd., the bully never wins. Miracles still happen in the town of Mystic Bay California. Angels live as humans there. Angel Ken, a former football coach, is surprised when his late best friend, the indomitable psychic, Madam Norma, appears in spirit form and asks him to write the story of her life through her memories she will send him. Surprising to Angel Ken, Madam Norma saw thousands of angels since childhood.  Sharpe recently received an honorable mention in the 2024 National Federation of Press Women's Professional Communication contest at the national level for one of her novels, 'Summer of Angels'. This is the fourth NFPW win for her. In 2023, Town Of Angels Christmas also placed At Large, as did 'Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder'.  She was also featured in the September issue of 'Great Writers You Should Be Reading Magazine.'  Books by Jody Sharpe include:  To Catch an Angel - Jody is also the author of 'To Catch an Angel', written in memory of her late husband Steve.

Will Jordana recognize Angel Ken as the man from her past as they work together on a rescue mission to bring twenty-two horses to Mystic Bay before Christmas, will they see what lies before them, a Christmas story only the angels could write.  Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  One of her latest books, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California. While sleeping, an angel sent her a vision in a dream of a future event. Gayle realizes she must use her intuition to save an old man from drowning. But who is this old man?

With surprising twists and turns of intrigue and love, Gayle and Alex find there are angels at the helm as they help prove the bully never wins.
