# Cambrian and Anheuser-Busch Honored with Global Water Award Distinction for Industrial Project of the Year at 2025 Global Water Awards

BOSTON, MA, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cambrian, a leader in water reuse and energy recovery-as-a-service, announced that its landmark project with Anheuser-Busch has been awarded Distinction in the Industrial Project of the Year category at the 2025 Global Water Awards, held during the Global Water Summit.  This prestigious recognition celebrates innovation and achievement in the industrial water sector, spotlighting projects that deliver exceptional environmental and technical performance. Cambrian's project, delivered under its Water-Energy Purchase Agreement (WEPA) model, stood out for transforming how water reuse infrastructure is deployed and financed at scale.  "We're honored to receive this distinction from GWI, and proud to stand alongside Anheuser-Busch as pioneers in circular water solutions," said Matthew Silver, Founder and CEO of Cambrian. "This project proves that environmental stewardship and economic efficiency can go hand in hand, through bold innovation and strong partnership."  The project features Cambrian's advanced BlueCycle™ membrane bioreactor (MBR) system, which treats over 400,000 gallons of high-strength wastewater per day at Anheuser-Busch's Houston brewery. After further advanced treatment, the treated water is of drinking water quality and is reused onsite for non-potable contact purposes, significantly reducing freshwater consumption. Over a 20-year contract term, the system is expected to treat 3.45 billion gallons, lower water and wastewater costs by 20%, and prevent more than 23,000 tons of CO₂ emissions.  Delivered through Cambrian's WEPA model, the project required no upfront capital investment from Anheuser-Busch. Cambrian financed, built, and now operates the system, charging only by the gallon treated. Embedded Cambrian personnel manage operations, ensuring performance and removing maintenance burdens from the brewery's team.  The collaboration began through the 100+ Accelerator, Anheuser-Busch InBev's global sustainability innovation platform, and represents the first full-scale deployment of Cambrian's WEPA model within the beverage industry. The project's success reflects growing industry momentum for outcomes-based infrastructure, where environmental performance and economic value are intrinsically linked.  Presented by Global Water Intelligence, the Global Water Awards honor the most impactful water projects and technologies worldwide. The Industrial Project of the Year – Distinction is awarded to projects that exemplify technical excellence, sustainability leadership, and scalability in addressing industrial water challenges.
