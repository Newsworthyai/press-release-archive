# Maths Is Not Hot by Benjamin Anarfi-De-Khems is the relatable, laugh-out-loud book students and teachers have been waiting for

LONDON, ENGLAND, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Maths Is Not Hot: A Comedic Journey to Escape Maths at School is here to shake up how we think about maths. Written by experienced mathematics teacher Benjamin Anarfi-De-Khems, this refreshingly funny and relatable book explores the universal student struggle of trying (and failing) to dodge maths.  Through the misadventures of Jahman, a student on a mission to escape numbers, equations, and Pythagoras' theorem, Maths Is Not Hot turns maths anxiety into comedy gold. Whether it's doodling in his notebook, zoning out in class, or launching a full-blown escape mission to avoid trigonometry, Jahman's journey is one that students, teachers, and parents will all recognize, and laugh along with.  But beyond the humour, the book carries an important message: maths may be unavoidable, but learning can be engaging, entertaining, and even, dare we say, fun.  For generations, students have dreaded maths. They've questioned its relevance, struggled through equations, and wondered why they need to find 'x' when no one lost it in the first place. Maths Is Not Hot is more than just a funny take on this frustration, it's a cultural commentary on how maths is taught and perceived in schools.  •	A fresh approach to maths anxiety – Instead of intimidating students with complex theories, this book meets them where they are: frustrated, confused, and looking for a way out.  •	Perfect for students, teachers, and parents – Whether you're struggling with maths, teaching it, or trying to support a child who hates it, this book offers a lighthearted perspective that makes learning feel less daunting.  •	Bridging the gap between education and entertainment – Inspired by the rise of humorous educational content on TikTok and YouTube, Maths Is Not Hot brings a relatable, modern take on learning.  "As Head of Maths, I should be horrified by this book—but instead, I couldn't stop laughing! While the author tries to escape numbers at every turn, they accidentally prove one thing: maths is everywhere, whether they like it or not! A hilarious and strangely educational read for both maths lovers and avoiders alike." E. Palmer, Head of Mathematics, NCC.  "A brilliantly witty take on every student's nightmare—maths! This book turns dread into laughter, making it a must-read for anyone who's ever stared blankly at an algebra problem. The Pioneer Education celebrates creativity in learning, and this book is a testament to how humour can make even the most feared subjects entertaining." The Pioneer Education.  "At Skinat Tuition, we believe learning should be engaging—but we've never seen maths tackled quite like this! 'Maths is Not Hot' is a hilarious rebellion against numbers, yet somehow, it sneaks in just enough logic to keep us mathematicians entertained. A must-read for students who think they hate maths—and for tutors who need a good laugh!" Skinat Tuition.
