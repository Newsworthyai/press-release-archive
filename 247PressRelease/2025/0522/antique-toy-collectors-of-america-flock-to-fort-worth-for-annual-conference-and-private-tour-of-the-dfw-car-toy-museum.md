# Antique Toy Collectors of America Flock to Fort Worth for Annual Conference and Private Tour of the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Busloads of collectors from across the country rolled into Fort Worth this week as the Antique Toy Collectors of America (ATCA) held its annual conference in North Texas—and one stop had everyone buzzing with excitement. The group was treated to a private visit at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where members, many of whom are leading voices in the hobby, were left amazed by the scale and rarity of the collection.  Dale Kelley, publisher of Antique Toy World magazine—the go-to publication for collectors for over 40 years—declared that the DFW Car & Toy Museum is "likely the largest antique toy museum in the world."  "This is a dream come true for any serious collector," said Jeanne Bertoia of Bertoia Auctions, one of the most respected antique toy auction houses in the U.S. "To see so many rare and precious toys, displayed so beautifully and made available to the public—it's an incredible gift to the community and to the preservation of toy history."  More than just a toy museum, the 150,000 sq. ft. facility also boasts over 200 classic and exotic cars, a full gallery of coin-operated machines, vintage automobilia, and nostalgic decor from every era. But for ATCA members, the antique toy section was the main attraction—and with good reason. With over 3,000 vintage toys, the display reflects the lifelong passion of museum founder and collector Ron Sturgeon, who began acquiring toys in 1985 and hasn't looked back since.  "It's such a joy to watch guests light up when they spot a toy from their childhood—or their parent's childhood," said Sturgeon. "That emotional connection is what this museum is all about."  Whether you're a lifelong collector or just nostalgic for simpler times, the DFW Car & Toy Museum offers a glimpse into the past that's as educational as it is delightful.  Admission is free and the museum is dog-friendly—so bring the whole family (pups included!) and relive the magic of vintage toys and timeless cars.
