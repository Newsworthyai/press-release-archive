DONCASTER, ENGLAND, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Career change can be intimidating, particularly for women aged over 40 who are looking to move into leadership positions, transition into a new sector, or rediscover their sense of purpose at work. Ruth Heron, Chartered Member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (MCIPD) and award-winning Executive Coach launches her new book, Become Unstuck: Navigating Your Career Confidently, providing readers with a hands-on, empowering guide to breaking through career blockages.

Basing herself on her own actual professional life and achievement as her point of reference, Heron draws upon hard-won wisdom and battle-tested techniques to encourage women to create self-worth, develop leadership presence, and have faith in themselves to seize new career possibilities.  "Having faced career setbacks myself, I know firsthand the challenges of navigating transitions, overcoming workplace biases, and regaining confidence," says Heron. "This book is my way of guiding other women through these moments, equipping them with actionable tools to move forward."  A Timely Resource for Today's Professional Landscape In a fast-evolving job market, midlife career reinvention is becoming increasingly common. From professionals pivoting industries to women breaking barriers in leadership, Become Unstuck aligns with global trends, including:  • Midlife Career Changes: A growing trend urging women above 40 to pursue new career prospects. • Women in Leadership: Efforts like Harvard's Women Leaders: Advancing Together point to the increasing demand for women's leadership development. • The Pay Gap & Workplace Equity: Closing gender and age-based biases in the workplace, become unstuck offers career progression and financial independence strategies.
