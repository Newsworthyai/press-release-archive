# Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C. Congratulates 2025 Winners of the National Finals of "We the People"

WASHINGTON, DC, May 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Students from Oregon's Lincoln High School and Sprague High School competed in the Center for Civic Education's National Finals of "We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution" last month, in April, placing first. The Center for Civic Education hosts this annual competition, held in Washington, D.C., for high school students across the country. Students explore the relevance of constitutional principles to history and current events, learning how to become engaged and knowledgeable participants in the democratic process.  Teams qualify for nationals by winning their state competition or through "wild card" selection. In addition, one John Lewis class is selected as a tribute to former congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis.   Students participating in the National Finals of We the People attend simulated congressional hearings. They are divided into six groups based on the six parts of the We the People: The Citizen & the Constitution high school textbook. A panel of judges acting as members of specific congressional committees scores each group's performance.  Hearings begin with a four-minute opening statement, followed by an eight-minute period of questioning from the judges. Judges evaluate the students' knowledge of the Constitution and how it applies in both historical context and precedent and to current constitutional issues.  Seventy-two judges participated in the evaluation, including Attorney Israel Piedra, of Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C. Attorney Piedra stated, "I represented New Hampshire in the 'We the People' national competition as a high school student and was honored to have the opportunity to serve as a judge this year. It really was a full circle moment. I was very impressed by the insight and preparation demonstrated by these teams."  The Center for Civic Education is a leader in providing civic education to K-12 students and adults. Growing over the last 60 years, the organization now reaches more than 45 million students and 440,000 educators. "The We the People National Finals showcases the transformative power of civic education," said Dr. Donna Phillips, President and CEO of the Center for Civic Education. It's an exciting event that helps produce leaders of the future and ensures that the principles our country was founded on remain in place.  About Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C.
