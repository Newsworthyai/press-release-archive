# Sisel Day of Service Honors Founder's Legacy with Global Acts of Kindness

SPRINGVILLE, UT, August 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sisel International continued its annual tradition of service on July 15 with the 2025 Tom Mower Sr. United Day of Sisel Service, a global initiative honoring the company's late founder through meaningful community engagement. This year's effort was carried out in partnership with The Creative Kindness Foundation, focusing on the creation and donation of handmade gifts to bring comfort and encouragement to individuals in need.  The Sisel Day of Service was established to reflect the values of kindness, generosity, and service that Tom Mower Sr. championed throughout his life. Each year on July 15, Sisel employees, partners, and supporters around the world come together to give back to their communities in a shared expression of compassion and unity.  The 2025 initiative brought team members together to handcraft a variety of thoughtful gifts intended to uplift recipients in local hospitals, shelters, and care facilities. The collaboration with The Creative Kindness Foundation added a new dimension to this year's service activities by promoting creativity for connection and healing.  Over the past four years, the Day of Service has evolved to include a wide range of volunteer projects that align with the mission and values of Sisel International. In 2022, teams cleaned trash and removed weeds from public properties to improve shared spaces. In 2023, employees assembled motion skill kits designed to support children's physical development. Last year, in 2024, volunteers gathered to make blankets for use in local hospitals—an effort that carried forward into this year's theme of comfort and care.  Sisel CEO and Founder, Tom Mower Jr., shared, "Every year, the Day of Service provides an opportunity to pause and reflect on what it means to serve others. It's not just about the project itself, but the intention behind it—honoring Tom Mower Sr.'s vision and extending that spirit of service into the lives of others."  Sisel extends sincere appreciation to The Creative Kindness Foundation for helping make this year's effort both heartfelt and impactful. The company also thanks the many individuals and families who took time to serve in their own communities on July 15, contributing to a global ripple effect of kindness. Sisel International is proud to carry on the legacy of Tom Mower Sr. through action, year after year.
