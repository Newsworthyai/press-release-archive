Threat Monitoring: Track the movement of people and systems using both automation and logs to detect potential problems quickly.  6 Tips to Boost Website Security  Begin Cyberattack prevention with 6 effective tips:  1. Create Strong passwords and change them often: Never keep default login details. Establish strict password policies for all users accessing your control panel or database.  2. Add SSL certificates to your entire website: Encrypt all the information in or out, along with payment or authentication pages.  3. Update all plugins, themes, and software regularly, as hijackers use outdated versions to hack sites.  4. Limit user permissions carefully: Only provide access to relevant teams that need it. This is an ideal way to ensure Online business security.  5. Create frequent site backups: Store clean versions of your website in multiple locations. This lets you bounce back fast after any incident.  6. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): In case passwords are compromised, MFA will still block unauthorized access.  Website Security Factors  1. Firewalls: Block dangerous traffic before it touches your website.   2. Encryption: Hide sensitive information from people trying to steal it.   3. Backups: Have backup files in case of disasters.  4. Access Controls: Define strict rules about who can perform which actions.   5. Audit Logs: Track all activities in admin areas and server operations.   6. Security Testing: Find vulnerabilities before criminals discover them.
