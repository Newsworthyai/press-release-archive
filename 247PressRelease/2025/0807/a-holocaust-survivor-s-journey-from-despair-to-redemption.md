# A Holocaust Survivor's Journey from Despair to Redemption

LORDS VALLEY, PA, August 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an unflinching and deeply human memoir that spans continents, generations, and spiritual awakenings, Alexander Deutsch presents So, Tell Me Why, a stirring autobiographical journey chronicling his escape from Communist Romania, survival in the wake of the Holocaust, and eventual rediscovery of faith in the United States.  So, Tell Me Why is more than a personal reflection. It is a heartfelt account of a Jewish engineer's life marked by historic trauma, cultural survival, and a spiritual awakening later in life that brought healing, purpose, and a renewed connection to God.  Born in Transylvania shortly after World War II, Deutsch takes readers through the harsh realities of growing up in a Socialist regime, enduring religious and ethnic persecution, and navigating the complexity of identity in a hostile environment. The book explores:  • His family's painful history with antisemitism and the Holocaust • The brutal realities of Communist Romania and the challenges of immigration • His long career as an electrical engineer in the U.S. and the spiritual void that persisted despite professional success • A transformative faith experience that reshaped his worldview and personal relationships  Through detailed chapters, Deutsch not only recounts key milestones—his immigration to America, rebuilding a life from scratch, raising a family, and experiencing miraculous changes through divine intervention—but also offers readers comfort, perspective, and wisdom.  "God, who even unknowingly to me, was always my spiritual and material Creator, has responded in such a deep way to my call," Deutsch writes. "Without a doubt, I know that HE is in my corner."  The book is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring power of belief. Whether readers are navigating personal challenges, exploring faith, or trying to understand generational trauma, So, Tell Me Why serves as a guide and companion.  About the Author:  Alexander Deutsch is a Jewish-Romanian immigrant, electrical engineer, husband, father, and grandfather. After decades of wrestling with personal demons and spiritual questions, he found redemption through faith. His memoir is a labor of love and an offering to those who may still be searching for answers, connection, or hope.  So, Tell Me Why is now available in print and ebook formats through major retailers.  For review copies, interviews, or speaking engagements, please contact alexdeutsch136@gmail.com
