# Everlasting Beauty Now Open and Accepting Appointments at the Salon and Spa Galleria Denton Highway in Haltom City, Texas

HALTOM CITY, TX, August 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Yenahira J. Maisonet-Acevedo's fascination with nails and beauty started young. Her mother was instrumental in fostering a love for beauty and nails.  "As a child, I was immersed in the beauty business," Maisonet-Acevedo said. "I went into this because I saw my mom doing this when I was little, and I've always liked nails." And now, she's delighted to be opening her new salon, Everlasting Beauty, at the Salon and Spa Galleria Denton Highway in Haltom City, Texas. Maisonet-Acevedo's specialties include gel and acrylic nails; manicures; haircuts and styling; fades; color; brow waxing; eyelash extensions; and lash/brow tinting.  Maisonet-Acevedo got her start by attending the Birdville Center of Technology and Advanced Learning in North Richland Hills, and proudly notes that her first customer from when she was in school continues to be a client of hers today.  "I really like getting to know my clients," Maisonet-Acevedo said. "That way, I ensure their satisfaction and can be certain everything is to their liking." Clients can view examples of her work by paying a visit to the Everlasting Beauty Instagram page.  She's accrued seven years of experience in the field, and it's easy to see she's excited about her newest venture. Maisonet-Acevedo plans to offer specialized training for others interested in entering the industry, including one-on-one nail classes and preparation for the state board testing.  "They will get in-depth training and preparation to take the state exam," Maisonet-Acevedo said. "It will be individualized training, instead of being in a room full of other people. I am a teacher at heart, and I want others to learn and better themselves," she added.
