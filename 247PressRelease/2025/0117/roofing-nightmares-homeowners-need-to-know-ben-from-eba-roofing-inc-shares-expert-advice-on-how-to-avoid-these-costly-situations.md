# Roofing Nightmares Homeowners Need to Know — Ben from EBA Roofing Inc. Shares Expert Advice on how to avoid these costly situations

LOS ANGELES, CA, January 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new roof should protect your home and family, but what happens when a roofing job goes horribly wrong?  Ben, the owner of EBA Roofing Inc., an award-winning roofing company serving Greater Los Angeles, CA, shares cautionary tales and expert advice to help homeowners avoid costly mistakes and choose reliable roofers.  Roofing Nightmare #1: Houdini The Vanishing Act A homeowner hired a roofer offering an unbelievably low price. The crew started the job, tore off the old roof, and then disappeared—leaving the home exposed to the elements. The homeowner had to scramble to find a trustworthy roofing company to complete the project.  Ben's Tip: "A drastically low bid is a major red flag. Always verify licensing and insurance, and get multiple written estimates. Be cautious of contractors demanding full payment upfront."  Roofing Nightmare #2: Hidden Damage Disaster After a storm, a homeowner hired a contractor for what seemed like minor roof damage. The roofer failed to inspect thoroughly, and months later, significant leaks revealed extensive structural damage hidden beneath the surface.  Ben's Tip: "A thorough roof inspection is essential after storms. Reputable contractors will assess both visible and hidden issues, such as sheathing damage or poor ventilation."  Roofing Nightmare #3: Cheap Materials, Costly Consequences A homeowner hired a low-cost roofer using subpar materials. Within a year, shingles began buckling and falling off due to poor workmanship and materials.  Ben's Tip: "Quality materials and proper installation matter. Investing in reputable brands and experienced roofers may cost more upfront but prevents costly repairs later."
