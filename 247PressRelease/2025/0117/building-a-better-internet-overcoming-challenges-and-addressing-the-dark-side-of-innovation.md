# Building a Better Internet: Overcoming Challenges and Addressing the Dark Side of Innovation

NEW YORK, NY, January 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the push for an agentic internet — one where individuals have more control over their data and digital identities — gains momentum, the growing influence of decentralized technologies must be met with both optimism and caution. While the promise of a user-centric digital world is inspiring, the rise of new technologies also brings challenges, including legal battles and concerns about fraud. Industry leaders are now advocating for solutions that protect users and prevent exploitation while promoting innovation.  Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has long championed the transformative potential of decentralized technologies but acknowledges that as the space grows, so do the risks. Silbert addresses the growing concern that bad actors might exploit these technologies, pointing to recent lawsuits and cases where companies or individuals were accused of defrauding investors and users. He emphasizes that the adoption of decentralized systems must be coupled with robust legal frameworks that protect users from potential harm and promote transparency in the marketplace.  Caitlin Long, founder of Avanti Financial Group, shares a similar view, stressing that while decentralized finance (DeFi) holds tremendous promise, it also requires careful regulation to prevent fraud. Long notes that without clear and enforceable rules, individuals and entities may misuse these technologies for malicious purposes, leaving consumers vulnerable. She highlights the importance of building a legal infrastructure that can prevent defrauding and ensure that users are protected as they navigate the evolving digital landscape.  As decentralized platforms continue to reshape the internet, industry experts agree that creating a balance between freedom and regulation is key to ensuring that the agentic internet can work for everyone. Efforts to democratize the internet and empower individuals should not come at the expense of security and fairness. By addressing the risks, including fraud and potential lawsuits, leaders in the space are focused on creating a safer environment for users while still fostering the innovation that promises to redefine how we interact online.
