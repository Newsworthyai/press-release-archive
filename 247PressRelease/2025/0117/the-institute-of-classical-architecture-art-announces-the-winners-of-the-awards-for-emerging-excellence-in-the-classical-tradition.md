NEW YORK, NY, January 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Institute of Classical Architecture & Art (ICAA) is pleased to announce the winners of the Awards for Excellence in the Classical Tradition. The Awards for Emerging Excellence are a suite of prizes that recognizes exceptional talent exhibited by young professionals in architecture, landscape, and craftsmanship. The Awards seek to highlight emerging talent that engages with classical design, demonstrating a thoughtful use of precedents from the past in projects that are forward-looking, creative, and holistically demonstrate their talents.  Kate Chambers has been named the winner of the Architect's Prize For Excellence in Architecture. The Prize, given with The King's Foundation and INTBAU, is awarded to an emerging architect whose work exhibits a holistic understanding of the principles of classical design, and whose projects show a demonstrable excellence in their design.   Kate Chambers received her Master of Architecture and Master of Architectural Design & Urbanism from Notre Dame in 2018. While at Notre Dame, she had the opportunity to complete an independent research project on the history of modern Greek architecture and a pattern book for repairing the modern city. Her research was grounded in on-site documentation performed in Athens.  Following graduation she moved to Montgomery, Alabama to work for Tippett Sease Baker Architecture. The firm designs exclusively through hand drawing and focuses on traditional vernacular architecture. In recent years Kate returned to Notre Dame as a visiting professor, then Assistant Professor of the Practice, for the academic years of 2021-2024 during which time she continued to practice architecture. She has also had the opportunity to participate as a design professional in several Dean's Charrettes held by the University of Notre Dame's Housing and Community Regeneration Initiative. Kate is a registered architect in Alabama and North Carolina.  Alice Arnn, an associate at Michael G. Imber Architects, is the runner up for the Architect's Prize, with Sohaib Ahmad Javed of Kamil Khan Mumtaz Architects receiving honorable mention.  Douglas Clark has been named the winner of the Bunny Mellon Prize for Excellence in Garden Design, recognizing work completed for Janice Parker Landscape Architects. The Prize is awarded to an emerging designer whose work furthers the ICAA's commitment to design and craftsmanship as being vital to lasting and meaningful places. Further, the prize honors emerging professionals that demonstrate skilled knowledge of horticulture in a design that holistically considers the symbiosis between outdoor environments and physical structures and is in the spirit of Bunny Mellon's "ceaseless interest, passion, and pleasure" in gardens, horticulture, and design.  Douglas Clark is a Landscape Architect at Janice Parker Landscape Architects, with over twelve years of landscape design experience and seven years as a licensed landscape architect. Of Brazilian-American heritage, Douglas was inspired early on by his grandfather's garden, where he developed a deep appreciation for the harmony between nature, garden, and home—a passion that continues to shape his career.  Douglas earned his Master's degree in Architecture in 2012, with his thesis, Prospect Refuge and Its Impact on Social Dialog in Our Built Environment, earning recognition from the Boston Society of Architecture for its exploration of how spaces influence human connection. That same year, he joined Janice Parker Landscape Architects.  In 2017, Douglas became a licensed landscape architect, and in 2018, he was named one of House Beautiful's Next Wave Designers, celebrated for his innovative approach to integrating classical principles with modern sensibilities.  His work spans many locations, including New York, New England, Florida, Sardinia, and Brazil, focusing on private residential gardens that seamlessly extend the home. Each project reflects his commitment to sustainability, environmental stewardship, and timeless design while honoring the individuality of his clients and the surrounding landscape.  Outside of work, Douglas enjoys spending time with his wife and two children and exploring his passion for cooking as an inspired amateur chef, often drawing from his Brazilian heritage and international experiences.  Alexis Stanhope, a project manager at Hollander Design Landscape Architects, is the runner up for the Bunny Mellon Prize.  Leyla Alekperova has been named the winner of the Maker's Prize for Excellence in Craftsmanship. The Prize is awarded to the emerging craftsperson, artist, or tradesperson whose work demonstrates a wealth of knowledge and excellence in a traditional building art, such as ornamental plaster, decorative painting and finishing, furniture design, masonry, blacksmithing, or any other allied art.  Leyla Alekperova is an immigrant professional and a third-generation artist dedicated to advancing her family's legacy in plaster craftsmanship. As a graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology with a BA in Visual Arts and Technology, her background in contemporary design blends with a deep passion for classical tradition.  Today, Leyla is a Plaster Molding Designer at Arkada Plus. She takes an active role in both the creative and managerial aspects of the business at her family's Brooklyn-based company. In her work, Leyla links tradition with innovation—infusing classical architectural style techniques with modern aesthetics—to create plaster moldings that add character to interior spaces.  Her success in finding the golden balance in the company's growth through generational legacy, modern innovation, and efficiency has shown how much she honors the dedication, vision, and hard work that shapes a more beautiful future for the advancing architectural landscape.
