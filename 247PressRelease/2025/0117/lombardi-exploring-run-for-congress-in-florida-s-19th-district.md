# Lombardi Exploring Run For Congress In Florida's 19th District

CAPE CORAL, FL, January 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Former Illinois Republican Congressional candidate and entrepreneur Jack Lombardi announced that he is exploring a possible run for Florida's 19th Congressional District should Representative Byron Donald not seek re-election. Lombardi like thousands of Americans relocated to the Sunshine State from a Blue State to get away from high taxes, a surging crime rate, and a woke agenda in schools. Lombardi who has two young girls was attracted to Florida's education system where wokeism has been banned and students are taught commonsense values and lessons. On an even more personal level, Lombardi selected the Naples area to be close to his parents and assist his mother as his father was slowly declining in health and has now passed away. He sees the 19th District as his family's home and one of the best areas in the nation to raise a family and own a business.  Lombardi is known as a strong conservative advocate. He has stood up to the special interests and establishment to prevent a woke agenda that deprives Americans of basic freedoms and economic opportunity. In Illinois, he tirelessly fought against Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's draconian Covid policies.  "Like thousands, I see Florida as a land of opportunity and freedom," said Jack Lombardi. "Byron Donalds has been a tireless champion of conservative values in Congress. He along with other members of the Florida delegation have worked to see that America embraces the values and policies of the 'Free State' of Florida.  "Should Byron decide not to seek re-election, it is essential that the 19th District have a proven conservative representing it in Congress and supporting the Trump agenda," concluded Lombardi. "I would definitely consider being that person."  A natural entrepreneur, Lombardi earned his first money at age 8 selling soda on a neighborhood street corner. He started his first business, Lombardi Trucking, by age 22 and has never looked back.   He is proud to be the husband of Sharon Lombardi and father of his son Jack III and daughters, Summer and Joy.
