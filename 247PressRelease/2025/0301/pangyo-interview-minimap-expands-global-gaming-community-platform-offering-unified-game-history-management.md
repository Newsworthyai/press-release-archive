# [Pangyo Interview] Minimap Expands Global Gaming Community Platform, Offering Unified Game History Management

PANGYO, KOREA, March 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Launched 2017 in South Korea, Minimap (CEO Sunghee Cho) has evolved into a global gaming community platform, boasting 250,000 monthly active users (MAU). The platform provides gamers with a dedicated social media space and collaborates with major game companies and publishers, including Sony, Nexon, Com2uS, and Gamepia.  Minimap offers personalized game recommendations based on actual player data and facilitates community engagement among users with similar interests. It is the only platform that integrates game data from four major gaming ecosystems—Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo—allowing users to manage their entire gaming history in one place. This functionality enables advertisers to execute highly targeted marketing campaigns while game companies can leverage organic community-driven promotions.  Minimap's Global Operations Director, George Jeong, explained, "Gamers play across multiple platforms, but their data remains fragmented. Minimap addresses this issue by consolidating game history into a single platform." The company hosts a database of 160,000 games and over three million user game reviews, providing advertisers with optimized marketing solutions. Having successfully entered the North American market in 2023, Minimap is steadily expanding its global presence. The English-language version, launched in July of the same year, has gained traction across English-speaking countries. In 2025, the company aims to extend its reach into Southeast Asia, further growing its international user base.  Minimap's key business partners include major global publishers such as Sony, Microsoft, EA, and SEGA, as well as independent game studios. By utilizing Minimap's extensive user data, game companies can efficiently target their core audiences while Minimap continues to expand its advertising partnerships.  Located in Pangyo Techno Valley, home to leading game companies like Nexon, Smilegate, Neowiz, and NCSoft, Minimap benefits from close networking opportunities and collaboration with industry giants. Jeong emphasized, "Pangyo offers the ideal environment from a geographical, strategic, and business standpoint. It provides easy access to major game developers and government startup support programs."  Minimap will attend South by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas in March. The company will operate a booth in the Korean Pavilion to expand its global network."Minimap is more than just a game management platform—it's a space where gamers can enhance their gaming experience," Jeong stated. "We will continue introducing innovative features to solidify our presence in the global market."  Pangyo Techno Valley is a global integrated R&D hub focused on IT, BT, CT, and NT, integrating Research (R), People (P), Information (I), and Trade (T). As Gyeonggi-do's representative innovation cluster, Pangyo Techno Valley was established to secure national new growth drivers such as technological innovation, human resource development, job creation, and enhancing international business competitiveness. As of 2023, 1,666 companies employ 78,751 people, and it has positioned itself as the most innovative hub in South Korea, with sales amounting to 167.7 trillion KRW (125.5 billion USD).  Furthermore, the Techno Valley Innovation Division of the Gyeonggi-do Business & Science Accelerator (GBSA) holds monthly events such as the Pangyo Evening Meet-Up, Pan-Pan Day, and the Pangyo Startup Investment Exchange "In-Best Pangyo" to maximize the value of Pangyo Techno Valley.
