# PRESENTATION OF THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOUSE MUSEUM PROJECT: FUTURE HOLY GRAIL INTERPRETATION CENTRE

VALENCIA, SPAIN, March 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The presentation of this new cultural space was also attended by the project coordinator, Miguel Navarro Sorní; the Archbishop of Valencia, Monsignor Enrique Benavent; and the Regional Secretary for Culture, Pilar Tébar.  On Thursday 27 February 2025, the presentation of the museum project of the 'Casa del Relojero', which will house the Interpretation Centre of the Holy Chalice, took place in the courtyard of the City Museum. This space will be dedicated to the dissemination and study of the sacred relic and its history, in an environment that will highlight the cultural and heritage wealth that has been generated over the centuries.  The event was attended by the Director General of Cultural Heritage, Marta Alonso; the Deputy for Culture at the Provincial Council of Valencia, Paco Teruel; as well as numerous representatives from the world of Culture, the Chapter of the Cathedral of Valencia and the various entities linked to the worship and devotion to the holy relic, and was enlivened by the group Capella de Ministrers, who performed several pieces of music from the medieval period regarding the Holy Chalice.  The mayoress of Valencia, María José Catalá, highlighted the importance of this project for the city and its impact on the promotion of cultural tourism. Together with her, Dr. Miquel Navarro Sorní, head of the museum project, highlighted the invaluable collaboration of numerous doctors and experts in the field, with a mention of the internationalisation work carried out through the Cultural Association The Way of the Holy Grail.  During the event, Dr. Ana Mafé García informed the authorities present about the progress made in the candidacy process of the Cultural Itinerary 'The Way of the Holy Grail, Route of Knowledge, Path of Peace'. In this regard, she announced that on 6 and 7 May, a group of experts from the International Association of the Cultural Route of the Holy Grail in Europe will travel to Luxembourg to continue the work of recognising this route at European level.  Dr. Ana Mafé García also commented on the internationalisation work carried out by the Cultural Association The Way of the Holy Grail since 2015 to position the city of Valencia as a focal point of the western Mediterranean… thanks to the history of the Holy Grail to José Vicente Navarro Raga, CVC member and president of the cultural society Lo Rat Penat.  The creation of a Holy Chalice Interpretation Centre in Valencia is a project of great historical, cultural and touristic importance. For more than two decades, this visionary association has been calling for its importance (The Holy Grail) to be more widely recognised. Since this space will serve to disseminate the importance of the Holy Chalice as an object of devotion and religious heritage, consolidating Valencia as a key destination within the Cultural Itinerary The Way of the Holy Grail in Europe.  For more than 20 years, the Cultural Association 'The Way of the Holy Grail' has worked tirelessly to promote this itinerary, allowing pilgrims from all over the world to travel the routes that lead to the Cathedral of Valencia. The fitting out of the 'Casa del Relojero' as an interpretation centre will facilitate the understanding of the meaning of the chalice and its history, allowing visitors and believers to immerse themselves in the spiritual and cultural richness of the route.  In addition to its religious and touristic relevance, the Holy Chalice (Holy Grail) has scientific support that reinforces its authenticity. Dr. Ana Mafé García has published the only doctoral thesis in the world that, applying the scientific method, demonstrates that the Christian oral tradition that supports the history of the Holy Chalice is true and not a historical fake. This research provides a solid basis for the history of the chalice and reinforces its importance in the academic and archaeological field. Since 2019, including ZDF German television channel, the BBC and in 2024 with NETFLIX, various television productions have given an international account of the research work about the Holy Grail.  The impact of this project on tourism and culture in Valencia will be significant. The centre will offer an outreach space that will attract not only pilgrims and religious tourists, but also researchers and academics interested in the history of Christianity. It will become a point of reference where visitors can learn about the trajectory of the Holy Chalice from its origin in Jerusalem to its arrival at Valencia Cathedral, as well as its influence on art, literature and Christian devotion over the centuries.  The internationalisation work carried out by the Cultural Association 'The Way of the Holy Grail' has been key to positioning this itinerary at European level. With the candidacy of the Way of the Holy Grail as a European Cultural Itinerary, the possibility of receiving official recognition opens up, which will strengthen the global projection of Valencia as a first-class spiritual destination. This recognition would truly help to increase the flow of visitors and the value of the city's historical heritage.  The Holy Chalice Interpretation Centre will not only be an exhibition space, but also a place of learning and innovation where visitors will be able to interact with didactic exhibitions and advanced technology. This will allow a more inclusive and engaging access to the history of the chalice, offering an enriching experience for believers, scholars and tourists alike.  In short, the creation of this centre represents a milestone for Valencia, as it will unite history, science and faith, providing tangible support for the tradition of the Holy Chalice. Thanks to the efforts of the Cultural Association 'The Way of the Holy Grail' and the rigorous research of Dr. Ana Mafé García, Valencia is positioned as an epicentre of the history of Christianity and a pilgrimage destination of great global relevance.  The Holy Grail Interpretation Centre is emerging as a benchmark in the research and dissemination of the legacy of the chalice, attracting both scholars and visitors interested in the history and culture linked to the Holy Grail. This project reinforces Valencia's commitment to the preservation and promotion of its historical heritage.  The news is being disseminated in the international press thanks to the support of the Valencia City Council, the Tourism Board of the Valencia Provincial Council (Turisme Diputació de València), and Turisme Comunitat Valenciana, in collaboration with Turismo Aragón.
