A recent review of the book by AWA stated, "One of the book's greatest strengths is its world-building. De Berge weaves the flora and fauna of Baja California into the narrative, making the setting feel like a character itself. Talking cacti, dust devils playing tag, and wise desert tortoises enrich the stories, placing readers in an enchanting ecosystem where the line between reality and fantasy blurs.  "The themes of community, creativity, and environmental respect run throughout the collection. Young readers will enjoy the magical adventures and witty dialogue, while adults will appreciate the underlying messages about cooperation, individuality, and harmony with nature."  Earl Vincent de Berge is also the author of 'A Finger of Land on an Old Man's Hand'. This coming of age memoir is more than just another adventure story; it's a meditation on resilience, friendship, and the inescapable pull of self-discovery. Each challenge -- be it physical or emotional -- becomes a steppingstone in the explorers' evolution, perhaps reminding readers of their own capacity for growth. It offers a compelling testament to the human spirit's capacity for transformation.  The Baja Peninsula serves as both a backdrop and a mirror. It immerses readers in four explorers' transformative journey through Baja California in 1962 and 1964, inspired by 'The Forgotten Peninsula' by Joseph Wood Krutch.  Photography enthusiasts will be thrilled to know the book offers a treasure trove of previously unreleased vintage photographs of Baja, the second-longest peninsula in the world.  One reviewer called the book, ". . . a beautifully written, fabulous tale of an incredibly brave and daring journey." ReaderViews, in their 5-star review said, "A Finger of Land on an Old Man's Hand by Earl Vincent de Berge is the stark, witty, and profound memoir of four college students testing their limits on the Baja Peninsula in the summer of 1962. One could think of this as the classic literary assignment, 'How I Spent My Summer Vacation.' Only to do so would be to grossly underestimate this narrative."  Earl's adventures in Baja deepened his youthful fascination with the Sonoran Desert and its plants and animals, and inspired him to write a collection of charming stories for young readers. The main characters are Big Ears Jack – a huge magician jackrabbit – and other animals, birds and plants of the Sonoran Desert and its coastal regions. 'Big Ears Jack and Friends,' is now available on Amazon in both print and e-book formats and would be a unique and delightful addition to anyone's Easter basket.  The book took Best In Category 2024, Nonfiction, from the Arizona Authors Association.  To date, Earl has also published three collections of his poems, 'Allegro to Life,' 'Swans to Carry Me,' and 'Wind in the Elephant Tree,' which touch on nature, human nature, love, desert silence, and life in Guatemala.  All of de Berge's books are available at Amazon and other online book retailers. More information, including an excerpt from the book and a PDF of selected photos from 'A Finger of Land On An Old Man's Hand', with insider details revealing Baja in the 1960s, is available at his website at https://www.earldeberge.com/.
