NEW YORK, NY, April 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Architecture and design enthusiasts have a reason to celebrate. Renowned architecture firm Creo Design Collective, Inc., led by Keith Buckley, R.A., in collaboration with boutique interior design studio P&T Interiors LLC, headed by Pol Theis, are featured in acclaimed photographer Nicole England's latest high-end coffee table book: ART IN RESIDENCE.  Step into a world where homes are not merely spaces to live, but curated environments that tell stories of creativity, culture, and personal identity.  In ART IN RESIDENCE, England explores extraordinary residences around the globe that are as much about the art they house as the architecture itself.  From an artist's industrial studio in New York to a modern coastal retreat in Victoria, Australia, these dwellings all share a common thread: they are home to exceptional, thought-provoking art. But this book isn't about who lives in themâ€”it's about what makes these spaces truly exceptional.  Some interiors feature modern art collections from across the globe; others reflect a lifetime of collecting deeply personal objects. ART IN RESIDENCE offers readers a compelling look into 22 architecturally rich homes, captured through Nicole England's award-winning lens, and accompanied by intimate, soulful interviews with the homeowners.
