# UN Publishes KAILASA's 28th Report Recognizing Hindu Indigeneity and UAN

GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, October 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The report, presented as part of the call for contributions to the 60th session of the UN Human Rights Council, highlights the historic and ongoing struggles of Hindus as an indigenous civilization and underscores the broader global need to dismantle colonial legacies.  The comprehensive submission emphasizes that Hindus—followers of Sanatana Dharma—are the indigenous people of Bharat (ancient India) and across Asia.  Unlike Christianity and Islam, which entered the region through conquest and external imposition, Hindu traditions have thrived for millennia across 56 indigenous Hindu nations spanning over 6 million km².  Key Highlights of the Report:   Indigenous Identity of Hindus: Hindus are recognized as the native inheritors of the Vedic civilizational tradition. Colonial powers, however, disrupted this identity by artificially constructing labels such as "caste" and "tribe" to divide and control populations.   Colonialism and Coloniality: Beyond physical colonization, European coloniality entrenched Eurocentric frameworks that delegitimized indigenous systems of law, governance, and knowledge.   Neo-Hindutva as Colonial Construct: The report critically examines the role of British-supported ideologies, such as that of V.D. Savarkar, in fragmenting Hindu society and aiding colonial divide-and-rule policies.   The Revival of KAILASA: Under the leadership of The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam—recognized as the Sovereign of 21 ancient Hindu kingdoms—KAILASA has revived the continuity of indigenous Hindu statehood.  Operating as a government-in-exile, it represents the assertion of decoloniality and the restoration of Hindu Swaraj (self-governance).   Persecution of KAILASA and Hindus Worldwide:  The report documents systemic human rights violations against The SPH and KAILASA, including deep state-sponsored violence, unlawful persecution, suppression of Hindu religious freedom, and illegal detention and torture of SPH and KAILASA members.   Global Alliance of Indigenous Nations: Through the United Ancient Nations, KAILASA has united over 160 indigenous nations and communities worldwide, advancing the shared struggle for sovereignty, cultural survival, and recognition.  Call to Action:  The report urges the United Nations and international community to:  • Recognize Hindus as indigenous peoples under UNDRIP. • Investigate systemic persecution of Hindu indigenous communities. • Hold deep state and non-state actors accountable for violations of religious and cultural sovereignty. • Support decolonial movements worldwide that seek to restore indigenous self-determination.  The struggle of KAILASA is not an isolated issue—it represents the universal fight of indigenous peoples against colonial legacies that persist today. Protecting the rights of Hindus and all indigenous communities is critical for global justice, peace, and cultural continuity.
