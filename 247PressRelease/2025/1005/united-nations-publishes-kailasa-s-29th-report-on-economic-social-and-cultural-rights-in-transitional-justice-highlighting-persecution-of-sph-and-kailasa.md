# United Nations Publishes KAILASA's 29th Report on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in Transitional Justice, Highlighting Persecution of SPH and KAILASA

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has published the 29th report submitted by KAILASA, the Ancient Enlightened Sanatana Hindu Civilizational Nation, in response to the Special Rapporteur on truth, justice and reparation's call for inputs on economic, social, and cultural (ESC) rights in the context of transitional justice.  The report underscores the systemic violations faced by Indigenous Hindu communities and advocates for reparative measures rooted in Hindu principles to restore dignity, equity, and cultural autonomy.  The report addresses the UN's key questions on how ESC rights intersect with transitional justice pillarsâ€”truth, justice, reparation, guarantees of non-recurrence, and memorialization.  It details historical and ongoing injustices, including the Hindu Holocaust, which resulted in the loss of 56 Hindu nations, over 500 million lives, and the destruction of thousands of temples and educational institutions.   The submission highlights colonial-era intensifications under British rule, such as the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 and the nationalization of Hindu temples, as well as post-colonial discrimination through state appropriation and cultural alienation.  A central case study focuses on the persecution of KAILASA and its Sovereign, The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, from 2010 to 2025.   This includes over 70 assassination attempts, 250 sexual assaults, 120 false legal cases, and $27 million in property destruction, alongside economic warfare, gender-based violence against women's institutions, and violations of indigenous rights under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).   The report exposes institutional bias, media disinformation, and the dismantling of traditional knowledge systems, emphasizing the need for people-centered approaches that integrate marginalized voices and gender perspectives.  KAILASA's submission calls for a paradigm shift in transitional justice, incorporating Indigenous Hindu epistemologies to address root causes of violence and prevent recurrence.  The report promotes KAILASA's solutions, including indigenous-led initiatives for sustainable development, education, and human rights.  It advocates for global commitments to acknowledge past atrocities, restore equitable resource access, and empower Hindu communities through participatory methodologies.  This publication marks another milestone in KAILASA's ongoing engagement with the UN, reaffirming its role in reviving 10,000 indigenous Hindu traditions and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.
