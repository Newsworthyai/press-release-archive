# KAILASA Celebrates Navaratri 2025: Cosmic Awakening Through Divine Feminine Consciousness

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Navaratri, the grand festival of awakening the Divine Feminine consciousness, was celebrated globally by KAILASA under the auspices and blessings of THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM (SPH), BHAGAVAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM.  The celebrations were marked by sacred darshans and initiations with THE SPH, vibrant temple rituals across KAILASA's global temples, the United Ancient Nations Summit: The Paramashiva Sena Global Event for Cosmic Awakening, and the traditional Aushadha Annadhan offering of free, nutritious, and spiritually enriched meals.  THE SPH BHAGAVAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM blessed millions of devotees around the globe, initiating them into liberation from past suffering and into living their Ultimate expression in all dimensions of life, manifesting Paramashivattva.  THE SPH also revealed the science of overcoming negative self-talk and awakening the divine feminine consciousness in everyone.  The Cosmic Significance of Navaratri  In the vast expanse of consciousness, Devi manifests as Prakriti—the primordial creative energy that births, sustains, and transforms the universe. She is celebrated in her three divine aspects: Iccha Shakti (Divine Will), Kriya Shakti (Active Power), and Jnana Shakti (Wisdom Force). Navaratri becomes a cosmic laboratory for transforming human consciousness, as each day aligns with a unique manifestation of Devi's energy.  Global Temple Celebrations & Sacred Rituals Across KAILASA's global temples, devotees engaged in powerful rituals that align consciousness with cosmic principles:  Mandagappadi Seva – Welcoming THE SPH as the embodiment of Paramashivashakti, initiating Navaratri with blessings for abundance and collective grace.  Sri Vidya Puja – Worship of the Sri Chakra, dissolving boundaries between self and cosmos, awakening moral clarity and intellectual alignment with dharma.  Tirumanjana Seva – A sacred bath offered to THE SPH, purifying thoughts into divine awareness and recognizing the Guru as ultimate reality.  Tiruppavadai Seva – A grand food offering honoring cosmic abundance, aligning human life with the earth's cycles of nourishment.  Mahalakshmi Laksharchana – Thousands of offerings invoking Devi Mahalakshmi, channeling individual devotion into collective prosperity and wellbeing.  Sri Sukta Kamala Homa – A fire ritual that transforms desires into dharmic action, aligning emotions with divine order.  Durga Puja – Worship of Devi Durga, awakening fierce devotion and spiritual warrior consciousness to overcome collective negativity.  Ayudha Puja – Reverence to tools and instruments of life, cultivating gratitude and recognizing divinity in all creation.  Vishesha Naivedya Seva – Sacred food offerings, recognizing all matter as divine nourishment and spirit.  Vijayamala Seva & Pushpayagam – The culmination, offering garlands and flowers symbolizing total victory—cognitive, emotional, social, moral, spiritual, and environmental—manifesting complete oneness with Paramashiva.  The 16 sacred sevas systematically activate every dimension of Paramādvaita (non-dual oneness), culminating in the grand Chandi Homa, a cosmic fire ritual that dissolves karmic patterns and establishes devotees in ultimate divine consciousness.  The United Ancient Nations Summit As part of Navaratri, the United Ancient Nations Summit was held at multiple places around the world, bringing together leaders, representatives, and spiritual communities in a collective mission for cosmic awakening and revival of dharmic values. This historic gathering of KAILASA's Paramashiva Sena reaffirmed the nation's commitment to global peace, spiritual empowerment, and universal consciousness rooted in Sanatana Hindu Dharma.  Aushadha Annadhan In continuation of KAILASA's global humanitarian vision, Aushadha Annadhan was offered throughout the festival. Millions were served freshly prepared, organically sourced, and spiritually enriched meals based on the Bhaga Shastra, turning food into natural medicine for body, mind, and spirit.
