# LEE'S FAMOUS RECIPE® CHICKEN CELEBRATES GROWTH AT ANNUAL CONFERENCE

SHALIMAR, FL, October 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Lee's Famous Recipe® Chicken, a name synonymous with delicious, home-style fried chicken for nearly 60 years, gathered its "Famous Family" for the annual Lee's Family Reunion at the Ameristar Casino Resort Spa in St. Charles, MO. More than 280 franchise owners, corporate leaders and business partners gathered to celebrate record-breaking growth, chart bold plans for the future, and recognize the individuals driving the brand's momentum.   CEO Ryan Weaver opened the reunion by spotlighting a system that continues to surge. With 2024 system sales climbing to $235 million and 2025 tracking ahead of that milestone, the brand now boasts an average unit volume of $1.85 million and pushes toward a $2 million goal. Lee's also announced development goals to more than double the current unit count by 2030, while investing in rebranding initiatives that modernize existing restaurants. Conference attendees saw this success firsthand when visiting the recently remodeled St. Charles location, just minutes from the event site, which has seen an 8% sales lift and 7% traffic growth.   But numbers told only part of the story. The reunion centered on connection, inspiration, and shared purpose. Guest speakers Danny Klein, VP Editorial Director of QSR Magazine, and Scott Greenberg, author, keynote speaker and management trainer, challenged attendees to think bigger, delivering powerful insights on leadership, industry trends, and how to thrive in a competitive business landscape. Their perspectives left franchisees energized to carry the momentum home to their own communities.   One of the reunion's most unforgettable moments was the gathering of Jack Omer and Katie Bennett, grandchildren of Lee's founders. Their presence brought nearly 60 years of Lee's history to life, a powerful testament to the family spirit, tradition, and vision that continue to shape the brand's future.   The event culminated in the Awards Dinner, where Lee's recognized outstanding operators who embody the brand's values of service, quality, and growth:   Legacy Award: Emmett and Jenny Gamache Former operators Emmett and Jenny Gamache from St. Louis, MO received the Legacy Award for their decades of commitment to the Lee's brand and their local community. Their leadership and unwavering dedication to quality have built a lasting example for future generations of franchisees.   Operator of the Year: NLM Enterprises LLC Operator of the Year is awarded to a Lee's franchised or licensed unit that demonstrates exceptional sales performance and operational excellence, while significantly contributing to the overall growth and improvement of the Lee's brand. NLM's success in the Detroit, MI market illustrates how operational excellence translates directly to community impact and brand strength.   Pacesetter Award: Henry Loving, HTL Inc. The Pacesetter Award is bestowed upon the unit with the highest sales across the entire system. Henry Loving is no stranger to the award, having received it multiple times. In 2024, Loving's store in Richmond, VA topped more than $6 million in annual sales.   "Our Family Reunion shows why Lee's keeps growing year after year," said Ryan Weaver, CEO of Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken. "We celebrated record-breaking sales, honored operators who set the standard in our system, and gained powerful insights from industry leaders who reminded us to keep thinking bigger. On top of that, having the family members of our founders with us brought our story full circle. That combination of heritage and momentum sets Lee's apart and positions us to achieve our boldest goals yet."
