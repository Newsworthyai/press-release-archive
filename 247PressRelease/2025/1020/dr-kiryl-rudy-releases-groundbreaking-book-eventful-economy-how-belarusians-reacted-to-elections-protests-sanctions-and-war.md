This work combines rigorous academic research with Dr. Rudy's first-hand experience to provide an unparalleled examination of Belarus' political and economic landscape.  EVENTFUL ECONOMY traces the country's trajectory from the explosive 2020 elections through street protests, escalating sanctions, and the ongoing impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Through five years of meticulous data collection and personal testimony, Dr. Rudy explores how political events reshape economic behavior, highlighting the anxiety, adaptation, and pragmatism of Belarusian citizens.  The book investigates critical questions through the lens of Dr. Rudy's extensive career in government, diplomacy, and academia: the relationship between economic growth and dominant political systems, the effectiveness of sanctions, and the impact of war on currency exchange and fiscal policy.
