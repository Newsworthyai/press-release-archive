Those who want official data on Rancho Cucamonga can visit https://www.cityofrc.us/.  Here is background information on this release. Nestled against the edge of the San Gabriel Mountains, Rancho Cucamonga is where the bucolic Inland Empire connects to the greater Los Angeles basin. It is also where thousands of business travelers touch down each month — quietly — in search of something better than a hotel. A space to sleep, work, eat, do it all over again. The secret concept here is "serviced apartments." These furnished units are hard to find, but when found, they mean a "home away from home" for the busy business traveler. Indeed, they can bring the spouse or family along to combine business and pleasure and take advantage of all the things that the "Inland Empire" has to offer.   "This property surfaced as an ideal candidate for our featured listing for November 2025," said Bob Lee, President of Key Housing. "Business travelers have Ontario Airport ten minutes away. Distribution centers, manufacturing corridors, regional offices — it's all happening near Rancho Cucamonga. Ironwood provides travelers with a real bed, a kitchen they can actually use, and a decent view from the patio. That's a win, and a way to bring the spouse or family along."  What Ironwood Actually Offers  The units are clean. Modern. Functional. Occupants get in-unit laundry, walk-in closets, and fully equipped kitchens that don't feel like an afterthought. The beds are comfortable and contemporary. Floor plans are available in one, two, or three bedrooms, providing ample space for a team or family. Some guests bring a partner. Some bring their dog. Some come alone but want to live "like a local" while working in and around Rancho Cucamonga.  ABOUT KEY HOUSING:  Since 1992, Key Housing has been a leader in affordable, friendly, short-term and corporate housing rentals in cities throughout California. The company competes with extended-stay hotels, and many nurses, interns, and individuals seeking pet-friendly corporate rentals or corporate relocation services use the service to find temporary housing.
