# "DISPOSSESSED: A Very L.A. Ghost Story" Spooky Comedy Novel in Time for Most of the Holidays by Guillermo X. Márquez

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- From the author of the incisive true-crime/horror sensation EVIL'S EDEN: Only Murders in Los Angeles comes the much anticipated supernatural comedy novel, DISPOSSESSED: A Very L.A. Ghost Story. In his electrifying and hilarious new book, author Guillermo X. Márquez deep-dives into life, love, and loathing in Los Angeles, a place of unbounded promise rooted in unfiltered evil.  DISPOSSESSED centers on a young Hispanic Angeleno, Alex Olvera, and his tempestuous love for lily-white Tempest Wirth, as they death-spiral into homeownership under the spell of a decrepit Victorian with a grisly past.   In the run-up to the holidays, Alex and Tempest are secretly apartment-hunting, defying parental edicts. But an overpriced, tumbledown rent-to-own Victorian mansion beguiles Tempest the moment she touches its antique Victrola. Soon, Alex is bedeviled by endless repairs, money woes… and is their janky love nest haunted? As their finances unravel, they fight to keep the house. Then, Tempest falls under the thrall of a malevolent, if impossibly hunky, force. Alex uncovers the grisly secrets of the home's first owners, a vaunted L.A. founding family. Now, the house wants Alex out, so it can have Tempest to itself. Alex and his geeky friends must rescue Tempest from the ghostly fiend, even if she doesn't love him anymore — but how?  Underpinned by the Victorian era treacheries of a fictional robber baron, DISPOSSESSED weaves the torrid tale of a modern-day triangle among a boy, a girl, and a thing long dead. Says Márquez, "It's about depravity, debauchery, life's firsts, infidelity, inequality, broken hearts, oppression, possession, corporate takeovers, land theft, privilege, paucity, murder most foul, family feuds, friendship, the high cost of living, and kicking demon ass. So yes — it's a comedy."  Praise for DISPOSSESSED:  An irreverent coming-of-age comedy with the chills of slow-burn horror. Get ready for pumpkins, turkeys, Santas, and fiery-eyed demons!
