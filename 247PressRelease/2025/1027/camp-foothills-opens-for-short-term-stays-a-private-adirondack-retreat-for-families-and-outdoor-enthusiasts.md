# Camp Foothills Opens for Short-Term Stays: A Private Adirondack Retreat for Families and Outdoor Enthusiasts

UTICA, NY, October 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The southern Adirondacks have a new hidden gem for travelers seeking a peaceful, private getaway. Camp Foothills, a newly available Adirondack family cabin, is now open for short-term vacation rentals on Airbnb, VRBO, and directly through its official website at www.campfoothills.com.  Nestled on 18 private acres in Forestport, New York, just minutes from Old Forge, Camp Foothills offers guests an authentic Adirondack experience with modern comfort and year-round adventure. The property features a large private pond, two kayaks, outdoor seating, a fire pit, and direct access to nearby snowmobile and hiking trails, making it the perfect base for families, couples, and small groups looking to explore the natural beauty of the region.  An Authentic Adirondack Experience  Camp Foothills was designed to deliver what travelers love most about an Adirondack vacation rental: privacy, relaxation, and the freedom to explore. The property's expansive grounds invite guests to unwind by the pond, paddle the calm waters, or hike through the surrounding forest without ever leaving the property.  "We wanted to create a place where people could disconnect from the noise and reconnect with nature and family," said the owners of Camp Foothills, Mike and Bridget. "Whether it's roasting marshmallows around the fire pit, taking a morning kayak ride, or snowmobiling through fresh powder, guests can enjoy the Adirondacks on their own terms."  With easy access to local lakes, scenic trails, and charming nearby towns like Old Forge, White Lake, and Remsen, Camp Foothills offers the perfect balance of seclusion and convenience.  Perfect for Every Season  Unlike many cabins that close in the off-season, Camp Foothills is open year-round, offering a four-season retreat. In summer, guests can kayak, fish, or hike. Fall brings stunning foliage and crisp air ideal for cozy fireside nights. Winter opens the door to snowmobiling, skiing, and snowshoeing right from the property. Spring guests enjoy peaceful mornings by the pond and the area's abundant wildlife returning to bloom.  This adaptability makes Camp Foothills one of the most versatile vacation rentals near Old Forge, drawing families, outdoor enthusiasts, and remote workers alike.  Modern Comfort Meets Rustic Charm  Inside, Camp Foothills blends Adirondack charm with modern comfort. The home includes multiple bedrooms, a private suite with a full bathroom, and modern amenities such as a mini-split heat and AC system, Starlink Wi-Fi, and a fully equipped kitchen. The layout comfortably accommodates families and small groups, making it ideal for family vacations, romantic getaways, or small retreats.  Guests often remark that the property feels "secluded yet close to everything," offering peace and privacy while being within easy reach of Old Forge's shops, restaurants, and attractions.  Book Direct and Save  While Camp Foothills is listed on Airbnb and VRBO, guests are encouraged to book directly through the official website, www.campfoothills.com for the most cost-effective rates. Direct bookings eliminate third-party service fees, allowing guests to save money while securing the same amenities and professional service.  The website features detailed property photos, availability calendars, and easy online booking, making it simple to plan your next Adirondack getaway.
