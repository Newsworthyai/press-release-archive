# Slowing Down Skin Aging — A Scientific Look at Five Key Anti-Aging Ingredients

NEW YORK, NY, June 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Slow aging is more than a beauty trend; it's a dermatological research field experiencing rapid growth. with a strong safety profile and rapid visible results, often seen within a week of application. According to a study in the Asian Journal of Beauty and Cosmetology, measurements of periocular wrinkles using ANTERA 3D imaging showed a significant increase in wrinkle depth with age: wrinkle medium values were 14.56 in women in their 30s, 17.38 in their 40s, and 18.07 in their 50s. This data highlights the need for active solutions that address age-related structural skin decline, especially post-menopause. At the forefront of this scientific movement are three ingredients: Matrixyl, Argireline, and Volufiline.  • Matrixyl (Matrixyl 3000) Matrixyl is a patented peptide complex developed by France's Sederma, composed of palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7. It is known to support skin structure and strengthen the dermal matrix.  Clinical studies have reported that creams containing 3% Matrixyl led to:  • A 20.3% increase in Collagen VII production • A 56% decrease in SA β-GAL, a biomarker of cellular senescence • Visible reductions in wrinkle depth and length after 12 weeks of use  A 2014 study confirmed that the active peptides in Matrixyl penetrate the stratum corneum to promote collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis. Notably, Matrixyl delivered comparable dermal regeneration results to retinoic acid (tretinoin)—but with significantly less irritation, making it ideal for sensitive skin.  • Argireline Argireline is a six-amino-acid peptide designed to reduce facial muscle contractions, one of the primary causes of expression lines. In clinical trials, 2% Argireline applied for 5 to 7 days resulted in an average 11% reduction in wrinkle surface area around the forehead and eye regions.  Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, thereby reducing muscle tension. As a non-invasive, topical alternative to Botox, it provides fast-acting wrinkle-relaxing effects with a strong safety profile and rapid visible results, often seen within a week of application. It is particularly useful in preventing deepening of expression wrinkles caused by habitual facial movements.  • Volufiline Volufiline is a plant-derived active that enhances the volume and proliferation of adipose (fat) cells within the skin, offering a solution to facial volume loss associated with aging.  Human trials showed that after 6 days of topical application:  • Skin volume increased by up to 641% • Fat cell volume expanded by 26 times in treated areas  These effects were especially prominent in regions prone to volume loss such as under the eyes, nasolabial folds, and cheeks, making Volufiline an effective approach to addressing structural changes linked to menopause and aging.  • Retinol Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is widely recognized for its ability to stimulate collagen production and promote epidermal renewal. It has been shown to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, and hyperpigmentation.  In clinical studies, 12 weeks of topical retinol application resulted in significant improvements in skin texture and fine wrinkles.  Compared to stronger retinoids such as tretinoin, retinol causes less irritation but may still lead to side effects such as dryness or erythema. For this reason, gradual introduction into a skincare routine is recommended to enhance tolerability.  • PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide) PDRN is a DNA-derived compound extracted from salmon, known for its regenerative and anti-aging properties.  Research has demonstrated its ability to suppress cellular senescence, promote collagen synthesis, improve skin elasticity and wrinkle depth, and accelerate wound healing.  Both clinical and preclinical studies have repeatedly confirmed PDRN's efficacy in enhancing skin thickness and reducing visible signs of aging, making it a promising ingredient in advanced skincare formulations.  • Three Peptides, One Anti-Aging Solution Matrixyl, Argireline, and Volufiline each target different mechanisms of skin aging—dermal regeneration, wrinkle reduction, and volume restoration, respectively. Together, these three peptides offer a multidimensional approach to addressing the complex causes of aging skin.  Clinical research has consistently shown that this combination delivers synergistic effects, including reduced wrinkle depth, increased elasticity, and improved facial volume.  Matrixyl, in particular, has demonstrated collagen-boosting effects comparable to retinol, yet with significantly less irritation, making it suitable for sensitive skin. Argireline is especially effective for expression line reduction, while Volufiline addresses volume loss, making the trio highly effective for treating multiple signs of aging simultaneously.  Meanwhile, retinol and PDRN remain gold-standard ingredients in anti-aging skincare, recognized for their proven roles in collagen synthesis and skin regeneration.   For those aiming to slow the progression of skin aging, this scientifically supported trio offers a powerful and effective strategy. Consequently, this peptide combination is rapidly gaining traction among dermocosmetic laboratories seeking to achieve superior results without compromise.  **References include the International Journal of Cosmetic Science (2005) article "Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3: A Novel Approach to Anti-Aging," clinical studies conducted by Sederma, a 2014 comparative study on Matrixyl versus retinoic acid, research published in the Asian Journal of Beauty and Cosmetology, and various other peer-reviewed dermatological journals.
