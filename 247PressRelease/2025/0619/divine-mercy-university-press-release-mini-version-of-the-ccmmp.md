# Divine Mercy University Press Release Mini-Version of the CCMMP

STERLING, VA, June 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Divine Mercy University Press (DMU Press) is excited to announce the publication of the Mini-Version of the original 700-page volume of A Catholic Christian Meta-Model of the Person: Integration with Psychology and Mental Health Practice. "The Mini-Version of the Meta-Model is intended for those who want a short, readable summary of the Meta-Model. This new book presents the basic ideas, presented in a less abstract form and without all the detailed analyses," said author Paul C. Vitz, Ph.D.  Both volumes integrate the insights of three wisdom traditions—the psychological sciences, philosophy, and theology—to provide a framework for understanding the person for application in mental health practice. The book received the 2020 Expanded Reason Award given by the Vatican Foundation Joseph Ratzinger / Benedict XVI and Universidad Francisco de Vitoria Madrid.  In consultation with the colleagues who collaborated on the original Meta-Model, Paul C. Vitz, Ph.D., has drawn out from the massive book the essential points and principles. In the condensed hundred-page mini-version, the book manages to summarize the most important issues necessary for a true and full understanding of the nature of the person from psychological, philosophical, and theological perspectives.   A Catholic Christian Meta-Model of the Person is designed to educate and train professors, practitioners, and students in the mental health field to apply the "Meta-Model" framework in their clinical work and psychological research. It also represents a significant contribution to theological and philosophical understandings of the person.  "A special dedication to the Faculty, Students, Staff, Benefactors and Friends of Divine Mercy University who brought about its remarkable growth and flourishing, and a special acknowledgement to those who were notably helpful in the development of this Mini Meta-Model, Fr. Lino Otero, Craig S. Titus, S.T.D., Ph.D., and Pat Fagan," said Paul C. Vitz, Ph.D., "Thanks also to the authors of the original 26 chapters of the Catholic Christian Meta-Model of the Person: Integration of Psychology and Mental Health Practice. (2020)."  The mini-version can be purchased via Amazon in paperback and for Kindle at this link.
