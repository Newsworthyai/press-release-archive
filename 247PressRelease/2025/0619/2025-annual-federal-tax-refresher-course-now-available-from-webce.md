# 2025 Annual Federal Tax Refresher Course Now Available from WebCE

DALLAS, TX, June 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 2025 Annual Federal Tax Refresher (AFTR) course is now available from WebCE, a leading provider of online continuing education and training. This online course helps non-credentialed tax professionals meet the core requirement of the Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP), a voluntary IRS initiative that recognizes preparers committed to the highest standards of professionalism.   WebCE's 2025 AFTR course covers recent changes to federal tax law, including revised standard mileage rates, adjustments to standard deductions, and other inflation-related modifications that may impact taxpayers' income tax liability. It also includes a comprehensive review of 2025 income tax topics and examines the rules governing preparer ethics, practices, and procedures.   Delivered entirely online, the course is accessible 24/7 on any device, allowing tax professionals to study at their own pace and on their own schedule. Course content is anchored in real-world scenarios and reinforced with built-in assessments designed to foster lasting comprehension.   The AFTR course is just one mandatory requirement for participating in the AFSP. The AFSP requires participants to complete a total of 18 hours of continuing education (CE) annually: the Annual Federal Tax Refresher Course (6 CE hours), 2 CE hours on ethics, and 10 CE hours covering other federal tax topics.   Those who complete the program earn an Annual Filing Season Program Record of Completion from the IRS. Program participants are also included in the IRS's public Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications. This directory includes only attorneys, certified public accountants (CPAs), enrolled agents (EAs), enrolled retirement plan agents (ERPAs), enrolled actuaries, and preparers with an AFSP Record of Completion. Earning this credential and appearing in the IRS database are two powerful tools to build credibility and attract new clients. While participation is voluntary, the program offers a structured path for preparers who want to grow their expertise and demonstrate a commitment to professionalism.   With updated tax law content, flexible delivery, and built-in assessments, WebCE's 2025 AFTR course offers a complete solution for tax professionals looking to enhance their skills, gain recognition, and prepare for the new filing season with confidence.
