# Fire Up Antibody Breakthroughs as Researchers Flock to Creative Biolabs' Cell Line Arsenal

SHIRLEY, NY, June 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- During the event entitled "Generation of a dual-function multi-engager antibody for simultaneous targeting NK cells and tumor cells", the targeted ADAM17 Blocker and Killer (TABK) antibody—brainchild of Dr. Bruce Walcheck—slams both NK cell checkpoints and tumor targets simultaneously. Scientists have binged the session since launch. Later, Creative Biolabs uploaded the webinar recording for those who did not attend the live session.  Real muscle lies under the hood. "You can't cook up a blockbuster antibody without a rock-solid cell line—it's the unsung hero in the lab," noted a Creative Biolabs rep.  Cell Line: The Silent Engine of the Biotech Boom  Creative Biolabs' service package covers various stages of biologics development, spanning multiple cell types, including the gold standard for therapeutic protein production, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.  • Host Cell Commercial Licensing As a pivotal part of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical landscape, the commercial licensing of host cells enables customized and efficient production of monoclonal antibodies and other biologic modalities through the CDMO process. Creative Biolabs ensures comprehensive deliverables in addition to the proprietary CHO cell lines to cover ECACC license agreements, vector synthesis reports, cGMP cell banking documentation, technical cell culture protocol, and thorough technical support.  • Mammalian Cell Line Development To provide mammalian cell lines for high yield, stability, cost-effectiveness, and, more importantly, human-specific post-translational modifications, Creative Biolabs established a robust platform that manages the transfection, cell selection, clonal screening and selection, cell line characterization, and expansion & downstream process in a streamlined manner.  • Cell Line Passage Stability Evaluation "Cell lines, prone to mutate genetically or alter in cell morphology under environmental stresses, should go through stability evaluation before actually applying to a research project." The rep says, "We provide stability evaluation service to ensure the cell line integrity, covering genetic stability, functional stability, viral contamination screening, and phenotypic stability assessment."  • Cell Bank Storage Stability Evaluation Further from passage stability, the storage stability of cell banks is in climbing demand these days. Creative Biolabs supports their pharmaceutical partners in maintaining cell line quality and safety, with a full set of tests on sterility, viability, functionality, genetic stability, and mycoplasma and monitoring over temperature, backup systems, and secure facilities.
