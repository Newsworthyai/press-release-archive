# Ana Miranda Discusses Phonedemic in Exclusive Interview: Insights on the Book's Impact, Personal Journey, and Future Projects

VANCOUVER, BC, June 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an exclusive interview, Ana Miranda, author of Phonedemic: The Unrelenting Loss of Humanity's Ability to Truly Connect, discusses the inspiration behind the book, the profound impact it's having on readers, and her vision for the future. The conversation provides a deeper look at the themes of device addiction, human connection, and what she hopes to accomplish with her writing. Ana also shares exciting news about future projects and potential follow-ups to Phonedemic.  The interview was conducted by Essi B. whose insightful approach and expertise in exploring cultural movements made him the perfect fit for this candid conversation with Miranda.  Q: Ana, what inspired you to write Phonedemic?  Ana Miranda: It was a combination of personal experience and a growing concern about the direction our society was heading in terms of technology and human connection. I've been through my own struggles with addiction, and I've witnessed firsthand how devices have taken over our lives in ways we never imagined. After the global pandemic, it became further evident how isolated we were becoming despite being constantly "connected." I felt like I needed to speak out—to inspire people that technology can never replace real, face-to-face human interactions. Phonedemic became a way for me to process these thoughts and inspire others to look within themselves, while sparking much-needed conversations.  Q: How do you hope Phonedemic will impact your readers?  Ana Miranda: I hope it will open people's eyes to the dangers of excessive screen time and the toll it's taking on our mental and emotional health. But more than just pointing out the problem, I want to offer a solution—an invitation to reconnect with one another in meaningful, authentic ways. The book isn't just about condemning technology; it's about rethinking how we use it and finding a balance that allows us to live fully in the real world, not just the digital one. If readers take away a renewed sense of purpose in their relationships and feel inspired to make small changes in their daily lives, I'll feel like I've accomplished my mission.  Q: You've been getting a lot of positive feedback from readers already. How does that feel?  Ana Miranda: It is honestly incredibly humbling. It's one thing to write a book, but to see it resonate with people in profound ways is beyond anything I could have imagined. Many readers have shared their stories about how Phonedemic has made them reflect on their own screen habits and how they're making intentional choices to put down their phones and engage more deeply with the people around them. This is the kind of impact I hoped for, and it makes all the hard work worth it.  Q: Do you want Phonedemic to be part of a larger mission. Can you tell us more about that?  Ana Miranda: Absolutely. I want to be a part of a movement that encourages authentic, face-to-face human interaction—particularly in today's world, where so many of us are constantly scrolling through life. I'm also looking to build partnerships with wellness organizations, schools, and community groups that want to host events or workshops based on the themes in Phonedemic. The book is just the beginning of a larger cultural shift I believe we need. I'm working on some exciting collaborations that will bring the message of this book to even more people.  Q: Speaking of the future, do you have any plans for a follow-up book?  Ana Miranda: I defintely have some ideas in mind, which were already coming to me as I was completing this publication. While I'm focused on spreading the word about Phonedemic for now, I am already thinking about the next book. Although I will not reveal the topic, it addresses another route in offering practical advice for living with more intention, presence, and joy.  Q: What's the ultimate message you want readers to take away from Phonedemic?  Ana Miranda: The ultimate message is that we are all worthy of real, meaningful connections. We're living in an age where it's easy to feel disconnected, even though we have been fed the fallacy that we're more "connected" than ever. Phonedemic is a reminder that we can choose to prioritize the people around us and our own well-being over the constant barrage of notifications and digital distractions. If we can learn to put down the devices and show up for each other in real life, this is where the magic happens.  Q: Thank you for sharing this Ana. Is there anything else you'd like to add?  Ana Miranda: Thank you so much for having me. I would like to say how grateful I am to everyone who has picked up the book, shared how it has positively impacted them and how they have become part of this movement. It's not just about Phonedemic—it's about all of us coming together to reclaim our time, our relationships, and what it is to be human.  I encourage anyone who is struggling with device addiction or feels disconnected from the world to take the first step toward change. You are not alone, and it's never too late to start making a difference.  For Media Inquiries, Interviews, please visit www.phonedemic.com. Phonedemic is available on Amazon.ca and Amazon.com.
