FORT WORTH, TX, July 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Licensed cosmetologist Emily Gallegos proudly announces the opening of The Wax Edit, located in the Salon and Spa Galleria Weisenberger in Fort Worth, Texas.   With five years of experience in the industry, it's clear that Gallegos has what it takes to keep her customers satisfied. Her specialty is Brazilian waxing, and Gallegos said she knows the importance of providing a relaxed, professional setting.  "I've created a private studio space where you can feel comfortable, confident, and cared for," Gallegos said. "Whether it's your first Brazilian or part of your monthly routine, I'm here to make the experience smooth, personalized, and stress-free."  In addition to Brazilian waxing for both men and women, Emily Gallegos offers other types of waxing, including eyebrow; lower lip, nose; bikini line; full bikini; underarm; full legs; upper or lower legs; inner thigh; butt; stomach strip; full stomach; full chest; full face; ears; upper lip; chin; sideburns; full arms; upper or lower back; full back. She also provides extractions, which are an added step to help remove ingrown hairs and clogged pores following a Brazilian waxing.  Gallegos said her focus is not just on achieving great results, but also to provide comfort, education, and a no-judgment approach. She takes the time to teach each client about aftercare and skin health, and always uses high-quality wax and techniques to minimize discomfort.  "I create an environment where everyone feels safe and celebrated, no matter their body type, hair type, or waxing experience level," she said. "I am known for making the experience less intimidating and more empowering. Clients love how quick, thorough, and detail-oriented I am, while still keeping the energy fun," she added.  And speaking of fun, Gallegos shared the story of how she came up with the business name "The Wax Edit."  "People always ask me about the name, and I love that it sparks curiosity," Gallegos said. "I chose the name because I wanted it to feel modern, clean, and elevated like a refined version of something you already know. Just like a photo edit brings out the best parts of an image, The Wax Edit is about enhancing confidence and helping people feel their best in their own skin. It's more than a wax; it's your glow-up edit," she added.   Gallegos also sells a curated collection of post-wax care essentials at The Wax Edit, including products from Bushbalm.
