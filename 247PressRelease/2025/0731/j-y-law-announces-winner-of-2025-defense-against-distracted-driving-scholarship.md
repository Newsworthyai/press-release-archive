# J&amp;Y Law Announces Winner of 2025 Defense Against Distracted Driving Scholarship

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- J&Y Law and its team of Los Angeles personal injury lawyers created the Defense Against Distracted Driving Scholarship in hopes of encouraging incoming and current college students to think critically about the dangers of inattention behind the wheel.   This year, the team applauds Abby Samuelson for her work creating a moving essay describing how she, as a victim of a distracted driving accident, might discourage her peers from putting their fellow drivers at risk.   Samuelson is a student at the University of Southern California. In her essay, she describes the terror of getting into an accident with a couple who were too busy arguing to pay attention to the road in front of them. "That realization hit me hard," she says. "What could have been an innocent disagreement led to a catastrophic event."  Samuelson walked away from her accident but came to realize that there were dozens of types of distractions that might make drivers more vulnerable to serious accidents. When discussing how she might move to prevent distracted driving accidents in the future, she noted that she'd highlight the cognitive, physical, and verbal distractions that might take someone's attention away from the road.  She also recommends taking a multi-prong approach to increase awareness about the dangers of distracted driving. She wants to challenge younger drivers' feelings of invincibility by providing them with a firsthand example of the risks of inattentive driving, specifically a firsthand account of her own near-miss.  Samuelson also wants to take advantage of social media's wide reach. Gamifying safe driving through a "No Distraction Challenge" on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok may make it easier for drivers to keep their attention on the road, even if there are tempting distractions in their cars with them.  J&Y Law's personal injury lawyers commend Samuelson for her insights into the dangers of distracted driving and her recommendations for improving anti-distraction outreach. Samuelson's university will receive $1,000 from the firm to dedicate toward her continued education.  Students interested in applying for next year's Defense Against Distracted Driving Scholarship can follow in Samuelson's footsteps.
