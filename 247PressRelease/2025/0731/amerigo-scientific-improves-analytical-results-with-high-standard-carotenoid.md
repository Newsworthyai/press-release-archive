# Amerigo Scientific Improves Analytical Results with High-Standard Carotenoid

NEW YORK, NY, July 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Amerigo Scientific, a life science supplier focused on providing critical products and services to biomedical and pharmaceutical communities, is advancing analytical precision with its premium carotenoid standards. These meticulously developed reference materials ensure reliable and reproducible results for researchers and laboratories in phytochemistry, metabolomics, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.  Carotenoids, naturally occurring pigments found in plants and microorganisms, play a critical role in human health and nutrition. Common carotenoid standards cover β-Carotene (Provitamin A, antioxidant), Lutein (Eye health, macular pigment), Zeaxanthin (Macular pigment, antioxidant), α-Carotene (Provitamin A, carrots),β-Cryptoxanthin (Provitamin A, citrus fruits), and Fucoxanthin (Brown seaweed, weight management). Accurate quantification of these compounds is essential for research, quality control, and regulatory compliance. Amerigo Scientific's carotenoid standards meet rigorous purity and stability requirements, offering analysts confidence in their data.  Why choose Amerigo Scientific's carotenoid standards? • High Purity (_95%): Minimizes interference for precise measurements. • Comprehensive Selection: Includes β-carotene, lutein, lycopene, astaxanthin, and other key carotenoids. • Strict Quality Control: Manufactured and verified under ISO-certified processes. • Stability Assurance: Packaged to preserve integrity under recommended storage conditions.
