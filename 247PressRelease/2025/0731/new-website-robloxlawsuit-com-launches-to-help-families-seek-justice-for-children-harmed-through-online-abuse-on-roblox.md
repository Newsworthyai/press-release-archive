# New Website RobloxLawsuit.com Launches to Help Families Seek Justice for Children Harmed Through Online Abuse on Roblox

CLEARWATER, FL, July 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new legal resource, RobloxLawsuit.com, has officially launched to support families whose children have been harmed by online predators operating through the popular gaming platform Roblox. The website provides confidential case evaluations, critical legal information, and access to experienced attorneys committed to holding Roblox Corporation accountable for its alleged failure to protect young users.  While Roblox markets itself as a fun, interactive platform for children and teens, its chat features and user-generated content have unfortunately created an environment where predators can thrive. These individuals often pose as children, use grooming tactics to gain trust, and then move conversations off-platform to continue abusive behavior in secret. Many victims suffer devastating psychological and emotional harm as a result.  "At RobloxLawsuit.com, we believe no child should suffer because a corporation failed to safeguard its platform," said Matthew Dolman, a leading Roblox lawsuit attorney. "We fight to expose negligence, secure compensation, and push for lasting safety changes in the online gaming industry."  The newly launched site empowers families to:  Understand their legal rights following online abuse or exploitation on Roblox  Pursue maximum financial compensation for medical treatment, emotional trauma, therapy, and more  Hold Roblox and related companies accountable for enabling unsafe online environments  RobloxLawsuit.com is led by a legal team that focuses exclusively on cases involving online abuse and child exploitation related to Roblox. They work on a contingency-fee basis, meaning families pay nothing unless compensation is successfully recovered. In addition to legal representation, the firm provides compassionate support and a commitment to long-term change.  "Roblox Corporation must do more to protect its youngest users," Dolman added. "This isn't just about one predator; it's about the system that allows them to operate. We're here to challenge that system and demand justice for every family affected."
