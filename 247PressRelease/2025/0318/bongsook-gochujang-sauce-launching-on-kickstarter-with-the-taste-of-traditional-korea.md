# BongSook Gochujang Sauce, Launching on Kickstarter with the Taste of Traditional Korea

ALBANY, NY, March 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- BongSook, a South Korean food company specializing in manufacturing traditional fermented gochujang (Korean chili paste), is set to launch its new Gochujang Sauce on the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, blending traditional Korean methods with modern fermentation techniques.  The BongSook Gochujang Sauce is a newly developed product made with traditional Korean gochujang optimized for various dishes. In response to changing global food trends, the sauce reduces the heavy conventional gochujang taste while maximizing the harmony of sweetness, spiciness, and saltiness, enhancing its umami flavor. This makes it an accessible and enjoyable option for consumers worldwide.  While traditional gochujang is often used for stir-fries, stews, or as a dip for vegetables, BongSook Gochujang Sauce is designed with optimal thickness and viscosity, making it perfect for a wide variety of dishes. It can be used with hamburgers, pizzas, tacos, salads, steaks, poke bowls, snacks, and more.  BongSook Gochujang Sauce comes in two flavors: Spicy and Honey. The Spicy version is perfect for stir-fries, steaks, hamburgers, poke bowls, and more, offering a bold spicy umami flavor. The Honey version is ideal for nuggets, popcorn, nachos, and fries, offering a sweet and mildly spicy flavor that is suitable for children.  Unlike traditional hot sauces or Tabasco bottles, which often create a mess and are difficult to manage hygienically, BongSook Gochujang Sauce features a custom-designed sealed opening to ensure the sauce remains clean and fresh after use.  The BongSook Gochujang Sauce prioritizes food hygiene and safety. It is produced in strict accordance with high manufacturing standards and has obtained HACCP certification for hygiene during the production process. Additionally, it has earned the FSSC 22000 certification, ensuring the safety of the food throughout the manufacturing, packaging, storage, and transportation stages.  The BongSook Gochujang Sauce will be available for backing on Kickstarter starting March 18, 2025.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351005727/bongsooks-gochujang-sauce-made-in-traditional-korean-way?ref=242xo0
