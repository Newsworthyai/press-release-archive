# Next Generation Trust Company Shares Information on Investing in Hedge Funds Through a Self-directed IRA

ROSELAND, NJ, March 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Investing in hedge funds through a self-directed IRA (SDIRA) is an increasingly popular strategy for those looking to diversify their retirement portfolios with alternative assets. These funds offer opportunities for potentially high returns and risk management strategies that differ from traditional investments like stocks and bonds.   In a recent blog article, Jaime Raskulinecz, founder and CEO of Next Generation Trust Company, explained what hedge funds are, the types of hedge funds available, and how self-directed investors can include them in their retirement portfolios. Her firm specializes in the full account administration and asset custody of self-directed retirement plans (IRAs, solo(k)s) as well as health savings accounts and education savings accounts.  "Investors in hedge funds may be accredited, institutional, or individuals, such as owners of self-directed IRAs," said Raskulinecz. "These funds are becoming more attractive to self-directed investors because the fund managers have flexibility in terms of the types of assets to include in a fund's portfolio, including the alternative assets allowed in self-directed IRAs. This aligns self-directed investors' retirement strategy with the fund managers' investment strategy."   Using a self-directed IRA to invest in hedge funds Like many other alternative assets allowed in a self-directed IRA, hedge funds offer opportunities for potentially high returns and risk management strategies that differ from traditional investments like stocks and bonds. In the article, Raskulinecz recommends investors identify a hedge fund that aligns with their investment goals and philosophy, risk tolerance, and liquidity preferences. Also, account owners should be sure to do their research and be comfortable with this type of asset, as some hedge funds have high minimum investment requirements or restrict investments from tax-advantaged accounts.   "As part of their due diligence, investors should evaluate the hedge fund's strategy, past performance, management team, and fee structure, and make sure they understand its lock-up periods and liquidity restrictions," added Raskulinecz, who also outlined the benefits of investing in hedge funds through a SDIRAâ€”from the tax-advantaged growth from the fund's gains to possible investment strategies that hedge against market downturns and volatility.
