# Humane Society Silicon Valley's The Fur Ball Set for May 10

MILPITAS, CA, March 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) will honor longtime supporters and advocates Sue and John Diekman May 10 at The Fur Ball, the organization's signature annual gala. Guests — and their well-dressed canine companions — will gather for an evening of fine dining and entertainment under the stars, all in support of HSSV's mission to save lives, keep families together, and create a better future for pets and their people.  Few have shaped HSSV's future as profoundly as Sue and John. From their first $5,000 gift in 2004 to their $3 million commitment to expand and name HSSV's Diekman Regional Rescue Program, the Diekmans have been unwavering champions for animal welfare. Their generosity has helped HSSV transport and care for thousands of at-risk animals each year, ensuring they receive critical medical treatment and find loving homes, and they have pledged a portion of their estate to HSSV.  "Sue and John have not only fueled our mission — they have strengthened the foundation on which our future is built," says Peter Detkin, Chair of HSSV's Board of Directors. "Their leadership, generosity, and deep belief in HSSV's work will continue to impact lives for generations to come."  A Legacy of Leadership and Giving  Sue and John's contributions go far beyond financial support. Sue, a former Board Chair, has dedicated more than 15 years to HSSV's Board of Directors, helping shape the organization's long-term strategy. As the co-chair of HSSV's Board Alumni Ambassadors, she and co-chair Marilyn Anderson continue to engage and rally former board members, keeping them connected to the mission. "Being a part of HSSV over the past two decades has been deeply meaningful to us," says Sue. "We have had the privilege of helping many pets and people — a mission that is vital to our hearts and our community."  John, an Honorary Board Member, has also played a pivotal role in guiding HSSV's financial sustainability and long-term vision. He and Sue co-chaired HSSV's transformative "Paint a Better Future" campaign, which raised nearly $60 million by the end of 2017— a milestone that helped establish HSSV as the world's first Model Shelter and expand its lifesaving programs.  "Sue and John are more than supporters — they are stewards of HSSV's future," says Kurt Krukenberg, HSSV President. "Their dedication and generosity not only strengthen our mission but also inspire others to invest in our lifesaving work, transforming the lives of thousands of animals and the people who love them."  "HSSV is a model for what's possible in animal welfare and leads the way for shelters nationwide," says John. "We invest in this organization because we see the results firsthand. The leadership, the vision, and the outcomes speak for themselves."  A Commitment to Community Beyond HSSV  Beyond their work with HSSV, Sue and John are deeply engaged in the broader nonprofit community. Sue, a veteran of the telecommunications industry, serves on the boards of Stanford's Cantor Arts Center and the San Francisco Ballet. John, a Founding Partner of 5AM Ventures, serves as chair of the Scripps Research Institute, chairs the Princeton University Art Museum Advisory Council and is a former Charter Trustee at Princeton University.  Their dedication to HSSV has not only transformed the lives of thousands of animals but has also inspired others to invest in the future of animal welfare.  Join the Celebration  The Fur Ball will take place from 5 to 10 p.m. on Saturday, May 10, at PayPal Park (1123 Coleman Avenue, San Jose). Tables and tickets are available for purchase.
