# DFW Car and Toy Museum Opens at New Location in Fort Worth on April 1, 2025

FORT WORTH, TX, March 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Texas' largest car museum, DFW Car and Toy Museum has more than 200 cars in its collection, generating a lot of enthusiasm for the new location.   The museum is different from many other car museums because it does not feature cars from the early 20th century, instead focusing on mostly European cars from the 1950's and forward. The collection also includes many Japanese cars and cars that the current generation of gearheads can relate to and appreciate.   Ron Sturgeon, the founder of the museum, who started collecting cars in the 1980's, says, "A museum should be fun, so we have a category for cars that should not exist, including a Ford Pinto, a Bricklin and even a Yugo."  The museum is dog friendly, and we love kids, which is why we also have a mystery van from Scooby Doo. For music lovers, we have the Grateful Dead's 1949 Studebaker, which they carried their band equipment in for years, and we look forward to having a concert later in the year for all the dead heads in Tarrant County. Interested parties should sign up at our website to get advance notice of future events including the concert, which will have limited space available. We also have cars from other famous celebrities, including Kid Rock's Rolls-Royce and one of Jerry Seinfeld's VW bugs.   The DFW Car and Toy Museum has one of the largest collections of toys in America dating to the late 19th century and includes many early German toys, including those made by Marklin, Tippco and American and Japanese toys. They also have early patent models, salesman samples, a Monopoly gallery with early Monopoly games and lots of Robots and model race cars.  Museum visitors are encouraged to take pictures.
