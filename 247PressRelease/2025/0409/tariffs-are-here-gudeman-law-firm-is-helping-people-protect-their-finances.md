# Tariffs Are Here & Gudeman Law Firm is Helping People Protect Their Finances

HOWELL, MI, April 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With the president's April 2, 2025 announcement of his executive order and his administration's declaration of an "economic emergency" that allows it to bypass Congress, he passed sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs that impose a 10% baseline tax on imports from almost every country in the world, with higher rates for dozens of countries whose exports exceed the value of its imports with the U.S. This triggered stocks in the U.S. and around the world to torpedo, amped up fears of a recession, and prompted aggressive retaliation from China (whose levy on goods is now 34%) and threats of retaliation from many other countries.   With the looming, continued increases in basic living costs and the uncertain (and scary) future of the U.S. economy, filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy now may be beneficial if you have a steady income but are struggling with a debt load you cannot keep up with payments on or if you fear that you soon won't be able to do this. Because of the president's new tariffs, many people in Southeast Michigan who were already suffering financially, are more stressed out than ever before. Many people who thought they were doing okay are now worried about being able to provide for themselves and their families because of rapid inflation, they have lost their jobs, or their job/industry is being threatened. Many people in these situations are unaware of the fact that when they are in over their head in debt and worried about foreclosure, vehicle repossession, and loss of assets, Chapter 13 and a few other forms of bankruptcy may protect them from these things.
