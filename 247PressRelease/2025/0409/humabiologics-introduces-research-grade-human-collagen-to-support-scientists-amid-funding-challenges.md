# Humabiologics Introduces Research-Grade Human Collagen to Support Scientists Amid Funding Challenges

PHOENIX, AZ, April 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Humabiologics, Inc., a leading innovator in human-derived biomaterials for regenerative medicine, announces the launch of research-grade human collagen, addressing the critical funding challenges facing life sciences researchers. As federal budget cuts to NIH and NSF grants threaten scientific progress, this new offering provides researchers with high-quality, clinically relevant biomaterials that won't strain limited research budgets. The product is being unveiled at the Society For Biomaterials (SFB) meeting in Chicago.  "Over the past months, I've had too many conversations with researchers struggling to keep their work going due to budget constraints," said Mohammad Albanna, PhD, Founder and CEO of Humabiologics. "To answer this, we've combined strategic tissue partnerships with manufacturing advancements to deliver native human collagen at an accessible price point without compromising quality."  The new addition to the company's HumaDerm family offers superior clinical relevance for regenerative medicine, drug testing, tissue models, and organ-on-a-chip applications. Ethically sourced through FDA-registered and AATB-accredited tissue banks, the human collagen comes from tissues not usable for transplant but deserving to be honored.  "The availability of human-derived biomaterials at a price point below animal alternatives represents a pivotal moment for regenerative medicine research," said Tim Bertram, CEO of the National Science Foundation Piedmont Triad Regenerative Medicine Engine (NSF PTRME). "This innovation from Humabiologics eliminates cost barriers that have historically forced researchers to compromise on physiological relevance. It's exactly the type of advancement that will accelerate translation of research into clinical solutions."  This launch builds on Humabiologics' recent grant from the Piedmont Triad Regenerative Medicine Engine to advance human collagen biomanufacturing. The company collaborates with the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM) and other members in PTRME's ecosystem to drive innovation in the field.   "Research shouldn't slow down because of funding challenges," added Dr. Albanna. "With human biomaterials now more affordable than animal alternatives, there's no longer any barrier for scientists to make the transition to more clinically relevant models that can better predict human outcomes."  Humabiologics is a pioneering biotechnology company dedicated to developing and producing high-quality, native human-derived biomaterials for regenerative therapies and tissue engineering applications. The company is committed to advancing the field by providing researchers with innovative and ethically sourced biomaterials that meet the highest standards. The company's products are used by researchers worldwide to drive advancements in tissue engineering, wound healing and drug discovery. Learn more at www.humabiologics.com.
