# Dee Dee Bridgewater, Branford Marsalis, Bilal, Kandace Springs, Keith David, Jazzmeia Horn and More Headline 15th Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival September 18-21

PITTSBURGH, PA, April 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- August Wilson African American Cultural Center (AWAACC) presents the 15th edition of the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival, co-presented by Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, featuring the city's own iconic history along with legendary and contemporary jazz artistry. The majority of performances are FREE on Liberty Avenue in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh with food trucks, a beer garden and Game Zone, plus ticketed concerts at AWAACC.   "The August Wilson Center is bringing you the best fest yet with the 15th edition of the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival co-presented by Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield," said Janis Burley, President/CEO of AWAACC and the festival's Artistic Director and founder. "As I reflect on the last fifteen years, I am proud of what the PIJF has accomplished: introducing new artists at the beginning of their rise to stardom, jazz legends at the height of their careers, and incredible jam session memories that the musicians remember as a special night in Pittsburgh. Music is the main objective for us, and we are committed to preserving the history, integrity, and ushering the future of this music we love, JAZZ."  "The Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival at The August Wilson African American Cultural Center is a powerful testament to music's ability to connect us all," said Kenya T. Boswell, senior vice president of community affairs, Highmark Health. "Through our Highmark Bright Blue Futures program, we're honored to support events like this that not only showcase the vibrancy of our community and its well-being but also contribute significantly to our local economy."   The 2025 festival headliners are an eclectic mix of straight-ahead jazz, neo soul, Caribbean and urban folk music. Jazz stalwarts Branford Marsalis and Dee Dee Bridgewater headline the festival. If you have a taste for the infinite varieties of jazz vocalists, you can feast your tastebuds on one of the reigning queens, Jazzmeia Horn, and Keith David, the richly-voiced, acclaimed stage and screen actor whose jazz album drops later this year, and two young singers -- the Los Angeles-based crooner, Michael Mayo, and the Jazz at Lincoln Center-affiliated chanteuse, Ekep Nkwelle Howard. And if you have a craving for a soothing, keyboardist/vocalist in the vein of the late Roberta Flack, hear Kandace Springs. After you've ingested all those musical styles, and you're ready to dance, you'll enjoy the D.C. go-go rhythms of the all-woman group, Be'La, Dona, the trap-jazz of saxophonist Nathan-Paul Davis, the West Indian riddims of the Trinidadian trumpeter Etienne Charles and his Creole Soul Ensemble, and the propulsive polyrhythms from the Haitian-American drummer Obed Calvaire. And, if you feel like chasing the blues, then catch Christone "Kingfish" Ingram, the young award-winning guitarist/vocalist from Mississippi.  Homegrown guitarist and jazz club owner, John Shannon tours the globe but will shine a light on Pittsburgh-based talent. Ohio native Dan Wilson is heir-apparent to the legacy of Pittsburgh's living legend, George Benson. He is commissioned by PIJF to be the musical director of an all-star tribute to Benson to open the Festival on Friday night September 19. If you are in the mood for some post-bop, avant-garde, soul music, you'll dig pianist Theron Brown and Orrin Evans' TARBABY trio, featuring bassist Eric Revis and drummer Nasheet Waits. Showcasing all flavors and styles of jazz, PIJF embraces the diversity of the music.  For the third straight year, pianist/bandleader/composer Orrin Evans will host THE JAZZ TRAIN™, in partnership with AWAACC and Amtrak. The travel package includes round-trip train tickets from New York, Newark or Philadelphia, live jazz music during the trip, light refreshments and exciting jazz-related games and activities followed by four days of live music at the Festival. Passengers are responsible for securing the hotel and festival events of their choice.   Festival attendees can purchase single-day or full weekend VIP Passes separately or as a bundle with The Jazz Train tickets. VIP access includes priority seating for outdoor stages, access to a lounge area inside the AWAACC building, VIP-only bars and more. VIP Passes are limited, and advance booking is recommended. Tickets are available at www.pittsburghjazzfest.org.  After giving it serious thought and probably changing her mind a time or two, Burley named some of her favorite performances over the past 15 years – "Chaka Khan, the first artist we honored with a Luminary Award … 50,000 people singing War's classic song, "Cisco Kid" … Patti LaBelle inviting dance partners on stage to sing a duet…Chick Corea, Christian McBride and Brian Blade in one of Corea's last festival appearances, and Gregory Porter headlining the festival in 2011."
