# A STREET ROD ICON: THE 1940 FORD DELUXE COUPE CUSTOM 'G FORCE FORTY' JOINS THE DFW CAR & TOY MUSEUM COLLECTION

FORT WORTH, TX, March 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A powerhouse of innovation, performance, and timeless style has rolled into the DFW Car & Toy Museum! The 1940 Ford DeLuxe Coupe Custom 'G Force Forty', a masterfully crafted street rod that redefines what a vintage coupe can do, is now on display as part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection. With free admission to the museum, visitors can experience this high-performance legend up close, immersing themselves in a world where classic design meets cutting-edge engineering.  Street rodding has always been about pushing boundaries, blending nostalgia with modern technology to create unique, exhilarating machines. The G Force Forty is the perfect embodiment of that spirit—a car that turns heads at shows, dominates the highway, and even holds its own on an autocross track. Beneath its sleek, fat-fendered exterior lies a high-performance chassis engineered for speed, handling, and precision.  While many street rods retain their vintage aesthetics but struggle with agility, this Ford is different. Thanks to its C5 Corvette suspension, this custom coupe carves through winding roads and mountain switchbacks with the poise of a modern supercar. Most rodders settle for the more common C4 Corvette suspension, but this build takes things further, embracing the next-level engineering of the C5 platform to deliver superior road control, ride comfort, and world-class handling.  Unleashing 711 Horsepower of Pure Muscle Performance isn't just an afterthought—it's the foundation of the G Force Forty. Under the hood, this beast is powered by a meticulously engineered Iron Eagle block, topped with Brodix-12 18-degree raised-port cylinder heads and an intermediary plate beneath the intake manifold for seamless integration. The result? A street-tuned powerhouse delivering a staggering 711 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and 607 lb-ft of torque at 5,000 rpm, all on pump gas! It's a testament to the dedication, expertise, and passion that fuels the world of street rodding.  A Tribute to Timeless Enthusiasm As with all great automotive passions, street rodding is ever-evolving, but the thrill remains unchanged. Whether you're drawn to the craftsmanship, the adrenaline rush, or the deep-seated nostalgia, this 1940 Ford DeLuxe Coupe Custom represents everything that makes the hot-rodding world so exciting. It's a car that speaks to generations of enthusiasts, reminding us why we keep coming back to the machines we love.  Now, this one-of-a-kind masterpiece is part of the DFW Car & Toy Museum's incredible collection, ready to be admired by gearheads, history buffs, and casual visitors alike.
