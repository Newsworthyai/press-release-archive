# Roonyx Strengthens Global Connections

ST. PETERSBURG, FL, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Vladimir Drogan, CEO of Roonyx, recently attended two influential industry events — GADA Investors 2024 and Deep Tech Atelier 2025 — reinforcing the company's commitment to driving growth through strategic partnerships and technological innovation.  At Deep Tech Atelier 2025, Roonyx participated in dynamic conversations with early-stage startups and seasoned tech leaders focused on the future of deep tech and artificial intelligence. This environment of open exchange allowed Roonyx to challenge its assumptions, validate its product roadmap, and stay aligned with cutting-edge industry developments.  "Cross-industry conferences are invaluable to me—they offer a rare chance to engage in subtle benchmarking and uncover AI-driven business models and deep-tech methodologies that may initially appear unrelated to fintech. Yet, it is precisely this cross-pollination of ideas that serves as one of the most powerful drivers of truly disruptive innovation. This time, after exchanging ideas with dozens of forward-thinking entrepreneurs, I returned with a refined shortlist of insights that the Roonyx team is already shaping into next-generation products."  — Vladimir Drogan, CEO of Roonyx.  Shortly after, at GADA Investors 2024, Vladimir Drogan engaged with investors, policymakers, and business leaders to explore emerging trends and the evolving investment landscape. A highlight was the keynote by Victor Fedeli, Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, who shared valuable insights on opportunities within the Canadian market.  "Canada remains a strategic priority for Roonyx," said Vladimir Drogan. "Our strong partnerships and the market's innovative spirit fuel our confidence in expanding here. Events like GADA offer invaluable perspectives and connections that help us grow thoughtfully and sustainably."  For Roonyx, participation in such high-caliber events goes beyond visibility — it is a vital part of remaining agile, informed, and ready to meet the evolving demands of the global tech ecosystem.
