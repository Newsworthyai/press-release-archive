# Healing Begins Within: Christine M. Esters Leads a Return to Self Through Natural Detox and Deep Emotional Cleansing

SANTA ROSA, CA, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Christine M. Esters didn't arrive at her calling by chance. Her work as a certified colon hydrotherapist, wellness educator, and emotional release practitioner is rooted in lived experience—a journey of self-trust, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of truth in healing.  Born in Belgium, Christine began her adult life in education, earning her Elementary Teacher certificate. But her true education would begin years later when she gave birth to two healthy boys at home—without a midwife, medical assistance, or vaccinations. "It was the first time I fully trusted my body's wisdom," Christine reflects. "And once you do that, you don't go back."  Her health began to shift when she experienced unexplained liver pain, prompting a deep dive into the causes of disease and what it truly means to live well. This wasn't a surface-level wellness journey—it was a spiritual and cellular awakening.  Christine began studying at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, where she explored more than 100 dietary theories and holistic approaches. Over time, she became a Certified Digestive Health Coach, a Certified I-Act Colon Hydrotherapist Instructor, a Certified Vibrational Kinesiologist, a Certified Massage Therapist, Aromatherapist, and Reiki Master. She would later create the 10-Day Better Body Cleanse, now practiced and respected by clients around the world.  "My journey began with pain," Christine says. "But pain is often the body's final cry for help. It was never the enemy—it was a messenger."  The 10-Day Better Body Cleanse isn't just about detox—it's a full-body and soul awakening. Clients experience colon hydrotherapy using gentle gravity flow, infrared saunas, ion foot detox baths, vibrational healing, nutritional support, and emotional release techniques. Each step is designed to help women let go—not only of toxins, but of trauma, fear, fatigue, and the layers of emotional burden they've been silently carrying.  "We work on the liver because it's more than just a detox organ—it holds our anger, our stories," Christine explains. "When we release from that place, women don't just feel better—they become who they truly are."  Christine's cleanse program includes daily probiotic infusions, juice fasting with organic produce, liver and kidney support, aromatherapy, color healing light, and foot/tummy massage. More than just treatments, it's a ritual of return—to the body, to breath, and to inner truth. Clients finish with a Graduation Ceremony that honors the emotional and physical breakthroughs they've experienced.  Many of Christine's clients are high-functioning, deeply intuitive women who have hit a wall—emotionally exhausted and physically depleted. "They're strong women who have been everything to everyone," she says. "They come here because they need a safe place to fall apart… and rebuild."  As a trainer and mentor, Christine now certifies future colon hydrotherapists and teaches them not only how to practice the work, but how to embody it. She helps them build practices rooted in care, clarity, and conscious living.  "I'm not here to diagnose or cure," Christine says gently. "I'm here to walk with people back to their bodies, back to their power, back to a life where they don't feel sick and tired anymore."  Her 2011 book, The 10-Day Better Body Cleanse, shares the foundations of her work and continues to serve as an entry point for clients ready to take their healing seriously.  When asked what she's most proud of, Christine doesn't hesitate: "Being a mother. Raising two healthy sons. And choosing every day to live in alignment with what I believe—that the body is wise, and that healing is possible for anyone willing to begin."  About Christine M. Esters  Christine M.
