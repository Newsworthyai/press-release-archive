# Gwinnett Clinic Named a Georgia Multispecialty Practice Center of Excellence

LAWRENCEVILLE, GA, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Gwinnett Clinic has been named a Georgia multispecialty Practice Center of Excellence by Castle Connolly. A destination practice for physicians and patients alike, Gwinnett Clinic serves communities in greater northeast Atlanta.   Castle Connolly Practice Centers of Excellence are premier healthcare entities that employ multiple Castle Connolly Top Doctors. Only 1% of medical clinics in the U.S. are eligible to be recognized as a "Practice" Center of Excellence. Only about seven percent (7%) of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen annually as Castle Connolly Top Doctors. In 2025, nine Gwinnett Clinic physicians were named Castle Connolly Top Doctors. Doctors do not and cannot pay to be selected as a Castle Connolly Top Doctor. As such, Castle Connolly is the nation's most trusted and respected physician review organization.  Since 1983, Gwinnett Clinic has been metro Atlanta's leader in providing the highest quality, comprehensive and patient-centered care. Gwinnett Clinic staff members are proud to be a part of an independent physician-owned and led group. The physicians and non-physician providers, experienced experts in their respective specialties, maintain an interdisciplinary approach - working together to provide coordinated care within the group. By doing so, Gwinnett Clinic focuses on creating long-term relationships with their patients with the purpose of improving patient outcomes. "High quality is the cornerstone of everything we do. It starts with hiring like-minded physicians, APPs, and administrative staff, which creates our culture, and carries through every aspect of the care we deliver," said Chief Operating Officer and primary care physician Dr. Deep Shah, MD, MSc. With this approach, Gwinnett Clinic has consistently achieved very high-quality scores and enduring patient satisfaction.  Gwinnett Clinic has a 17-clinic network in the northeast suburbs of metro Atlanta. Full-spectrum adult and adolescent primary care is provided at nearly all locations. Additionally, Gwinnett Clinic offers specialist care in allergy, asthma, and immunology; general neurology; lifestyle medicine; physical therapy; obesity medicine; orthopedic surgery; and sleep medicine. Ancillary care provided at their Lawrenceville main location includes imaging, radiology, moderate complexity laboratory services and an on-site pharmacy that also provides free home delivery for Gwinnett Clinic patients. "We continuously ask ourselves what our patients and the surrounding community need to be healthier. We meet those needs with primary care being the focal point of their care, and augment it with specialty care, in-house ancillary health services and a curated referral network of likeminded physicians," commented Dr. Shah.  Unlike most medical clinics, Gwinnett Clinic provides patients with the convenience of same-day sick visits, walk-in visits (available to established patients and new patients), evening hours and weekend hours. To provide prompt patient interaction that is both personalized and accessible to the diversity of its patient population, Gwinnett Clinic manages a sophisticated scheduling system with trained staff who understand the practice's mission to be available for its patients and the community at large. Of note, Gwinnett Clinic physicians collectively speak 14 languages.  Patients truly get to know everyone at Gwinnett Clinic as the tenure of the clinical and administrative teams is unique among medical clinics. The average tenure of a Gwinnett Clinic physician is over 10 years, and several have been there for 20 to 40 years. The clinical and administrative staff are very loyal to their patients â€“ many have worked in the practice for 10, 20 or 30 years.  Five core principles guide Gwinnett Clinic staff in their mission to provide high-quality interdisciplinary care: - Building strong relationships among patients, providers, and support staff. - Delivering comprehensive care. - Recognizing the responsibility of being good stewards of patients' time, energy and finances. - Providing access and convenience to patients. - Offering patients the highest quality care in every dimension of their practice.
