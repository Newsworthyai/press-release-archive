# DR. ANA MAFÉ GARCÍA, A WORLD EXPERT ON THE HOLY GRAIL, REVEALS ITS SECRETS IN 'LA SOTONERA'

LA SOTONERA, SPAIN, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Technology and historical research are coming together to develop one of the most innovative cultural projects of today: an immersive experience about the journey of the Holy Grail from Jerusalem to Valencia, with a strategic stop in La Sotonera ( Huesca ). A journey that, beyond legend, relies on documental rigour and tangible heritage, and will be interpreted using cutting-edge technology too.  The historical and heritage advisory work was led by Dr. Ana Mafé García, president of the 'El Camino del Santo Grial' Cultural Association and a renowned international researcher. Her contribution was essential in the documentation, validation of historical content, and narrative structuring of the project, ensuring its academic soundness and cultural value as an educational, tourism, and local development tool.  Dr. Mafé directly advised the company awarded the contract for the Design, Conceptualization, Production, and Equipment for the immersive reality experience, providing the scientific foundations that support the representation of the different episodes of the journey of the Holy Chalice: from the Last Supper in Jerusalem, its passage through Rome and Aragon, until its arrival at the Cathedral of Valencia.  One of the major innovations of this collaboration has been the integration of artificial intelligence support, which has facilitated document analysis, source comparison, systematization of historical data, and organization of stage scripts. This synergy between AI and humanistic knowledge has allowed for optimized production times and strengthened narrative coherence, while maintaining the utmost respect for historical accuracy.  "Artificial intelligence doesn't replace historians, but it can be a helpful tool for complex projects like this one, which require synthesizing centuries of history and making it accessible to a wide range of audiences," said Dr. Ana Mafé.  The result will be an immersive experience that will allow visitors to discover the spiritual, artistic, and cultural legacy of the Holy Grail from a multisensory perspective, reinforcing the value of the territory and the importance of 'La Sotonera' as a key site in the story.  Dr. Ana Mafé García is also president of the International Association Cultural Route The Way of the Holy Grail in Europe, which also includes a team of researchers from France and Italy. The work being developed around The Way of the Holy Grail is part of a broader strategy: the official nomination of this route as a European Cultural Route recognized by the Council of Europe . This candidacy represents an exceptional opportunity for the internationalization of Aragonese heritage, since it would allow the historical, spiritual and scenic wealth of enclaves such as La Sotonera or the Monastery of San Juan de la Peña to be visible at a European level. Furthermore, it would be a strategic tool for territorial development, facilitating access to cultural networks, sustainable tourism, cross-border cooperation and European funding. Being part of the Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe is a guarantee of quality and authenticity that reinforces Aragon's identity as a land of welcome, culture and living memory.   The project, called 'The Holy Grail Route', will be carried out thanks to funding from the European 'Next Generation EU' funds, as part of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR).
