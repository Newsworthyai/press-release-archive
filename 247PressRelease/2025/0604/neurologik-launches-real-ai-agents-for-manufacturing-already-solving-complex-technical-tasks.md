# Neurologik Launches Real AI Agents for Manufacturing — Already Solving Complex Technical Tasks

LEWES, DE, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Neurologik.io, an AI company building domain-trained agents for technical and product teams, announces the launch of its production-ready AI agents, already used by several manufacturing customers in live environments.  These agents are not chatbots or copilots — they operate like real technical staff, delivering structured outputs, validating solutions, and interpreting product data, standards, and regulations.  "We didn't build a chatbot," said Andrei Tsyganok, Co-Founder and CRO of Neurologik. "We built agents that can reason through complex systems, and our customers are already using them in production."  Neurologik's agents support manufacturers of complex systems by: • Creating solution designs from minimal input • Validating product configurations • Explaining decisions with traceable logic • Interpreting regional compliance standards • Instantly comparing product options — including alternatives from competitors • Providing early go / no-go decisions for each request or RFP  To showcase its capabilities, Neurologik published a 100-page example using public data from a known manufacturer. The document illustrates real prompts and outputs — highlighting how the system functions in the field.
