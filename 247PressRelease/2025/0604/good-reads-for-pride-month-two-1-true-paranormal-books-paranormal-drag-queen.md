# Good Reads for PRIDE Month: Two #1 True Paranormal Books &amp; Paranormal Drag Queen

BOSTON, MA, June 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Celebrate PRIDE with 2 true paranormal best-sellers involving a drag queen and gay man's spirit who solved the mystery of his own death. Medium/author Rob Gutro teamed with Paranormal Investigator and Drag Queen, Monique Toosoon on a new book called "Haunting Emery Estate," about a chilling 5-hour investigation with three ghosts. Gutro's book "Kindred Spirits" chronicles how his husband's late partner has been part of their relationship for over 20 years.   Toosoon, New England's paranormal drag queen with a sensitivity to earthbound ghosts worked with Gutro, leading the investigation of Emery Estate in Massachusetts.   "We connected with three ghosts, two of whom we proved their identities, and one who affected mirrors in a frightening way. They conveyed their personalities and stories, and one double-crossed us," Gutro said. Gutro also sketched two ghosts he saw.   Monique decided to try drag on investigations during COVID, and said, "I tend to call myself 'The best trigger object you can bring investigating,' because locations always tell me that the energy is completely different and much more elevated when I am around."   "Haunting of Emery Estate" covers the 5-hour investigation. The investigators tried to uncover the identities, stories and reasons why these ghosts remained behind. One of the ghosts even affected a public investigator whom had to be protected and he revealed his chilling and controlling nature at the end of the night. They have another book coming out in January 2026 about the "Haunting of Hunt Memorial Library."   Gutro's other book, "Kindred Spirits: When a Medium Befriends a Spirit," has been called "A Spirit Love Triangle." It's about how Rob's husband Tom's late partner Ed, who died in 1996, has been part of their relationship since they met in 2005.   Ed's communications with Rob unveiled the truth about Ed's passing. Ed proved he visited every member of his family with a "treasure hunt," before Rob met them for the first time. Ed sent a look-alike to rescue Rob and Tom on an England vacation, and proved he greeted each of their late dogs in the light. Ed's fun personality shines while teaching us how spirits give signs to loved ones. "Knowing Ed in spirit is like having a friend who lives in another state," Gutro said.   Both books have been popular with LGBTQ readers and are best-sellers. Emery Estate also achieved the #1 spot on Amazon in Ghosts and Hauntings and Parapsychology categories.  Rob Gutro is a medium, pet medium, scientist and paranormal investigator. He is the first in the paranormal field to make the distinction between earthbound ghosts and spirits who have crossed over and explains the paranormal with science. He also sketches ghosts. He has published 12 true paranormal books based on his experiences. He has three series including: The award-winning "Pets and the Afterlife" series, which teach how pets communicate from the other side. "Ghosts on a Medium's Vacation," contains history and hauntings Gutro encountered in England, Ireland and the Bird Cage Theatre, Arizona. His "Ghosts and Spirits" series is about hauntings and spirits he met.   Monique Toosoon is a captivating force in the world of drag and paranormal exploration. With a career spanning 2 decades and named New Hampshire's "Ghostess with the Mostest," she was crowned Best Local Entertainer for four years running. From sold-out extravaganzas across New England to riveting appearances on esteemed paranormal showcases like Dark Echoes Paranormal Show and Ghost Finders, Monique's ascent knows no bounds.
