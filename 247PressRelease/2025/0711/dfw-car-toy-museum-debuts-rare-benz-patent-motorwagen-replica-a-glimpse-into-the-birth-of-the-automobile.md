# DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Debuts Rare Benz Patent-Motorwagen Replica — A Glimpse Into the Birth of the Automobile

FORT WORTH, TX, July 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to unveil one of the most historically significant vehicles ever created — a rare Benz Patent-Motorwagen replica, Serial No. 044, now on display for visitors to experience firsthand.  This meticulously crafted Motorwagen was produced by John Bentley and Sons Engineering in North Yorkshire, England, as one of a limited number built for Daimler-Benz to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Carl Benz's revolutionary invention. The vehicle is believed to have been previously showcased in a Mercedes-Benz showroom in Richmond, Virginia, before joining the DFW Car & Toy Museum's world-class collection.  Carl Benz's original Patent-Motorwagen, built in 1885, holds the distinction of being the world's first true automobile — a gas-powered, self-propelled vehicle that forever transformed human mobility. The replica now on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum faithfully recreates this pioneering machine in exquisite detail, offering visitors a rare glimpse into the earliest days of automotive engineering.  The vehicle features a tubular steel frame paired with finely crafted woodwork and authentic brass hardware. Power comes from a 954cc single-cylinder engine delivering approximately ¾ horsepower, modeled directly after Carl Benz's original design. The drivetrain includes a leather belt-driven planetary transmission and chain-driven rear wheels. Visitors can also examine the vehicle's distinctive spring-mounted leather seat and tiller-style steering system, which provides a hands-on understanding of how the earliest automobiles were operated. Additional authentic details include a period-correct drip oiling system and evaporative cooling system — cutting-edge technology for its era.  "This vehicle is not just a replica — it is a time machine," said Brian Sturgeon, manager of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It gives our guests a rare opportunity to witness the humble yet ingenious beginnings of the automotive world."  The Benz Patent-Motorwagen replica, identified by serial plaque MBCC No. 044, is a coveted collectible and a cornerstone addition to the museum's evolving collection of rare vehicles and historical artifacts.
