# This Couple Chose Nova at University Park For Their New Home in Palm Desert

PALM DESERT, CA, July 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Do yourself a big favor," said new Nova homeowner Harry G. "Come to WPG projects at University Park. See for yourself. You'll be on the cutting edge of a new community that is developing beautifully."  For Harry and wife Theresa, the decision to buy their new home at Nova was an easy one. They knew they wanted a home in the desert, and they knew they preferred a new home.   "Buying a brand-new home saves you money," said Harry. "Everything is new, so you aren't buying a home and then spending thousands of dollars to make fixes and updates."  They had looked for two months, scouting the area and even making a deposit on a lot in another community. "It became unaffordable with the upgrades we wanted, so we looked around at University Park, and initially were drawn to the Nova model," said Harry. "But we wanted a casita, which was not available with the model.   "So, I looked online again and found an available Nova plan with both casita and ADU," said Harry. "I called Chad Ross on Monday morning, and we bought that same day."  Nova sales representative Chad Ross connected Harry and Theresa with WPG preferred lender U.S. Bank and Jeff Weirsma, "Jeff can help you sort out the choices, including interest rate buy-downs, and determine the optimal scenario for you," said WPG President Todd Cunningham. "He and his staff will help identify best opportunities and whether a purchase is right for you." Call Jeff at 949-515-1205 or 714-403-0329, or email Jeff.wiersma@USBank.com.   "Jeff Weirsma helped me secure a great home loan," said Harry. "He is tremendous, and his assistant Banker Hedyeh Nader was off the chart great. Ditto with our processor Jaime Boyan—the whole experience was incredibly good.  "We have purchased several homes over the past 7 years and have never encountered anyone as pleasant and easy to deal with as the people at U.S. Bank," added Harry. "WPG and U.S. Bank made our experience easy."  Chad Ross also earned high praise. "It's simple—Chad is a respectful, classy guy whose desire is to help you, not 'sell' you," said Harry. "And he has helped with many things after our move, like referrals for the people you need to get settled, such as house cleaners and gardeners."  The desire to secure a home with auxiliary space was strong, and Nova filled the bill. "The ADU gives homeowners a chance to help with the housing shortage that is acute in so many Southern California areas," said Harry. "We can provide a low-cost rental, while offsetting costs—definitely a win/win.   "The casita is terrific for long-term visitors, or an aging parent," Harry added. "They have an independent, easy to care for dwelling unit and you are right there for them, adding security to their living."  As for their new home living space, Harry and Theresa find much to praise. Said Harry, "WPG built this home to be so quiet, and we hear nothing from the outside world. Everything is at our fingertips here, and living is clean, simple and pleasing.  "We are dog people, with a Great Dane and an English Mastiff," added Harry. "We all lounge together in the great room, and it's a quick step to the rear door to let our pals get to the outside space."  Location also suits this couple. "The desert is beautiful, and the cost of living is lower than in many areas," said Harry. "The walking is easy in our neighborhood, and the people here are phenomenally great. We have had many wonderful experiences in just a short time with our neighbors at Nova and in University Park."  Prices at Nova are from the low $700,000s, and several selections are move-in ready. Plan sizes range from 2,086 to 2,751 square feet and provide 4 to 5 bedrooms and 2.5 to 4.5 bathrooms. All homes include a 2-car garage.

Ideal as a permanent residence, these homes also offer the lock-and-leave ease of a winter home.  Casita and ADU Designs—Nova's casita and ADU layouts offer sleeping and living space, a bathroom and wardrobe, washer/dryer space and a compact kitchenette. A separate entry further privatizes these layouts, optimizing their income potential or as independent space for parents, live-in help or long-term guests. "Our buyers have varied reasons to consider casita and ADU layouts, and the potential for higher resale value is attractive to all," said Cunningham.
