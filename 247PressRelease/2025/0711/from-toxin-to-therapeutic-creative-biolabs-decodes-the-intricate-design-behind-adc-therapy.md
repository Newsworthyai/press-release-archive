# From "Toxin" to "Therapeutic": Creative Biolabs Decodes the Intricate Design Behind ADC Therapy

SHIRLEY, NY, July 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "The toxin in an ADC isn't simply the more potent, the better," stresses a senior scientific advisor at Creative Biolabs. "A successful ADC must precisely target cancer cells while controlling its toxicity."  This balance is what makes ADCs unique. They are not just an antibody linked to a toxin, but rather, they constitute a finely-tuned, chemically engineered weapon system. The two crucial elements are the payload (toxin) and its behavior in vivo.  Although a variety of natural products have been investigated as potential toxins for ADCs, the most clinically used subset currently is the auristatin, a subclass of microtubule inhibitors. These types of molecules cause cancer cell death by preventing mitosis, leading to apoptosis.  "Used directly, auristatins are too toxic," the advisor explains. "But if they are targeted, contained, and spatially restricted, they can actually serve as effective surgical tools." In this instance, scientists modified the structure of auristatin by removing the N-terminal methyl group and adding a secondary amine that could conjugate to linkers. He called it "tame enough" for ADCs while still potent.  Through the changes made, auristatin derivatives such as MMAE and MMAF became widespread ADC toxins. Creative Biolabs has developed a specialization in ADC design and has built an auristatin-centered toxin development platform to provide clients with high-purity and traceable ADCs and offer custom derivatives, linker design, and structural validation.  These processes are not as simple as they may seem. Indeed, the most crucial aspects come into play in the body: the release, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the toxin. Answering these questions requires in-depth pharmacokinetic studies.  "The different components of the ADC, which in total can be likened to a 'sandwich' structure, all have individual fates once inside the body," said the head of the PK Team at Creative Biolabs. Stability is first assessed—does the antibody degrade, or does the linker break too soon? Following that, the dynamic changes of total antibody, conjugated antibody, free toxin, antibody-toxin complexes, and metabolites are studied.  For this, Creative Biolabs has developed solutions through a comprehensive pharmacokinetic analysis system, including:  • Modified ELISA to quantify total and conjugated antibodies separately; • LC-MS/MS for precise measurement of free and bound MMAE in plasma; • Tissue distribution and excretion studies tracking ADC presence in organs and elimination via urine and feces.  These data inform dosing regimens and directly impact toxin structure and linker design. Due to this close connection, Creative Biolabs considers toxin development and PK study to be one cohesive service, not separate steps.  "Unlike conventional drugs, ADCs require an iterative process combining molecular design with in vivo evaluation," the advisor concludes. "Our goal is to provide clients with ADC solutions that are precise, controllable, and ready for clinical use."
