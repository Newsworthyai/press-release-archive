# The Silo Cooking School Welcomes Chef Carlos Nuno a Culinary Virtuoso from the Azores in a Bold Revival of Its Storied Legacy

NEW MILFORD, CT, January 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Silo Cooking School is cranking the heat back up—and not just on the stoves. Fresh off its reopening under the sharp eye and even sharper knives of Chef Constantine "Dino" Kolitsas—yes, the same guy who's been racking up "Best Restaurant" accolades for Greca Mediterranean Kitchen + Bar four years running—The Silo is kicking off 2025 in style. And by style, I mean a groundbreaking, palate-punching move. We're talking about bringing in Chef Carlos Nuno, a blazing talent from the international culinary circuit, to christen the kitchen with a whole new level of badassery. This isn't just another guest chef gig; it's The Silo saying, "We're back." Bigger, bolder, and ready to show that this little corner of the world has the chops to host the best and inspire the next generation of kitchen warriors. Strap in, it's going to be one hell of a ride.  Carlos Nuno isn't just a chef, he's a damn artist with a knife, and his story is as flavorful as the dishes he creates. Born in Lisbon, with deep roots in the volcanic beauty of Terceira, Azores, Carlos carries the kind of culinary heritage that turns mere ingredients into stories on a plate. By 22, he wasn't just some kid in a kitchen—he was snagging a merit scholarship at Lisbon's elite Hotel and Tourism School, a golden ticket that launched him headfirst into the white-hot world of haute cuisine. From there, it was a meteoric rise through kitchens where only the brave survives. At Alma, he mastered the two-Michelin-star dance of balance and brilliance. At Fifty Seconds, under Martin Berasategui, he sharpened his precision into something almost surgical. And then, there was El Celler de Can Roca—a three-Michelin-star temple of gastronomy that doesn't just sit on lists of the best restaurants in the world, it defines them. Carlos Nuno doesn't just cook; he crafts experiences that punch you right in the taste buds and leave you begging for more. Get ready, because this guy isn't just visiting The Silo—he's about to set the place on fire (figuratively, we hope).  Chef Carlos Nuno is at the helm of Mar e Vinhas on Terceira Island; Mar e Vinhas is a living, breathing ode to the ocean, a place where heritage meets the cutting edge, and tradition takes a wild, inventive twist. Here, seafood doesn't just get cooked—it gets elevated, reimagined, and served with a side of boldness that leaves diners rethinking everything they thought they knew about Portuguese cuisine. This guy doesn't do ordinary, and that's exactly why he's the perfect fit for The Silo Cooking School's next big act.  By welcoming Chef Carlos to its kitchen, The Silo Cooking School isn't just doubling down on its legacy of excellence—it's throwing down the gauntlet. "Carlos brings it all—creativity, unmatched skill, and this unstoppable hunger to reinvent and inspire," says Chef Constantine "Dino" Kolitsas, the man steering the ship at The Silo Cooking School. "This collaboration is about giving our students a firsthand look at what passion and innovation really look like."  And trust me, you'll want in on this. Chef Carlos isn't coming to play; he's leading two hands-on masterclasses that are set to blow some minds. First up, on January 11th, is a seafood lover's dream. Clams à Bulhão Pato dripping in garlicky perfection. Azorean seafood soup that hugs your soul. Shrimp so good, they wouldn't dare call it simple. And the main event? Arroz de Marisco e Peixe, a seafood rice dish so luxurious it practically requires a tux. This isn't just a class; it's a love letter to Portugal's coastlines (Sold Out).  On January 13th, Carlos flips the script to showcase the comfort and charm of traditional Portuguese cuisine. Croquete de carne—crispy little parcels of meaty magic. Peixinhos da horta, those addictive fried green beans that'll have you reaching for more. Tender bites of Pica-pau balancing tangy pickles, the rustic, soulful Migas, and an Azorean steak that would make any beef-loving carnivore weep with joy. And for dessert? Doce da avó, the kind of retro, heartwarming sweetness that takes you straight back to grandma's kitchen (Sold Out).  On January 12th, Chef Carlos Nuno brings his A-game in more ways than one. While students at The Silo Cooking School get a hands-on crash course in the comfort and soul of traditional Portuguese cuisine, a lucky few will have the rare chance to skip the cooking and savor the magic instead. At 5 pm sharp, Chef Carlos takes over the kitchen at Greca Mediterranean Kitchen + Bar for an exclusive seafood 5-course dinner experience that's shaping up to be pure culinary theater. This isn't a class—it's a takeover, and it's going to be one for the books. (Almost Sold Out)  But this isn't just about food—it's about experience. It's about getting schooled by a world-class chef who isn't afraid to push boundaries and take you along for the ride. "At The Silo Cooking School, food isn't just something we teach—it's a language," adds Alessandro Piovezahn Hunt Hill Farm's President. "Bringing Chef Nuno here is about connection, a cultural enrichment exchange, about giving our community something truly unforgettable."  This is what The Silo Cooking School is all about—bringing you a front-row seat to witness the brilliance of culinary greatness. They've hosted legends before, and they're not slowing down now. This is the kind of culinary moment you'll be bragging about for years. Reserve your spot and be part of history, because at The Silo, the next chapter is already cooking.  The Silo Cooking School is an integral part of the Skitch Henderson Center of Excellence for Youth Empowerment, embodying Hunt Hill Farm's dedication to community development as an NGO accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Committed to advancing the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, this initiative highlights SDG #3, #4, #8, #10, #12, and #17 through projects like the cultural enrichment exchange program starting with Chef Carlos Nuno from the Azores. This collaboration marks the beginning of a vibrant youth artistic and cultural exchange program set to launch in 2025, fostering opportunities for social entrepreneurship and personal growth. With a world-class infrastructure, including the Cooking School, Art Gallery, retail Store, the Skitch Henderson Museum - first Smithsonian affiliate museum of American Music History and Americana, 10 historic buildings in the National Registry of Historic Places, accommodations for over 25 residents and the capacity to train and engage hundreds, The Silo has long been a hub for cultural preservation and artistic residency. From Chef Carlos, the first international culinary artist to join, to creatives from Brazil, Ukraine, Italy, and beyond, this legacy honors Ruth and Skitch Henderson's vision of promoting arts, culture, and education on a global scale. "Being of Azorean heritage myself, I am profoundly inspired to share the rich Portuguese culture and legacy that form a part of my own identity," said Daniele Piovezahn, Director of Legacy.  This initiative invites Member States, NGOs, and civil society organizations to collaborate strategically, celebrating cultural values while empowering youth through life-changing opportunities.  Located in Northville, CT, The Silo Cooking School has been a beacon of culinary excellence for over five decades. Known as the Superstars of the cooking world retreat for its immersive classes, celebrated instructors, and commitment to inspiring new generations of food lovers, The Silo combines tradition with innovation to create unforgettable educational experiences. Its recent reopening marks a new era in its storied legacy, with an exciting lineup of programs and instructors designed to ignite a passion for cooking in every student.  Hunt Hill Farm seeks collaboration with UN Member States and NGOs to expand this initiative into a global network of young chefs, united by their passion for sharing and celebrating their unique cultural heritage on an international stage.
