PowerFlix, led by film industry veterans Robert Schwartzman and Cole Harper, will host the launch of their new tech platform at the lounge, as they provide tools and service add-ons to release films. PowerFlix will be celebrating its release at the Sommsation Wine Lounge, the company who is leading the wine industry with its advanced technology and solutions to small, independent wineries, all while offering centralized distribution solutions alongside additional client services, such as Sommelier-guided support. •	To wrap up the weekend, Sommsation will host a fundraising event where 100% of the proceeds will be donated to select local charities in support of the recent wildfires that have heavily impacted the Los Angeles community.
