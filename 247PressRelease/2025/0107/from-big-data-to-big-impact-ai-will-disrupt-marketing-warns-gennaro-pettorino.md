# From Big Data to Big Impact: AI Will Disrupt Marketing, Warns Gennaro Pettorino

MILAN ITALY, January 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Artificial intelligence will become the primary driver of digital marketing transformation over the next few years," predicts Gennaro Pettorino, an Italian digital marketer specializing in AI-driven campaigns. According to Pettorino, a surge in automated solutions will reshape key processes, eliminate outdated roles, and create new, more specialized professions within the sector.  In a recent statement, Pettorino underscored how artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize omnichannel strategies by sifting through colossal amounts of data—often referred to as big data—and extracting consumer insights in real time. "We are at a point where AI-based algorithms can swiftly identify which content resonates best with target audiences, effectively personalizing ad messages and optimizing content marketing," says Pettorino.   However, Pettorino also warns that this new era of advanced automation does not come without challenges. He cites data privacy, the considerable cost of implementing complex AI tools, and an overreliance on automated processes as crucial factors marketers must address. The evolving Internet of Things (IoT), the growing influence of natural language processing (NLP) on customer service, and the rise of robotic services and chatbots have all fueled debates on how far AI can—and should—go in supplanting human-driven strategies. "There is no doubt," Pettorino states, "that AI is a game-changer, but marketers must balance these cutting-edge technologies with ethical responsibilities and human creativity."  Looking ahead, Genni Pettorino believes AI-powered content creation and brand management will only continue to expand, allowing for tailored messaging that meets consumers' exact preferences. "The ability to parse and interpret nuanced user feedback in seconds will bring a faster, more targeted approach to marketing, helping brands stay relevant and top-of-mind," he explains.   Gennaro Pettorino concludes by highlighting a key takeaway for the industry: "The marketing world as we know it today will be unrecognizable in just a few short years, largely because artificial intelligence will grow more integral every step of the way. Professions will transform—some will vanish, and others will emerge—but the opportunities for innovation and growth are boundless for those who embrace this new frontier."
