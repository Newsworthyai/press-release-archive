# Martial Law Declared in Korea: BD Kim's Art Exhibition Halted Amid Unrest

NEW YORK, NY, January 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renowned Korean artist BD Kim (Kim Dae Yong), who captured global attention with his September 1st exhibition at Mount Baekdu, announced that the unveiling of his latest large-scale artwork, originally planned for December 2024, will be postponed. The decision comes in response to the recent declaration of martial law and the impeachment of Korea's president.  In a statement shared on his official website and social media, Kim explained: "With martial law declared and then lifted, the impeachment of the president, and the Constitutional Court's pending decision, people are currently in a state of confusion and difficulty. It would not be appropriate to unveil my work under such circumstances."  Kim's September exhibition offered a preview of his ambitious 12m x 1.5m piece, Beyond the Whole World, showcasing a 2.5-meter segment of the work he spent five years creating atop Mount Baekdu on the North Korea-China border. The event garnered widespread attention, with Kim promising a full unveiling in December 2024.  Adding to the intrigue, just a week before the exhibition, Kim released a groundbreaking video on YouTube in 11 languages. The video, which referenced Elon Musk as the "President of the Space Federation," captured global imagination and cemented Kim's reputation as a visionary in the art world.  Since the exhibition, nearly 10,000 visitors have flocked to Kim's website (www.daum.ai) to explore his unreleased work and future projects. With 90% of the traffic coming from English-speaking regions, fans worldwide expressed their disappointment over the postponement, though many applauded Kim's sensitivity to the current political climate.  Despite the delay, Kim remains steadfast in his commitment to his audience. He reassured fans that his work, infused with "the energy of peace and love," will debut at a time when the nation regains stability and harmony. "Art has the power to inspire and heal," Kim shared, "and I hope to share this vision when the time is right."  Kim's decision reflects his deep connection to his homeland and the global significance of his work. By aligning his artistic vision with the values of peace and solidarity, he continues to solidify his role as a cultural ambassador and a voice for resilience.
