There are no sign-ups, nothing to join and no hidden agendas! Just my way of saying thank you and sending out some big international love! - Allen Brooks" (11/07/25)  Kansas City–based musician Allen Brooks unveils his latest single and accompanying music video, "Mirrors In My Mind," an evocative fusion of psychedelic rock, haunting textures, and cinematic storytelling. A close follow up to his most recent release "Caviar and Cigarettes," Brooks returns with a deeper, darker sound that pushes creative and technical boundaries.  "When I wrote Caviar and Cigarettes, I developed a specific formula for that song, using acoustic guitar as the main track and distortion on the electric only for texture, which is usually the reverse," Brooks explains. "For Mirrors In My Mind, I started with the same formula but aimed for something that felt like Early Doors meets Marilyn Manson, a creepy, psychedelic hard rocker with tribal drums and orchestral drama."  The track features an international lineup of collaborators including Mariano Vega on drums, Mariano Power on saxophone, and Plátano Ebrio on orchestral timpani, all based in Argentina. The song was produced and mastered in Italy by Andrew Caccese, a longtime collaborator and trusted creative partner of Brooks.  "I've built a humble but powerful home studio over the past few years," Brooks shares. "Each project teaches me something new. The best advice I can give is this, 'Record everything to your satisfaction, but always hire the best professional engineers and producers you can afford for the final mix and master.'"  There are some fun references in the track including PRIMUS's release Sailing The Seas Of Cheese and Steam Powered Giraffe's release Honey Bee.  The music video for "Mirrors In My Mind" is a vivid visual journey created through Brooks' own direction and by using cutting-edge AI tools. Combining his background in film and animation, as he's a graduate of NYFA (2010), Brooks wrote the script, designed storyboards, and performed in full green screen setups to bring the surreal narrative to life.  "My video process is complex but completely worth it," Brooks says. "I start by writing the script, then build storyboards and develop my outfits. For this one, I repurposed the look from my 'Tragically Twisted' video and even designed custom Owl pajamas. And yes, since everyone always asks, my owl's name is Valtherion."  The end result is a bold fusion of visual art and rock expression! An immersive experience that blurs the line between sound, vision, and imagination. immersive experience that blurs the line between sound, vision, and imagination.  "Hold on to what you believe in, and your dreams will always come true."  Allen Brooks • https://allenbrooks.net • https://www.youtube.com/@AllenBrooks-Music
