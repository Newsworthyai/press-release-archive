# Praxis named "2025 Faith-Based Organization of the Year" by Environmental Finance magazine

GOSHEN, IN, December 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Praxis Investment ManagementTM, a company of Everence® and a leading faith-based investment manager, today was named the global 2025 Faith-Based Organization of the Year by Environmental Finance in its IMPACT Award program. This recognition follows the launch of Praxis Investment Management's two ETFs—Praxis Impact Large Cap Value (PRXV) and Praxis Impact Large Cap Growth (PRXG)—and the release of our research: "Faith-based investing: The conversation clients seek, the value advisors can add."  "This award recognizes in part our 2025 research which revealed gaps in awareness and disconnects in communications between investors and advisors," said Mark Regier, Vice President of Stewardship Investing. "Faith-based investing is about fostering purpose as much as performance, and we're honored to be recognized for our work this year helping advisors meet the growing demand for this strategy from clients."   Environmental Finance's annual IMPACT Awards recognizes the work of impact investors everywhere and highlights best practices, across all asset classes and all geographies. Winners were selected by an advisory panel consisting of industry experts made up of investors, pension fund managers and insurers, along with the Environmental Finance editorial team.  "We're proud to continue pioneering ways for clients to put their faith in action while pursuing competitive returns—and we're deeply grateful for the trust investors and advisors have placed in Praxis," said Benjamin Bailey, Vice President of Investments.
