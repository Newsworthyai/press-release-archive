ALBANY, NY, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Golfers can traverse the course with effortless ease, focusing solely on their swing and the scenic fairways ahead. This is the refined experience that the NAVEE Electric Golf Push Cart delivers to both recreational enthusiasts and professional players. With the Birdie series, which launched on its official website earlier this month, NAVEE is introducing its core smart mobility solutions to the golf course for the first time. The company has also innovated the cart's drive system to adapt flexibly to the course's varied terrain, offering golfers an entirely new gameplay experience.  NAVEE Birdie Series Debuts at Salt Lake City Outdoor Trade Show in June Adding to the momentum, NAVEE's American team participated in North America's largest outdoor industry trade show from June 18 to 20, 2025, in Salt Lake City. The Birdie series, making its first public appearance there, drew crowds of onlookers. Its responsive remote control operation and impressive self-following feature wowed attendees, earning rave reviews across the board.  Why does the NAVEE Birdie 3X offer a completely new golfing experience?   Smart Auto-Follow—100% hands-free golfing.  The premium Birdie 3X model combines ultra-precise UWB technology with visual technology to automatically detect the golfer's speed and direction, providing different levels of assistance. With the remote control, you can easily make the cart turn or stop instantly. Additionally, golfers simply need to press a button to activate the auto-follow function, clip the remote control to their belt or back pocket, and it will begin following them throughout the entire round. This allows golfers to maintain a truly natural, uninterrupted walking rhythm from the first tee to the final putt.  Keeps up with all-day tournament play Birdie 3X is equipped with a high-efficiency 220Wh battery that intelligently manages power consumption to support long battery life. A single charge allows you to complete at least two full rounds of 18 holes (up to 36 holes). No need to worry about battery life, ensuring a continuous and enjoyable tournament experience.  Robust Dual - Motor Performance on All Terrains​ With dual independent rear motors, front swivel wheels, rear all - terrain wheels and an anti - roll wheel, the Birdie 3X delivers stable traction across all terrains. Whether it's traversing the undulating greens or maneuvering around carefully designed sand traps, the cart glides smoothly and can change directions with great sensitivity. This powerful and stable design ensures that golfers can move around the course with confidence, regardless of the ground conditions, enhancing the overall flow and enjoyment of the game.​  Fast Folding Compact 5.3 cu ft Storage Addressing the pain point of bulky storage in most electric golf carts, the NAVEE Birdie 3X features a three-fold design that can be easily folded to 68×56.5×38.4 cm with a single push of a button. Once placed in your trunk, it leaves enough space for clubs and other equipment. This compact and portable design makes it extremely convenient for golfers to transport their carts to and from the course, eliminating the headache of storage and transportation.  Smart APP Unlock More Personalized Features This high - end electric golf cart comes with the NAVEE - developed mobile app, which enables golfers to control their Birdie 3X directly from their smartphones (up to a distance of 150 meters). Through the app, users can adjust the cart's speed, check the battery level, keep track of their scores, and customize various settings. This level of customization allows golfers to tailor their golfing experience to their specific preferences, adding an extra layer of convenience and personalization to every round.​  Compact & Portable Design The Birdie3X features a reinforced frame that reliably supports heavy golf bags across multiple seasons.
