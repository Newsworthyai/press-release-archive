# Creative Biolabs Unveils Advanced Neuroscience Platforms to Accelerate Brain Research

SHIRLEY, NY, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The demand for translational neuroscience tools is climbing, given the rising global rates of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports more than 55 million persons now living with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's disease estimated to be the cause of up to 70% cases of dementia. To adapt to this demand for relevant research tools, Creative Biolabs has created a suite of specialized platforms that focus on key cellular mechanisms in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.  Schwann cells are pivotal to the peripheral nervous system, and more significantly for axonal regeneration and myelination. To support research in peripheral nervous system, Creative Biolabs has launched a complete Schwann Cell Assay platform that can isolate Schwann cells from 3 species (i.e. human, mouse, and rat). The platform supports a co-culture system using neurons, which allows scientists to assess important functional measures including neurotrophic factor secretion and the potential for myelination, both of which are fundamental to the area of regenerative medicine.  Meanwhile, within the central nervous system, microglia have the job of managing neural homeostasis. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are crucial for the response to neuroinflammation and in eradicating pathological protein aggregates.   Creative Biolabs also launched its microglia phagocytosis assay service, while we are in this area of research, which uses live-cell imaging and fluorescently labelled bioparticles, allowing researchers to visualize the microglial phagocytic function in real time. Also, the upcoming webinar on the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease will take place on September 18, 2025, at 10:00 AM EDT. If you're interested, please register in advance.  "We have also developed our preclinical/research assessment services for Alzhemier's disease models, with the capability to make both 2D and 3D platforms that represent key aspects of the disease, which includes amyloid deposition, tauopathy and neuroinflammation," said a scientist. The models can either exhibit familial or sporadic models of Alzheimer's disease, initiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a more rigorous context for drug screening or mechanistic studies.   "Our aim is straightforward: to give them the right resources to set neuroscience in motion," said a spokesperson from Creative Biolabs.
