# Galvanized steel pipes manufacturer: BaoLai Steel Group - one stop hot dipped galvanized steel pipe supplier and all processing service supplier

ALBANY, NY, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ --   Importance of galvanization Galvanization is a process that involves applying a protective coating of zinc to metals like steel or iron. The zinc coating offers protection against rust and corrosion, effectively increasing the durability or longevity of the metal.  Standardized processing procedures ensure product quality. Baolai Steel places utmost importance on product quality, implementing stringent requirements at every stage of production. From raw materials to meticulous control over each manufacturing step, our hot-dip galvanized steel pipes achieve nearly 100% customer satisfaction upon delivery.  Let's take a look at our galvanized production lines and discover how we create high-quality pipes that are resistant to corrosion, extreme environments and have a long service life.  Quality control: raw material Good raw materials are vital to the production and processing of goods, and BaoLai insists on controlling quality from the source.We choose the best raw material for your requirement of galvanizing processing. Our raw material of hot dip galvanizing is--zinc ingot with 99 percent zinc content.  Factory introduction: We have 5 galvanizing lines, including 3 blow-galvanizing lines and 2 hoist-galvanizing lines. Blow-galvanizing and hoist-galvanizing are two different processing methods.The difference between them is that blow-galvanizing is used for small sizes with little average zinc while the hoist-galvanizing is applied to large sizes with much average zinc content.Comparing the surfaces of the two galvanizing methods, the surface of a blow-galvanizing pipe will be smoother.  Processing: The overall hot dip galvanizing process is divided into a pre-treatment stage, a galvanizing stage and a post-treatment stage  (1) Pre-treatment stage: Acid Wash: Removing the rust of the bare pipes' surface. Water Wash: Removing the acid fluid. Galvanizing Auxiliary Fluid: Preventing oxidation and enhancing zinc adhesion.  (2) Galvanizing stage Lining up and Drying: Removing the water from the galvanizing auxiliary fluid. Hot-dip galvanizing: Immersing the pipes into zinc fluid to form a zinc layer.  (3) Post-treatment stage Cooling: Cooling the pipes and solidifying the zinc layer. Passivation: Avoiding oxidation and improving corrosion resistance. Water Washing and Drying: Removing the residual passivation solution. Inspection: We will test the finished products to ensure that it meets the customer's requirements.
