# Gullwing Reimagined: 2004 Mercedes SLK320 Tribute Channels the Spirit of the 300SL

FORT WORTH, TX, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An unmistakable silhouette with a modern heart, the 2004 Mercedes SLK320 "300SL Gullwing Tribute" is now showcased at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, captivating guests with its blend of timeless design and contemporary engineering. Part of the renowned Ron Sturgeon Collection, this unique build pays homage to one of the most iconic vehicles in automotive history—the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing.  Sharing its 2,400mm wheelbase with the original 300SL, the SLK320 underpinnings have been skillfully transformed to evoke the classic proportions and spirit of the legendary 1950s supercar. Signature upward-opening doors, complete with fixed windows, wheel-arch eyebrows, dual hood bulges, fender louvers with bright spears, pivot-out door handles, simulated roof vents, and chrome bumpers, deliver an unmistakable vintage aesthetic with a bespoke touch.  Power comes from a 3.2-liter M112 V6, a modern Mercedes power plant featuring sequential fuel injection, twin-plug ignition, and SOHC aluminum construction, factory-rated at 215 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. A 5G-Tronic five-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear wheels, delivering smooth, capable performance behind the wheel.  The chassis retains the R170 SLK's reliable dynamics, including servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, power steering, independent front suspension, and a multi-link rear setup for modern drivability.  Inside, the cockpit bridges past and present with beige loop carpeting, faux sill vents, a dash-mounted rear view mirror, and air conditioning routed through defroster and footwell vents. A body-color dashboard fascia houses VDO gauges, including a 160-mph speedometer, 7,000-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary readouts, while an ivory-colored tilt steering wheel eases entry and exit—just like the original Gullwing.  From its dramatic gullwing doors to its retro styling cues and modern comfort, this tribute car offers a unique take on Mercedes-Benz history—merging mid-century magic with 21st-century performance.  Now proudly on display at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, the SLK320 300SL Tribute offers a stunning visual and visceral experience for both classic car enthusiasts and modern collectors alike.
