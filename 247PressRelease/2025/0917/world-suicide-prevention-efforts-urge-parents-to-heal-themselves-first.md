# World Suicide Prevention Efforts Urge Parents to Heal Themselves First

TORONTO, ON, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With suicide now the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10–34, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, parents are searching for answers. The upcoming Tao Science Conference (Sept. 24–26, 2025) brings together 18 leading mental health experts to introduce an innovative approach: empowering parents to transform their own inner state as the most effective way to safeguard their children's mental wellness.  "A fish is as healthy as the fish tank," explains Winnie Chan Wang, L.Ac., Founder of Mindful Healing Heart and Heart Center LA. "If my tank is polluted by fear, grief, or reactivity, my children are swimming in that field. If my tank is peaceful, joyful, and resilient, that's the environment they grow up in. This simple truth gives every parent hope."  Winnie speaks from lived experience. After a painful divorce and a Mother's Day when her children refused to see her, she spiraled into grief and despair. When COVID struck soon after, her blood oxygen dropped dangerously low. "I was drowning," she recalls. "In that moment I decided to give up the victim story." Through Tao healing practices and light transmissions taught by Master Sha, her oxygen rebounded within minutes, and her life trajectory changed permanently.  Her story underscores a key insight shared by UCLA Professor Daniel Siegel in The Whole Brain Child: the brain's prefrontal cortex—the center of judgment and emotional regulation—does not fully mature until age 25. Until then, children rely heavily on mirror neurons, meaning they subconsciously mirror their parents' emotional states.  "If a parent is depressed, their child absorbs that reality. But if a parent cultivates peace and joy, even a struggling child can heal in that clean field," Winnie emphasizes.  The Tao Science Conference offers practical tools for parents who want to break cycles of trauma, depression, and anxiety. Unlike traditional therapies—often resisted by teenagers—the Tao approach equips parents directly, ensuring that healing ripples into the family.  "Parents may not always practice self-care," Winnie says, "but every parent would do anything to save their child. When you heal yourself, you transform the tank. And the fish—your children—can thrive."
