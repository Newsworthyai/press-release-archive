# Natural Health &amp; Wellness Innovator ArcticCollagen Targets Supplement Enjoyability with Citrus-Tasting Formulations

BOCA RATON, FL, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fresh off the heels of product appearances at the ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session in South Florida as well as inclusion in this year's Emmys Week in Los Angeles, California, holistic health and wellness leader ArcticCollagen is highlighting the importance of collagen in daily life through the continued nationwide expansion of their consumer-friendly strawberry and lemon flavored formula blending 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in once-a-day sachets.   "We can't even begin to describe how proud we are of how our national launch has unfolded," said ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist. "Our recent exposure across the industry has given us the opportunity to truly showcase the value collagen plays in everyday well-being, as well as prove how fun and easy staying healthy can be through the successful creation of a food-ready, honey-like formula that easily doubles as a sweet treat or snack on the go. We look forward to what all our upward momentum will bring."   Made from the sustainably sourced skin of wild caught, Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon, as well as hydrolyzed in Norway, ArcticCollagen is a type 1-rich collagen supplement that significantly boosts the body's natural levels, especially important as the body loses collagen with age. According to Mayo Clinic, at least 30% of the body's protein is made up of collagen, with it being primarily concentrated in bones, ligaments, tendons, skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. Type 1 in particular provides elasticity and strength for the body, including for nails, hair, bones, and skin (such as hydration and lessening wrinkles).   Unlike supplements of the past, which were often flavorless or chalky leading to consumer frustration, ArcticCollagen has been built from the ground up with convenience in mind. While easily added to common breakfast foods like cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt, the formula can also be taken on its own, with its packaging allowing for easy transportation. During the company's recent interview on The Donna Drake Show, President Winqvist displays how it can be eaten in seconds, all without mess.   "We were inspired to create ArcticCollagen after we saw how already-available supplements missed the mark," added Winqvist. "No consumer wants to feel bogged down by large or easily-spillable containers, and they also don't want to taste unnecessary bitterness while enjoying their day. We selected strawberry and lemon flavoring due to their inherent sweetness and ability to refresh, and we are thrilled to see so many enjoy the taste while replenishing essential protein."   According to Nutraceuticals World, "More than half (59%) of global consumers indicate that taste is influential when determining the value of health and wellness products, which is slightly more important than multifunctional benefits (57%) or even scientific evidence to support health claims (57%)."  ArcticCollagen is available for purchase on OneLavi.com, Medpaid Market, and Amazon.com, with a debut coming soon to Walmart.com. A pack of 14 single-use, tear-top sachets retails for $47.99.
