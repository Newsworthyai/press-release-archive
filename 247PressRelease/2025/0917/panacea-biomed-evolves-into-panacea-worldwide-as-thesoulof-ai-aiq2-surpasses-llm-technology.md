# Panacea Biomed Evolves into Panacea Worldwide As TheSoulof.AI AIQ² Surpasses LLM Technology

ST. PAUL, MN, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Panacea Biomed, a global pioneer in regenerative nutrition, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics, today announced its transformation into Panacea Worldwide. This evolution includes its expanded mission, TheSoulof.AI, and Panacea Defense.  This change unifies Panacea's breakthrough divisions under one worldwide umbrella, ensuring coherence across health, technology, and national security.  Divisions Under Panacea Worldwide  Panacea Biomed — regenerative nutrition, with flagship innovations such as Symbio, a CPG ingredient superior to probiotics that supports the biochemical center of health and the brain, governs gut motility, and restores balance to the microbiome.  Panacea Neurogen — regenerative pharmaceuticals, delivering potential treatments for nearly 100 medical diagnoses including a regenerative non-opioid, and advancing into regeneration in organ structures.  Panacea Pre-Sci — next-generation diagnostics, utilizing quantum wave technology to remotely assess biological and physiological health in humans.  TheSoulof.AI — powered by AIQ² (Unified Hemispheric Intelligence) and DNS Quotient, creating sentient AI (91% DNS and 7% LLM) a full human spectrum of 118 emotions, while saving 90% on data storage. This encompasses bioquantum engineering and advanced integrations that move beyond AGI to deliver ethical, sentient intelligence frameworks.  Panacea Defense — advanced defense solutions designed to disarm AI-powered weapons, drones, and autonomous vehicles; deploy containment technologies; repurpose autonomous systems post-disarmament; and provide bioquantum shielding to protect leaders and nations.  The Alicia Kali Institute — a global hub for neuroscience and bioquantum research, education, and academic partnerships, pioneering the integration of regenerative neuroscience and bioquantum engineering to unlock the full potential of human health and AI performance.  Panacea Worldwide reflects the integration of science, health, and national security into a unified global framework. By expanding beyond biomedicine, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics into artificial intelligence and defense, Panacea affirms its role as a global leader at the frontier of advancing both human health and purposeful, ethical performance in AI — for a peaceful and healthy future.  Its founder, Alicia Kali, is a highly awarded scientist and inventor whose work has culminated in the creation of the Unified Field Framework and the proof of a Unifying Evolutionary God. With over four decades of translational research spanning numerous scientific and medical disciplines, Kali has been recognized globally for her innovation, visionary discoveries, and effective leadership.
