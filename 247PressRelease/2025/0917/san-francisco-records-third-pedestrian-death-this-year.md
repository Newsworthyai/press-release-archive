# San Francisco Records Third Pedestrian Death This Year

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A 77-year-old woman was struck by a car at the intersection of 39th Avenue and Geary Boulevard earlier this month, marking the third such death in San Francisco in 2025. This isn't the first death at this intersection in recent years. In December 2020, a 68-year-old man was killed similarly as he was crossing the street. Specific information about the victim and her family has not yet been released out of consideration for her family.  Says Jodie Medeiros, executive director of Walk San Francisco, "We grieve the loss of life on our streets and are heartbroken for this woman's loved ones. We hold the victim and her loved ones in our thoughts."  Ms. Medeiros notes that this intersection is inherently dangerous. Both roads have four travel lanes, and the intersection is not guided by traffic lights or stop signs. Although there is a pedestrian crosswalk at each crossing, without marked signage for safety or right-of-way guidance, the chances of a pedestrian being struck by a car significantly increase. In fact, last year, 24 pedestrians were struck and killed by drivers in San Francisco.  Walk San Francisco issued a release about the deadly accident, urging the city to take action to better protect pedestrians. "Pedestrians must cross a long distance, and drivers often speed in this quieter section of Geary Boulevard despite a new 25 MPH speed limit."  As seasoned Santa Monica wrongful death lawyers, we can't help but observe that the failure of the City of San Francisco to install traffic guidance, in the form of traffic lights or stop signs, or even a pedestrian crossing signal for pedestrians to use, is negligent. The City has a duty to ensure that those afoot have access to safe crossings of busy, wide streets.
