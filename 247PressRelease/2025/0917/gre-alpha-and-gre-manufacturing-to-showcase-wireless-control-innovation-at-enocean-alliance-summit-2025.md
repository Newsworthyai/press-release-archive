# GRE Alpha and GRE Manufacturing to Showcase Wireless Control Innovation at EnOcean Alliance Summit 2025

FRANKFURT, GERMANY, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- GRE Alpha Electronics and GRE Manufacturing will participate in the EnOcean Alliance Summit 2025, taking place September 24-25 in Frankfurt, Germany. This marks a significant milestone in the companies' strategic expansion into the European market, following successful growth across North America and Asia.  Yoshihito Mori, Japan Country Manager for Sales & Marketing, will represent both companies at the summit, participating in expert panels and live product demonstrations.   The event will showcase the synergy between GRE Alpha's wireless control expertise and GRE Manufacturing's contract manufacturing capabilities, reinforcing their combined strength in delivering innovative building automation solutions.  Advanced Wireless Control Technology on Display  At the summit, GRE Alpha will demonstrate its latest EnOcean Wireless LED Dimming Module, which enables smooth, flicker-free dimming with energy harvesting wireless switches. The module supports multiple regional frequencies (902MHz NA, 928MHz JP, 868MHz EU/China) and is designed for seamless integration into both existing and new automation projects.  Complementing the dimming module, GRE Alpha will also showcase the ENO-LUNA universal energy harvesting wireless switch. Available in both European and US form factors, the ENO-LUNA utilizes an electro-dynamic energy transducer that converts rocker movement into electrical energy, powering maintenance-free Bluetooth Low Energy transmission. Every rocker press or release generates the energy needed to transmit button status, eliminating the need for batteries or external power sources while providing reliable wireless control.  The technology addresses key challenges in building automation by eliminating the need for additional control wiring, reducing installation complexity and associated costs while providing enhanced control flexibility through wireless connectivity.  Strategic Partnership Drives Innovation  The joint participation highlights the complementary strengths of both companies. GRE Alpha's expertise in LED power solutions and wireless control technology combines GRE Manufacturing's capabilities as a premier technology leader in contract manufacturing, including its Vietnam facility. This partnership enables comprehensive support for multinational customers from initial design through final delivery.  The companies' wireless control solutions support applications across architectural lighting, commercial installations, industrial environments, and smart building integration, offering architects, lighting designers, and OEMs complete flexibility in their project requirements.  Summit Engagement and Networking  During the two-day summit, attendees will experience industry panel discussions, technology showcases, and networking sessions focused on wireless control, energy harvesting technologies, and building automation innovations. GRE Alpha and GRE Manufacturing representatives will be available to discuss how their solutions can be customized for specific project requirements and regional market needs.  The EnOcean Alliance Summit serves as a vital platform for demonstrating cutting-edge innovations to B2B decision-makers, procurement managers, and OEMs seeking reliable, energy-efficient wireless solutions for intelligent building systems.
