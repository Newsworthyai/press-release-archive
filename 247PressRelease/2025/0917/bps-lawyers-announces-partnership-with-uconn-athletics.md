# BPS Lawyers Announces Partnership With UConn Athletics

EAST HAMPTON, CT, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Brown Paindiris & Scott (BPS Lawyers), an Glastonbury-based law firm, is excited to announce that they're now a proud full-service law partner of UConn Athletics. The firm looks forward to providing legal counsel and support for the university's athletics programs, while simultaneously hoping to foster student development and community engagement.  "We are happy to officially be a part of the support system for the Huskies and their student athletes," said firm Partner Nick Paindiris, who also happens to be a UConn graduate. "Whether it's helping the program navigate legal matters or setting up protections to reflect the needs of future generations, this partnership will allow us to make a meaningful impact."   Recent changes in NCAA transfer policies have significantly impacted student-athletes' academic and athletic trajectories. As of 2024, the NCAA eliminated restrictions on the number of times academically eligible student-athletes can transfer during their college careers. Athletes can now transfer multiple times without losing eligibility, provided they maintain good academic standing and meet progress-toward-degree requirements at their new institution. This shift offers greater flexibility but also introduces complications regarding credit transfer, eligibility, and academic progression.  Recent NCAA reforms have also granted student-athletes greater autonomy over their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), allowing them to engage in commercial activities without jeopardizing their eligibility.   As their full-service law partner, BPS Lawyers will assist UConn Athletics with a variety of legal services, including compliance support, contract reviews, general counsel services, and much more. Plus, the partnership could lead to future possible opportunities for student-athletes to consider pre-law pathways, scholarships, and mentorship programs.  The University of Connecticut (UConn) is a leading public research university, recognized for its diverse and rigorous academic programs and commitment to student success, while the UConn School of Law is a nationally recognized program that offers a range of degrees, certificates, and legal concentrations. It provides students with a comprehensive foundation in legal theory and practical experiences. The curriculum emphasizes experiential learning to prepare students for careers in litigation, public service, corporate law, and other areas. Multiple attorneys at BPS Lawyers are graduates.   "If this [partnership with UConn Athletics] somehow also helps inspire current student athletes to explore pre-law tracks and opportunities in our field, that'd also be a great result," said Ian Butler, another Partner at the firm. "The focus and discipline that athletes need to be successful in their sport translates pretty well to the legal field. Common undergraduate programs that can be great pre-law tracks include political science, history, economics, English, and philosophy. Basically anything that helps develop critical thinking, research, and communication skills."
