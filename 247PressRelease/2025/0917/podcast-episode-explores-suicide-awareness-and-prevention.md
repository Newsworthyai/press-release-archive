# Podcast Episode Explores Suicide Awareness and Prevention

OAKLAND, CA, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a new episode of her podcast, "Untethered: Healing the Pain of Sudden Death," psychologist Jennifer R. Levin speaks with a father who lost his son for September, National Suicide Prevention and Awareness Month.  Suicide Prevention and Awareness Month is a time when advocates, organizations, survivors, allies, and communities come together to raise awareness and promote prevention. The episode, "Saying I'm Fine Is Not Enough: An Interview With Bob O'Brien," was released Sept. 10, World Suicide Prevention Day.  "According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2023 more than 49,000 Americans died by suicide — an average of one person every 11 minutes — marking one of the highest totals ever recorded in the United States," Dr. Levin says. "Among young people, the numbers are so alarming. The CDC further reports that between the years 2007 and 2021, suicide rates among those aged 10 to 24 rose by 62%.  "According to the National Alliance for Mental Illness, suicide is now the second leading cause of death for ages 10 to 14, and the third leading cause of death for ages 15 to 24. These statistics are not just numbers. They represent lives, families, and communities forever changed."  In the episode, O'Brien shares the story of his son Aidan, who died in February. Aidan was a high-achieving senior at the University of Washington studying chemistry and biochemistry and researching solar cells, known for helping his fellow students succeed. Despite having a couple of quarters left before graduating, he had achieved the credits required and was awarded his degree posthumously after his death.  "He was an amazing young man and the kind of child any parent would've been proud of," O'Brien said. "And the reason I'm telling you all this is not to brag about his accomplishments, though we are proud of him, of course, but to try to convey that this was a guy who didn't clearly exhibit any of the warning signs that one might expect to see of an at-risk individual."  He encouraged friends and family members to "engage in a very deep way."  "This age group, folks now in their early twenties, in a world of social media and pandemics and deep political divisions, we actually have to take extra care to make sure they're okay," he said. "Not every time, but sometimes to ask twice how someone is doing and really go deep."  O'Brien and Dr. Levin also discussed the need to reduce stigma and encourage open dialogue about mental health and the devastating impact of suicide.  "Seeking help is such a brave act in this world," he said. "I think we should cheer people who are on that path."  If you or someone you love are experiencing suicidal thoughts or emotional distress, help is available: Dial or text 988 to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24/7.
