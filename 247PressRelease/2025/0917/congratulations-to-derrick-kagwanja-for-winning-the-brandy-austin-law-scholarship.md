# Congratulations to Derrick Kagwanja For Winning the Brandy Austin Law Scholarship

ARLINGTON, TX, September 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Congratulations to Derrick Kagwanja on receiving the Brand Austin Law Scholarship award. Derrick was selected out of hundreds of applicants for the $1,000 academic scholarship. Derrick's authentic commitment to social justice, a foundation of our selection process, made him a standout candidate. His deep engagement with contemporary legal issues including analyzing the Grants Pass homeless encampment ruling ( a recent Supreme Court case that addressed whether cities can punish people for sleeping or camping in public spaces when they have no other safe place to go).  Derrick's extensive volunteer work has given him a clear vision for using legal education to serve underrepresented communities. His focus on the needs of at-risk youth started at a young age, working as a volunteer with a free lunch summer program for inner-city youth in Kansas City while in high school, and later in college, volunteering at an elementary school to assist young boys learn the value of education through a series of interactive science experiments, speaking sessions, and outdoor play.  He balances a compassionate commitment to the next generation of young men with a commitment to academic excellence. He recently graduated from Rice University with a 3.67 GPA and looks forward to attending law school.  Congratulations to Derrick!
