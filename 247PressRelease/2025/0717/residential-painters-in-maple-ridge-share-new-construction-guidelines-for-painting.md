Misteps can lead to delays, rework, or added costs, so use this article as a guide for more seamless planning.  In construction, steps must be taken in a specific order to achieve clean and flawless finishing. Ideally, when it comes to residential house painting in Maple Ridge (or anywhere), paint goes on after rough construction and majocentraltems are in place – but before fixtures, flooring, or final cleanup.  Painting too early means potentially damaging freshly painted walls during the installation of cabinets, lights, or baseboards. Whereas waiting too long may leave painters struggling to work efficiently in finished spaces, resulting in delays and higher costs.  Hitting the right timeframe in residential painting results in a better-looking finish and a smoother workflow across all teams involved in the construction process.  Schedule Exterior Residential Painting In New Builds  Exterior painting for new construction depends heavily on weather, so project timing is crucial. The conditions that yield the best results are mild and dry, typically from spring through early fall in the Lower Mainland. Surfaces must be dry, and the temperature should be within the recommended range for the type of paint being used.  In most cases, exterior home painting happens once the structure is weather-tight and siding has been installed. That means the framing, sheathing, windows, and roofing should be complete. Painting over raw surfaces before they're protected or cured can lead to poor adhesion and premature wear.  It's essential to coordinate with professionals handling tasks such as landscaping and scaffolding to identify potential obstructions that could prevent clean and tidy work. If access to certain areas is restricted later, ensure the painters can access them first.  Interior Painting: What To Finish First  Schedule a residential painter in Maple Ridge as soon as the drywall is installed and finishing is complete: taping, mudding, and sanding are done and fully dry. It's best to wait until the new construction is enclosed and climate-controlled. Stable humidity and temperature levels help paint cure, reducing the risk of peeling or cracking over time.  Order of operations once drywall is up:  • Prime and paint the ceilings • Paint trim and doors (often after installation) • Paint the walls • Walkthrough and final inspection  Delays in construction projects happen all the time. If a residential painter shows up and another crew is still working in the same space, everyone loses time, potentially causing costs to skyrocket. Coordinate with the builder or general contractor to ensure smooth and uninterrupted timelines, allowing contractors to complete their work without interruption.  Remember paint choices and finishes should be selected well in advance. Waiting until the last minute to pick a colour can seem harmless, but it can delay a schedule by days or even weeks when colours are out of stock or need custom mixing.
