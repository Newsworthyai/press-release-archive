# Vancouver Scanning Services for Historic Artifacts

VANCOUVER, BC, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Over the decades of providing customized scanning services in Vancouver, the team at Micro Com Systems has been asked to scan a variety of interesting items, including one-of-a-kind artworks. Although nerve-shattering, Micro Com's professionals have always risen to the task, creating records of just about everything imaginable, short of stone tablets. For more, go to https://www.microcomsys.com/scanning-services-for-historic-museum-artifacts/  When it comes to scanning historic museum artifacts, some of the projects the team at Micro Com has successfully scanned include linen drawings from the 1800s, an expensive Italian scarf that would have made beautiful wallpaper, and many thousands of rare books.   Museum Artifacts - Scanning Services in Vancouver  Although the team at Micro Com has yet to scan a stone tablet, they have scanned marriage, birth and death records from almost 200 years ago, including newspapers from 1910 and computer printouts from the 1970s. While the oldest known stone records, discovered in the region of Iraq, date back to 3350-3000 BC, the glyphs still document recorded facts meant to benefit future generations. In essence, these were the first in an endless series of technologies used to capture data.   That established, it's reasonable to argue that extracting data from historical documents couldn't be that different from extracting and sharing information from the dawn of civilization?  Taking the premise a step further, people have always lived in an age of information. Even though digital scanners were still several thousand years in the making, the Mesopotamians would certainly have wanted their work archived (and backed up) if they had access to the technology, given the potential for wars, earthquakes, and volcanoes.   Micro Com Systems – Ready to Scan Just About Anything!  Although this has been a roundabout way of explaining what the team at Micro Com can do (and why it's a good idea), the team is available to assist with scanning services for all historic artifacts. Micro Com makes it possible to scan just about anything, extract all relevant metadata and return the images and original product safe and unharmed. After the scan process, all digitized files are provided on a convenient thumb drive.  Note–the average thumb drive weighs about 12 grams. When it comes to archival records, it's a lot easier to drop on your foot than a stone tablet.
