# Coastal Weather and the Need for Chimney Maintenance in North Vancouver

VANCOUVER, BC, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In Vancouver, constant exposure to moisture is a leading cause of chimney damage. Brick and mortar, the primary materials in most chimneys, are porous, meaning they absorb water. In North Vancouver, the repeated freeze-thaw cycles can cause trapped water to expand and contract, resulting in crumbling mortar, loose bricks, and cracks in the chimney structure that jeopardize both efficiency and safety.

Water penetration can lead to interior damage in the flue liner, allowing mould or mildew to form. Not only does this create structural vulnerabilities, but it can also compromise air quality inside the home. Since chimneys are mainly out of sight, these issues often go unnoticed until more extensive and costly repairs are needed.  The importance of regular inspection and timely chimney repair in North Vancouver  One of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is assuming the chimney is in good condition simply because it's not leaking or visibly damaged. However, with the North Shore's climate, problems can escalate quickly. A small crack can grow substantially by the next heavy rainfall. That's why professional chimney inspections, before and after winter, are crucial.  Inspections done by experienced professionals can identify early signs of deterioration, such as spalling bricks, eroded mortar joints, or flashing issues. Addressing these problems early can prevent more severe complications, such as chimney collapse, interior leaks, or inefficient heating.  Given the environmental stress that chimneys endure in North and West Vancouver, relying solely on DIY fixes or seasonal visual checks is insufficient.
