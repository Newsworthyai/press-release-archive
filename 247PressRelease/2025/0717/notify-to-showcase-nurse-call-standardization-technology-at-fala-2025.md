# Notify to Showcase Nurse Call Standardization Technology at FALA 2025

MINNETONKA, MN, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Notify, a healthcare technology company transforming communication in senior living communities, will attend the Florida Assisted Living Association (FALA) 2025 Annual Conference & Tradeshow at the Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek. Greg Robertson, SVP and General Manager, will represent Notify at the Senior Safety Technologies booth during the tradeshow July 29-30th.   Many senior living organizations manage 10-20 different nurse call systems across their communities. This fragmentation slows productivity and creates operational chaos. Notify's flagship Overlay software platform solves this by connecting to over 25 nurse call manufacturers, allowing communities to standardize fragmented systems without replacing existing hardware.   The healthcare communication platform enables complete standardization in just two hours, replaces pagers and walkie-talkies with smartphones over existing WiFi, and provides real-time analytics for operational insights. Senior care communities can detect patterns, optimize staffing, and make data-driven decisions that improve both the caregiver experience and resident outcomes.   Notify's participation aligns with FALA 2025's "RIPPLE EFFECT" theme, as the platform creates positive change by enabling caregivers to work more effectively while maintaining high care standards. The solution addresses critical staffing challenges by reducing caregiver burnout and improving response times through prioritized alerts and simplified communication.   "We're looking forward to meeting with senior living leaders at FALA and showing them how they can finally standardize their nurse call systems without ripping out existing hardware," said Robertson. "It's about giving operators real choices—they can keep their investments and still get the unified communication they need."   Notify offers risk-free 60-day pilot programs and will provide personalized demos at the event. Senior living professionals can connect with Robertson during the tradeshow or visit www.notifync.com for more information.  Notify is a SaaS-based nurse call and communication platform purpose-built for senior living. Its flagship solution, Notify Overlay, unifies alerts from more than 25 legacy nurse call systems into a single software platform with integrated analytics and staff communication. The Notify Communications App enables WiFi-based push-to-talk voice, text, and video across care teams—eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional radios. Together, these solutions help communities improve coordination, increase visibility, enhance operational efficiency, and support caregiver retention—without replacing existing infrastructure. Notify serves senior living communities nationwide with 24/7 U.S.-based support and risk-free pilot programs. For more information, visit www.notifync.com.
