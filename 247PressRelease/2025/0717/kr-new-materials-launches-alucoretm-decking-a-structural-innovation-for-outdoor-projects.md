# KR New Materials Launches AluCore™ Decking, a Structural Innovation for Outdoor Projects

XUANCHENG, CHINA, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KR New Materials Co., LTD (KR WPC), a trusted leader among composite decking manufacturers, proudly announces the launch of its latest innovation: KR AluCore™ Decking. This new product line is engineered to meet the structural and aesthetic demands of today's outdoor construction projects.  AluCore™ combines the natural look of wood plastic composite decking with the exceptional strength and stability of a reinforced aluminum core. The result is a decking product that outperforms traditional WPC in span, load capacity, and dimensional stability—ideal for commercial platforms, poolside installations, and high-traffic public spaces.  Reinforced Structure for Demanding Applications KR AluCore™ Decking delivers a host of technical advantages:  Extended Joist Span – With a high-strength aluminum interior, boards can span 60–80 cm without additional substructure reinforcement.  Near-Zero Thermal Expansion – The metal core resists temperature-induced warping or contraction, reducing unsightly gaps over time.  Enhanced Load-Bearing Capacity – While lighter than solid WPC boards, AluCore™ offers superior support for large-scale and load-heavy outdoor environments.  This innovation makes it an ideal solution for wholesale composite decking and composite wood fence projects worldwide.  Driven by Quality, Backed by Experience As a leading WPC composite decking manufacturer, KR WPC ensures every product is manufactured under strict quality control processes.
