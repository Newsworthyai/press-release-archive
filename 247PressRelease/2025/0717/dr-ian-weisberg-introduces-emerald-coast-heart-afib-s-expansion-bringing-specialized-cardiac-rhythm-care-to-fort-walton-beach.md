# Dr. Ian Weisberg Introduces Emerald Coast Heart &amp; AFib's Expansion: Bringing Specialized Cardiac Rhythm Care to Fort Walton Beach

FORT WALTON BEACH, FL, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Emerald Coast Heart & AFib, a groundbreaking cardiology practice devoted exclusively to the diagnosis and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, has announced its expansion into Fort Walton Beach. Founded by esteemed cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Ian Weisberg, the practice stands out as the region's only center focused entirely on managing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and related arrhythmias.  After a highly successful debut earlier this year in Crestview, Emerald Coast Heart & AFib is now extending its reach to meet the growing demand for expert arrhythmia care along Florida's Emerald Coast. The new location in Fort Walton Beach aims to enhance access to specialized treatment for communities across Northwest Florida, including Navarre, Milton, and surrounding areas.  Dr. Ian Weisberg, a fellowship-trained electrophysiologist from the University of Chicago, brings over a decade of specialized experience to the region. He is widely recognized for his leadership in advancing cardiac rhythm management programs and deploying next-generation therapies in hospital systems across the state. His clinical expertise includes performing over 300 AFib ablation procedures annually, making him a sought-after authority in the field.  "Many patients with heart rhythm conditions suffer unnecessarily due to misdiagnosis or lack of access to focused care," Dr. Ian Weisberg explained. "At Emerald Coast Heart & AFib, our goal is to deliver individualized, high-quality treatment using the most current technologies—without the need for patients to travel far from home."  The clinic's comprehensive range of services is tailored to those dealing with complex cardiac arrhythmias and includes: • Personalized AFib treatment plans • Advanced catheter ablation therapy • Pacemaker and defibrillator implantation • Left atrial appendage closure using the Watchman device • Implantable loop recorder placement and remote monitoring • Preventive care and lifestyle coaching to reduce stroke risk  What sets Emerald Coast Heart & AFib apart is its commitment to patient education, transparency, and empowerment. The clinic is not only a treatment center but a resource for helping individuals understand their cardiac conditions and confidently navigate their care options. This approach is complemented by Dr. Ian Weisberg's digital education platform, DrIanWeisberg.org, which provides accessible, evidence-based information about atrial fibrillation.  "We are passionate about demystifying electrophysiology," Dr. Ian Weisberg said. "Patients deserve to understand what's happening in their hearts and feel confident in the care they receive. Our mission is rooted in clarity, compassion, and clinical excellence."  Emerald Coast Heart & AFib is built on a "patients-first" model, emphasizing responsive care, in-depth consultations, and customized treatment pathways. With the addition of the Fort Walton Beach location, more residents will now benefit from this highly focused cardiac rhythm expertise.
