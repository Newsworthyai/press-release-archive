# Introducing Burleigh Pottery: A Storied British Ceramic Brand, Now Available to U.S. and Canadian Collectors

HILLSBOROUGH, NJ, July 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Made entirely by hand in Stoke-on-Trent, England, Burleigh pottery has been creating its signature tableware for more than 170 years using techniques that few other potteries still practice.  Each piece is crafted at Middleport Pottery, a Victorian factory still powered by the same traditions it was founded on. Burleigh remains the only pottery in the world to use the labor-intensive process of tissue transfer printing, which gives its intricate patterns their unmatched depth and character. From start to finish, every item is handled by skilled artisans who are continuing a rare and respected legacy.  "We don't chase trends - we create objects of lasting value that tell a story," says the Burleigh team. "There's a reason collectors, stylists, and tastemakers around the world seek out Burleigh. It's not just pottery - it's a piece of British history."  The brand's distinctive blue patterns have made it a favorite for generations. From the enduring popularity of Blue Calico to the recently revived Blue Prunus collection - based on an original 1913 archive design - Burleigh's blue tableware brings a sense of quiet luxury and cultural heritage to homes.  With its commitment to sustainable small-batch production and UK-based supply chain, Burleigh offers something rare in today's market: a connection to craft, place, and purpose. As consumers grow more conscious about how and where their goods are made, Burleigh's story resonates more than ever.
