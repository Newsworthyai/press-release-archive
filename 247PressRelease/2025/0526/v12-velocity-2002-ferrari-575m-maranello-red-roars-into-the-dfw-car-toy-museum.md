# V12 Velocity: 2002 Ferrari 575M Maranello Red Roars Into the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A true thoroughbred of the Ferrari lineage has arrived at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. Introducing the 2002 Ferrari 575M Maranello—an unapologetically bold expression of front-engine, rear-wheel-drive V12 performance, now proudly showcased as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  Finished in Ferrari's iconic red, this 575M is powered by a ferocious 5.7-liter quad-cam F133E V12 engine with 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management. From the factory, it delivers a staggering 508 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque—power that's channeled to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Ferrari's legendary Fiorano handling package ensures maximum control and road feel, turning every drive into a performance experience.  To elevate its precision, the 575M features Ferrari's Skyhook suspension system with adaptive dampers. Stopping power comes courtesy of yellow-finished Ferrari-branded calipers clamping down on cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners.  The cabin is just as refined as the performance. Inside, drivers are treated to automatic climate control, electric windows, a Kenwood head unit with a remote CD changer, rear luggage straps, and even a floor-mounted fire extinguisher for that extra track-ready flair. A leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel with column-mounted shift paddles fronts a 220-mph speedometer, a 7,600-rpm redline tachometer, and gauges monitoring oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer shows just 15,000 miles.  "The 575M Maranello captures everything we love about Ferrari—raw power, elegant design, and motorsport engineering you can feel in your fingertips," says Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "This car is more than fast—it's a rolling tribute to Ferrari's grand touring legacy."  Visitors can see this immaculate 575M up close—alongside over 200 classic, exotic, and rare vehicles—only at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where admission is free and automotive dreams come to life.
