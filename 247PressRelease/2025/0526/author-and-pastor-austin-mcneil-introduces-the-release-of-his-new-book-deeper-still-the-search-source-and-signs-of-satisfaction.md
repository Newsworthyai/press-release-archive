# Author and Pastor Austin McNeil Introduces the Release of His New Book "Deeper Still: The Search, Source, and Signs of Satisfaction"

MAGNOLIA, TX, May 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Where would you say satisfaction in life is found? Thousands of people, and especially those traversing young adulthood, are seeking answers to this question in all sorts of places. Yet, research shows the most common answers are also the most empty.   What if satisfaction in life isn't as elusive as it seems? What if someone could show you, definitively, the source and the signs of a truly satisfied life? You were made and created with a longing for fullness of life. And the One who created in you such desires is ready and able to fill them.   Serving as both a Global Gates Missions Catalyst and as Young Adult Pastor at Pleasantview Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, author Austin McNeil longs to see his generation, and all those who follow after, find lifelong satisfaction in knowing and growing in Christ. With a decade of experience serving in college ministries, Austin's prayer is that people will see how good, gracious, and satisfying Jesus is.   Within us may be deep longings for satisfaction and fulfillment. But, as we draw near to Him, Jesus proves to be a well deeper still. Don't settle for passing pleasures when complete satisfaction is available.  As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Austin's book will educate, support and inspire. "Deeper Still: The Search, Source, and Signs of Satisfaction" is a reminder that true satisfaction is contentment in life born from a fullness of life. Only Jesus can offer living water in a world of empty wells!  ABOUT LUCID BOOKS Lucid Books is an independent, hybrid publisher in the Houston area.
