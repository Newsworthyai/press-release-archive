# 85% of Clinicians Need Additional AI Training: Radixweb AI in Healthcare Report Reveals

FRISCO, TX, December 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Radixweb just announced the launch of its 2026 Global AI in Healthcare Report. One of the key takeaways is that over 85% of healthcare professionals feel they need more training to use AI effectively both in patient care and operations.   The finding highlighted a growing gap between rapid AI adoption and workforce readiness. This comes at a point when healthcare organizations are gearing up to move beyond pilots and embed AI into everyday workflows with 100% of surveyed healthcare organizations mentioning that they use AI in some form or the other.   This report is based on insights from over 750 professionals in the healthcare field, including doctors, top IT leaders in healthcare, and AI developers from around the world. It pulls together thousands of data points to give a detailed look at how AI is being utilized in healthcare, showing where it's really making an impact and what's holding it back from scaling up.   "Healthcare has clearly entered its AI-integrated phase," said Divyesh Patel, CEO of Radixweb. "What this report makes evident is that technology is no longer the limiting factor. Human readiness is. Clinicians recognize the value of AI, but without structured training and organizational support, that value cannot be fully realized."   AI Is Delivering Impact, But Readiness Is Lagging  According to the report, 50% of healthcare operations use AI for efficiency-driven workflows such as scheduling, RCM, documentation, and automation and are seeing a real impact. Both clinicians and IT leaders are seeing noticeable improvements in their workflows and patient care. This shows that AI is moving beyond just testing and becoming a key part of the operations.   However, the study also uncovers structural friction beneath this progress. While clinicians increasingly rely on AI tools, 85% still feel the need for additional training. This skill gap introduces risk at scale. More so in environments where AI recommendations directly influence patient care.   "AI maturity is rising faster than organizational maturity." said Dharmesh Acharya, COO of Radixweb. "We're seeing strong adoption, but scaling responsibly requires more than deployment. It requires investment in skills, governance, and trust across clinical and IT teams."   Integration and ROI Continue to Compound Adoption Challenges  Beyond training, the report identifies system integration and value realization as compounding challenges. Fragmented legacy systems and complex regulatory environments continue to limit AI's ability to move seamlessly across workflows, according to 66% of healthcare IT leaders.   Also, while any organizations have noted some early efficiency improvements, but it's interesting to see that fewer than half (42%) have realized significant returns just yet. This highlights a disconnect between the timing of investments and their impacts.   According to the report, 2026 is set to be a crucial year in the evolution of AI in healthcare, marking a transition from AI-assisted workflows to systems that are fully integrated with AI. The report also stresses that the future of this progress hinges on workforce skills, interoperable infrastructure, and governance models that can ensure clinical trust alongside operational growth.   Overview of the Report  The 2026 Global AI in Healthcare Report: A Playbook for HealthTech Leaders is a comprehensive study by Radixweb. It looks at how AI is being embraced and implemented in healthcare settings. The findings are based on insights gathered from over 750 clinicians, healthcare IT leaders, and AI developers from around the globe. The survey responses were kept anonymous and looked at as a whole, while some personal insights were shared with the participants' consent and credit.   The report goes beyond surface-level adoption trends and uncovers how AI is actually performing inside healthcare organizations worldwide. Key highlights include:   - 57% of clinicians report stronger clinical decision-making with AI   - 66% of healthcare IT leaders say system integration is the biggest adoption hurdle   - 43% of clinicians see early reductions in clinical errors from AI use   - LLMs lead healthcare AI development, used by 60% of developers   - 57% of developers rank privacy and security as their top AI concern   Get more statistics and complete findings in the 2026 Global AI in Healthcare Report.
