# 20% More Enterprises Are Choosing SharePoint Over OneDrive for Business Collaboration in 2025, According to Estimate

DALLAS, TX, March 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive are two of the most popular cloud document management platforms, which allow users to collaborate on documents in real-time. However, recent trends show that more and more businesses using Microsoft OneDrive are switching over to SharePoint, for more advanced and modern collaboration features.   Evolvous, one of the leading Microsoft Gold Consultants in Canada, estimates that around 20% more companies are making or planning to make the change in 2025, as compared to 2024. The company believes that the increased interest among businesses is because SharePoint brings a range of features which makes it attractive to businesses looking to become more efficient in 2025 and beyond.   Businesses are Looking to Leverage SharePoint Intranet to Boost Collaboration   While OneDrive does offer real-time collaborative document editing, SharePoint offers far more features that make it 'truly collaborative'.   According to Evolvous, one of the biggest draws of SharePoint is its intranet features. Glorya Cornelius Aldrin, Director Marketing at Evolvous said "Organizations can build a SharePoint intranet where individual SharePoint team sites are connected with each other and facilitate information sharing and collaboration".   SharePoint intranet sites allow team members of the same department to quickly find critical business documents and work on them together in real time. It also gives easy access to important company news and events. These features are not offered on OneDrive.   "Most of our clients who are looking for OneDrive to SharePoint migration, state that the opportunity to build a corporate intranet without significant investments, is one of the biggest reasons why they want to make the switch.", Cornelius Aldrin stated.   SharePoint Comes with More Advanced AI Features as Compared to OneDrive   Artificial Intelligence has changed the way is business is done. Today, companies are looking for ways to leverage the technology to enhance their productivity and gain a competitive edge in the market. Compared to OneDrive, SharePoint has more advanced AI features that make it more relevant to modern businesses.   For example, SharePoint comes with AI-powered search capabilities that make it faster and easier for users to find the right documents. This feature is especially useful for businesses who have a significantly high volume of data to be managed.   Another productive AI feature is the SharePoint Copilot. This is an AI assistant from Microsoft that makes it easier for business users to execute everyday tasks like making document summaries, creating a new document by combining two documents and a range of others. Users can simply enter plain text prompts, and the Copilot will execute the task.   SharePoint Makes it Easy to Meet Compliance Requirements   Most businesses, ranging from finance and healthcare to manufacturing and construction, need to follow strict compliance codes on data protection and privacy. While it is difficult to ensure compliance in OneDrive, SharePoint makes it easy.   SharePoint comes with built-in features like audit trails, role-based access control and others that make it easier different compliance codes like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO standards and others.   According to Glorya Cornelius Aldrin, this is what makes the SharePoint ideal for medium and large sized businesses. "Many of our clients wishing to migrate from OneDrive to SharePoint were struggling to meet the compliance requirements with their OneDrive system. After switching to Microsoft SharePoint, they found it much easier to meet compliance requirements and avoid the risk of penalties and other punitive actions", she added.   Evolvous is Making OneDrive to SharePoint Migration Easier   Identifying the demand from companies looking to switch from OneDrive to SharePoint, Evolvous has stated that they offer specialized OneDrive to SharePoint migration services to ease the transition.
