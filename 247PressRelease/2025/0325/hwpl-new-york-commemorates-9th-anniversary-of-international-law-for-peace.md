"There are things that humanity needs to keep to protect peace," said HWPL Chairman Lee. "If we don't work for it, who will? So even religions, we should all transcend different authorities and differences but work together as brothers and family for the shared goal of peace."  The HWPL event in New York was one of many commemoration events hosted around the world during the month of March. The main event took place in Cheongju, South Korea.
