# Congress Extends Medicare Telehealth Flexibilities Through September 30, 2025

WASHINGTON, DC, March 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a significant move to enhance healthcare accessibility, Congress has passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) that extends critical Medicare telehealth flexibilities through September 30, 2025. This extension ensures that millions of Americans, particularly those in rural and underserved communities, will continue to have access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable telehealth services.  The extended provisions include:  • Removal of Geographic and Originating Site Restrictions: Medicare beneficiaries can receive telehealth services irrespective of their location, eliminating previous geographic limitations.  • Expanded Practitioner Eligibility: A broader range of healthcare providers, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists, are authorized to offer telehealth services.  • Inclusion of Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics: These centers can continue to furnish telehealth services, bolstering care in underserved areas.  • Continuation of Audio-Only Telehealth Services: Patients without access to video-capable devices can still receive care through audio-only consultations.  • Delayed In-Person Requirements for Mental Health Services: The mandate for an in-person visit prior to telehealth mental health services has been postponed, facilitating uninterrupted access to mental health care.  These telehealth flexibilities were initially introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain healthcare access amidst unprecedented challenges. Their continued extension reflects bipartisan recognition of telehealth's vital role in modern healthcare delivery.  Kyle Zebley, Executive Director of ATA Action, expressed appreciation for the extension, stating, "We commend Congress for taking action to prevent a lapse in these vital telehealth flexibilities. While we would have preferred a longer extension, this step ensures uninterrupted access to telehealth services for patients and clinicians, as we continue working toward permanent solutions that reflect the needs of modern healthcare."  Jeff Scholtes, CEO of Millennium Sleep Lab, also commented on the extension, saying, "The continuation of Medicare's telehealth flexibilities is a pivotal step toward ensuring that patients nationwide have uninterrupted access to essential healthcare services. At Millennium Sleep Lab, we've witnessed firsthand how telehealth has transformed sleep medicine, allowing us to reach patients who might otherwise face barriers to care.
