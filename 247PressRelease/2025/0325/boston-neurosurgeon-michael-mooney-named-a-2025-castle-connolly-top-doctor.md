# Boston neurosurgeon Michael Mooney named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor

BOSTON, MA, March 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Michael A. Mooney, MD, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, the first year he has been honored with the prestigious Top Doctor designation. Only about 7 percent of the nation's licensed physicians are chosen each year as Castle Connolly Top Doctors for their specialties in their regions.  Dr. Mooney is a neurosurgeon with the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurosurgery and with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  Certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgeons, Dr. Mooney has special expertise in performing complex cranial and spine surgery.  He treats adults with both benign and cancerous brain and spine tumors. These include skull-base tumors, meningiomas, schwannomas, and gliomas, as well as metastases from primary cancer tumors.  Dr. Mooney surgically treats degenerative conditions of the spine as well, including cervical radiculopathy, cervical stenosis, disc herniation, lumbar radiculopathy, lumbar stenosis, myelopathy, and spondylolisthesis.  He performs a number of highly technical neurosurgical procedures, many with the use of minimally invasive techniques such as disc arthroplasty, endoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery. These procedures include artificial disc replacement, tumor excision, and spinal decompression and fusion operations.   Dr. Mooney sees self-referred patients as well as those referred by other providers.  "After a focused evaluation of a patient's history, symptoms, and imaging findings, they can expect a tailored discussion of management options including operative, non-operative, and minimally invasive techniques, when applicable," Dr. Mooney says.  Active in research, Dr. Mooney's interests include novel imaging techniques in skull-base surgery, resident education, and clinical trials related to brain and spine tumors.  He also serves in an administrative role evaluating value-based care and clinical care redesign efforts within Mass General Brigham.  In addition to his clinical, research, and administrative activities, Dr. Mooney serves as an Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School.  Top Doctors are nominated by peer physicians and selected by the physician-led Castle Connolly research team.  Dr. Mooney earned his medical degree — Alpha Omega Alpha, with academic distinction and honors in research — at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University.  He completed a seven-year neurosurgery residency at Barrow Neurological Institute, where he focused on complex cranial and spine surgery. He completed fellowship training in skull-base neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
