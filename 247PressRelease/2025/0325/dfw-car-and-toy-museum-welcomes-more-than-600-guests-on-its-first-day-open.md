# DFW Car and Toy Museum Welcomes More Than 600 Guests on Its First Day Open

FORT WORTH, TX, March 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ron Sturgeon started collecting toys in the 1980s and eventually was collecting full-size cars as well in the auto salvage business. Through the years, he amassed more than 3000 toys and several hundred cars. Originally located in Haltom City, he had outgrown his facility and located a facility 10 times as large at 2550 McMillan Parkway, Fort Worth 76137 for DFW Car and Toy Museum.  Sturgeon says, "we hated to leave Haltom City after 50 years, but the building we found was perfect, located right on I 35 with a large sign. We look forward to seeing thousands and thousands of people viewing the collection, and we are welcoming the Antique Toy Collectors of America on May 5, 2025, for their annual convention."  Sturgeon says, "it was a group effort to improve the 150,000 square foot facility, which was pretty much like it had been for the last 40 years. We painted, tiled, took out the shag carpet, refreshed just about everything on the building to make it look and function as new."  "Our official opening is April 1, 2025, and our grand opening is April 12th, with cars and coffee, which promises to be an even bigger event," Sturgeon added.
