# For Your New View At Home

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, April 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Finding your new home is exciting for many reasons. At Valencia by FivePoint, buyers discover that this community's thoughtful designs and planning deliver that excitement in many pleasing ways.  The homes are fresh, and designed to be easy to live in. Whether you pick a detached or attached home, a single-level or multi-level layout, a compact floorplan or a larger home, the basic design, or alternate layouts, you will see the design focus on functionality and convenience.   Why They Buy New—The households that call Valencia home include first-time homeowners, young and growing families and those who have purchased one or more homes in the past. Here are a few examples of their many reasons to buy here.  "In addition to inflated pricing, the pre-owned homes we looked at needed a lot of work, which equals more time, more money, more hassles," said first-time homeowners who purchased and moved here with their toddler son. "Here, everything is new and modern and works—the move-in ready choice made a lot more sense to us both, and since we both grew up in townhomes, we were happy to consider both attached and detached designs.  Stylish Floorplans Also Work Hard—Patios, decks and courtyards enhance outdoor living, entertaining and leisure. Interior social spaces are inviting, kitchens are sleek and high-function, retreats are luxurious, and flex spaces optimize versatility now and as a household changes over time.   Said one buyer with multiple needs, "I have always wanted to live in a home where I was the first owner, and this design works really well for us. It has room for a home office, and we have 4 bedrooms, with suite layouts upstairs and down and two full baths for the two upstairs bedrooms, so everyone can enjoy their privacy and comfort. Plus, our spaces for hosting family and friends are great!"   Another family offered these comments: "I think our builders were top notch and aesthetically made these homes with a lot of love and thought. Their floorplans were my favorites, and the attention to detail really stood out."  Design Does Makes A Difference—Easy circulation paths in the social spaces and pleasing outdoor views and access make everyday living and special occasions a pleasure. Secluded retreats and versatile flex spaces provide privacy and use options. And Valencia's well-designed new homes also reflect attention to light gain through the day and seasons.   Multiple functions vary by buyer and are addressed with design that anticipates a variety of needs. Said one: "We really wanted a home where the second floor is dedicated to us and our infant son, while the downstairs suite is ideal for guests."  An optional Next-Gen suite proved ideal for a family household, and the design they picked features a bedroom and bath, seating area, kitchenette, stacked washer/dryer and entries from hall and side yard. "Our parents live in India, and this suite makes it easy for them to enjoy extended stays! And our home's loft makes a perfect lounge, study or home office space. Having this flexible extra room is terrific."  Neighborly Surroundings—Then there is design for outdoors. Valencia's walkable environment invites outdoor enjoyment. Enriched by a pedestrian network and the diversity of households, the surroundings promote the friendly, neighborly dynamics of a small town.   As two buyers summed it up: "We came from Highland Park, after some friends drew us up this way, where we found Valencia. When we toured new homes, we saw people out and about with their kids and dog. That's a happy sign for us, our two young children and our dog."   Valencia's panoramic hillside site features vista views, and site planning weaves open spaces and diverse amenities to create a delightful indoor/outdoor community fabric, with optimized open space and protected trees and natural vegetation.   "You see beauty, not power lines, and it really feels like a nature setting," said a homeowner here. "The location and the quiet atmosphere make this an oasis."  Community Pleasures—Also by design, exceptional amenities are within easy walking distance of most homes. Seating niches, small parks and trails for pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals invite you to enjoy your community without driving.   Enticing lifestyle pleasures include award-winning Confluence Park, which combines outdoor expanses, a pool complex and easy connectivity to many other community points. Adventure Playground is tailored for kids and parents to enjoy.  Thus, a culture of connection highlights Valencia, and activity choices are as rich and varied as the homes, with great choices all year around, for homeowners, friends and new visitors. Holiday gatherings, Earth Day, gardening tutorials, a wide array of fun and learning for little ones, new model home openings, live music festivities—these and more are all here.  And every Sunday, the Valencia Farmers Market offers fresh produce and artisan fare to residents and visitors, with special demonstrations slated for selected Sundays. Managed by California Farm Direct Markets, the Sunday market draws from Valencia's surrounding areas for food products and ready to eat foods, with offerings sold by the growers.
