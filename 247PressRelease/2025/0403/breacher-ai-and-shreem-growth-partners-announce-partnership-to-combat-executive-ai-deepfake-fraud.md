# Breacher.ai and Shreem Growth Partners Announce Partnership to Combat Executive AI Deepfake Fraud

ORLANDO, FL AND LONDON, UK, April 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Breacher.ai, a leader in deepfake security simulation and training, today announced a strategic partnership with Shreem Growth Partners, a premier provider of executive-focused deepfake defense training. This collaboration creates the industry's first complete deepfake protection solution specifically designed for enterprise leadership teams facing the proliferation of AI impersonation threats against executives.  The partnership addresses a critical security gap: while 54% of social engineering attacks now specifically target executives (PhishLabs, 2024), most organizations lack specialized defenses for leadership-level deepfake threats.  "We experienced executive impersonation first-hand, and it exposed some gaps in how prepared we were. This solution helped us turn that incident into action by training our leadership team and strengthening our defences," said Anoop Nair, GM, Interpolitan Money.  "Executives face unique vulnerabilities that generic security training simply doesn't address," said Jason Thatcher, Founder of Breacher.ai. "Our partnership with Shreem delivers a comprehensive solution that protects both the individual executive and the entire organization from damaging AI impersonation attacks."  The joint offering combines Breacher.ai's advanced deepfake simulations with Shreem's executive briefing program, creating a three-part protection system:  Executive Briefing: A tailored session that equips leadership teams with strategies to protect their executive identity and establish organizational communication protocols Vulnerability Assessment: Custom deepfake simulation testing that identifies specific weaknesses in decision-making processes and verification protocols Awareness Training: Specialized deepfake education for employees across departments to create organization-wide protection  "Attackers who impersonate executives exploit the inherent trust associated with their familiarity and perceived authority", said Aarti Samani, founder of Shreem Growth Partners. "Our combined approach ensures organizations are aware of these threats and are actively protecting against them through practical protocols that work, regardless of how AI technology advances."  Recent data underscores the urgency of this partnership, with financial services firms losing an average of $603,000 per company to deepfake fraud in 2024 (Regula, 2024), with 60% of successful attacks exploiting information executives shared publicly.  The new solution is available immediately to enterprises in financial services, technology, government, legal, and other sectors where executive impersonation presents significant financial and reputational risk.
