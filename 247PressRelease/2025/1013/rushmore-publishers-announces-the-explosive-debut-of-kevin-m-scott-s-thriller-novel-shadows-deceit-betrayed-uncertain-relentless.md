CHICAGO, IL, October 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rushmore Publishers is proud to announce the release of Shadows & Deceit, the electrifying debut novel by Kevin M. Scott, a gripping new voice in modern thriller fiction. The book officially launches on October 20, 2025, and is now available for pre-order on Amazon.  Blending high-octane action with razor-edged suspense, Shadows & Deceit thrusts readers into a shadowy world where conspiracy, betrayal, and survival collide. With a style that recalls the intensity of Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, and Lee Child, Kevin M. Scott's first novel is already generating excitement among thriller enthusiasts and early reviewers.  A Thriller Where the Shadows Always Win The novel opens with a rooftop mission in Las Vegas gone fatally wrong, pulling black-ops leader Chuck Barnes into a world of poisoned serums, honey-traps, and assassins who strike without leaving a trace. As glittering hotel skylines give way to bleak desert landscapes, Barnes uncovers a deadly conspiracy centered around a single classified file: BlackRose.  But the conspiracy is only the beginning. A phantom enforcer known only as El Cucuy stalks Barnes at every turn, while the city's power brokers tighten their grip in the background. Forced to protect a whistleblower, defend the family he's barely holding together, and outwit killers who never miss, Barnes must face a truth so dangerous it could cost him everything.  With its cinematic pace and relentless suspense, Shadows & Deceit delivers an unforgettable reading experience where loyalty becomes a weapon, and survival is never guaranteed.  A Rising Author with a Global Perspective Kevin M. Scott, a U.S. Air Force veteran, brings discipline, intensity, and a global lens to his writing. His years of service shaped the authenticity of the military and covert operations depicted in Shadows & Deceit, grounding the fiction in realism while amplifying the stakes with imaginative twists. Scott's debut is more than just another thriller; it's the start of what promises to be a bold new series exploring the intersection of espionage, urban crime, and human resilience.
