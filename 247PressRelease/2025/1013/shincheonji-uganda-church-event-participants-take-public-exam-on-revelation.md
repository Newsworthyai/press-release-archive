# Shincheonji Uganda Church Event Participants Take Public Exam on Revelation

NEW YORK, NY, October 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- An event testing participants on their knowledge of the Bible's Book of Revelation was hosted by the Thomas Tribe of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.  A total of 200 people took part in the public Bible exam held at the Global Hotel in Kampala, Uganda, including 100 Shincheonji Church members and 100 local pastors. The 2-hour test included 100 questions.   "This test was not about competition," said the Shincheonji Uganda Church. "As Chairman Lee Man-hee proposed, it was designed to distinguish orthodoxy from heresy based on the words of Revelation."  Shincheonji Church Chairman Lee has often said that, "the Book of Revelation should be the standard of faith, and based on Revelation 22:18â€“19, tests like this help discern true doctrine from false."  One pastor who took the Bible exam said, "I've always considered Revelation to be a compass for faith, but I'm ashamed that I never properly learned it. I'll study again to better understand prophecy and fulfillment."  A Shincheonji Church member noted, "Unlike Shincheonji members, many pastors found the questions difficult and couldn't answer according to scripture. Now that even ordinary believers like me can easily understand Revelation, I hope this knowledge will spread and bring change throughout Uganda's Christian community."  Seven churches hoping to collaborate with the Shincheonji Uganda Church signed MOUs after the Bible test was completed. The church also notes that a number of denominations have recently decided to officially affiliate themselves with Shincheonji Church.  "Knowing the reality of Revelation is the first step to leading believers in truth," said a representative of the Shincheonji Uganda Church. "We hope more pastors will learn the Word and grow together."  Shincheonji Uganda Church has grown exponentially since it opened in 2015 with 27 members. Today, the church has over 8,400 members.
