# USCIS Accepting New DACA Applications Amid Ongoing Court Restrictions

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program continues to stand at the center of legal and political debate in the United States. In the latest development, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it is accepting new (initial) DACA applications once again—but under current court orders, it cannot process or approve those applications at this time.  This announcement comes as many applicants seek clarity on their options and turn to trusted legal professionals for help. Working with an experienced immigration lawyer Los Angeles, CA can provide much-needed insight into how these developments may affect both pending and future filings.  While this may sound like a small technical step, it signals a potentially significant turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding DACA and the government's intent to keep the program alive for so-called "Dreamers."  Background: The Legal Battle Over DACA  DACA was first established in 2012 to provide certain undocumented individuals who arrived in the U.S. as children with protection from deportation and the ability to obtain work authorization.  However, a series of court challenges—most notably in the Southern District of Texas (Judge Andrew Hanen) and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals—have found that DACA was not lawfully implemented.  In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit issued a decision striking down key portions of the Biden Administration's DACA regulation but stopped short of completely ending the program. The court sent the case back to Judge Hanen to determine how the program should operate moving forward.  The Current Status: Acceptance Without Adjudication  As of October 2025, USCIS confirms the following:  - Renewal applications for current and prior DACA recipients continue to be accepted and - processed nationwide. - Initial (first-time) applications are being accepted but placed on hold. - USCIS will receive and store the filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction is given. - Advance Parole (for travel) remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.  This "accept but don't process" approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved—even if applications are submitted.  For those pursuing long-term legal status or naturalization, consulting a knowledgeable citizenship lawyer Los Angeles, CA may help identify alternative immigration pathways while the courts continue to deliberate.  What Might Come Next  The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have asked the court to allow adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not be penalized by a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.  Legal analysts expect that whichever way the Texas court rules next, the case is likely to head back to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final decision on DACA's future in 2026.
