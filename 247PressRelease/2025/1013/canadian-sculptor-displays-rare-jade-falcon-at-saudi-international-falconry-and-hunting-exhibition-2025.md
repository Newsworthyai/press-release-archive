# Canadian Sculptor Displays Rare Jade Falcon at Saudi International Falconry and Hunting Exhibition 2025

RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA, October 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Canadian sculptor Tom Hjortholfson is making his debut in Saudi Arabia at the Saudi International Falconry and Hunting Exhibition 2025, presenting a stunning collection of sculptures that capture the elegance and majesty of falcons through detailed and expressive craftsmanship.  Hjortholfson said his work is inspired by the beauty of wildlife — his lifelong passion — and that his participation in the Riyadh exhibition marks an important milestone in his artistic journey.  He explained that his connection to the world of falcons began through fellow Canadian artist John Logon, who invited him to sculpt a falcon named "Nona." The experience, Hjortholfson said, was a defining moment that eventually led to his collaboration with the Saudi Falcons Club and his participation in this prestigious international event.  Among his works on display is a rare falcon sculpture carved from Canadian jade, valued at SR300,000. The piece weighs more than 45 kilograms and features intricate bronze detailing and agate-inlaid eyes. Another piece, crafted from solid bronze with an ivory-white finish, is valued at SR150,000. Each artwork, Hjortholfson noted, is limited to 12 editions worldwide, making every piece exclusive and collectible.  "The response has been wonderful," Hjortholfson said. "Visitors have shown great appreciation, even though these are high-value art pieces created from rare and luxurious materials. We believe that true collectors will recognize their artistic and emotional value."  The exhibition also features artisan pavilions showcasing handcrafted works and traditional pieces inspired by Saudi Arabia's landscapes, wildlife, and falconry heritage.  Organized by the Saudi Falcons Club, the Saudi International Falconry and Hunting Exhibition 2025 continues through Oct. 11 at the Riyadh Exhibition and Convention Center in Malham, north of the capital. The event brings together more than 1,300 exhibitors and brands from 45 countries, highlighting Saudi Arabia's commitment to preserving its heritage while promoting innovation, culture, and international exchange.
