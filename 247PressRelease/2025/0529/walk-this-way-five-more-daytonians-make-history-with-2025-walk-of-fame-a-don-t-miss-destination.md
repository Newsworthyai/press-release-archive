# WALK THIS WAY: FIVE MORE DAYTONIANS MAKE HISTORY WITH 2025 WALK OF FAME—A DON'T-MISS DESTINATION

DAYTON, OH, May 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a city known for taking flight, five more legendary names are landing in history. For nearly 30 years, the Dayton Region Walk of Fame has etched the names of inventors, artists, civic leaders, and cultural icons into the sidewalks of Dayton's historic Wright-Dunbar District. Now, five new names are joining the legacy.  2025 Inductees: Rob Lowe – Raised right here in Dayton, Rob Lowe's journey from local kid to Hollywood icon is a story of talent and perseverance. From The Outsiders to The West Wing, his career spans generations—and his roots in Dayton remind us that the biggest stars shine brightest when they never forget where they came from.  Vic Cassano Sr. – The king of Dayton-style pizza. With a thin crust, square-cut slice, and entrepreneurial spirit, Vic Cassano turned a grocery store side hustle into a regional empire. Cassano's Pizza King became the taste of a city and the foundation of a family legacy.  The Original Lakeside – Born and raised in Dayton, The Original Lakeside brought a unique funk and soul sound to the nation that still echoes today. With their hit "Fantastic Voyage," they captured the spirit of an era—and their vibrant energy, infectious grooves, and style continue to inspire fans and musicians alike.  The Levin Family – Rooted in a courageous journey from Eastern Europe to Dayton, the Levins transformed hardship into hope. Sam Levin, founder of the Levin Family Foundation, helped build a lasting legacy—one that continues today through family members like Karen Lorenz-Levin and Ryan Levin. Together, they uplift underserved communities across Montgomery County.  Jenell Ross – Breaking barriers and building legacy, Jenell Ross is the only second-generation African-American woman auto dealer in the country. As President of Bob Ross Auto Group and a passionate breast cancer advocate, she continues to accelerate change in Dayton and across the industry.  More Than a Sidewalk: A Living Landmark Stretching down West Third Street in the heart of the Wright-Dunbar District, the Dayton Region Walk of Fame isn't just a list of names—it's a walking tour through Dayton's legacy of invention, artistry, resilience, and heart. From the Wright Brothers and Paul Dunbar to local trailblazers and national legends, it's a place where past meets present, and where every brick tells a story.  Whether you're a lifelong Daytonian or just discovering the Gem City for the first time, the Walk of Fame is a reminder that greatness isn't always found in flashing lights—it's often right beneath your feet. The 2025 honorees will be formally recognized during a ceremony this fall. But why wait? Come take a stroll. Snap a photo. Learn something new. And walk where they walked.  About Wright Dunbar, Inc.
