BOCA RATON, FL, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ArcticCollagen, the industry-disrupting collagen supplement perfectly blending 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C for daily health and beauty, will be headed to California this September for Emmys Week in LA, being included in show-stopping celebrity swag bags for hundreds of entertainment leaders such as reality TV stars, soap opera stars, Emmy nominees, producers, directors, and more.   "Words cannot describe how excited we are to be part of this illustrious event," said ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist. "This year's Emmys Week will be bringing together some of the most recognizable icons in the entertainment industry, showcasing a world of luxury and beauty many of us have only dreamt of. Knowing our formula will be enjoyed by so many attendees warms our heart, and we can't wait to see ArcticCollagen make even more waves as we expand nationally."   Taking place September 11th in Beverly Hills, this year's Emmys Week swag bags, provided by CapAquarius Media through repeated partnership with "The Marianna Group," will include a myriad of luxury goods renowned for their quality, uniqueness, and impact gifted to all celebrity guests. ArcticCollagen will join the likes of top brands beloved by America's most prestigious industry. Available to consumers in both strawberry and lemon varieties, ArcticCollagen is a once-a-day, honey-like formula easily added to food or eaten on the go thanks to its travel-ready sachet design. Sustainably sourced from the skin of wild caught, Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon and hydrolyzed in Norway, ArcticCollagen supports the body's natural collagen levels while improving skin, hair, joint issues, and bone strength across the body.   In recent years, collagen supplements have begun reshaping the modern beauty industry, with their benefits for skin health and de-aging, along with consumer-friendly delivery, responsible for their popularity. According to Nutraceuticals World's coverage on the nearly $6.5 billion industry, "Collagen supplements tout many benefits, from increasing skin's hydration and elasticity to reducing signs of aging, like wrinkles. Some supplements claim to work by stimulating the body to produce collagen on its own, and other skin-improving proteins such as elastin and fibrillin. Collagen supplements can also work to prevent brittleness in hair and nails and may even stimulate growth."   Winqvist added, "As more American consumers realize the importance of collagen in their daily lives, we are grateful for the opportunity to provide an option that's convenient, safe, and delicious. Our inclusion in this year's Emmys swag bags represents our team's incredible momentum, and we look forward to what the future will bring."   ArcticCollagen is available for purchase on OneLavi.com, Medpaid Market, and Amazon.com, with a debut coming soon to Walmart.com. A pack of 14 single-use, tear-top sachets retails for $47.99.
