# As Gold Surges, La Jolla Jeweler Offers Guidance to San Diegans

SAN DIEGO, CA, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Gold prices have climbed to near record highs in 2025, sparking renewed interest among San Diegans looking to sell unwanted gold jewelry, coins, and heirlooms. For many families, the timing feels right to open their jewelry boxes and discover just how much value they may be holding.  Today's gold price hovers around $3,555 per ounce — up from about $2,692 this time last year and roughly $2,129 two years ago. This dramatic rise has made even modest pieces of gold jewelry significantly more valuable than they were just a year or two ago.  But where should you turn when considering a sale? According to Carl Blackburn, owner of C. Blackburn Jewelers in La Jolla, the answer is not always obvious.  "Gold is traded as a global commodity, so when prices surge like this, it creates opportunities for everyday people," Blackburn explained. "But the difference between selling to a pawn shop, mailing it to an online buyer, or working with an experienced estate jeweler can amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars."  A Trusted Local Resource  C. Blackburn Jewelers has earned a reputation as one of San Diego's most trusted gold buyers. The boutique jewelry store, which holds an A rating with the Better Business Bureau, specializes in evaluating not only the melt value of gold but also the potential resale and collectible value of fine jewelry.  Many buyers in San Diego focus strictly on gold weight, paying as little as 55% of the daily market value. In contrast, Blackburn often pays significantly more—typically 80–85% of gold's value—and offers premiums for estate jewelry, vintage designs, and pieces from luxury brands.  "An antique Edwardian ring or a Cartier bracelet isn't just gold," Blackburn noted. "It's history, artistry, and desirability. That's why we regularly pay well above melt value."  Helping Families Make Informed Decisions  Recent clients say that Blackburn's careful evaluation process sets him apart. One local customer who sold an inherited collection recalled how he explained each piece's quality and craftsmanship before making an offer. "He appreciated the sentimental value," she said, "and even had buyers in mind for several items. It wasn't just a transaction—it was personal."  For others, the motivation to sell comes down to timing. With gold prices peaking at levels not seen before, many families are choosing to turn long-forgotten jewelry into cash that can be used for education expenses, travel, or reinvestment.  What San Diegans Should Know  Blackburn encourages residents to educate themselves before selling their gold. A few simple steps include:  • Check the day's gold price – Online resources can give you a sense of current value.  • Know your karat – 10K, 14K, 18K, and higher-purity pieces have very different melt values.  • Consider gemstones and brand value – Diamonds and luxury designer names (like Tiffany & Co.) will increase worth beyond gold weight.  • Choose a reputable gold buyer – Look for local jewelers with established reputations who specialize in estate jewelry and have transparent practices.  A No-Pressure Approach  At C. Blackburn Jewelers, evaluations are free and come with no obligation to sell. Clients can walk in with scrap gold, like a broken gold chain, or an entire estate jewelry collection. Either way they'll leave with either a clear understanding of their items' value or immediate payment if they choose to sell.  "We're here to educate first," said Blackburn. "People deserve to know what they have and what their options are. If they decide to sell, great — they'll get paid on the spot. If not, at least they walk away informed."
