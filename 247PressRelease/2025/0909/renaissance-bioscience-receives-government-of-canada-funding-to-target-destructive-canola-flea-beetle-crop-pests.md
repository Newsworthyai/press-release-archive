# Renaissance BioScience Receives Government of Canada Funding to Target Destructive Canola Flea Beetle Crop Pests

VANCOUVER, BC, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renaissance BioScience Corp. is pleased to announce that it has received financial support from the Government of Canada, via the AgriScience Program – Projects Component, to accelerate the development of an innovative, environmentally friendly RNA interference (RNAi) biocontrol technology to protect canola crops from crucifer and striped flea beetles—two of the most damaging pests affecting this key global agricultural sector.  Part of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership (Sustainable CAP), the AgriScience Program funding will provide almost $830,000 to support this $1.65 million Renaissance project entitled "Eco-Friendly Precision: Innovation RNAi Encapsidation for Flea Beetle Control." This funding will be distributed over the next three years, with the project set to conclude in 2028.   Canola (also known as rapeseed) is the world's second-largest oilseed crop with global annual production of approximately 70 million tonnes. Canada leads the world in both production and export of canola, yielding approximately 20 million tonnes per year and contributing an estimated $44 billion to the Canadian national economy.   A precision targeted technology advance for pest biocontrol Renaissance's innovative solution leverages RNAi technology, a highly specific biocontrol method that "interferes" with specific genes unique to the pest, preventing reproduction and survival, without harming other species. To enhance this technology's effectiveness, the project will also look to improve the stability and potency of RNAi delivery and efficacy for faster more reliable results under real-world farming conditions.   This project aims to provide canola farmers with a cost-effective, sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides. Once developed and approved, this made-in-Canada biocontrol innovation will be commercially available to farmers worldwide, offering a powerful new tool to protect yields, cut costs, and align with the global shift toward eco-friendly agriculture.  "Making sure producers have access to cutting-edge pest control tools is key to maintaining Canada's leadership in sustainable, profitable agriculture and reducing crop losses. This made-in-Canada solution will protect canola yields, open new opportunities across the value chain, and support economic growth in our rural communities." - The Honourable Heath MacDonald, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food  About Renaissance BioScience Corp. Based in Vancouver, Canada, Renaissance is a global leading yeast bioengineering company developing innovative, market-ready, functional microorganisms that provide cost-effective solutions to address a broad range of environmental, health and industrial challenges in agriculture, animal and human health, food and beverage, and energy.
