# Cody Villalon, Attorney at Law, Urges Public to Know Their Rights in Richmond Criminal and Traffic Offense Situations

RICHMOND, VA, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Criminal defense attorney Cody Villalon is calling on Richmond-area residents to be aware of their constitutional rights when facing criminal or traffic charges. With more than 15 years of legal experience, over 1,000 cases defended, and more than 5,000 hours spent in court, Mr. Villalon has built his practice on the principles of compassion, dignity, and zealous advocacy.  In Virginia, individuals accused of crimes have the right to remain silent, the right to legal counsel, and the right to a fair trial. Yet many Richmond residents may not fully understand these protections until they are already under investigation or arrest. Mr. Villalon warns that exercising these rights from the very beginning can make the difference between a conviction and a successful defense. "The Commonwealth of Virginia has trained law enforcement officers, expert witnesses, and seasoned prosecutors prepared to oppose you," he explained. "That is why you need a defense attorney who will not be intimidated, who can level the playing field, and who genuinely cares about guiding you through such a difficult time."  Mr. Villalon represents clients accused of a wide range of offenses, including violent crimes, DUIs, burglary, domestic violence, and serious felony charges. He emphasizes that a criminal conviction can impact every aspect of life, including employment, education, family relationships, and personal freedom.  For Mr. Villalon, the work goes beyond legal defense. "No matter where people come from or what they are accused of doing, everyone deserves respect," he said. "Our rights only exist as long as people are willing to defend them. Being a defense attorney is not just a job to me, it is how I serve my community and fight for the type of world I want my own children to live in."  Clients choose Mr. Villalon because of his proven effectiveness at trial, honest and straightforward advice, skilled negotiation, and compassionate advocacy.
