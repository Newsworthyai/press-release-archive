# A Higher Calling: Eve Wilson of SpiritualHealers.com Invites the World to Remember Its Wholeness

ANN ARBOR, MI, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an age where outer noise often drowns inner knowing, Eve Wilson offers something rare: a calm and steady light. As the founder and guiding presence of SpiritualHealers.com, Eve is not just helping people heal—she is helping them remember who they are and why they came.  For over 30 years, Eve has walked with individuals, families, and communities through life's most personal and universal transformations. Her work is not a quick fix, nor is it about dramatic promises. It is rooted in compassion, precision, and a profound attunement to soul and spirit. Her gift is creating safe, sacred space—where growth, healing, and truth are not only possible, but inevitable.  "There is a place inside each of us that is whole, strong, and unbreakable," Eve says. "My role is not to lead you away from yourself, but to walk with you as you return home to that place—one step at a time."  Through her award-winning blog The Weekly Word, her long-standing spiritual mentorship programs, and now with new offerings on the horizon, Eve is expanding the reach of her voice and vision. Her upcoming projects include The First International Our World Ascension Event on October 18th, 2025, and the next series of six Healing & Ascension Monthlies beginning January 1, 2026—an inspiring way to begin the new year.  Eve's work is more than personal healing. It is a direct response to the changing nature of the world.  "We are in a time of accelerated growth," she explains. "The Earth and its people are evolving. My work supports those who are called to be a part of that—people who are already doing their inner work and are ready to help uplift the world around them."  Rather than speaking from a place of ego or spiritual performance, Eve brings gentleness, humor, and clarity to the process of spiritual growth. Her approach is both grounded and expansive. Through her classes, writings, and sessions, she offers not just insight—but a transmission of presence. Those who work with her often say they feel more seen, more calm, and more connected to their own inner strength.  SpiritualHealers.com is a reflection of this. It's not a marketing machine—it's a living resource. A home base for those seeking real growth and real guidance in a world that too often offers surface-level solutions. On the site, visitors will find tools for personal ascension, collective healing, and the rediscovery of sacred purpose.  At a time when so many are awakening to deeper truths, Eve's message is as steady as it is timely: You are not broken. You are becoming. And you don't have to do it alone.  As one reader of The Weekly Word wrote,   "It's like Eve is speaking directly to my soul. Her words remind me of who I really am—and who I want to be in this world."  In the months ahead, Eve will continue to teach, write, and guide—but now with a renewed sense of invitation. Those who are ready to live and lead from soul, who are committed to walking the path of healing with compassion and strength, are warmly welcomed to join her.  Because this is more than a message. It's a movement—rooted in love, guided by spirit, and built for the times we're living in.
