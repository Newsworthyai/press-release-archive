# Rev. Klingeisen's A Life of Giving Delivers Timely Message with New Episode, Prayer for Deliverance

MANITOWOC, WI, September 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Reverend Richard Klingeisen, host of the acclaimed podumentary series A Life of Giving, has released the program's latest episode, Prayer for Deliverance. This newest installment takes an unflinching look at the modern struggles facing individuals and families, particularly the rise of mental illness, cultural confusion, and the breakdown of moral order in today's society.  From crime to questions of identity, from the pressures of shifting cultural values to the ongoing erosion of faith in public life, A Life of Giving consistently addresses the issues that shape our world. With Prayer for Deliverance, Reverend Klingeisen offers not just commentary but also a path forward, showing how prayer and a return to lasting principles can provide clarity and strength.  "Too many today are overwhelmed by anxiety, despair, and division," Rev. Klingeisen explains. "This episode is about remembering that we are not powerless. Prayer gives us the strength to resist the deterioration around us, and it calls us back to the values that hold families and communities together."  Since its launch, A Life of Giving has been recognized for tackling difficult subjects with honesty and compassion. Each episode draws upon Rev. Klingeisen's decades of experience in ministry and healthcare, blending wisdom with direct engagement on issues ranging from mental health and family life to the moral decline of society.  Retired from full-time parish ministry yet still deeply engaged in schools, charities, and parish events, Rev. Klingeisen continues to embody the resilience and conviction he so often speaks about. Now in its seventh year, his podumentary series A Life of Giving has produced eight episodes and nearly 20 individual installments, establishing him as a foremost authority and trusted voice on the intersection of faith, mental health, and cultural challenges. His perspective bridges the practical realities of modern life with the enduring strength of faith, offering guidance that is both timely and timeless.  Prayer for Deliverance is available now for streaming on the official A Life of Giving website. Viewers are encouraged to watch, reflect, and share this important episode with family and community.
