FAYETTEVILLE, AR, March 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In "Edge of Resurrection", author James Sullivan introduces you to the intriguing world of Logan Brodie, a Seattle billionaire with a reputation for giving and not taking. When he meets the fiery and free-spirited Jade Murphy, his carefully constructed walls begin to crumble. He is still reeling from the death of his wife and in search for a new nanny for his two young daughters. As he struggles with the grief and pain of losing his wife, those closest to him worry about him as he has slipped into the darkness of his depression. He thought his passion, desire, the ability to love again died with his wife.  Jade Murphy is a young independent wildfire. She was working as a bartender in Las Vegas when she decided to have a change in scenery and move to Seattle where her best friend and college roommate lives. The second you meet Jade, her zest and fiery spirit draws you in. She is unapologetic and her self-reliance is beyond measure. Jade has always kept her shields up, and for years have not felt any man could be her equal. That was until she met Logan Brodie.  As Logan and Jade navigate their burgeoning relationship, they are faced with challenges which test their own beliefs and values. Despite their differences, they find themselves drawn to each other in ways they never thought possible.  But as their love blossoms, Logan struggles to let go of the past and find a way to live life again. He was raised never to take money for granted, yet he struggles with it because all the wealth in the world couldn't save his wife. This powerful man is the one who needs to be saved.  Will Logan and Jade be able to overcome the obstacles in their path, or will their love be lost forever in the shadows of their pasts?   Edge of Resurrection is a romantic and steamy tale of love, redemption, and the power of second chances. The main theme is emotional healing through strong, supportive relationships.  "I love the passion between Logan and Jade. I couldn't put the book down!" ~Anna Y.  James shares that the inspiration for this book started during a date night with his wife. After they put their kids to bed, they would have a romantic dinner in the living room followed by conversations about other couples they knew which play out as the plot and scenes in this book. Role playing was a consistent theme.   After listening to several romance audiobooks and reading other books in the genre to gain an understanding of how the flow works in a story, James knew he wanted to be completely different and as original as possible. Especially with the dialogue. He thought "whatever they're writing, DO THE OPPOSITE!!!"  "As an avid reader of romance and erotica, I was blown away with this one. The dialogue is original and I absolutely loved the compassion the characters have for each other. Logan and Jade are such an adorable couple and I'm dying to hear more from them." ~Samantha T.  James notes it took him 42 years to discover his true passion. He spent is professional life always telling himself, "Something will happen." Then he realized nothing happens unless you make it happen. Morgan Freeman landed his first major role at 52. Vera Wang designed her first dress at 40. Julia Child published her first cookbook at 39. Age is just a number. The only thing you're too old for is self-doubt, and he had enough of that.   James is working on a sequel to Edge of Resurrection, which has received several raving 5-star reviews. The new book, titled Edge of Atonement, will continue Logan and Jade's story as they move into the next chapter of their lives.  "I write because I have finally found something I truly enjoy…. I enjoy telling their (Logan and Jade) story… I am hooked."  As for a third book in the series, stay tuned for a book-based in Jade's hometown, Las Vegas.
