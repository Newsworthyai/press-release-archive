# Benefits of Hiring a Lawyer After a Car Accident if You've Been Injured

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO, March 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- If you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident in Missouri, you may be wondering if you should accept a settlement offer from insurance and not bother hiring an attorney. This could prove to be a costly mistake.  Insurance companies are out for profit, and they will do everything possible to deny or minimize claims, including trying to make it seem as if the accident was your fault. They know you want to get your money quickly and will likely make a lowball initial offer for far less than your case is worth.  "Missouri injury law is complicated, and the compensation you might receive from a car accident injury case can vary widely, but an experienced car accident lawyer knows the tactics insurance companies use and how to fight for the settlement you deserve," says Attorney Kelvin Birk of the Birk Law Firm. He explains some benefits of hiring a lawyer if you have been injured in a car accident.  •	Knowledge of Missouri Injury Laws – Missouri follows a "comparative fault" rule, meaning your compensation may be reduced if you're partially at fault. Additionally, under RSMo. §516.120, you have five years to file a lawsuit after an accident. •	Case Value Assessment – Your lawyer evaluates factors like injury severity, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering to ensure you seek fair compensation. •	Evidence Collection – Attorneys gather and preserve crucial evidence, such as accident reports, photos, witness statements, and expert testimony, to strengthen your case. •	Insurance Negotiations – Lawyers handle all communications with insurance companies and opposing attorneys, improving your chances of a fair settlement. Insurers take claims more seriously when legal representation is involved. •	Court Representation – If negotiations fail, your lawyer can present your case in court, managing depositions, expert testimony, and cross-examinations. •	Stress Relief – Handling legal complexities, your attorney allows you to focus on recovery while they work to secure the compensation you deserve.  "It is in your best interests to retain an experienced lawyer who knows the system and how to fight for your rights and the settlement you deserve," Birk concludes.
