# Charleston Paw Project Aims to Save Lives by Donating 150 Spay and Neuter Surgeries

NORTH CHARLESTON, SC, March 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Charleston Animal Society, Joye Law Firm, and Adams Outdoor are proud to announce their partnership to promote responsible pet ownership through the Charleston Paw Project Spay/Neuter Giveaway. As part of this initiative, Joye Law Firm is funding 150 spay/neuter certificates to help pet owners across the Lowcountry provide essential care for their furry family members.  Spaying and neutering are vital to reducing pet overpopulation, preventing animal homelessness, and improving the long-term health of pets. For 150 years, Charleston Animal Society has led the way in advocating for animal welfare, and Joye Law Firm is honored to support their ongoing mission. Adams Outdoor has graciously donated outdoor advertising as well as graphic design to support the endeavor.  "I'm proud to be part of this initiative to support responsible pet ownership," said Charleston Animal Society Board Member and Joye Law Firm Attorney William Asche. "Spaying and neutering are essential steps in preventing pet overpopulation and ensuring a better quality of life for animals in our community."  South Carolina pet owners are encouraged to enter for a chance to win a spay/neuter certificate and join us in celebrating 150 years of lifesaving work with Charleston Animal Society. The demand for spay/neuter surgeries is clear; more than 300 people entered their names for a free spay/neuter within the first five days of the Charleston Paw Project campaign.  Charleston Animal Society remains a leading advocate for animal welfare in the country, and this giveaway supports their mission to end unnecessary euthanasia and provide lifesaving care to animals in need.   "Many people don't realize that spaying or neutering your pet also saves lives," said Charleston Animal Society Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Aldwin Roman, CAWA. "When an animal is spayed or neutered, we prevent future unwanted litters – and that saves thousands of lives."  The Charleston Paw Project will select 150 winners in three waves on May 20, August 26, and October 21. Each winner will receive a spay/neuter certificate redeemable at Charleston Animal Society's Spay & Neuter Clinic, which also includes a one-year rabies vaccine for their pet.  To enter, visit CharlestonPawProject.com and complete the entry form with your contact information and pet details. Terms and conditions apply and can be found at the link above. Together, we can create a healthier, happier future for pets in our community.
