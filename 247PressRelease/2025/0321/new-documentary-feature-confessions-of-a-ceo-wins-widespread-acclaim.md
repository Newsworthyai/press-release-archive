# New Documentary Feature 'Confessions of a CEO' Wins Widespread Acclaim

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The new documentary feature film "Confessions of a CEO: My Life in an Out of Balance World" has been winning accolades since its February release.  "Confessions of a CEO" is a crackling critique of corporate America told through the true story of Tom Gegax, a once-toxic CEO who transformed from a profits-over-people, philandering executive to an unorthodox leader, populist messenger, and mentor to American influencers from Al Gore to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Featuring notable figures like Deepak Chopra, the controversial RFK Jr., and Blue Zones founder Dan Buettner, it's a story of growth, redemption, and the impact of self-awareness on leadership and life. "Confessions of a CEO" has received rave reviews, including:  •	"An epically amazing documentary." — Darin Leach, technology executive •	"It plays like a thriller." — Adam Reider, television producer ("Survivor," "The Bachelor") •	"I am still feeling the buzz." — Daniel Waters, Screenwriter ("Heathers," "Batman Returns") •	"Everyone raved. Thanks for making me part of it." — Dan Buettner, founder, Blue Zones  Buettner, an award-winning journalist and producer who won three 3 Daytime Emmy Awards for his hit documentary series "Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones," is among thought leaders in business, medicine, food, psychology, and the environment shaped by Gegax's influence and mentorship.  Six-time Emmy Award nominee Eric Gardner served as co-writer, producer, director, and editor of the film. Distributed by Virgil Films ("I Am Chris Farley"), "Confessions of a CEO" premiered in select theaters in January and was released on Feb. 11 on platforms including Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV. The film and Gegax have been profiled in publications including, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Minnesota Star Tribune, Modern Tire Dealer and The Madison (Indiana) Courier, which calls it "a sharp and compelling examination of corporate America."  The film explores the profound impact corporate America has on employees and consumers as a positive source of jobs and innovation, while shedding light on its many irresponsible practices.  Gegax, who serves as chairman of The Gramercy Fund, a socially responsible venture capital fund, highlights the dangerous shift in corporate America to prioritizing profits over people. This is exemplified by the stark rise in CEO pay disparity with their average worker — from a 20-1 ratio in the 1970s to an astounding 350-1 today.  As an insider who once shared this profit-driven mindset, Gegax's personal and professional transformation serves as the narrative thread of the documentary. His journey from a sharp rise to precipitous fall illustrates the transformational principles that inspired profound success within his organization, prompting him to share his insights with corporate leaders and their employees nationwide. His mission, conveyed through his books, keynote addresses, and leadership of The Gramercy Fund, now finds a powerful new medium in "Confessions of a CEO."  As chairman of The Gramercy Fund, a venture capital fund that has invested in over 100 companies that are doing good things in the world, Tom is a leader in socially responsible investment, conscious leadership, and corporate responsibility. His personal transformation and commitment to ethical business practices have influenced countless leaders and organizations. Through his books — "Winning in the Game of Life" (Random House) and "The Big Book of Small Business" (Harper Collins) — and his keynote addresses and workshops, Tom shares his invaluable insights with a wide audience, inspiring others to prioritize integrity and balance in their personal and professional lives. His mission is inspiring corporate leaders and their employees to become better versions of themselves in their personal and professional lives.
