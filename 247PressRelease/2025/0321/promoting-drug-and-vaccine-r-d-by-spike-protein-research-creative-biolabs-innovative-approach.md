# Promoting Drug and Vaccine R&D by Spike Protein Research: Creative Biolabs' Innovative Approach

SHIRLEY, NY, March 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  Drug Design Based on Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 The SARS-CoV-2 virus invades host cells through its S protein by binding to the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, developing drugs and antibodies against the spike protein is the most important focus for treatment of COVID-19. Creative Biolabs has developed a number of advanced experimental models and analytical technologies aimed at supporting COVID-19 drug and vaccine development.  Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay: Fast and Efficient Way to Test Antiviral Drugs To test the efficacy of candidate antibodies or antiviral agents, Creative Biolabs developed an assay based on pseudovirus neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Pseudoviruses are genetically engineered viruses that have the ability to infect cells but cannot replicate, allowing researchers to test if the antibodies or drugs can prevent the viruses from entering the cells.  An expert from Creative Biolabs said, "In the traditional virus neutralization tests, live viruses have to be handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. With the pseudovirus system, it is possible to conduct the experiments in a normal lab, which is less dangerous and more practical. Our optimized model of the pseudovirus represents the most accurate version of the interaction between the spike protein and ACE 2. Therefore, it has greatly simplified and enhanced the quality of drug tests."  Stable Cell Lines Expressing Spike Protein Stable cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are essential for drug screening and vaccine development. Creative Biolabs developed these cell lines for the stable expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein so that they can be used in: • Vaccine Development: As antigen expression vectors during the vaccine production process. • Neutralizing Antibody Screening: Determining the ability of the antibodies to bind to the spike protein. • Drug Research: Testing small molecules designed to block viral infection for biologic activity.  "The establishment of stable cell lines greatly improves reliability of experiments and reduces the time needed for each individual study. Our cell lines can be used for extensive screening of antibodies, studies of receptor binding, and evaluation of drugs."  SARS-CoV-2 VLP Vaccine Platform Based on MVA Vector As the SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to arise, the development of vaccines must ensure efficacy, safety, and flexibility to new strains. Creative Biolabs has integrated its advanced virus-like particles (VLP) vaccine technology with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector to create the SARS-CoV-2 VLP vaccine platform.  The vaccine platform produces in vivo virus-like particles containing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of vaccination. VLPs are capable of inducing a strong immune response because they have external structures of real viruses. Since VLPs do not carry a viral genome, there is no risk of infection.   "This platform unites the immunogenicity of VLPs with the safety of MVA, making research on the vaccine development more efficacious and versatile. Our other specialties in protein expression, pseudovirus assays, and cellular immune analysis enable us to comprehensively aid in candidate screening and immune evaluation," the expert commented.
