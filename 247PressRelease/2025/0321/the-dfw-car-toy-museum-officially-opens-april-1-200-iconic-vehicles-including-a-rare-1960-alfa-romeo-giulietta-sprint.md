Featuring over 200+ remarkable vehicles, the collection showcases some of the rarest and most beautifully restored automobilesâ€”including the stunning 1960 Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint 5-Speed from the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  A true European gem, this left-hand-drive 1960 Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint was originally delivered to the UK before making its way to Switzerland in the 1990s. Every inch of this vehicle reflects Alfa Romeo's racing DNA, from the wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel to the carefully curated Smiths and Veglia instrumentation that keeps the driver connected to its heartbeat. A fire extinguisher is mounted behind the passenger seat, while a trunk-mounted battery features a dedicated cutoff switch, reinforcing its performance-oriented build.  Under the hood, this Giulietta Sprint has been meticulously engineered for enhanced performance. The replacement twin-cam inline-four, sourced from a 105 series GT 1300 Junior, was overhauled and enlarged to 1.4L in 2021 by Besic Motorsports of Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Featuring Wiseco pistons, Carillo rods, a ported and polished cylinder head, a custom oil pump, and a replacement oil pan and water pump, this high-performance powerplant is designed for speed and precision. Twin Weber 40 DCOE carburetors ensure optimal fuel delivery, while a custom Pace Products aluminum radiator with an integrated oil cooler keeps the engine running at peak performance. The power is seamlessly transferred to the rear wheels through a replacement five-speed manual transmission, ensuring an exhilarating driving experience.
