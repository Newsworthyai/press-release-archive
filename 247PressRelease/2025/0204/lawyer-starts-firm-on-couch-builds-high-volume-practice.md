# Lawyer Starts Firm on Couch - Builds High-Volume Practice

ST. LOUIS, MO, February 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When Steve Bardol graduated from law school in 2010, the country was still suffering from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Legal jobs were few and far between as many large firms had been hemorrhaging attorneys and small firms were in no position to hire.   With very little experience, Steve started a firm from his low-budget apartment. He met with his first client, a child custody case, on the couch in his apartment. That case turned into a 3-day trial and launched Steve's practice - Bardol Law Firm.  While the firm eventually moved into traditional office space and added employees and marketing, Steve fondly remembers where the firm began. Here are his tips for starting a business from anywhere:  Leverage Technology - AI is here to stay whether we like it or not. Lawyers and other business owners can use AI for numerous tasks in their businesses. AI can help systematize processes, write marketing content or detail hiring procedures. If AI is overwhelming, then start smaller. Practice management software or billing software would be a welcome addition to many businesses.   Forget Stereotypes - Certain types of businesses are traditionally supposed to be run in a specific fashion. For example, lawyers and law firms are very traditional. Many firms still run out of brick-and-mortar buildings. Many lawyers view themselves as professionals who are above-marketing themselves. The world has changed even for the most conservative industries. All industries should embrace flexible work environments and the creative marketing available to them.   Educate Yourself on SEO - Marketing is online, almost exclusively. Check out the statistics for billboards or magazine ads and you will find that your money will be much better spent online. That being said, anyone running a business must educate themselves on SEO. If you can embrace online marketing, you can easily gain an advantage over your competition. And the more educated you are, the better you can spend your resources on that online marketing.  Bardol Law Firm, LLC, is located at 34 North Gore Ave., Suite 203, St. Louis, Missouri 63119.
