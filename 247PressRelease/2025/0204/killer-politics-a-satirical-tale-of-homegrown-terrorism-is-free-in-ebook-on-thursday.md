# "Killer Politics: A Satirical Tale of Homegrown Terrorism" is Free in eBook on Thursday

PORTLAND, OR, February 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Killer Politics" - Book 2 in The Anti-Hero Rebellions series - will be available Thursday, Feb. 6 in eBook on Amazon, author Norman Brewer announced.   A Trump-like president inspires a white supremacist to launch attacks on innocents in a ruthless bid to incite civil war - and defend the "American way of life."  Hoss, the supremacist, teams up with a "Most Wanted" terrorist to attack a rock concert, contaminate the food supply, destroy a reservoir and flood homeowners living downstream. People die. Fear mounts. A rogue FBI agent is in hot pursuit.  "I found myself transported into the scenes with the main character, Stickman," wrote a reviewer for NetGalley. "The tie-in with the current political situation in our country, and the President (named Tower in this case, get it?) made the book feel even more believable. The author's description of "Tower" and his antics was spot on! And the ending! It's been a while since I have been surprised. This one did it!"   While works of fiction, The Anti-Hero Rebellions capture story lines that could jump out of today's partisan politics. All three domestic terrorism books are Amazon bestsellers.   Book 1 is "Blending In: A Tale of Homegrown Terrorism." Stickman and Maple could be your next-door neighbors, except they foment political polarization and rebellion in their quest to upend government. "Killer Politics" can be read as the sequel to "Blending In" or as a standalone book.   Book 3 is "January 6: A Novel." Democracy is under siege when the President's rally morphs into a mob and storms the Capitol. Terrorists in their midst launch attacks nationwide. The President weighs declaring martial law to restore order - and justify refusing to leave office.  Brewer worked for The Des Moines Register and Tribune and for Gannett News Service in Washington, D.C., covering Congress, the White House, and pursuing award-winning investigations. He was also Director of Employee Communications at the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. He can be reached at bbyb1@outlook.com.
