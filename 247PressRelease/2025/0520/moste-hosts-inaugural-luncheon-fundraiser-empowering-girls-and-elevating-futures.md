# MOSTe Hosts Inaugural Luncheon Fundraiser: "Empowering Girls and Elevating Futures."

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MOSTe (Motivating Our Students Through Experience), a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization focused on long-term mentoring and academic support for girls from under-resourced communities, will hold its first luncheon fundraiser, Empowering Girls and Elevating Futures, on Saturday, June 7, 2025, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at San Antonio Winery in Downtown Los Angeles.  The 2025 event replaces the MOSTe's traditional Lanterns gala and will highlight its work across its 39-year history. The program will include lunch, student and alumnae speakers, and updates on MOSTe's current programming and community impact.  Earlier this month, MOSTe honored its graduating high school seniors at its annual Culmination Ceremony, marking a significant milestone for scholars as they prepare to enter college and their new professional journeys. The Empowering Girls and Elevating Futures luncheon continues that celebration, inviting supporters, corporate partners, and the broader community to invest in the future of young women across Los Angeles County.  "We've seen our scholars become lawyers, doctors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, because someone believed in them," said Nicole Fisher, Executive Director of MOSTe. "This luncheon is about investing in what's possible when that belief is backed by action."  In 2024–2025, MOSTe introduced redesigned academic and leadership programs, including: •	MOSTe Leadership Academy •	MOSTe College Readiness •	MOSTe Mentorship & Career Pathways  These initiatives are made possible through the generosity of donors and the success of fundraising efforts like the annual luncheon. Funded programming supports academic achievement, community service, and the growth of career and life skills. Scholars participate in volunteer projects with organizations such as Heal the Bay and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and participate in career readiness, financial literacy, and college planning workshops.   During the current academic year, the organization experienced a 38% increase in scholar enrollment and serves students in 19 communities across Los Angeles County. All enrolled scholars come from low to moderate-income households, with 62.2% living below the poverty line. Continued financial support allows MOSTe to expand its reach and deepen its impact, especially as it grows.
