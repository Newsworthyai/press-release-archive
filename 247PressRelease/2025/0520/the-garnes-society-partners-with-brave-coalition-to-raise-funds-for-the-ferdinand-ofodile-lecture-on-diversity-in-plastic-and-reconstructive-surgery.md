ORANGE, CA, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Arthur L. Garnes Society (The Garnes Society), a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing inclusive excellence in plastic and reconstructive surgery, is pleased to announce a new partnership with the Breast Restoration and Advocacy Education (BRAVE) Coalition to support the endowment of the Ferdinand Ofodile Lecture on Diversity in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.   Building on The Garnes Society's previous collaboration with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) to establish the lecture, this partnership with BRAVE will amplify fundraising efforts to reach the $100,000 endowment goal. The endowment will ensure the ongoing presence of this vital lecture at PSTM, providing a continuous platform for critical conversations surrounding inclusive excellence within the specialty. Funds raised will directly support speaker fees, travel expenses, and program development for future lectures.  "We are incredibly excited to join forces with the BRAVE Coalition in our mission to endow the Ferdinand Ofodile Lecture," said Dr. Paris Butler, founding member of The Garnes Society. "BRAVE's dedication to patient advocacy and education aligns perfectly with our commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable environment within plastic and reconstructive surgery. Together, we can significantly impact the future of our field by ensuring these crucial dialogues continue for years to come."  The Ferdinand Ofodile Lecture honors the distinguished legacy of Dr. Ferdinand Ofodile, a Clinical Professor Emeritus and Special Lecturer in Surgery at Columbia University, and former Chief of Plastic Surgery at Harlem Hospital. This Hospital has the distinction of having the nation's first plastic and reconstructive surgery training program at a predominantly Black hospital. Dr. Ofodile was a protégé of Dr. Arthur L. Garnes, the namesake of The Garnes Society.  "BRAVE is honored to partner with The Garnes Society on this important initiative," said Dr. Christien Grogan, Founder of BRAVE Coalition. "Promoting inclusive excellence and addressing disparities in healthcare are central to our mission, as we have done extensive work with Dr. Robert Galiano and Dr. Tokoya Williams on this area at Northwestern University. We believe the Ferdinand Ofodile Lecture will be instrumental in fostering a more inclusive and representative plastic surgery community, ultimately benefiting patients from all backgrounds."  The Garnes Society and BRAVE Coalition invite individuals and organizations committed to inclusive excellence in medicine to contribute to this landmark initiative.
