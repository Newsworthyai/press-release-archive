# Creative Biolabs Strikes "May Double Play": Conference Coup & Bispecific Breakthrough Unveiled

SHIRLEY, NY, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nexus Conference Home Run at Booth #13  The company stole the show with its bispecific antibody platform—the secret sauce behind a large portion of its pharma partnerships last year. Crowds flocked to see live demos of their bispecific antibody (bsAb) development pipeline, which one collaborator jokingly called "the pocketknife of antibody engineering."  "Imagine antibodies that can simultaneously tackle cancer cells and supercharge natural killer (NK) cells," said a scientist at Creative Biolabs during an exclusive interview. "That's not sci-fi anymore—we help discover complexes by marrying the mechanism behind it with the exact targeting you have in mind."  Aces in Bispecific Innovation  I. Customized bsAb pipeline Creative Biolabs provides customized bsAb design, engineering, and analysis workflows either for fundamental research or clinical trials, meeting all proposals on bsAb candidates with target, application, or mechanism of action designated.  "Whether for big pharma players or a nimble biotech startup, we are positioning ourselves as the go-to partner for your bsAb R&D." The scientist says. With one eye on scientific rigor and the other on speed-to-market, their approach is all about "less trial, more triumph."  II. Proprietary bsAb products  A whole "bank" of bispecific antibody products is readily available for miscellaneous research purposes: * Complete Product Line Ever: Tandem scFv, Tandem Fab, diabody, IgG-scFv, BsIgG, and so on— all under one roof * Therapeutic Area Specialization: From hematology and gene therapy, to solid tumors. * Full-Target Coverage: VEGF, CD16, CD19, EGFR, and star combinations available for bulk order.  Webinar Teases the Industry  The buzz doesn't stop there. On May 22 at 11 AM EST, scientists from Creative Biolabs invited Dr. Bruce Walcheck to jointly dive deep into the Targeted ADAM17 Blocker and Killer Antibody (TABK) complex during a live webinar. This first-in-class construct fires up natural killer (NK) cells and incorporates ADAM17 targeting to zero in on tumor cells.  "Join us to explore how this powerful complex creates a potent immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment." The scientist says.  What's Next?  The company's innovation roadshow hits five cities in Q3 for the World Bispecific Summit, with whispers of next-gen bispecifics in the works.  About Creative Biolabs is a biotechnology company specializing in the field of antibodies, providing first-rate antibody discovery and production services as well as "blue-ribbon" reagent products, which constantly participates in industry conferences and invites renowned researchers to promote their breakthrough ideas on antibody innovations.
