# Dr. Jeffrey Sternberg Named to Castle Connolly's Top 7% of U.S. Doctors for 14th Consecutive Year

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jeffrey A. Sternberg, MD, founder of The Sternberg Clinic in San Francisco and internationally recognized colorectal surgeon, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, marking the 14th consecutive year he has earned this prestigious honor. In 2025, Dr. Sternberg was recognized among the Top 7% of U.S. physicians—a distinction awarded to a select group of doctors nominated by their peers for exceptional clinical excellence and compassionate, patient-centered care.  A National Leader in Pilonidal Disease Surgery While Dr. Sternberg treats a broad range of colorectal conditions, he is best known for his expertise in the surgical treatment of pilonidal disease—a common yet often misunderstood condition affecting patients in their teens, 20s, and 30s. Contrary to outdated beliefs that it is a congenital cyst, pilonidal disease is a chronic infection that develops in the deep buttock cleft near the tailbone due to repeated microtrauma to the area. Cut or shed hairs often become embedded under the surface, contributing to abscess formation. This leads to painful infections, sinus tracts, and open draining wounds.  Although pilonidal disease affects an estimated 1–3% of adolescents and young adults in the U.S., it is frequently misdiagnosed or poorly treated using ineffective, outdated methods. Many patients endure multiple failed operations, months of painful wound care, missed school or work, and significant emotional and financial stress.  "This condition can derail a young person's life for months or even years," says Dr. Sternberg. "And that's completely unnecessary."  Changing the Standard of Care Dr. Sternberg has dedicated much of his career to correcting misconceptions about pilonidal disease and providing a modern, definitive surgical solution. He has performed approximately 2,000 Pilonidal RAF (Rotation and Advancement Flap) Procedures, also known as the Cleft Lift Procedure. This flap-based reconstructive surgery addresses the root cause—the deep buttock cleft—by flattening the cleft, eliminating dead space, and relocating the incision off the midline. Hence, it remains dry and heals properly. The result is rapid recovery without packing or prolonged wound care.  He is one of only a handful of surgeons worldwide specializing in this technique. Patients routinely travel from across the United States and abroad to seek his expertise after exhausting other treatment options. His outcomes include a reoperation rate of less than 1% in over 1,300 consecutive cases—a dramatic improvement compared to the high recurrence rates associated with traditional excisional surgeries.  "Pilonidal disease is not rare," Dr. Sternberg explains. "What's rare is finding a surgeon who treats it properly."  More Than Just Surgery Although pilonidal care is his primary clinical focus, Dr. Sternberg also treats a variety of other colorectal conditions, including anorectal abscesses, anal fistulas, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and rectal bleeding. He performs in-office excisions of cysts, lipomas, and other skin lesions, providing highly personalized care to patients of all ages.  Patients consistently praise his clear communication, compassionate bedside manner, and results-driven approach. "The biggest compliment I receive is when a patient says, 'You gave me my life back.' That's what drives me every day," says Dr. Sternberg.  Accomplished, Respected, and Peer-Recognized Dr. Sternberg is double board-certified by the American Board of Surgery and the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery. He attended Dartmouth College, where he graduated magna cum laude, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and was named a Rufus Choate Scholar (for top 5% of his class in junior year). He earned his medical degree from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and completed residency and fellowship training at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Minnesota.  He has served as President of the Northern California Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. Currently, he holds faculty appointments as a clinical assistant professor of surgery at UCSF and as an attending surgeon at Sutter Health's California Pacific Medical Center. He is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons.  In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Sternberg is a passionate advocate for raising awareness about pilonidal disease. His website, www.pilonidalsurgery.com, serves as a leading educational resource for patients and physicians worldwide.
