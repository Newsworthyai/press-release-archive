# DFW Car & Toy Museum Draws Over 5,000 Visitors in First Month

FORT WORTH, TX, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum has only been open a month, and it's already revving up excitement across the Metroplex. Located at Meacham Blvd. and I-35 in the massive former Coors distribution facility, the 150,000-square-foot space has been transformed into a world-class museum — offering free admission, dog-friendly galleries, and a jaw-dropping collection of over 200 rare cars and 3,000 toys from decades past.  Owned by Ron Sturgeon Real Estate LP, the building now houses Ron Sturgeon's personal collection, lovingly curated over the last 40 years.  The venue made headlines when Cars and Coffee of Texas selected it for its Tarrant County debut, attracting more than 2,000 car enthusiasts in one day—the largest Cars and Coffee event ever held in North Texas.  Early reviews say it all: The museum boasts only five-star ratings on Google and has rocketed up the ranks on TripAdvisor, climbing from #145 to #38 out of 340 attractions in Tarrant County — with sights set on the Top 20.  "This is just the beginning," says founder Ron Sturgeon, a self-made entrepreneur with a remarkable backstory. After losing his father in high school and finding himself homeless, Ron opened a small garage in Haltom City. That humble start evolved into a successful junkyard operation, which he sold to Ford Motor Company in 1999. Since then, he's built a thriving real estate business with over 1,000 tenants.  "I've been collecting toys and cars for decades, and I wanted to share the joy and nostalgia with others," said Sturgeon. "It's a place where generations can connect — whether you're a gearhead, a collector, or just a kid at heart."  The museum was recently featured on American Pickers at its former, smaller location in Haltom City. Although Sturgeon initially hoped to remain there, support from the city fell short. "I found two potential buildings in Haltom City, but ultimately, the new location at 2550 McMillan Parkway turned out to be a far better fit," he said. "With a billboard on I-35, greater visibility, and 10x the space, we can now showcase everything in our portfolio."  The DFW Car & Toy Museum is also gaining digital traction, thanks in part to a bold TikTok campaign featuring "The Dashboard Diva," which has surpassed 17,000 views in just one month.  Coming soon: guided tours, volunteer docents, and the museum's first official ambassador, Lee Jackson, who will help spread the word about this can't-miss destination.  "I'm thrilled we're in Fort Worth," added Sturgeon. "Dallas doesn't have a car museum at all — this is the place to come experience it all."  About Ron Sturgeon  The visionary behind DFW Car & Toy Museum has been a dedicated car collector for over 30 years. His passion for automobiles began in his teenage years when he taught himself to repair Volkswagens, eventually leading to a successful career in the automotive industry. From building one of the largest auto salvage operations in the country to restoring and collecting classic and exotic cars, Ron's love for all things automotive has never wavered.
