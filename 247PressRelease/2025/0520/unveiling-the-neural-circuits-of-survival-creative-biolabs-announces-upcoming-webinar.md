# Unveiling the Neural Circuits of Survival: Creative Biolabs Announces Upcoming Webinar

SHIRLEY, NY, May 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As neuroscience continues to unravel the complicated processes of the brain, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying survival behaviors has emerged as a fundamental research focus. Responding to growing interest and to promote collaboration in this active field, global biotechnology leader Creative Biolabs is pleased to present an upcoming webinar, "Neural Circuits of Survival." Researchers, scientists, and scholars are invited to join this enlightening event, during which the neural mechanisms of survival instincts will be explored.  Unveiling the Mysteries of Survival Instincts Survival behaviors are universal to all living organisms, regulating fundamental behaviors such as danger avoidance, feeding, and reproduction. Recent advances have revealed specific neural circuits that are activated by environmental stimuli to regulate actions and decision-making at the neural circuit level.  The webinar will discuss key points, including * Detailing state-of-the-art research on the structure and function of neural networks underlying the generation of survival behaviors. * How organisms perceive danger and react to it, with an emphasis on critical brain areas such as the amygdala. * How neural circuits regulate vital behaviors such as escape behavior, foraging, and mating, and how experience and environmental factors affect these circuits. * Featuring innovative techniques transforming the investigation of survival behaviors, including neuroimaging and neural circuit mapping.  Introducing New Technologies in Neuroscience In line with its commitment to advancing neuroscience research, Creative Biolabs offers a neuronal circuit multicolor labeling toolbox, allowing the visualization and analysis of complex neuronal circuits in the brain.   "Our Brainbow™ Toolbox can be customized and optimized for specific neuronal populations and brain regions," said a scientist at this company.  Why Attend? * Stay Current with the Latest Research: Get exposure to ongoing research and new developments related to survival behaviors in neuroscience. * Discover New Research Tools: Learn about emerging technologies and services, including the Brainbow multicolor labeling, to advance your research. * Network with Fellow Professionals: Discuss with others who are working in neuroscience and behavioral science. * Advance Your Knowledge: Learn more about complex neural mechanisms through lectures by leading experts.
