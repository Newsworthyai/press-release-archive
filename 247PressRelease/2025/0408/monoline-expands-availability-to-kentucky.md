# Monoline Expands Availability to Kentucky

AUSTIN, TX, April 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Monoline, the industry standard for personal umbrella placements, is now live in Kentucky, marking another major milestone toward nationwide availability. With this expansion, Monoline is now available in 43 states and continues its mission to provide agents with a seamless solution for placing standalone personal umbrella policies.  The launch in Kentucky required important modifications to Monoline's platform to comply with the state's unique fee and tax regulations. These enhancements position Monoline for future expansion into new states and products.  "This is a big step in terms of us updating our underlying architecture to support all the state-specific rules that will be required for future products we may bring to market," said Greg Blasko, Monoline Co-Founder. "The updates we made to accommodate our expansion into Kentucky will help us scale more efficiently as we continue to grow."  Since its launch in 2023, Monoline has become the preferred carrier for top agencies across the country. The intuitive online platform is free to use, offers standalone personal umbrella from $1M to $5M, and allows account executives to quote and bind in half the time compared to traditional methods. With Ivans download and agency management tools, Monoline is revolutionizing the way personal umbrella is placed and managed, saving agents hours per account and making policy management and reporting a breeze.  "Our goal is to make Monoline's platform available to agencies across the country," said Ben Phillips, CEO and Co-Founder of Monoline. "Each state presents unique regulatory challenges, and we are committed to tackling them head-on to ensure that agents everywhere have access to our innovative solutions."  With an eye on further growth, Monoline is actively working to launch in Florida, New York, New Jersey, Minnesota, Oregon, and Maine. Agents can look forward to even more enhancements designed to make policy placement faster and easier. Monoline is focused on reaching the remaining key markets that will bring it closer to nationwide availability.  For more information, visit https://www.monoline.com/states.
