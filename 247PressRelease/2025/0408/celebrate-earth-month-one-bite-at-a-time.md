# Celebrate Earth Month… One Bite at a Time!

OAKLAND, CA, April 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hodo, an award-winning organic-certified company known for its tofu products made with clean, minimally processed ingredients, invites you to celebrate Earth Month by being "water smart" and making more sustainable food choices.  "Small steps can really add up to nourish yourself and the planet," says Minh Tsai, Hodo's Founder and CEO. "At Hodo, we're committed to zero waste, so we ensure every part of the soybean—from hull to pulp—serves a purpose."  4 Simple Steps to Sustainable Eating 1.	Be Water Smart Soybeans use significantly less water than animal agriculture and up to 10x less water than almonds. Choosing soybeans and tofu over animal meat and some popular legumes and nuts can significantly reduce your environmental footprint.  2.	Share the Plate Cut saturated fat by mixing plant protein with your meats. Add tofu to stir frys or salads. Swap half your burger meat for mushrooms.  3.	Choose Organic  Organic farming = healthier planet. Soybeans are nitrogen-fixing and good for soil health.  4.	Save Money with Tofu and Beans Save money on your grocery bill! Soybeans are a very efficient source of protein with one of the highest usable grams of protein per acre. Soybeans and tofu (which is made from soybeans) are an economical source of protein.   Global Flavors, Plant-Friendly Foods Hodo creates delicious and Insta-worthy dishes inspired by global flavors, including North African Harissa, Moroccan spices, umami-packed Teriyaki and Miso, Thai Curry, Indian spices, and Mexican seasonings.
