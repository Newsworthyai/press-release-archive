# 1958 BMW Isetta 600 Limousine: A Microcar Marvel on Display at Unique Fort Worth Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, April 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 1958 BMW Isetta 600 is a fascinating piece of microcar history, bridging the gap between BMW's famous Isetta bubble car and more conventional automobiles. Produced between 1957 and 1959, the 600 was designed to offer more practicality while retaining the unique charm of its predecessor. With seating for four passengers and an innovative front-opening door, the Isetta 600 was a bold experiment in automotive engineering.  Engineering and Performance Powered by a rear-mounted, air-cooled 582cc flat-twin engine, this microcar produced approximately 19.5 horsepower at 4,500 rpm. Paired with a four-speed manual transmission, the Isetta 600 could achieve a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). It was also the first BMW to feature independent semi-trailing arm rear suspension, a design that would later be used in models like the BMW 3 Series.  Despite its well-thought-out engineering, the BMW 600 faced stiff competition from larger economy cars like the Volkswagen Beetle. As a result, production was limited to approximately 34,813 units before the model was discontinued in 1959.  A Stunning Restoration This particular 1958 BMW Isetta 600 underwent a comprehensive restoration in 2015, ensuring that its legacy lives on in pristine condition. The car was stripped to its black primer and repainted in a single-stage turquoise, believed to be its original color. The restoration process included replacing the floor pan and installing new steel to repair rusted areas, bringing the car back to its former glory.  Additional standout features include chrome-finished nerf bars, chrome front splash guards, sliding side windows, and a driver-side mirror. The car's excellence has been recognized with prestigious awards, including a 2017 AACA Grand National Award and a 2016 AACA National First Prize, both commemorated with plaques displayed on the front of the vehicle.  Unique Interior and Driving Experience The Isetta 600's interior is designed with both charm and functionality in mind. Access to the cabin is through a front-opening, side-hinged door, with an additional right-side door for rear passengers. Notable features include a horn button, grab strap, rear parcel shelf, and a floor-mounted shifter. The steering wheel is mounted on a hinged column, framing a dashboard pod with a 120-mph speedometer.  Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle, ensuring an engaging and memorable driving experience. Stopping power is provided by hydraulically actuated drum brakes, and the car rides on a coil-spring suspension system that enhances its microcar handling dynamics.
