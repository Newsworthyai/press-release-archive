# Former Prosecutor and Longtime Defender: Gretchen Taylor Pousson Champions Justice with Scrofano Law PC

FAIRFAX, VA, October 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Scrofano Law PC proudly announces Gretchen Taylor Pousson as the head of its Virginia Criminal Defense Practice, bringing over 30 years of trial experience and a unique dual perspective as both a former prosecutor and longtime defense attorney. Based in Fairfax, Virginia (see Google Maps), Attorney Pousson represents clients in state and federal courts across Northern Virginia, offering powerful, compassionate advocacy for individuals facing criminal charges.  Attorney Pousson's career began as an Assistant Public Defender in Roanoke, Virginia, where she tried her first murder case just six months after passing the bar. She later served as a prosecutor in Newport News for five years, gaining critical insight into the strategies and priorities of the prosecution. Reflecting on her time working for both sides of the courtroom, she told Super Lawyers Magazine, "Sometimes justice means you let someone go or you give them a chance for redemption."  Her deep understanding of the criminal justice system shaped her approach as an Assistant Federal Public Defender in the Eastern District of Virginia, where she served for seven years. In that role, she handled some of the region's most serious federal cases, earning a reputation as a fearless, ethical advocate for her clients.  In 2008, Attorney Pousson opened her own law practice—Taylor Law Company—which she incorporated in 2011. After more than a decade leading her firm, she joined Scrofano Law PC in August 2023 to establish and open and oversee its Fairfax office, expanding the firm's reach throughout Virginia. She continues to represent clients charged with criminal offenses, as well as individuals seeking expungements, firearm rights restoration, and protective order defense.  "Gretchen embodies everything we value at Scrofano Law—relentless advocacy, compassion, and a deep belief in redemption," said Joseph A. Scrofano, founder and principal attorney. "Her leadership in Virginia strengthens our firm's commitment to defending the rights of the accused with skill and integrity."  She has also presented on a range of topics before national defense organizations on criminal law and trial advocacy. Recognized as a Super Lawyer and AVVO Top Attorney, Attorney Pousson is known for her courtroom excellence and personal dedication to every client. As a Founding Member of the DUI Defense Lawyers Association, her cases have spanned from DUI and theft to serious felony and homicide charges—and even animal defense matters, successfully exonerating dogs wrongfully labeled as dangerous. Former clients describe her as "honorable, ethical, and kind," crediting her with "drastically altering the course of my life simply by doing her job."
