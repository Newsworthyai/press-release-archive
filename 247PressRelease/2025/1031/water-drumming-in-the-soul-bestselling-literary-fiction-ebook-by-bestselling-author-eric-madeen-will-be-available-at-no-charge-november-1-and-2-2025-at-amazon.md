WILMINGTON, NC, October 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bestselling author Eric Madeen has announced that 'Water Drumming In The Soul', a work of literary fiction based on his travels in Africa, will be available at no charge in ebook form this Saturday and Sunday, November 1 and 2, 2025 at Amazon.  'Water Drumming in the Soul' is a literary love story with the water drummer being a gorgeous African lady who, at the outset, plays a stream as a drum as she sings gloriously ... to catch the attention of an American Peace Corps volunteer almost arrived au village to build a medical dispensary. By and by David becomes the hunter captured by the game. And what a rollicking game of love it is, with a fictional reality stitched into the narrative along with a bit of mischievous straying as if the author dipped into his experiences in equatorial Gabon, Africa. There, opposed to northern climes with their rather icy chimes of the Apollonian, the novel's African culture in 'Water Drumming' is slathered with the pageantry of life forces and the wicked, wild and mystery dance of the Dionysian. While David Fields' point of view is crackling as in his seeing the novel in everything, his lover, the novel's gorgeous heroine Assam, goes even deeper in her seeding the love story with chthonic spirits and a toxin in David's meals of, e.g., monkey he hunted ... to get what she wants.  Like wunderkind best-seller Paul Theroux, Eric Madeen will always think of himself as a Peace Corps volunteer, one who, just after graduating from the University of Arizona, constructed in Francophone Gabon, Africa a primary school complex in an equatorial village surrounded by rainforest … where he got lost for three days while hunting monkeys for the cooking pot … and where notably he fell in love, giving his first novel, 'Water Drumming in the Soul' a vigorous fictional reality.  Readers and reviewers have expressed high praise for 'Water Drumming In The Soul'. Zaheer Baber; Professor of Sociology; University of Toronto, said, "Madeen's storytelling prowess shines through and resonates with authenticity. The characters, particularly Assam, are beautifully developed, challenging traditional stereotypes as in presenting a more nuanced and genuine portrayal of African culture."  One Amazon reviewer said, "Water Drumming in the Soul not only tells a passionate love story, but it also delves into thought-provoking themes like culture, identity, and the power of human connection. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that'll have you laughing, crying, and everything in between. This isn't your typical love story! This novel is well-written and full of unexpected twists that keep you flipping those pages. Plus, the characters are so well-developed that you'll feel like you've known them forever. So, if you're ready for a wild and adventurous ride, grab a copy of this modern-day classic ASAP!"  Elizabeth Montano, author of The Eternal Dawn Trilogy, called it " a novel so beautifully and realistically written I found it on par with works by whom we consider masters … Hemingway definitely comes to mind."  Eric Madeen writes cross-genre, and is the author of several books:  Tokyo-ing! - This is an apt word for this bestselling trio of tales chiming with anyone even slightly interested in Asia's most dynamic metropolis and its glazing of layers – be they cultural or taking-wing exuberant. Madeen does deep dives in three fascinating directions and voices, including the persona in first-person female. Then doesn't let readers come up for air because they don't want to -- until the delicious end.  Asian Trail Mix: True Tales From Borneo to Japan, a bestselling travelogue mixes it up on the Asian Trail in a voice that's by turns personal, passionate and ohhhh so very soulful. "So I get up at dawn and marvel at fog burning off into mist tumbling down like the finest mosquito netting of silk. The hills beyond the rivers' confluence, like shoulders of a woman undressing, the way the misty shroud lifts off feminine curves, higher and higher ... I tingle all over, feeling there on Borneo the dream tug of Joseph Conrad's fiction, notably his early Malaya Quartet therein Lord Jim." By turns literarily pathbreaking and intimate, this smorgasbord of travel essays scales down the sprawl of Asia by focusing on the unique and revelatory in gemmy prose. See up close and personal the razzmatazz of novice monks at play in northern Laos, the bonding with hustling pedicab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City, the rainforests blazed on gutsy treks across Borneo and Thailand's Elephant Island and novel things Japanese. Served up nice and spicy, Asian Trail Mix is slathered across 12 rocking-it essays plus a tall tale at its glorious ending, making for a baker's dozen of sumptuousness.  Tennis Clubbed, Snubbed and Rubbity-Dub Dubbed - In historically rich Yokohama, where Captain Perry and his Black Ships cracked open Japan, the wicked shiver of the tennis snub in the postmodern present pits David Adams against K: a puffed-up xenophobic tyrant who rules over the courts of a club that has as its anthem, ironically, the promotion of international friendship, modelled on the world's 2nd oldest tennis club on whose board Madeen had the privilege of serving.
