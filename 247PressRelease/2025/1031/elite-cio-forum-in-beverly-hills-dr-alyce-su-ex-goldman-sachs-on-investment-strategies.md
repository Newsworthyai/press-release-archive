# Elite CIO Forum in Beverly Hills: Dr. Alyce Su (Ex-Goldman Sachs) on Investment Strategies

BEVERLY HILLS, CA, October 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On October 14, Beverly Hills hosted a high-profile wealth management forum featuring top Chief Investment Officers from across the financial industry. CIO Dr. Alyce Su headlined a marquee panel titled "Navigating Markets: Investment Strategies and Macroeconomic Outlook," where she and fellow CIOs discussed strategic investment responses to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut.  Held at The Maybourne Beverly Hills, the 9th Annual Private Wealth Southern California Forum, hosted by Markets Group, brought together family offices, institutional investors, and wealth advisors to explore portfolio resilience amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, shifting fiscal policy, and evolving interest rate expectations.  "Now that the Fed has adopted a more cautious tone, we find ourselves in a non-recessionary easing cycle â€” a backdrop that has historically supported both fixed income and equities," said Dr. Alyce Su during the event. "This is a key moment for disciplined asset allocation: capturing bond yields, investing in sectors tied to capital expenditures, and maintaining diversification through alternatives."  In her remarks, Dr. Alyce Su outlined a three-pronged tactical strategy: 1. Lock in bond yields, focusing on short-duration investment-grade credit, long-duration municipal bonds, and hybrid securities. 2. Lean into equities, with targeted allocations to the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and sectors including Artificial Intelligence (AI), financials, industrials, power, and defense. 3. Hold alternatives for diversification and long-term value capture, particularly through hedge funds.  The CIO panel addressed broader market and policy themes, including global trade risks, labor market dynamics, interest rate trajectories, and the potential impact of the new OBBBA fiscal stimulus bill.  Dr. Alyce Su also shared perspectives on global investment trends, highlighting Hong Kong's emergence as a leading IPO hub, and noting its growing role as a public-market parallel to the U.S. private equity ecosystem.  The forum underscored Southern California's rising influence as a global financial center, providing regional investors with access to institutional-grade insights and expertise.
