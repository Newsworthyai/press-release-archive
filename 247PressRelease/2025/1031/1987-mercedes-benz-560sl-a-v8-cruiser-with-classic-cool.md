# 1987 Mercedes-Benz 560SL: A V8 Cruiser with Classic Cool

FORT WORTH, TX, October 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to showcase a true icon of 1980s grand touring elegance: a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 560SL, now part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection. Finished in radiant red and showing just 12,000 original miles, this V8-powered roadster captures the peak of Mercedes-Benz refinement and performance during its golden era.  Under the hood, the 560SL is equipped with a 5.5-liter V8, factory-rated at 227 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, paired to a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. Power, poise, and German precision define the drive, enhanced by power steering, a fully independent suspension, and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes.  Inside, this SL is a time capsule of luxury and innovation. The cabin features automatic climate control, cruise control, electric windows, central locking, and even a period Carphone, all wrapped in a setting dominated by a factory Becker stereo and classic VDO instrumentation. The leather-wrapped four-spoke steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel economy, and fuel level.  "This 560SL is the definition of a classic you can still drive and enjoy," says Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It has the comfort, presence, and understated power that makes the SL timeless—and with just 12,000 miles, it feels practically new."  Offered only in the North American market from 1986–1989, the 560SL is the most powerful and most refined of the R107 chassis, widely celebrated for its build quality, balanced performance, and enduring design. Whether admired for its classic lines or legendary longevity, this low-mileage SL is a standout among Mercedes-Benz collectibles.
