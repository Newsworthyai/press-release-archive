# Author and Writer Theresia Whitfield Introduces the Release of Her New Book "After Cancer: Now What?"

MAGNOLIA, TX, October 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- You've heard the diagnosis. You've endured the appointments, scans, treatments, and surgery. Now it's over. So… now what?  After months—or even years—of your life being dictated by cancer, stepping into life after treatment can feel overwhelming. You may feel hopeful but hesitant, grateful yet unsettled. A wave of emotions hits, and you're left wondering how to move forward.  Theresia Whitfield's new book, "After Cancer: Now What? A Biblical Guide to Navigating Life After Cancer" offers honest encouragement and practical help for survivors facing the emotional and spiritual aftermath of cancer. With compassion and biblical insight, this guide explores what God's Word says about the complex emotions that often surface post-treatment—and how to walk through them toward lasting healing.  Theresia is a seasoned freelance writer with over 25 years of experience, having contributed to more than two dozen national and international publications. Her work earned two Emmy nominations and two Best Consumer Report awards from the RTNDA and Associated Press.  After transitioning from broadcast to print, Theresia covered both the auto racing industry and faith-based topics, combining sharp reporting with a passion for stories that inspire. Her heart for storytelling centers on themes of hope, healing, and resilience. Cancer gave her a second chance to live life in a more meaningful and abundant way, and she hopes readers will see the faithfulness of God in her own story and in the stories of others who have battled cancer.  As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Theresia's new book will educate, support and inspire. "After Cancer: Now What?" is a reminder that whether you're wrestling with fear, loss, or uncertainty, you can find hope, peace, and purpose on the other side of survival.
