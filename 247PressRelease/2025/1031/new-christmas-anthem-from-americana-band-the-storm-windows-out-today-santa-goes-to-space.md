The band takes their name The Storm Windows from a song title of one of their musical heroes, John Prine, but also as an appropriate description of some veteran musicians who have weathered a few storms but are still standing and singing about it. Critics have labeled their music "New Americana â€“ a blend of folk, rock and even jazz laced sonics."   The single follows the recent summer release of the new studio EP "More Lucky", a set of summer anthems for 2025 that convey a message of hope tinged with a yearning for something better, and the promise of the road to try to find it.
