# Nicolet Law Accident &amp; Injury Lawyers Becomes Exclusive Personal Injury Partner of House of Harley-Davidson, Expanding the Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ Advocacy

MILWAUKEE, WI, December 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nicolet Law Accident & Injury Lawyers has become the Exclusive Personal Injury Partner for House of Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee, strengthening the firm's long-term investment in protecting riders across the Midwest.   Nicolet Law's Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ has partnered with House of Harley-Davidson to meet the unique needs of injured motorcyclists and their families while supporting the communities where they live and ride.​  Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ was established when Nicolet Law recognized the need for comprehensive legal support for riders facing distinct risks on the road, complicated insurance and liability issues after a crash, and unfair bias that threatens their financial future.   Led by Partner and avid motorcyclist Drew Epperly, known as The Midwest's Motorcycle Lawyer™, this division is designed to function as an arm of Nicolet Law.   The legal organization provides assistance with crash investigations, insurance disputes, and serious injury claims involving motorcyclists across Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa.​  Through the exclusive partnership, Nicolet Law and House of Harley-Davidson will unite to support the community.   Recently, we attended and sponsored House of Harley's Chili Cookoff in Greenfield. Representatives from Nicolet Law handed out gift bags and were a welcoming presence, affirming a lasting relationship with the communities we both serve.  Teams from multiple fire departments and firefighter organizations competed to raise funds for specialized training, equipment, and support services for firefighters and their families throughout southeast Wisconsin.​  The event, organized in partnership with Milwaukee Firefighter Charities and Local 215, draws departments and supporters from communities including Caledonia, Racine, West Allis, Greenfield, Hales Corners, and others, along with groups like the Junior Fire Institute, the Milwaukee Fire Bell Club, and the Axemen Motorcycle Club.   A panel of judges and invited leaders from the fire service and local business community underscores how deeply the cookoff is rooted in southeast Wisconsin's culture of public safety, philanthropy, and motorcycling.​  A Response to Rising Motorcycle Risks in the Midwest  The expansion of Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ and the decision to forge a long-term partnership with House of Harley-Davidson comes at a time when motorcycle crashes remain a serious concern throughout the region.   In Iowa, motorcycles account for a small percentage of registered vehicles and vehicle miles traveled but represent a disproportionate share of traffic fatalities, including 2023, in which motorcycle deaths made up 16% of statewide traffic fatalities.   Across Wisconsin, state transportation and public safety agencies continue to report the need for ongoing rider education, improved driver awareness, and stronger safety initiatives.   With over 1900 crashes happening annually between 2020 and 2024, Wisconsin motorcycle riders need to be especially vigilant when someone else's negligence causes harm.   In Minnesota, official crash reports and annual motorcycle safety publications emphasize that riders remain overrepresented in serious and fatal crashes, which has driven support for a statewide motorcycle safety program.   Vision Zero efforts in North Dakota likewise highlight the importance of targeted strategies to reduce motorcycle injuries and fatalities, underscoring how vulnerable riders can be when other drivers fail to share the road safely.  Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™: Built by Riders for Riders  Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ reflects Nicolet Law's belief that effective legal representation for riders must be grounded in a real understanding of motorcycle culture.   As a rider who has personally recovered from a crash, Partner Drew Epperly brings first-hand insight into the physical, emotional, and financial pressures motorcyclists face after a serious accident.   His experience shapes how the Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™ evaluate cases, collaborate with experts, and communicate with clients whose lives have been upended by a crash.​ The team's work also extends beyond courtroom advocacy and settlement negotiations.   "Riders deserve a legal team that not only understands the law, but truly understands what it means to live this lifestyle. For Midwest Motorcycle Lawyers™, partnering with House of Harley-Davidson is about showing up where riders already gather, standing with the first responders who protect these communities, and making sure that when a serious crash happens, there is a team ready to fight for injured motorcyclists and their families." – Drew Epperly, Partner at Nicolet Law Accident & Injury Lawyers and The Midwest's Motorcycle Lawyer™  The team attends dealership events, rallies, and community gatherings to provide clear, plain-language information about insurance coverage, common crash scenarios, and the steps that can protect a rider's rights after a collision.   The partnership is designed to help riders understand that they do not have to navigate complex legal and insurance systems alone, especially when injuries are serious and liability is contested.​  About Nicolet Law Accident & Injury Lawyers  Nicolet Law Accident & Injury Lawyers is a personal injury law firm serving clients across Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa, with a practice focused on helping injured people rebuild after accidents.
