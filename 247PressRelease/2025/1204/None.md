# Real Dairy Milk Fuels Gunner Stockton on the Road to the 2025 Conference Title Game

ATLANTA, GA, December 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the University of Georgia prepares to face the University of Alabama in the 2025 conference title game, all eyes are on quarterback Gunner Stockton. The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, spotlights how one steady source of fuel carried Stockton through every stage of his football journey: real dairy milk. From Friday night lights to championship-level competition, real dairy milk has supported his strength, recovery, and drive to perform at his best.   Throughout years of early practices, weight training, and high-pressure moments, Stockton leaned on real dairy milk as the one constant that helped him recover, rebuild, and stay strong. The Milk's Got Game® platform elevates athlete stories like Gunner's to highlight how complete, high-quality protein supports muscle building and repair, natural electrolytes aid hydration through long drives, and carbohydrates restore energy after intense training and competition. As Stockton nears the biggest game of his season, he doubles down on the fuel that has always worked.   "Real dairy milk has always been part of my routine," said Gunner Stockton, University of Georgia Quarterback. "I grew up drinking it after practices, and I still rely on it today. It helps me recover faster and perform at my best when it matters most. As we head into the conference championship matchup, I'm sticking with what has always worked – real dairy milk."   "Gunner's dedication and drive reflect the heart of Southeastern athletics," said Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at The Dairy Alliance.
