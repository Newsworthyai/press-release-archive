SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, CA, September 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Some residents call Valencia by FivePoint their oasis, with good reason. The panoramic hillside site features vista views, permanently protected open space, trees and vegetation. "You see beauty, not power lines, and it really feels like a nature setting," said one homeowner.   Elevated location and a serene atmosphere introduce the oasis that is Valencia, and abundant additional attractions further distinguish this special place. Confluence Park offers expansive spaces for family picnics and special gatherings, and such resort-style amenities as a lap pool, kiddie pool, spa and cabanas.   Throughout the community are outdoor seating niches, small parks and sidewalk systems that invite enjoyment without a drive. Pedestrians, trikes, bikes and four-legged pals have plenty of room to roam at Valencia. Adjacent trails make it easy to hike from home, and some connect with regional networks.   The friendly fabric of a neighborly small town flourishes here.

"There are lots of great places to spend time throughout the community."   "The walkability and our pools and cabana are like a vacation at home," said another.
