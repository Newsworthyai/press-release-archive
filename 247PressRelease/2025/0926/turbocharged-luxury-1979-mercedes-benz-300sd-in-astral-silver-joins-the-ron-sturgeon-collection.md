# Turbocharged Luxury: 1979 Mercedes-Benz 300SD in Astral Silver Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is excited to announce the addition of a 1979 Mercedes-Benz 300SD to the Ron Sturgeon Collection. A trailblazer in its time, the 300SD was the world's first production turbocharged diesel sedan, delivering remarkable efficiency, engineering innovation, and executive-level comfort that redefined expectations for luxury cars.  Originally finished in Astral Silver Metallic, this example was repainted in the early 2000s and now sports subtle European-spec touches including quad headlights and streamlined bumpers. A sunroof, dual side mirrors, and a power antenna round out the refined exterior, while the pitting chrome on the right-front door handle tells a small part of this car's well-traveled story.  Under the hood lies the 3.0-liter OM617A turbo diesel inline-five engine, factory rated at 110 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. This powertrain—famed for its bulletproof durability—helped usher in an era where diesel engines were no longer just for trucks or taxis. This particular vehicle has over 212,000 miles on the odometer, a testament to the reliability of the 300SD's engineering.  The car's suspension has been upgraded with Bilstein shock absorbers, and stopping power is handled by power-assisted ventilated front and solid rear disc brakes. Inside, classic amenities include a Becker Grand Prix stereo, automatic climate control, cruise control, power locks and windows, and a tasteful mix of analog instrumentation and ergonomic German design.  "The 300SD was a luxury pioneer, proving that diesel could be both elegant and efficient," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a car built to go the distance, and it represents an important chapter in Mercedes-Benz's legacy."  This 1979 Mercedes-Benz 300SD is now on display alongside over 200 rare and exotic cars and 3,000 vintage toys and collectibles within the museum's extensive collection.
