LOS ANGELES, CA, September 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Skywork today announced a major update connecting Microsoft 365, Outlook, OneDrive, Google Drive, and Notion to its productivity platform. This integration eliminates the need to switch between applications, allowing users to manage their digital workspace from a single interface.  After authorization, users can immediately: - Query and send Outlook emails - Create and manage Outlook Calendar events - Access and store files across Google Drive and OneDrive - Generate content within Microsoft 365 - Edit Notion pages seamlessly  "This update represents our commitment to creating tools that work where you work," said Andy. "We're eliminating the friction that occurs when moving between different applications."  The integration operates through Skywork's General mode, functioning as an execution layer across authorized tools.
