# SERVOCAR: 1,800mm Wide PPF with Outstanding Heat Resistance at an Affordable Price

NEW YORK, NY, May 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Enhance LABS has unveiled their latest premium Paint Protection Film (PPF), SERVOCAR, on Kickstarter. The company leveraged over 20 years of experience and expertise in producing optical films and adhesive tapes for LCD TVs for a PFP that goes above and beyond its competitors.   There are 3 features that make SERVOCAR exceptional—first, its heat resistance. Capable of withstanding temperatures up to 356°F (180°C), SERVOCAR is the first PPF that perfectly protects vehicles even in extreme desert climates like Las Vegas or Dubai without suffering film damage. Next is the minimal orange peel effect—preserving the vehicle's original paint texture far better than conventional films. Finally, the extra-wide 1,800mm width—surpassing standard PPF (1,520mm), allowing coverage for long-hood sports cars, pickup trucks, large SUVs, boats, and even aircrafts for enhanced versatility.   SERVOCAR is engineered with optimal thickness and strength, balancing ease of installation with superior protection. By shielding your vehicle from road debris, impacts, acid rain, dust, bird droppings, insect residue, and other damaging factors, SERVOCAR is an invisible, high-strength barrier for your car — from the front all the way to the back.   The outstanding heat resistance and lack of orange peels are the main ways that SERVOCAR address the common problems of PPF. Using premium Argotec TPU and UV-absorbing top coatings, SERVOCAR prevents discoloration, physical deformities, and orange peels, maintaining the car's original quality for years.   After 5+ years of extensive research on adhesives, SERVOCAR's residue-free adhesive layer ensures no damage to the paint even after long-term use and removal. And with SERVOCAR's outstanding scratch resistance, moderate scratches vanish instantly with heat or hot water while light swirl marks recover naturally at room temperature within 10 minutes.   SERVOCAR's superior water repellency lets your car resist stains and for a clear coat in harsh conditions, keeping your car looking pristine with little hassle. Rest assured that your car will continue to look beautiful and clean months after you've driven it off the lot. Thanks to its amazing hydrophobic properties, SERVOCAR makes it easier than ever to clean and maintain your car.  But what's truly noteworthy about SERVOCAR is how it's priced at 1/3 the cost of traditional PPF. Despite its wider width and higher quality, the financial burden of PPF has never been lower if you go with SERVOCAR.   Enhance LABS—the makers of SERVOCAR—had this to say about their launch: "It wasn't easy, but we've finally developed a breakthrough PPF that solves issues like orange peel, yellowing, and paint damage during removal. Plus, the amount of coverage is truly unprecedented… With a width of 1,800mm, you're getting total vehicle coverage. You should definitely seek out SERVOCAR if you're looking for safe, long-lasting protection for your vehicle."   Want to learn more or support the project?
