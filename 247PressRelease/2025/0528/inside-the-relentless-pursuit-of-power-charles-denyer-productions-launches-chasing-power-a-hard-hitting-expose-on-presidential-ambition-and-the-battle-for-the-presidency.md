# Inside the Relentless Pursuit of Power: Charles Denyer Productions Launches Chasing Power, a Hard-Hitting Exposé on Presidential Ambition and the Battle for the Presidency

DALLAS, TX, May 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Charles Denyer Productions announces the launch of Chasing Power: The Path to Pennsylvania Avenue, a groundbreaking new podcast exploring the high-stakes world of American presidential politics. Premiering December 25, 2025, the podcast will be available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major streaming platforms.  Hosted by Charles Denyer, Chasing Power delivers a front-row seat to the drama, strategy, and relentless ambition that fuel the race for the most powerful office in the world. With more than two decades of experience advising top officials, including Vice Presidents, Cabinet officials, and intelligence leaders, Denyer brings rare access and unmatched insight to every episode.  "This podcast is about more than the Oval Office," says Denyer. "It's about the battlegrounds—both geographic and ideological—where presidential campaigns are won and lost. It's about the raw, unfiltered pursuit of power and the strategies behind every handshake, every headline, every vote."  Beginning with the transformative presidency of John F. Kennedy, the podcast chronicles the evolution of modern campaigning—from the charisma of Reagan, to the centrism of Clinton, the digital revolution under Obama, and the media-dominated era of Trump. Each episode dives into the tactics that shape American elections: voter mobilization, swing state warfare, media manipulation, the billion-dollar machinery behind political influence, and so much more.  Through deep analysis, historical context, and insider interviews, Chasing Power reveals how the battle for the presidency is waged far beyond Washington's corridors—from campaign war rooms to the living rooms of undecided voters across the country.  Whether you're a seasoned political junkie or a curious citizen seeking to understand how leaders rise to power, Chasing Power offers an unfiltered journey into the heart of America's political arena.  Listen to Chasing Power: The Path to Pennsylvania Avenue beginning December 25, 2025. Available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major platforms.  Charles Denyer is a seasoned professional with a strong focus on cybersecurity, data privacy, artificial intelligence, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). He maintains direct access to top political and business leaders around the world, providing unique insights into global affairs. As an established author and the official biographer to three U.S. Vice Presidents, his work reflects deep knowledge of American political history and leadership. He also serves as a national security correspondent for major news outlets and is a sought-after keynote speaker at conferences and events worldwide.
