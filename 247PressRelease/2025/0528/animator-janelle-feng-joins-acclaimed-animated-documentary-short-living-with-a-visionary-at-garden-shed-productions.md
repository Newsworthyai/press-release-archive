# Animator Janelle Feng Joins Acclaimed Animated Documentary Short "Living with A Visionary" at Garden Shed Productions

LOS ANGELES, CA, May 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Garden Shed Productions proudly announces the addition of animator Janelle Feng to the creative team of Living with A Visionary, an ambitious animated documentary short film set for a 24-month production window from September 1, 2023, to September 1, 2025.  About the Production: Living with A Visionary is an animated documentary short film adapted from John Matthias' poignant memoir, first published in The New Yorker in 2021. The film intimately chronicles the journey of Matthias as he cares for his wife Diana, whose Parkinson's-related hallucinations blur the line between reality and imagination. The project is spearheaded by Stephen Neary, Creator/EP of HBO Max's "The Fungies!" and Supervising Producer of Cartoon Network's Emmy-nominated "Clarence". Neary was awarded a Filmmakers Fund Grant from Rooftop Films and Equity Financing from Brookly-based animation studio Cartuna, with James Belfer and Adam Belfer serving as Executive Producers and Mireia Vilanova as Producer.  The documentary short is entirely hand-animated, with each frame colored using watercolor crayons before being digitally scanned–a labor-intensive process designed to evoke the tactile, emotional texture of memory and hallucination.  Janelle Feng's Leading Role: Janelle Feng joins the production as Lead Animator, entrusted with translating the director's vision into fluid, expressive animation. Working from detailed storyboards, Feng will animate on TVPaint, oversee the traditional rendering process, and collaborate closely with Neary to ensure each frame's emotional authenticity. Her role is pivotal in maintaining the film's visual consistency and in executing the complex layering and cel techniques that distinguish the project's unique look.

Director's Statement: "Thank you to poet and professor John Matthias for trusting me with your story. I first read John's article in the middle of the pandemic, with a newborn sleeping at my side. I felt profoundly moved and couldn't stop thinking about it for months. I began daydreaming of how to bring Diana's visions to life in animation," said Stephen Neary.
