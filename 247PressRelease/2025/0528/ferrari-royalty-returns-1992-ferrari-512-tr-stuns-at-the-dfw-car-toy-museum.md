# Ferrari Royalty Returns: 1992 Ferrari 512 TR Stuns at the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to unveil one of the rarest and most iconic Ferraris of the 1990s: the 1992 Ferrari 512 TR, now on display as part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection. This fiery red masterpiece isn't just a supercar—it's a time capsule from the golden age of Italian automotive excellence.  The 512 TR (Testa Rossa) is a stunning evolution of the legendary Testarossa, and this particular car stands as a remarkably preserved example of Ferrari's 12-cylinder glory. With only about 400 units officially imported into the United States over the model's three-year production run, surviving examples like this are increasingly rare—and even fewer remain in such exceptional condition.  Presented in Ferrari's classic red with tan interior, this 512 TR includes its original tool kit, owner's manual set and pouch, along with three car covers for maximum preservation. Enhancing its collector appeal are unused red and black neoprene seat and seat belt covers, plus original red satin Ferrari-branded seat and steering wheel storage/dust covers, complete with the black prancing horse emblem.  "This 1992 Ferrari 512 TR is more than just a car—it's a unicorn among '90s exotics," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's one of those cars that defined a generation, and we're honored to have it preserved and on display for enthusiasts to enjoy up close."  Visitors can experience this rare gem and over 200 other incredible vehicles at the DFW Car & Toy Museum—where every car tells a story, and admission is always free.
