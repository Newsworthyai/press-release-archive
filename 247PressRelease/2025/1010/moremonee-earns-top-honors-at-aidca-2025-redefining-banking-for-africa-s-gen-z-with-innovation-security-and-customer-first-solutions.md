ABU DHABI, UAE, October 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Moremonee Wins Innovative Firm of the Year at African Industrial & Development Awards 2025  In a significant recognition of its innovative approach to banking, Moremonee, a Nigerian fintech company, has been named the Innovative Firm of the Year at the African Industrial and Development Awards (AIDCA) 2025.  Launched in 2023, Moremonee has rapidly become known as the Gen Z bank, offering a range of innovative features that blend speed, safety, and innovation into an experience that feels less like banking and more like a lifestyle app.  At the core of Moremonee's success is its deep understanding of the needs and values of Gen Z. This generation expects efficiency, trust, transparency, and inclusivity from the companies they interact with, and Moremonee has designed its platform to meet these expectations.  Some of the standout features of Moremonee's platform include: • Daily Interest: Users earn interest every single day, turning savings into an instant reward system. Snappy: A first in Africa, this feature allows users to snap a picture of account details instead of typing them manually, reducing errors and making money transfers effortless. • Trusted Partners and Lion Guard: Security takes center stage, with users able to designate a trusted contact to lock their account in emergencies or temporarily freeze their own funds with biometric authentication. • Moremonee FutureBox: The Moremonee FutureBox allows users to earn up to 24% interest annually on fixed savings. There are three plans to choose from: Future Landlord (3 months, 4% interest), Jethro (6 months, 10% interest), and Makarios (12 months, 24% interest). You can select the plan that best suits your financial goals. • Tap n Pay: Using a debit card is more convenient with Moremonee's Tap n Pay feature. Users can simply tap their card on the POS terminal to make a withdrawal. There's no need to insert the card, speeding up the process and making transactions user-friendly.  Moremonee's commitment to innovation and customer-centricity has earned it a reputation as one of Nigeria's leading fintech companies. With its win at the AIDCA 2025, Moremonee has cemented its position as a leader in the African fintech space.  "Our philosophy is simple: real innovation in the financial industry should help people grow, grow their wealth, grow their confidence, and grow beyond financial stress. We exist to simplify finance, not complicate it. Growth isn't just a metric for us; it's a mission – growth for our users, our team, and the communities we serve," said Dr. Mohammed Olatunji (Dr MO), PhD, Founder and Chairman of Moremonee.  "We are deeply grateful for this recognition and give all the glory to God for the progress and expansion achieved so far. Truly, we are nothing without the help of the Almighty God, said Dr Mo. "Our goal has always been to redefine banking for Africa's youth, and this award is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team."
