PHOENIX, AZ, October 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Veritas Global Protection has released its latest annual report, outlining measurable outcomes that reflect the company's continued emphasis on customer satisfaction and reliable service. The report provides a data-driven view of how the company's vehicle protection plans have performed over the past year, offering transparency into service results and customer experiences.  According to the report, Veritas Global Protection documented steady year-over-year improvements in claim resolutions, service response times, and overall customer feedback. These outcomes reflect the company's focus on building trust with drivers through vehicle protection plans that are frequently compared to traditional warranties. While not warranties in the legal sense, these protection plans are designed to function in a similar way, providing financial security when vehicles encounter unexpected mechanical issues.  Among the highlights: Faster Claims Processing – The report notes that average claim processing times decreased compared to the prior year, helping customers return to the road more quickly.  Broader Coverage – New plan options introduced during the reporting period expanded protection for electric vehicles, luxury cars, and recreational vehicles, aligning with evolving consumer demand.  High Retention Rates – Customer retention showed notable improvement, with drivers opting to renew coverage plans at higher rates than in previous years.  The report also details the company's commitment to service reliability. Repair authorizations and payments to service providers have been streamlined, reducing delays for both customers and repair centers. Veritas Global Protection emphasizes that its protection plans deliver comparable benefits by covering repair costs, offering roadside assistance, and including additional customer support services.  Independent feedback collected through customer reviews indicates a mixed but improving perception of service delivery. Many customers cited responsive claims handling and convenience, while the company acknowledged that ongoing refinements remain a priority to ensure consistency across all plan types.  The annual report arrives at a time when demand for extended vehicle coverage continues to rise. With more drivers keeping their cars longer and vehicle technology becoming increasingly complex, vehicle protection plans and warranties are viewed as important safeguards. Veritas Global Protection positions its services to meet this need by tailoring options to different driver segments, from everyday commuters to owners of high-end vehicles.  Veritas Global Protection states that it will continue refining its processes, leveraging technology and customer feedback to enhance future service results. The company's annual report underscores its aim to provide customers with protection solutions that offer both financial security and practical peace of mind.
