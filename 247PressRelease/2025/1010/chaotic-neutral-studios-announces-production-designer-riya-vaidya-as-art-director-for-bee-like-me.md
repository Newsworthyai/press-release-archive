# Chaotic Neutral Studios Announces Production Designer Riya Vaidya as Art Director for "Bee Like Me"

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Chaotic Neutral Studios is proud to announce the involvement of Production Designer Riya Vaidya as Art Director for the upcoming music video "Bee Like Me."   Bee Like Me, directed by Nelson Estevez and produced by Darsh Thakker (CEO, Chaotic Neutral Studios), blends bold creative imagery with symbolic design—an approach that has come to define the studio's identity in the independent film and music video landscape. Chaotic Neutral Studios, known for its collaborative ethos and authentic visual language, has built a reputation for crafting content that transforms genre conventions into immersive visual experiences.  About the Production Set for release on YouTube and Vimeo, Bee Like Me explores identity, imitation, and authenticity. The concept personifies Mondaii as the "king bee," a figure reclaiming his individuality amidst a world of mimicry. Through choreography, mirrored staging, and layered production design, the project weaves themes of self-reflection and empowerment into every frame.  Riya Vaidya's artistic approach plays a central role in bringing these ideas to life. Her work reimagines physical space as a narrative medium—using honey-based textures, reflective surfaces, and surreal props to evoke transformation and self-awareness. From early visual research to on-set supervision, Vaidya has been instrumental in shaping the project's aesthetic language, ensuring visual cohesion between performance, symbolism, and set environments.  Her contributions include: - Developing visual motifs around mirrors and honey; collaborating with the director on conceptual lookbooks and design sketches; assisting in location scouting. - Overseeing the art department during principal photography; managing reflective staging and practical effects; coordinating real-time design transitions during choreography, and maintaining visual continuity to retain design integrity through the final cut.  About Chaotic Neutral Studios:  Based in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, Chaotic Neutral Studios thrives by empowering artists and elevating brands. Specializing in branded films, music videos, photography, and visual marketing campaigns, the company fosters an environment where creative innovation meets rigorous execution.

"Riya brings the kind of creative insight and discipline that embodies what Chaotic Neutral stands for," said Darsh Thakker, CEO of Chaotic Neutral Studios. "Her design sensibility transforms conceptual ideas into tangible, emotionally resonant visuals. Bee Like Me is a testament to that synergy."
