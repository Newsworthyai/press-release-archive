# Araromi Beach &amp; Shekina City Project: A Vision for Luxury, Culture, and Sustainable Community

VANCOUVER, WA, October 10, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Along the pristine coastline, two landmark initiatives—the Araromi Beach Project and the Shekina City Project—are redefining what it means to build for the future. Far more than property developments, these projects represent bold blueprints for vibrant, self-sustaining communities where luxury, culture, innovation, and empowerment converge. Spearheaded by H.E. Amb. Rachael O. Ologodidan under the Ologo Didan Jezi Foundation Global Project and presented by the Shekina City of Help Ministry, the vision is to create destinations that enrich lives while setting new standards for African coastal development.  Luxury, Leisure, and Tourism The Araromi Beach Project promises to be a world-class luxury destination. From ocean-view chalets and boutique hotels for honeymooners to infinity pools, spas, beach bars, and fine dining, every detail has been designed to offer both relaxation and adventure. Water sports, yacht cruises, and seaside recreation create an atmosphere where leisure meets lifestyle. Beyond luxury, the project integrates cultural landmarks such as an amphitheater, art gallery, mini museum, and culture café, ensuring that visitors experience not just hospitality but heritage.  Culture, Creativity, and Entertainment Together, both projects aim to place culture at the heart of community life. Concerts, festivals, and exhibitions will find a home in purpose-built spaces, while a film village and creative centers will serve as hubs for Nollywood and African storytelling. These cultural investments make the developments more than real estate—they are platforms for creativity and identity that celebrate African pride.  Education, Health, and Social Well-being Central to Shekina City's vision is education. From nursery to university level, with vocational training embedded, the city will prepare future generations with knowledge, innovation, and employable skills. Healthcare is equally prioritized, with hospitals, medical centers, and wellness facilities planned to ensure comprehensive well-being. Social services, including an orphanage, food banks, and worship centers, will foster inclusivity, compassion, and spiritual balance.  Economy, Infrastructure, and Empowerment Both projects are designed to stimulate growth. Banks, microfinance institutions, shopping malls, and cooperative societies will power economic activity, while modern estates provide quality housing for families. Infrastructure such as access roads, helipads, cable cars, police stations, and lifeguard towers ensure safety, connectivity, and long-term sustainability. Business spaces, including the OJF Global offices, anchor the vision with opportunities for entrepreneurship and investment.  Recreation, Sports, and Family Life With family-friendly attractions like waterparks, playgrounds, and splash zones, alongside sporting arenas, golf courses, and multi-sport facilities, the communities are designed for all ages. These amenities ensure that residents and visitors alike can enjoy a balanced lifestyle that blends activity, leisure, and relaxation.  A Holistic Vision for the Future The Araromi Beach Project and the Shekina City Project stand as transformative models for what modern African coastal development can achieve. They are not simply about building structures but about creating ecosystems where luxury meets legacy, culture meets commerce, and community meets sustainability.  Together, these projects promise to be more than destinations—they will be landmarks of vision, growth, and empowerment for generations to come.
