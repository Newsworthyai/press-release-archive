# The Dairy Alliance Launches Free Grant-Writing Support Pilot to Help Dairy Farmers

ATLANTA, GA, December 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, launched a new pilot program offering free grant consulting and grant-writing support for eligible dairy farm projects through a partnership with Lasso, a grant services provider. The pilot is designed to help farms identify and secure public funding for on-farm investments without the time burden and complexity often associated with grant applications.  The program supports farmers considering equipment upgrades, infrastructure improvements, or energy and efficiency projects who may be unsure whether grant funding is available or how to navigate the application process. By reducing the administrative burden often associated with grants, the pilot helps farmers focus on sustaining their family businesses while investing in their operations for the next generation. Selected participants will receive Lasso's end-to-end support at no cost, including identifying relevant grant opportunities, preparing applications, and managing post-award requirements.  "Dairy farmers are constantly looking for innovative ways to invest in their operations, but grant funding can feel out of reach when you're already juggling everything it takes to run a farm," said Farrah Newberry, CEO of The Dairy Alliance. "By allowing Lasso to handle the heavy lifting of applying for grants, farmers can pursue avenues quicker to strengthen their business and support their local community."  Lasso works directly with farms to understand their needs and match projects with federal, state, regional, and local grant programs, including opportunities such as the Value-Added Producer Grant and the Southeast Dairy Business Innovation Initiative. Lasso reports a 90 percent success rate and has helped customers secure more than 70 grants, representing millions of dollars in funding for on-farm projects.  "Many farmers have strong project ideas but don't have the time or resources to navigate the grant process on their own," said Nicole Rojas, co-founder of Lasso. "Partnering with The Dairy Alliance allows us to remove that barrier by helping dairy farmers identify the right funding opportunities and manage the grant process from start to finish, so they can focus on running their farms and investing in their operations with confidence."  Dairy farmers interested in participating in the pilot should be open to pursuing public grant funding and have an on-farm project in mind with potential vendors or service providers identified. Participants may also be invited to take part in a high-level case study for The Dairy Alliance highlighting project type, outcomes, and the benefits of grant funding.  Farmers can learn more about the pilot and determine eligibility by contacting the Lasso team or Mekenzie Panhans at molly@joinlasso.com and (312) 833-7726 or mpanhans@thedairyalliance.com and (404)-210-4504.
