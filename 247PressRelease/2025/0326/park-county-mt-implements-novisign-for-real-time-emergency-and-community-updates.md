# Park County, MT, Implements NoviSign for Real-Time Emergency and Community Updates

MILWAUKEE, WI, March 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Park County, Montana, has implemented NoviSign Digital Signage to address communication challenges in its expansive rural region. Faced with limited internet and cell service, the county sought a reliable method to deliver essential information to residents and visitors, especially during emergencies.  NoviSign's digital signage software powers multiple screens in high-traffic grocery stores, enabling centralized management from the courthouse. This system allows for real-time updates on emergency alerts, government announcements, community events, and tourist information, effectively bridging the communication gap. The county can create, edit, and schedule content, ensuring consistent messaging and rapid updates during emergencies.  Benefits include improved real-time communication, centralized management, enhanced community engagement, and better tourist information dissemination. The deployment has transformed Park County's ability to communicate, improving emergency response and community engagement.  The ability to quickly deploy time-sensitive information ensures that all citizens are receiving critical updates, and the centralized management reduces the potential for misinformation. Furthermore, by placing these screens in regularly visited locations like grocery stores, the county ensures that even those without reliable internet or cell service have access to vital information, fostering a more informed and connected community.
