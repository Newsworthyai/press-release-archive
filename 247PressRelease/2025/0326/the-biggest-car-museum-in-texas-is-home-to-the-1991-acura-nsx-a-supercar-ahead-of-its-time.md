Inside, the driver-focused cockpit is equipped with a 9k-rpm tachometer, a 185-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and battery voltage. Luxury meets performance with automatic climate control, power windows, cruise control, and a Bose AM/FM/cassette stereo, ensuring both comfort and high-end sound quality.
