OULU, FINLAND AND NEW YORK, NY, March 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- To meet the rising demand for AI-powered solutions in media, Valossa, a pioneer in multimodal video understanding AI, is set to save time and extract new value from video and audio content with Valossa Transcribe Pro™ — the first all-in-one AI media analysis and transcription tool designed to streamline workflows, save time, and enhance media production by automating labor-intensive tasks. Valossa Transcribe Pro™ empowers content creators, owners and distributors by generating full video to text transcriptions of their media assets. Valossa Transcribe Pro™ delivers multilingual transcripts and captions, natural language video scene descriptions, video logs, tools for inspection and edits, and full time coded content metadata. With comprehensive "In-Video" search and description of everything inside video and audio, value for video production is multiplied over independent tools still requiring time consuming manual labour.   With the recently released 7th generation Valossa AI™ core, an AI that understands and describes audiovisual content like a human, companies can transcribe both audio and visual content details, streamline content strategies, and unlock new monetization opportunities while reducing operational costs. Valossa AI™ enhances asset understanding with unprecedented breadth, accuracy and efficiency through proprietary deep learning and generative AI technology for video to text generation. The solution is designed for optimal balance of quality and cost for cognitive audio and video processing and enables broad utility for several media production tasks.   For years, managing media assets has been hindered by fragmented production tool selection, low-quality metadata, a lack of nuanced, actionable insights, and inefficient large-scale analysis methods.
