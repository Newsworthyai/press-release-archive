# Samuel Zekri: Building a Cross-Continental Empire from Dubai

DUBAI, UAE, March 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A serial entrepreneur with a clear vision and unstoppable drive, Samuel Zekri has been living and thriving in the United Arab Emirates for over five years, managing multiple ventures that span from beauty innovation to real estate and financial markets. Based in Dubai, Samuel not only calls the city home but also the strategic hub from which he leads his growing portfolio of businesses across the region and beyond.  Blust On: Redefining Hair Care for Professionals  Samuel is the co-founder and CEO of Blust On Middle East, a revolutionary professional haircare and coloring brand officially launched in 2022, following more than five years of intensive development and research. The brand quickly stood out in the global market thanks to its all-encompassing approach: delivering powerful results for clients, simplified processes for salons, and cutting-edge innovation for hairstylists.  Blust On's formulas are packed with active ingredients that treat and protect the hair while coloring. Hero products like the 10-minute permanent color and vegan bleach lifting up to nine levels have established the brand as a true game-changer in the salon industry. With a firm focus on education and academy development, Blust On is supported by global ambassadors Enrique Guzman and Victor Keyrouz, alongside strong local ambassador networks in each market.  The brand is already expanding rapidly, with established operations in the UAE and Lebanon and upcoming launches in Saudi Arabia and Qatar — a testament to Samuel's strategic leadership and commitment to regional excellence.  AMPSZ Consulting: Business Connections That Matter  Alongside his work in the beauty industry, Samuel is also the founder of AMPSZ Consulting, a Dubai-based firm that bridges the gap between international suppliers and local businesses. The company provides commercial brokerage services and is actively engaged in real estate consulting, facilitating key introductions and negotiations with a focus on discretion and strategic value.  Over time, AMPSZ has positioned itself as a trusted behind-the-scenes connector, helping businesses expand, relocate, or invest in the Middle East with seamless efficiency.  Finmapi DMCC: A Passion for Financial Markets  Samuel's entrepreneurial journey is deeply rooted in his lifelong passion for the stock market. Through Finmapi DMCC, his private financial trading company, he continues to manage his personal investment portfolio, focusing on stock markets in the US and Europe. Trading has been part of his life from a young age, and Finmapi serves as the platform through which he continues this discipline with structure and vision.  Mazel Capital Group: Real Estate Investments in Spain  While the core of Samuel's activity remains in the UAE, he is also the founder of Mazel Capital Group, a real estate investment company operating in Spain. The group is actively involved in a variety of high-yield opportunities, from residential flips and auction deals to full-scale developments. Samuel and his partners also acquire distressed debt and carry out complex recovery operations.  Currently, the group is finalizing the construction and fit-out of 40 apartments in a reclaimed project that was previously illegally occupied — one of many examples of Mazel's hands-on, value-driven approach. Their focus is concentrated in key markets such as Marbella, Ibiza, and Madrid, where Samuel leverages both his expertise and network to execute profitable deals.  A Life Built in Dubai  Born and raised in Switzerland, Samuel began traveling and building businesses from a young age. Today, he resides most of the year in Dubai, where he organizes and oversees all his ventures. Though his work takes him around the world, his base in the UAE remains at the heart of his operations — a city he chose for its dynamism, connectivity, and opportunity.  From revolutionary beauty products to smart investments, Samuel Zekri's business journey continues to grow — powered by vision, strategy, and an unshakable entrepreneurial spirit.  https://mazelcapitalgroup.com/  https://ampszconsulting.ae/  https://www.finmapidmcc.ae/  https://blust-on.com/  A serial entrepreneur with a clear vision and unstoppable drive, Samuel Zekri has been living and thriving in the United Arab Emirates for over five years, managing multiple ventures that span from beauty innovation to real estate and financial markets.
