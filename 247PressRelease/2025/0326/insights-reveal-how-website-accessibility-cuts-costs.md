# INSIGHTS REVEAL HOW WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY CUTS COSTS

MIAMI, FL, March 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- WSI Your Digital Success, led by its Principal Juan Carlos Zegarra Ayllon, is suggesting that various organizations, including businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions, can significantly reduce costs simply by making websites accessible.  According to their findings, accessibility improvements can lead to significant cost savings, though the amount depends on factors like the size of the business, the level of accessibility implemented, and the legal risks avoided. Here's how:  Increased Revenue People with disabilities represent 20% of the population and have $13 trillion in disposable income. Accessible websites can increase conversion rates by up to 20% and improve SEO, leading to higher traffic and sales. In short, the cost savings come from capturing a larger audience, improving conversion rates, and reducing marketing expensesâ€”all of which stem from making websites more accessible. This opens new revenue opportunities while expanding market reach.  Reduced Customer Support Costs An accessible website reduces the need for customer support, as users can navigate independently. Studies show that businesses save up to 20% in support costs by improving user experience, cutting down on operational expenses.  Reduced Maintenance Costs WCAG-compliant websites feature cleaner, more structured code, making them easier and cheaper to maintain. By designing with accessibility in mind, businesses can avoid costly retrofitting and reduce ongoing maintenance expenses.  Preventing Legal Challenges U.S. businesses face ADA website accessibility lawsuits, with settlements averaging $5,000 to $50,000 (excluding legal fees). In some cases, litigation costs can exceed $100,000. Proactively accessible websites can help businesses prevent these legal challenges, saving significant amounts in legal expenses.  Deduction Programs Deduction programs may be available in certain countries to support businesses in making accessibility improvements. For example, in the United States, businesses can claim deductions to enhance accessibility. The Disabled Access Credit and the Architectural Barrier Removal Tax Deduction may allow businesses to offset costs associated with removing physical barriers. Consulting a tax expert is essential to ensure compliance with tax regulations.  "These findings are very attractive for any organization to consider, especially given that technology is evolving at a fast rate. Accessibility is a forward-thinking strategy that improves the digital experience for everyone while offering significant cost savings across various sectors," said Mr. Zegarra Ayllon.
