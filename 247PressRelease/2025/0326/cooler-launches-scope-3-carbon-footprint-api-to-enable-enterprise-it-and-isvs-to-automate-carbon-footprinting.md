GRAND RAPIDS, MI, March 26, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cooler, the platform enabling businesses to measure and neutralize carbon emissions in the increasingly important fight against global warming, today announced the release of its Cooler Carbon Footprint API.   Cooler's Scope 3 Carbon Footprint API is now publicly available for enterprise, IT managers, and software developers looking to integrate actionable carbon emissions estimates and data directly into their workflows, software applications, and websites. The Cooler Carbon Footprint API enables businesses to calculate the estimated carbon footprint of products and services in real-time, using its science-backed, GHG-compliant carbon calculator.  The API empowers developers to:  - Measure, store, and retrieve emissions across hundreds of product and service categories. - Integrate real-time carbon footprints into in-house, eCommerce, and customer-facing software - Integrate footprinting into Microsoft, Google, AWS, Shopify, and other platforms  "Global warming didn't simply give up when Trump took office, nor have we; over 70% of US consumers are concerned about global warming, and expect business to do something about it," said Charlie Crystle, CEO of Cooler. "With the Cooler Carbon Footprint API, we're simplifying the complex process of estimating carbon emissions, and giving businesses the power of actionable data so they can take meaningful steps toward a sustainable future while building trust with their customers."  Cooler's API is designed for seamless integration into existing platforms, from e-commerce stores and financial tools to supply chain systems. With developer-friendly documentation and scalable architecture, the API is accessible to businesses of all sizes, from startups to the Fortune 500.  On the use of AI, Crystle added, "AI does not generate reliable carbon footprints, they make guesses based on previously published data. Though Cooler uses AI for certain aspects of its platform, we do not use it within our carbon footprint calculations."
