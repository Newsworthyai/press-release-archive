Those who are ready to investigate actual options can book a school tour. The company has numerous Bay Area campuses from San Carlos (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/san-carlos/) to Hercules (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/hercules/), Irvington (Fremont) (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/irvington-fremont/) to Sunnyvale (https://www.learnandplaymontessori.com/sunnyvale/) and beyond.   Here is background on the new content. Given the fact that the Bay Area has many dual-income households, reliable childcare is not only a necessity for parents, it is also a crucial building blocks for children. Kids need a solid educational foundation, while parents want to be able to juggle their careers with the joys (and requirements) of being a parent. In particular, the updated childcare content emphasizes the manner in which the educational programs nurture children from as young as 18 months to kindergarten (availability, varying by campus) with a structured but open approach to learning. The approach is inspired by Montessori and focuses on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) learning. It provides children with exposure to important academic concepts while building social and emotional skills. Instead of "babysitting" like most traditional childcare centers, Learn And Play® Montessori School incorporates active learning, setting children up for success in preschool, kindergarten, and beyond in age-appropriate ways.  Early childhood experiences shape a child's ability to learn, adapt, and problem-solve, making high-quality childcare with structured, age-appropriate learning essential for long-term success. Exposure to foundational subjects like math, science, and language at an early age fosters academic and professional achievement.   The convenience continues as flexible hours allow working parents to drop off early and pick up late so that they can seamlessly balance professional and family life. Families can book a school tour today to see the Montessori plus STEM approach in action.
