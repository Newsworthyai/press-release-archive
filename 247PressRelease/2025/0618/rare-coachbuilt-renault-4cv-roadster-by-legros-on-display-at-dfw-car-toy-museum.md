# Rare Coachbuilt Renault 4CV Roadster by Legros on Display at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, June 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Among the dozens of rare and historic European classics featured at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, few tell a story as fascinating as the 1950 Renault 4CV Roadster by Legros. Originally introduced in 1947 as France's first post-war economy car, the Renault 4CV was the first French automobile to surpass one million units sold—but this particular example is anything but ordinary.  Wearing bespoke coachwork crafted by Belgian coachbuilder Legros, this rare roadster version features hand-formed steel body panels, dual side mirrors, a shortened windscreen, louvered deck lid, and elegant driving lamps. Painted in a rich blue finish, the car's compact charm and design details exude European flair, offering a striking counterpoint to the mass-produced saloons most people associate with the 4CV name.  Inside, the minimalist two-spoke ivory steering wheel fronts a Jaeger instrument cluster with a 120-km/h speedometer, gauges for coolant and oil temperature, fuel level, and battery charge. A five-digit odometer reads just 38,000 kilometers (~24,000 miles), underscoring its rarity and preservation.  Under the rear deck lid, a replacement 845cc Ventoux inline-four engine paired with a four-speed manual transaxle powers the car—true to its roots as an accessible, agile runabout with a flair for the unique.  "This Legros-bodied 4CV roadster is a brilliant reminder that even the most humble platforms can become rolling art when placed in the hands of a talented coachbuilder," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's one of those cars that makes you stop, smile, and ask—'Wait, what is that?'"  The Renault 4CV Roadster by Legros is now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, home to over 200 cars and 3,000 toys and collectibles.
