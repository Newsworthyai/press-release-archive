# Back to the Future, Preserved in Time: The 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 on Display in Fort Worth at the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, June 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A symbol of 1980s design and futurism, the 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 5-Speed—famous for its gullwing doors and stainless-steel body—now calls the DFW Car & Toy Museum home. This striking example remained with its original owner until 2016 and currently shows only 13,000 miles, making it a rare survivor and a true collector's dream.  Powered by a 2.85-liter V6 engine paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, the DMC-12 embodies the bold vision of Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. With its unpainted stainless-steel panels, fiberglass underbody, and Lotus-derived double-Y chassis, it delivers both futuristic flair and engineering pedigree. Exterior details include turbine-style aluminum wheels (14" front, 15" rear), gray urethane bumper caps, black side moldings, louvered engine cover, and quad headlights.  Inside, a black leather interior houses power windows, central locking, air conditioning, and an AM/FM stereo. The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and full instrumentation, including voltage, temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level.  "This DeLorean is more than just a pop culture icon—it's a snapshot of ambition and design from a bygone era," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's one of the few cars that still stops people in their tracks."  Come experience this stainless-steel sensation up close. Admission is always free, and the museum is dog-friendly.
