# BWRCI Unveils Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol to Prevent Rogue AI Behavior

CHICAGO, IL, June 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc. (BWRCI) has announced a breakthrough in AI safety: the Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol (QSAFP), the world's first known method for enforcing expiration of artificial intelligence systems using quantum cryptography and multi-party human verification.  Now officially patent pending with PCT filing in progress, the protocol marks a shift from theoretical policy to technical enforcement — giving regulators, safety organizations, and AI developers a viable way to guarantee provable system shutdowns and runtime boundaries.  "We've reached the point where trust-based AI shutdowns are no longer sufficient," said Max Davis, inventor of the protocol and Director of BWRCI, an international self-regulatory organization, (SRO). "What QSAFP delivers is a zero-trust, mathematically enforced expiration layer. It ensures AI systems can't modify their own kill switches or bypass expiration timelines. We believe this technology will quickly become essential to the future of AI governance."  Provable Safety for a Post-Trust AI Era  QSAFP works by applying quantum-generated keys and human-verified, time-bound contracts that AI systems cannot override. The result is a fail-safe protocol that's immune to self-modification, unapproved runtime extensions, or tampering — closing a critical gap in today's AI governance infrastructure.  Engagements with Quantum Security Firms Underway  As QSAFP enters the global licensing phase, BWRCI is actively engaging with quantum security companies to develop the protocol's hardware enforcement layer.  "We're now seeking quantum security partners to help scale enforcement globally," said Davis. "We welcome conversations with leading firms like ID Quantique, Qubitekk, Quantinuum, and others working at the intersection of cryptography and infrastructure."  BWRCI emphasized that any hardware partner would be selected based on alignment with global safety goals, regulatory standards, and non-proprietary integrity. Development discussions are ongoing.  Quote from Max Davis (aka author MAXBRUCE D) – A Call to Build, Not Fear  "I'm tired of watching fear chill innovation. This protocol ensures AI won't go rogue on humanity's watch, so let's build. Let's innovate with confidence, knowing that fail-safes like QSAFP exist to keep us protected."  Invitation to AI Safety Organizations and Regulatory Coalitions  BWRCI has extended invitations to AI policy coalitions, sovereign governments, and technical research bodies to evaluate QSAFP for blanket licensing, framework adoption, and compliance alignment.  "The protocol is designed to serve the industry, not dominate it," said a BWRCI spokesperson. "Its structure supports licensing models that respect sovereignty, innovation, and layered control — ideal for governments, AI think tanks, and public-private consortia alike."  About BWRCI Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc. is an international not-for-profit self-regulatory organization (SRO) that develops inclusive, secure frameworks for autonomous economies and frontier technologies. Current mandates include the Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol (QSAFP) and the People's Autonomous Economy (PAE). https://bwrci.org  About Max Davis Max Davis — pen name MAXBRUCE — is inventor of Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities (CETEs), founder of DigiPie International PBC, and author of Inclusionism: Finally! A Blueprint for the Bold Transformation of Capitalism. The Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol (QSAFP) represents his most recent work as a founding architect of the Cyberg movement — a new class of techno-humanists shaping Earth's AI future.
