# ARC Clean Technology and Deep Atomic Sign MOU to Explore Deployment of ARC-100 Nuclear Reactor for Data Centers and AI Infrastructure

WASHINGTON, DC, June 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ARC Clean Technology, a leading developer of advanced nuclear technology, and Deep Atomic, a pioneer in nuclear-powered infrastructure for high-density computing, announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly explore the deployment of ARC's advanced small modular reactor (SMR), the ARC-100, to power next-generation data centers and AI infrastructure.  Deep Atomic, a Swiss-American company, provides project development services for hyperscale and edge data centers powered by SMRs. Their expertise provides a crucial link between SMR technology and data center developers by offering planning and technology integration capabilities, including novel balance-of-plant and cooling technologies.  The MOU outlines a framework for collaboration including site identification, feasibility assessments, and engagement with potential customers across North America. The companies plan to jointly evaluate sites where ARC-100 reactors can be deployed in close proximity to Deep Atomic's hyperscale infrastructure projects.  This agreement reflects growing momentum for nuclear energy as a cornerstone of digital infrastructure planning, particularly as AI and high-performance computing workloads drive exponential increases in power demand.  "Our mission is to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear for 21st-century digital infrastructure," said William Theron, CEO at Deep Atomic. "By partnering with ARC, we can offer our customers a pathway to fully decarbonized, 24/7 energy that meets the performance, security, and sustainability needs of AI-era data centers."  The ARC-100 is a 100 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor based on a design with over 30 years of proven operating experience. Its modular design, compact footprint, and ability to deliver both electricity and high-temperature heat offer unique advantages for co-location with industrial and compute-intensive customers.  "Data centers are rapidly becoming one of the world's fastest-growing sources of electricity demand," said Bob Braun, Chief Operating Officer at ARC Clean Technology. "The ARC-100 is ideally suited for this emerging market â€” it provides 100 megawatts of safe, carbon-free power with high thermal output and reliability, making it a perfect fit for mission-critical, high-density digital infrastructure. We are extremely excited to bring together our technology with Deep Atomic's expertise in project development for the next generation of AI infrastructure."
