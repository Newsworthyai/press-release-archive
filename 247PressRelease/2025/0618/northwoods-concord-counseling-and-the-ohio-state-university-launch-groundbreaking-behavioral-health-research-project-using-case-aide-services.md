# Northwoods, Concord Counseling, and The Ohio State University Launch Groundbreaking Behavioral Health Research Project Using Case Aide Services

DUBLIN, OH, June 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Northwoods is proud to announce a new strategic partnership with Concord Counseling Services and The Ohio State University to pilot Case Aide Services in the behavioral health field—marking a significant expansion of the service beyond child welfare.   This 12-month research project, funded by a SOAR Network Innovation Grant from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS), explores how technology-enabled case aide support can reduce burnout, increase staff satisfaction, and improve service delivery in behavioral health settings.   Northwoods' Case Aide Services have already demonstrated tremendous impact in child welfare—returning valuable time to caseworkers, improving compliance, and boosting retention. The new project will evaluate whether these results can be replicated in behavioral health agencies by streamlining workflows and enabling AI-driven operational efficiencies utilizing AWS technologies.   "Concord Counseling Services is proud to partner with Northwoods and The Ohio State University College of Social Work on this exciting and innovative project," said Linda Jakes, Executive Director at Concord Counseling Services. "We believe this will provide new tools for our workforce that will improve services to our clients and reduce burnout in our staff."   The project will be evaluated by Tom Gregoire, Associate Professor at The Ohio State University College of Social Work. He will assess organizational performance before and after the implementation, measuring outcomes including staff satisfaction, turnover rates, and financial impact.   "This partnership reflects what can happen when a team is empowered by technology to rethink how work gets done," said Richie Diers, Chief Advisor at Northwoods. "We're excited to explore how these tools can help behavioral health agencies operate more efficiently while also giving more time back to their staff and clients."   The grant awarded to Concord Counseling through SOAR (Supporting Outreach, Access, and Resiliency) Network Innovation Funds supports technology innovations that advance mental health and addiction recovery services. Northwoods assisted Concord Counseling in identifying this funding opportunity, which is now fueling this collaborative, research-based initiative.   This project aligns with OhioMHAS' vision to support transformational innovation in behavioral health through people-centered, tech-enabled solutions.
