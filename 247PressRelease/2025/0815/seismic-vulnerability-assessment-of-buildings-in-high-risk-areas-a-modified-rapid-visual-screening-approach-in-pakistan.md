# Seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings in high-risk areas: A modified rapid visual screening approach in Pakistan

KNOXVILLE, TN, August 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In this study, we evaluate the seismic vulnerability of buildings in Dir City, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, using a modified rapid visual screening (RVS) approach.  In Dir City, Pakistan, the majority of structures are non-engineered and old, and were built by local masons. Based on the Building Code of Pakistan, the city falls within Seismic Zone III, and these could be vulnerable during a seismic event.  In a study (DOI:10.1016/j.jdd.2025.100018 ) published in Journal of Dynamic Disasters, a hundred randomly selected buildings, including residential, commercial, government, and religious buildings, were assessed in a (rapid visual screening) RVS survey via a modified Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) data collection form.  "The structural configuration of the surveyed buildings was diverse—unreinforced masonry, confined masonry, stone masonry, and reinforced concrete (RC) frames with unreinforced masonry (URM) infill," shares first author Khan Shahzada.  The authors used positive and negative score modifiers to assign and modify basic scores based on characteristics that increase or decrease seismic resistance in a building; low final scores indicate the need for further expert examination. The final scores were then mapped to damage grades representing potential vulnerability. Drawing on the findings, suggestions for improving the earthquake resilience of Dir City are offered.  Based on the Building Code of Pakistan, falls within Seismic Zone III.  "We recommend several actions to mitigate seismic risk and improve the seismic resilience of the buildings in Dir City," says Khan. "These recommendations focus on enforcing stricter regulations, retrofitting vulnerable structures, and fostering community engagement to build a culture of preparedness."  According to the authors, the following steps should be prioritized:  •Ensure that all new buildings, especially those located on slopes, adhere to engineering design standards to reduce seismic vulnerability.  •Prioritize retrofitting of older, non-engineered buildings, especially residential structures with a relatively high risk of severe seismic damage.  •Implement regular inspections to verify compliance with seismic safety standards and to identify necessary repairs.  •Educate residents on the importance of seismic resilience and encourage them to take steps to improve the seismic safety of their homes.  •Offer grants or low-interest loans to building owners to encourage investment in retrofitting and structural improvements.  •Create comprehensive plans that include early warning systems, earthquake drills, and the strengthening of critical infrastructure such as hospitals and schools.  •Residents should actively seek professional seismic evaluations of their buildings, invest in retrofitting, and ensure that new buildings comply with seismic resistance standards.  •Residents should acquire emergency kits, create family emergency plans, and facilitate and organize community discussions about seismic risks to build a culture of preparedness.  •Researchers should expand on Level 1 screenings by conducting highly in-depth studies on retrofitting methods, material performance, and slope stability.  •Perform studies assessing the impact of retrofitting measures and explore modern technologies such as seismic isolation systems to enhance the seismic resilience of buildings.  •Involve local stakeholders in applying research findings and improving the seismic safety of Dir City's infrastructure.
