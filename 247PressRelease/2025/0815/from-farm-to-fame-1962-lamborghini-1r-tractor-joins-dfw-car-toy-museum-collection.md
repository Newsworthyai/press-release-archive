# From Farm to Fame: 1962 Lamborghini 1R Tractor Joins DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, August 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Long before Lamborghini became synonymous with sleek supercars and roaring V12 engines, it built its legacy on tractors. Now, the DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly showcases a beautifully restored piece of that history: the 1962 Lamborghini 1R Tractor, freshly imported from Italy and now a key part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection.  Founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, Lamborghini Trattori was born out of post-war necessity—providing rugged, reliable machinery to rebuild the Italian countryside. The 1R model, produced throughout the 1960s, represents a pivotal chapter in the brand's story, long before the first Miura stunned the world.  "Every automotive story has a beginning, and this Lamborghini 1R Tractor is a rare chance to witness the brand's roots," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a beautifully engineered workhorse, and it offers visitors a whole new perspective on Lamborghini's incredible journey from farm fields to Formula 1 and beyond."  This air-cooled 1,462cc diesel twin delivers a factory-rated 26 horsepower through a three-speed dual-range manual transmission and rear portal axle, showcasing mechanical simplicity and brilliance. The tractor was refurbished in Italy before making its way to the U.S. in 2022, and now gleams with authentic Lamborghini badging, 1R decals, headlights, taillights, and a hinged engine cover.  Stopping power comes from rear drum brakes, while controls include a hand throttle, two-speed range selector, PTO selector, and independent rear brake pedals. The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a dash equipped with a Veglia oil pressure gauge and a signature Lamborghini Cento reverse-sweep tachometer.  In addition to dual rear power take-offs, the upper PTO shaft features a protective housing, showcasing the tractor's versatility for heavy-duty agricultural work in its heyday.  Visitors will now have the rare opportunity to see this authentic piece of Lamborghini's pre-supercar heritage alongside more than 200 cars and thousands of collectibles at the DFW Car & Toy Museum — one of Texas' premier free attractions for automotive enthusiasts and history buffs alike.
