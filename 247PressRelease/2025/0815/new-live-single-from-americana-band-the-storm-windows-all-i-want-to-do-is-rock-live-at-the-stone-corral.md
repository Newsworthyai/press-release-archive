# New Live Single from Americana Band The Storm Windows: "All I Want to Do (Is Rock) – Live at The Stone Corral"

BURLINGTON, VT, August 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- About "All I Want to Do (Is Rock) – Live at The Stone Corral"  In a recent review, Spin Magazine described The Storm Windows trio performing live as watching the "Folk Ramones." Here's the evidence. Recorded live at The Stone Corral in Richmond, Vermont, the trio of brothers Rob Mathews (guitar and vocals) and Don Mathews (upright bass and vocals) Mathews and drummer Erik Anderson give a high energy live rendition of one of The Storm Windows' classic songs, recorded live June 20, 2025.  The single follows the recent June release of the new studio EP "More Lucky", a set of summer anthems for 2025 that convey a message of hope tinged with a yearning for something better, and the promise of the road to try to find it.  You can see The Storm Windows perform live on August 20 at the Hague Town Beach Park in Hague, New York or at the Bravo Zero bar in North Hero Vermont on August 24.  Below are a Soundcloud link to the new single and a Spotify link to More Lucky:  All I Want to Do (Is Rock) – Live (on Soundcloud)   More Lucky EP (on Spotify)  About The Storm Windows   The Storm Windows play both showcases and bar gigs, and always have a few of each lined up. The band takes their name The Storm Windows from a song title of one of their musical heroes, John Prine, but also as an appropriate description of some veteran musicians who have weathered a few storms but are still standing and singing about it. Critics have labeled their music "New Americana – a blend of folk, rock and even jazz laced sonics."
