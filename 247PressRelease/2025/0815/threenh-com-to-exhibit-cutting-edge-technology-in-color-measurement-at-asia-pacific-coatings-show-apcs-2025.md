BANGKOK, THAILAND, August 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Guangdong Threenh Technology Co., Ltd. (3nh), precision optical measurement instruments industry leader, announced their attendance to Asia-Pacific Coatings Show (APCS) 2025. The event will take place from the 3rd to the 5th of September at the International Trade & Exhibition Center in Bangkok, Thailand. ThreeNH will be located at Booth 3F05, exhibiting the newest developments in color measurement technologies for the coatings industry.   About APCS and the Industry Context  APCS is the increasingly popular trade show for the coatings and paints industry in the Asia Pacific, attracting participants from decorative and industrial coatings, surface treatments, and other chemical formulation sectors. Due to the recent trends of faster production and increased demand for environmentally friendly solutions and aesthetic appeal, the coatings industry has faced heightened demand for precision color control and quality assurance.  ThreeNH's Role in the Coatings Industry Since color, gloss, and surface finish are important for the value of a coating, these areas must be done precisely. These concerns arise in automotive paints, industrial finishes, parquet coatings, and quasi decorative surfaces. From a client and brand loyalty perspective, visual accuracy is critical. Even the slightest change in color or sheen can result in expensive rework or rejected products. To assist professionals in accuracy for color and appearance management, ThreeNH offers a full suite of spectrophotometers, gloss meters, colorimeters, and color matching systems which go above and beyond international standards.   Live Demonstrations and Product Showcase Attendees of the 3F05 booth will listen to the live workflows of ThreeNH instruments from R and D to formulation, production and quality control. These features include: • Real-time color capture with spectrophotometers  • Measurement of gloss for different surface finishes  • Monitoring of batch consistency using high precision colorimeters • Closed loop color matching software for workflow improvement and waste minimization   These systems are tailored for surfaces, whether it be flat, curved, matte or glossy. They also incorporate the newer technologies of automated performance, analysis, and data sharing, thereby linking to digital systems.  Innovative Approaches to the Solutions of the Industry's Problems As is well-known, the coatings industry faces the problem of achieving uniformity across different sites and production pours. Numerous suppliers and changing environmental conditions hinder uniformity. ThreeNH's instruments ensure that all supply chain participants achieve repeatable, traceable, and accurate data. We automate processes with our technologies, thus minimizing human errors, and increasing reliability across different sites.   Accelerating Adaptation to Industry Change  The focus of the coatings industry is shifting towards increased sustainability and environmental responsibility, alongside fast-tracked production cycles and customization. There is swift manufacturer adaption capability with ThreeNH's instruments, all while maintaining the industry's stringent quality benchmarks. We support innovation to manufacture with greater automated control, cleaner, and more efficient coating processes.
