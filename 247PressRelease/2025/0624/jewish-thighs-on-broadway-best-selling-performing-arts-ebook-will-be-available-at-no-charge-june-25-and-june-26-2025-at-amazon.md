# Jewish Thighs On Broadway, Best Selling Performing Arts Ebook, Will Be Available At No Charge June 25 And June 26, 2025 At Amazon

WILMINGTON, NC, June 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway: Misadventures of a Little Trouper,' Penny Orloff's bestselling comedy ebook, will be available at no charge June 25 and 26, 2025 at Amazon.  The ebook version of 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway' has achieved bestseller status in a number of categories: Comedy, Biographies of Comedians, Humorous Literary Fiction, and Theatre Biographies.  We are fascinated with celebrities, and their glamorous public personas, luxurious lifestyles, and seemingly perfect lives as portrayed in the media. This fascination often results from a lack of understanding about the realities of their lives. Most fans have an idealized and incomplete view of what life is truly like for these public figures. Orloff lays this bare for the world to see in a way that is both revealing and utterly hilarious.  "Jewish Thighs is a quirky, funny first-person story, based on slightly fictionalized true events involving famous people," Orloff stated. "It's a good thing most of them never recognized themselves! A few did... Some were flattered, some stopped speaking to me, others were mad at me because they felt left out! Like The Devil Wears Prada, it's a love-hate mixture of celebration and revenge, leveled at a very sparkly profession with a very dark underside."  Orloff's novel is populated by an oddball immigrant family, on-again-off-again lovers, diets from Hell, and a Rogue's Gallery from the Showbiz underworld; and every scene has readers laughing out loud.  Orloff's one-woman show, inspired by the novel, played to standing ovations and critical acclaim, including sold-out houses and rave reviews for its premiere in the Seattle Fringe Theater Festival in March, 2000. The show toured the U.S. for a decade, including a successful off-Broadway run in 2005. That show is now back on the road.  Abigail Paine, born Miriam Rosen, has been in love with Showbiz and the performing arts since childhood, perpetually fantasizing herself as the Little Trouper Who Finds Stardom and True Love by the end of the movie. After a hundred shows and a hundred one-night stands, love and fame still elude her, and she'd rather eat cyanide than face another audition. Complicating her search for the Busby Berkeley ending is her primitive alter-ego: The Beast. This creature can track, kill, dismember, and devour an entire cheesecake; and kick the stuffing out of smaller muggers on the sidewalks of New York. When Abigail finds love at long last, she is faced with an agonizing choice: Showbiz or The Guy. As she laments, "Breaking into this Business is like breaking into Fort Knox; breaking out, we're talking Alcatraz."  The ebook version of the novel will be available free of charge June 25 and 26th, 2025, at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Thighs-Broadway-Misadventures-Trouper-ebook/dp/B0DTC15NGZ/ref=sr_1_1?.  Metropolitan Opera Leading Tenor Jacques Trussel called 'Jewish Thighs on Broadway', "Ravishingly descriptive and continuously entertaining... the best book I have ever read on this subject... incredible warmth, wit, charm... Brilliant!"  Theater Puget Sound's review said, " . . . passionate. . . Wonderfully evocative language, lots of humor, tears where they belong...thoroughly enjoyable."  One Amazon reviewer wrote, "Fun book! I highly recommend it. Characters are bigger than life, and delightfully screwball. Everyone's Jewish family nightmare! Lots of laughs." Another stated, "No doubt the most fun I've had reading for many years. Read it and laugh!"  Penny Orloff is available for media interviews and can be reached at Penny@pennyorloff.com.
