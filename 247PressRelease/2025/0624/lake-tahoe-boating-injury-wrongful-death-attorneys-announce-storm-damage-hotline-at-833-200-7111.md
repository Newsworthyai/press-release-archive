# Lake Tahoe Boating Injury &amp; Wrongful Death Attorneys Announce Storm Damage Hotline at (833) 200-7111

TAHOE, CA, June 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Wagner Law Group is opening up their Injury Hotline to victims of the intense storm that occurred on 06/21/2025 on Lake Tahoe. Storm conditions including high winds estimated to exceed 30 knots and wind waves exceeding 8 feet came up abruptly leaving many boaters on the water and unprepared for the severity of the storm. These types of conditions can happen quickly and the waves can grow in size and intensity very quickly. People who aren't experienced at operating vessels in these conditions are more susceptible to being injured or killed as a result of these conditions, especially if they aren't boat owners.  At approximately 3 p.m. on Saturday multiple agencies responded to reports of approximately 10 people in the water at Lake Tahoe after the vessel they were on capsized. At this time not all of the facts are available but it is believed that six people lost their lives while another 2 are still missing. 2 people were rescued by first responders and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. "This is a tragedy, like all tragedies it is important to examine the facts and determine how this could have been avoided. It is equally important to make certain that if someone else is responsible for the loss of life, property damage or injuries that they are held accountable," says Buth Wagner, Personal Injury Lawyer & Founder of The Wagner Law Group.  Wrongful death attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have collected hundreds of millions of dollars for accident victims including boating accidents. This particular incident involved a 27-foot Chris Craft vessel carrying approximately 10 people. According to the U.S. Coast Guard the condition of the 2 people who were taken to the hospital is unknown or not being released at this time. For the 2 people who are still missing the chances of survival are considering the overnight low Saturday into Sunday brought the snow level down to 8500 feet. The water temperature is estimated to be in the upper 50's, people who aren't wearing protective gear to combat the cold would likely suffer hypothermia if they were still in the water overnight.  "We still don't know the fall out from this severe weather phenomenon. There could be other capsized boats and other people hurt or killed that weren't visible to witnesses. The property damage associated with all of the boats colliding or washing up on shore is still yet to be determined. It will take time to sort out how this tragedy could have been minimized and who may be to blame for any unsafe or irresponsible behavior," says Wagner. Butch and his team have opened up their Personal Injury Lawyer Hotline to anybody affected by this severe storm.  With near freezing conditions overnight on 06/21/2025 going into 06/22/25 it's hard to know the final outcome for the 2 known people in the water and whether or not there are more unknown victims.
