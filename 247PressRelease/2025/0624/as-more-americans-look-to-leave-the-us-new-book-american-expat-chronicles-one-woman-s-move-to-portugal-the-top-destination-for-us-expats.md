# As More Americans Look to Leave the US, New Book, American Expat, Chronicles One Woman's Move to Portugal — the Top Destination for US Expats

SANTA LUZIA, PORTUGAL, June 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With rising numbers of Americans considering a move abroad, Portugal has emerged as the #1 destination for US expats — thanks to its lower cost of living, welcoming culture, and laid-back lifestyle.  But what is it really like to pull up stakes and start over in a foreign country — especially at 62 and solo?  Barbara Grassey's new book, American Expat: Moving Abroad Solo After 60, answers that question with humor, honesty, and practical insight. Officially launching June 24th on Amazon, the memoir takes readers behind the dream and into the reality of making the leap.  "It's not so much Eat, Pray, Love — it's more Move, Panic, Adapt," says Grassey. "Moving abroad is exciting — but it's also challenging, messy, and sometimes lonely. What I hope readers take away is that reinvention is possible at any age — and that community and curiosity make all the difference."  Driven by everything from political tensions to affordability concerns to quality of life, more Americans — especially women over 50 — are seeking new beginnings overseas. Grassey's story resonates with this growing audience of "life reinventers."  Told in the breezy, conversational style of her popular Substack My Expat Golden Girl Life, the book offers both entertainment and practical takeaways, including:  • How to navigate visas, logistics, finances, and the emotional rollercoaster of moving abroad • The realities of life in Portugal — beyond Instagram-perfect shots • Tips and encouragement for midlife and older adults looking to reinvent their lives  American Expat: Moving Abroad Solo After 60 is available now on Amazon in paperback and ebook formats.  About the Author:  Barbara Grassey is a writer, editor, and book coach who moved from Florida to Portugal at age 62. She writes the Substack My Expat Golden Girl Life, where she shares stories and resources for Americans exploring life abroad and midlife reinvention.
