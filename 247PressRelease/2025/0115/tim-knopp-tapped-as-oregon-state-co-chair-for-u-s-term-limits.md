# Tim Knopp Tapped As Oregon State Co-Chair For U.S. Term Limits

WASHINGTON, DC, January 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, U.S. Term Limits announces that former State Senator Tim Knopp has agreed to be the Oregon State Co-Chair for U.S. Term Limits. Knopp brings a depth of both private and public service to this role. He has long advocated for term limits at the federal level and will work tirelessly in his role as Oregon State Co-Chair to see that Oregon adopts a resolution in support of common-sense term limits. Knopp is succeeding Alek Skarlatos who was elected to the Oregon State House in November.  "I am honored to serve as the Oregon State Co-Chair for U.S. Term Limits," said Tim Knopp. "Now more than ever before, the need for term limits is crystal clear. Polls show that one issue that unites all Oregonians regardless of political affiliation is the need for congressional term limits.   "For many, serving in Congress has become a lifelong entitlement rather than a public service," concluded Knopp. "Term limits will help improve accountability, diversify Congress, and make government work better for all Americans. I look forward to working with my Co-Chair Andrew Kalloch on one issue that brings all voters together."  "We are honored to have Tim leading our efforts in Oregon along with Andrew Kalloch to pass term limits for Congress," said Philip Blumel, President of U.S. Term Limits. "Under their guidance, I am confident we will get our term limits resolution passed in Oregon."  Tim Knopp served 18 years in the Oregon Legislature, serving in the House and the Senate. Knopp served in leadership positions in both chambers.   He is known for his unwavering commitment to protecting our Constitutional rights, promoting fiscal responsibility, supporting small businesses and a champion of term limits for elected officials.   Tim Knopp is a native Oregonian who has lived in Central Oregon for over 45 years.  U.S. Term Limits is the largest grassroots term limits advocacy group in the country. We connect term limits supporters with their legislators and work to pass term limits at all levels of government, particularly on the U.S. Congress. Find out more at termlimits.org.
