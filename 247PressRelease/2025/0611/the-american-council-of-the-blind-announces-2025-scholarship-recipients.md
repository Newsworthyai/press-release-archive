# The American Council of the Blind Announces 2025 Scholarship Recipients

ALEXANDRIA, VA, June 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The American Council of the Blind (ACB), in partnership with the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB), is proud to announce the 2025 recipients of its national scholarship program. This year, 24 students who are legally blind from across the United States have been awarded scholarships totaling over $111,400 to support their post-secondary education.  Established in 1982, the ACB Scholarship Program is one of the most significant financial aid resources available to legally blind students. With support from AFB and other generous partners, ACB awards scholarships ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 to students attending technical colleges, entering their freshman year, or pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees.  The scholarships can be used to offset the cost of tuition, fees, room and board, adaptive technology, and other educational expenses.  "ACB's scholarship program expands access to higher education for blind and visually impaired students," said ACB Executive Director Scott Thornhill. "These scholarships represent more than financial support â€” they're a recognition of each student's potential, talent, and dedication."  To be eligible, applicants must be legally blind, maintain a 3.0 GPA for most scholarships, and be enrolled full-time, or part-time while working at least 32 hours per week. Recipients must also demonstrate involvement in their school and local communities and be attending a post-secondary institution within the United States.  Brock Kitterman, a three-time scholarship recipient from Huntingdon, Tennessee, is studying computer science, mathematics, and philosophy at the University of Alabama. "Receiving this scholarship fills me with immense joy as it allows me to focus solely on my education without worrying about finances," said Brock. "It lets me make the most of the four short years I have at the university and be prepared for my career once I graduate."
