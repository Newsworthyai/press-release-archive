# HIGHER Corporation Selected as 'Baby Unicorn' for Global Growth of HILO WAVE®, Medi-Order, and Higher-Link

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, June 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- HIGHER Corporation, an innovative medical device startup, has been selected as a 'Baby Unicorn' by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and recognized as a 'First Penguin' company by the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund. These honors confirm the company's advanced technology and strong business potential, highlighting its promising future as a global unicorn.  The 'Baby Unicorn' program is a key government initiative focused on identifying and nurturing high-potential startups poised for global success. By providing tailored support, funding opportunities, and strategic guidance, the program aims to accelerate the growth of innovative companies and help them become future unicorns. This year's selection process was highly competitive, reflecting the increasing dynamism of the Korean startup ecosystem. Notably, the presence of multiple companies from Daegu among the selected highlights the city's rising reputation as a hub for technological advancement and entrepreneurial innovation. This momentum underscores the region's growing contributions to the national innovation landscape and its potential to drive future economic growth.  Founded in 2021, HIGHER Corporation operates three main business units: Medi-Order, a medical device order platform; HigherLink, a beauty medical network; and its core product, HILO WAVE®, an advanced collagen booster.  HILO WAVE® is a next-generation bio-stimulator based on a dual-formulation of low- and high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, designed to promote collagen and elastin production. Unlike conventional fillers, which primarily add volume, it uses hyaluronic acid to safely stimulate the skin's natural regeneration process from within. Approved as a Class 4 medical device by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, HILO WAVE® safely and effectively improves skin elasticity, hydration, and creates natural volume, delivering immediate and lasting results, earning high trust from medical professionals.  HIGHER Corporation's global business value is a key strength. The company has secured supply contracts worth approximately 13 billion KRW with major Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, contingent on medical device approvals. In Hong Kong and Japan, where Korean medical device approval serves as a reference, direct imports and exports have already begun. Additionally, export agreements are being negotiated with Brazil and China based on pending approvals, with a projected contract value exceeding 20 billion KRW. The company is also preparing for CE MDR certification to enter the European market, strengthening its global competitiveness and expanding its presence in the worldwide aesthetic medical device market.  The Ministry of SMEs and Startups supports Baby Unicorn companies with up to 300 million KRW in market development funds and up to 5 billion KRW in special guarantees from the Korea Technology Finance Corporation. This year, a performance-linked guarantee system was introduced, providing additional guarantees without separate reviews upon achieving follow-up investment or sales milestones. The program also offers global IR, participation in technology expos, and collaboration with KOTRA for overseas market entry.  A HIGHER Corporation representative stated, "Being selected as both a First Penguin and a Baby Unicorn company officially validates our innovative technology and sustainable growth potential. Leveraging HILO WAVE® and our global business value, we will strengthen our position in domestic and international aesthetic markets and strive to become a leading global unicorn."
