# A Restored Revolution: 1971 Datsun 240Z Coupe Highlights Z-Car History at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, June 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A legendary sports car with a rich backstory and a role in automotive history is now part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum: the 1971 Datsun 240Z Coupe, a beautifully restored Series 1 model that helped pave the way for Nissan North America's famed Vintage Restoration Program of the 1990s.  Originally restored in 1992 by the renowned Pierre Z Car Center, this particular 240Z gained notoriety for its role in the proposal that led to Nissan's official restoration initiative—during which approximately 37 vintage Z-cars were acquired, restored, and sold through select dealerships. With appearances in Road & Track (February 1997) and Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car (December 2007), it's not just a showpiece—it's a symbol of Z-car preservation.  Under the hood, the car is powered by a 2.4-liter L24 inline-six—a replacement engine rebuilt and installed during its 1992 restoration—delivering 151 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque through a four-speed manual transmission. Enhancements include a tubular exhaust header, electronic distributor conversion, and a 280Z-sourced fuse block, making it as reliable as it is authentic.  "This 240Z is far more than a beautiful coupe—it helped shape how vintage Japanese sports cars are restored and celebrated today," says Ron Sturgeon. "It's an honor to have such a historically significant car in our museum."  Additional features that mark it as a Series 1 model include the distinctive vents below the rear hatch glass, front and rear bumper guards, and color-matched aftermarket mirrors. Inside, the cabin sports factory instrumentation with a 160-mph speedometer, 8k-rpm tachometer, and center-mounted gauges for oil pressure, fuel level, coolant temperature, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows just 34,000 miles.  Experience a true turning point in Z-car history at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, where over 200 classic and collectible vehicles and more than 3,000 vintage toys are on display—all with free admission.
