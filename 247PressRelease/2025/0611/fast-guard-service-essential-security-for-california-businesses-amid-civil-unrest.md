# Fast Guard Service: Essential Security for California Businesses Amid Civil Unrest

LOS ANGELES, CA, June 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With the deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles following days of unrest sparked by ICE-related operations, California businesses are once again facing the critical need to protect property, people, and peace. Fast Guard Service, a nationwide leader in emergency response and security guard services, is stepping forward with boots on the ground to deliver urgent, professional protection during uncertain times.  The situation bears stark similarities to the 2020 George Floyd protests, which escalated into widespread demonstrations, looting, and property damage, ultimately costing U.S. cities over $2 billion in insured damages. While most protests remain peaceful, the potential for disruption to business operations is high, particularly in densely populated and high-profile commercial zones like Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego.  "Security today is not just about presence; it's about preparedness and trust," said Roderick C. Payne Jr President at Fast Guard Service. "When curfews and emergency deployments aren't enough, businesses turn to us for protection that's immediate, reliable, and tailored to their evolving needs."  From high-rise properties to retail districts and essential infrastructure, Fast Guard Service provides armed and unarmed guards, fire watch teams, and mobile surveillance units across California. Their rapid deployment model is backed by a 24/7 operations center, GPS-tracked patrols, and real-time reporting via the Fast Guard App.  As public demonstrations grow in scale and unpredictability, many California businesses are finding traditional measures insufficient. The presence of trained, licensed guards can de-escalate tense encounters, ensure compliance with fire marshal regulations, and deter opportunistic crime.  Fast Guard Service is a nationwide provider of on-demand security solutions including armed and unarmed guards, fire watch, mobile surveillance, and executive protection. Operating in all 50 states and trusted by Fortune 500 companies, Fast Guard has a decade-long track record of delivering security when it matters most.
