# New Memoir "What On Earth Are We Doing?" Offers a Raw and Restorative Message of Faith for the Brokenhearted

CIRCLE MOUNT, MN, July 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When tragedy strikes, faith is often shaken. But in her transformative new memoir What On Earth Are We Doing?, author Allison Shawn reminds readers that faith can also be the foundation that rebuilds a life from the rubble. After a life-threatening accident, a failing marriage, and a series of devastating health battles, Allison found herself broken—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet, she chose to rise.  Her book chronicles her extraordinary journey through suffering, surrender, and seven life-changing decisions that became the framework of healing. Far from a traditional "self-help" read, this memoir resonates with anyone struggling and looking for real hope and real faith, for real life.  "I didn't write this to preach," says Shawn. "I wrote it as encouragement, that as long as you are still breathing, then God has a purpose and good plans for you, if you choose to accept His invitation."  What On Earth Are We Doing? invites readers of all backgrounds to examine their own crossroads and reimagine how trials can shape legacy and purpose. The book also introduces Shawn's concept of being F.I.T. for Real Life™—living with Faith, Integrity, and Trust.  Published by [Insert Publisher], the book is available on Amazon and other major platforms. Allison also offers mentoring and faith-based resources through her website.
