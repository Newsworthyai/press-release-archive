# Creative Biolabs to Host Webinar on Next-Generation Tumoroid-on-a-Chip Technology

SHIRLEY, NY, July 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Creative Biolabs will host an online webinar on August 22, 2025, at 12:00 PM EDT, focusing on the tumoroid-on-a-chip platform—a microfluidic-based 3D tumor model that aims to provide more physiologically relevant conditions for preclinical testing. The session will be presented by Dr. Mohsen Akbari, an Associate Professor from the University of Victoria and the Director of the Laboratory for Innovations in Microengineering (LiME), which focuses on tumor microenvironment modeling and tissue engineering.  Register Now This webinar is open to researchers and professionals in oncology, drug development, and related fields. Don't miss this opportunity to explore how microfluidic platforms are revolutionizing cancer research.  3D tumor systems have become vital in early-stage drug development and immunotherapy screening due to the advanced need for precise and reliable cancer models. While conventional 2D cultures are limited in replicating tumor complexity, next-generation models—such as tumoroid-on-a-chip—offer a more representative in vitro environment by incorporating key structural and cellular features of solid tumors. These systems allow for more accurate assessment of drug response and have the potential to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical practice.  Key Topics to Be Covered Evolution from multi-compartment tumor chips to high-throughput tumoroid-on-plate systems Strategies to incorporate cellular heterogeneity and ECM complexity Immunotherapy screening under near-physiological conditions Applications in preclinical drug testing and personalized oncology  About the Speaker Dr. Mohsen Akbari's research focuses on microengineering, biomaterials, tumor-on-a-chip platforms, and biofabrication. Dr. Akbari has authored over 140 peer-reviewed articles and serves on the editorial boards of Biofabrication, Micromachines, and other journals. His work has been recognized through several fellowships and has been featured by major media outlets including BBC News, Science Daily, and CBC.  Creative Biolabs' 3D Tumor Modeling Portfolio In support of oncology research and therapeutic development, Creative Biolabs specializes in engineering high-fidelity human tumors with high fidelity for advanced oncology and drug development, offering a comprehensive portfolio of 3D tumor modeling platforms such as: • Ex Vivo Tissue Models • Precision-Cut Tissue Slicing Models • 3D Spheroid Models • 3D Organoid Models • Organ-on-a-Chip Models  These platforms enable researchers to evaluate drug responses under conditions that better reflect the in vivo tumor microenvironment, particularly in the context of immuno-oncology and combination therapy studies.
