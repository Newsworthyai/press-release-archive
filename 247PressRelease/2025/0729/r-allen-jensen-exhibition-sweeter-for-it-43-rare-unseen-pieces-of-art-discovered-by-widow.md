# R. Allen Jensen Exhibition "Sweeter for It": 43 Rare, Unseen Pieces of Art Discovered by Widow

SEATTLE, WA, July 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It is with reverence that you're invited to a landmark exhibition celebrating the extraordinary body of work by R. Allen Jensen, on August 9 and 10, 2025.  Jensen's art is a bold meditation on life's most profound certainty — death — not as a shadow to flee, but as a companion to walk beside. Jensen met this call with grace and fire, creating works that confront our final passage with both fearless inquiry and exquisite craft.  In a century marked by the upheavals of pandemic, the turbulence of natural and man-made disasters, and the passing of an entire generation, we are called once more to ask: How do we live fully, knowing we must one day let go?  Jensen answered that question with beauty and honesty: "Be absolute for death. Either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter." — William Shakespeare  We hope you will join us to witness this powerful culmination of vision and devotion. The event will be held at Blackwall Studios, located at 5815 Pioneer Highway, Stanwood, WA, 98292, from 1:00 to 4:30 PM, Saturday and Sunday.  50% of the proceeds will go to The R. Allen Jensen Foundation, actively supporting students and artists utilizing workspaces to create. RAllenJensen.com  Please mark your calendars for what promises to be an unforgettable experience.  With sincerity and anticipation, Susanna "Z" Mantis Curator, publicist, and widow  Contact Z for interviews and an early showing: 360-333-5113  Exclusive Pre-Funk Friday, 8/8, 5:30 to 7:00 PM Hosted by the Tafoyas, displaying the largest private body of work by Jensen, spanning decades.
