# Jaime Raskulinecz of Next Generation Trust Company Explains Investing in Tax Liens and Tax Deeds Through a Self-Directed IRA

ROSELAND, NJ, July 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jaime Raskulinecz, CEO of Next Generation Trust Company, has published an article in her Forbes Finance Council column titled "Investing in Tax Liens and Tax Deeds Through a Self-Directed IRA." In the article, she outlines how self-directed investors can include this alternative asset within their retirement accounts to further diversify their portfolios and generate passive income.   "Tax liens are an aspect of real estate investment that people may not realize they can include in their self-directed IRA or solo 401(k) plan," said Raskulinecz, a long-time Forbes Finance Council member and contributor. This spring, in recognition of her expertise, she was chosen to be a Retirement Planning Member Leader to share insights and help individuals and financial professionals build wealth while maximizing tax advantages through self-direction.  Her firm specializes in custodial and full-service administrative services for self-directed IRAs (SDIRAs) as well as client education about the many different alternative assets allowed in these plansâ€”including tax lien certificates and tax lien deeds.  In the article, Raskulinecz explains tax liens and how they relate to real estate as an asset class, details the differences between the two investments (certificates and deeds), and explains how the SDIRA makes money through these investments. She also provides a cautionary note about avoiding self-dealing (a prohibited transaction) to stay within IRS investment guidelines.   "Compared to many other types of real estate investments, tax liens are relatively short term, held for a year or a few years, which may be attractive to some investors," noted Raskulinecz. "The investment income stays within the tax-advantaged account and can be used to invest in other tax liens or other alternative assets self-directed plans allow."
