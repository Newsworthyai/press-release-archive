# 6 Degrees Media Dollar4Dollar Program -- Matching Every Client $1 to Sliding Scale Services for Small Businesses

DALLAS, TX, July 29, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- 6 Degrees Media, a women-led digital growth firm, today announced two parallel impact commitments:  Dollar4Dollar Equity Access Program – For every dollar a client spends, the firm matches one dollar in professional marketing services for founders who meet income-eligibility guidelines and have historically lacked access to high‑level strategy.  St. Jude Partnership – A portion of the program's first‑year matched service capacity will be converted into a direct cash donation of $5,000 to support creator Ryan Trahan's "50 States in 50 Days" fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  "Innovative ideas shouldn't stall because strategic marketing is out of financial reach. Our clients can drive their own results while powering another founder's journey—and now, together, we can help kids fighting cancer through Ryan's inspiring campaign."  - LaNell Angerstein, Founder and CEO of 6 Degrees Media.  How 6 Degrees' Dollar4Dollar Equity Access Program Works • One‑to‑One Match – Each client dollar billed is matched with an equal service credit for an eligible founder up to $250,000 per year. • Transparent Eligibility – Founders share documentation demonstrating limited financial resources. • Tailored Roadmaps – Selected businesses receive customized strategy, creative assets, and growth coaching.  Initial Commitment 6 Degrees Media has allocated up to $250,000 in matched service capacity through 2026, with a goal of supporting at least 5+ founders in the first year.  About "50 States in 50 Days" YouTuber Ryan Trahan and wife Haley are visiting every U.S. state in 50 days, filming daily episodes while rallying viewers to donate for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The effort has already raised more than $7 million for pediatric cancer research and care.
