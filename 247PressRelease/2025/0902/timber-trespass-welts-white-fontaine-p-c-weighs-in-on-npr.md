# Timber Trespass? Welts, White, &amp; Fontaine, P.C. Weighs In on NPR

NASHUA, NH, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tree law is a little-known subsector of civil, premises liability, and real estate law, but it's one that can cost violators a surprising amount of money. Attorney Israel Piedra, a lead personal injury lawyer at Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C., specializes in timber trespass matters. Recently, he appeared on NPR's Morning Edition to discuss a recent case on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. One neighbor faces criminal charges after cutting down his neighbor's trees to improve his property's view. The timber trespass may have boosted his property value, listed at nearly $10 million, but may end up costing the amateur lumberjack dearly.  Mr. Piedra notes that "timber trespass" cases are fairly common in New England, but many instances are simply due to confusion over property lines and failure to conduct a property survey before removing trees. Piedra pointed out that the Nantucket incident reached a "level of egregiousness" closer to a recent Maine case in which trees were poisoned, rather than razed. Most commonly, tree trespass involves "a neighbor not knowing where the property line is, or perhaps even potentially knowing that [a tree] is probably on their neighbor's property, but plowing ahead and sticking their head in the sand and cutting down the trees anyway," says Piedra.  Timber trespass cases can get surprisingly complicated; Mr. Piedra estimates that he is currently working on about two dozen active tree law cases across the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont. He does note that few of these cases will result in criminal charges. More often, the victim must seek recourse through a civil lawsuit. Piedra, and the rest of Welts, White & Fontaine's southern New Hampshire personal injury lawyers, focus on recovery of compensation for those injured by the negligence of others.  Tree law and timber trespass often involve thousands of dollars, heightened emotions, and the complex issues of property law.
