# Sasha Moore Wins 2025 Siegfried &amp; Jensen Truth, Justice, and Fairness Scholarship

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sasha Moore's scholarship video for Siegfried & Jensen's Truth, Justice, and Fairness Scholarship spoke candidly about how exhausting it can be to navigate the civil system. Moore, a victim of someone else's vehicular negligence, will have to deal with chronic pain for the rest of her life as a result of that misconduct.  However, Moore isn't one to sit idle when she can use her experience to help others. She hopes that by getting her M.B.A. at Western Governors University, she can facilitate professional connections that make it easier for accident victims to get the medical care they need and to connect with attorneys who care about their well-being.  It's in light of Moore's commitment to improved victim support that the team with Siegfried & Jensen chooses to award her this year's Truth, Justice, and Fairness Scholarship. As this year's scholarship winner, Moore receives $2,500 to dedicate toward her final semester at Western Governors University.  "Completing my M.B.A. will be a dream fulfilled," says Moore, recalling in her video the many obstacles she's overcome to make it to this point in her academic career. Following her imminent graduation, she plans to transition into the healthcare field, where she hopes that her M.B.A. will make it easier for her to facilitate smoother day-to-day operations in medical facilities.  Moore believes strongly that victims of today's personal injury accidents should have true advocates on their side who take their losses seriously, whether they involve serious injuries or long-term illnesses. In her video, she notes that having such a strong ally on her side throughout her recovery may have made it easier for her to fight for a settlement that addressed all of her losses.  Students interested in applying for next year's Truth, Justice, and Fairness Scholarship can follow Moore's example and begin composing videos that discuss today's civil system and how the law can benefit disenfranchised communities.
