# The Office of Count Jonathan of Aquitaine Affirms International Framework for the Centre for Education and Diplomacy in Avignon

AVIGNON, FRANCE, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Office of Count Jonathan of Aquitaine, serving under the sovereign authority of HRH Thomas ll, Grand Duke of Aquitaine, today issued a communiqué reaffirming the mission of the Centre for Education and Diplomacy in Avignon. Established in August 2025, the Centre represents a lasting commitment to education, cultural dialogue, and humanitarian service, now explicitly framed within the world's most important charters and conventions of international law.  Grounded in the Republic of Aquitaine's Sovereignty  The Republic of Aquitaine, a sovereign non-state government with a constitutional framework and international legal instruments authenticated under the Hague Apostille Convention, provides the authority under which the Centre operates. In alignment with the Republic's mission of education, diplomacy, and humanitarian service, the Centre is designed to advance peaceful cooperation between peoples while contributing to international cultural life.  Aligned with the United Nations Charter  The Centre situates its mission within the United Nations Charter (1945), particularly Article 1, which establishes the purposes of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations among nations, and achieving international cooperation in solving cultural, educational, and humanitarian challenges. By embracing these principles, the Republic of Aquitaine ensures that the Centre reflects not merely aspiration but compliance with binding purposes of the international order.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  The Centre also affirms the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):  Article 26 guarantees the right to education.  Article 27 guarantees the right to participate in cultural life.  These provisions affirm the Centre's dual role as both an educational and cultural institution, echoing the Republic of Aquitaine's long-standing commitment to human dignity.  The Sustainable Development Goals  The Centre acknowledges the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, focusing particularly on:  SDG 4 – Quality Education  SDG 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions  SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals  These goals establish an internationally recognized framework to which the Centre's initiatives naturally contribute, reinforcing the Republic of Aquitaine's global engagement.  UNESCO and the European Cultural Convention  The Centre's mission also harmonizes with the Constitution of UNESCO (1945), which charges the world community with advancing collaboration through education, science, and culture to foster peace.  As an institution located in Europe, the Centre draws additional grounding from the European Cultural Convention (1954), which commits its members to safeguard and encourage cultural cooperation across the continent. Situated in Avignon, a city with centuries of diplomatic history, the Centre embodies this European commitment.  Tradition of Hague-Based Legal Instruments  The Republic of Aquitaine's authority is reinforced by its adherence to Hague-based instruments, including the Hague Apostille Convention (1961), which authenticates legal acts across borders. This tradition of lawful documentation underscores the Centre's legitimacy within the framework of international legal order.  Pillars of the Centre  The Centre for Education and Diplomacy advances its mission under three pillars:  Education – promoting access to knowledge across cultures and strengthening intellectual cooperation.  Diplomacy – offering a forum for dialogue that strengthens mutual respect among nations and peoples.  Humanitarian Service – supporting cultural and charitable endeavors consistent with international law and human rights.  Statement from the Office  "The Centre for Education and Diplomacy in Avignon reflects the enduring mission of the Republic of Aquitaine: to advance education, diplomacy, and humanitarian service within the lawful frameworks that bind the international community. By grounding itself in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UNESCO's constitutional mandate, the Sustainable Development Goals, and Europe's cultural conventions, the Centre is not only an initiative of our Republic but also a partner in the shared responsibility of building peace and understanding."
