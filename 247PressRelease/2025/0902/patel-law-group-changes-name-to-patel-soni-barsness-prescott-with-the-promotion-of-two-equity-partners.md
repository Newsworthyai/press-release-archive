DALLAS, TX, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Patel Law Group, a leading Texas-based boutique law firm, today announced they will be changing their name to PSBP Law, also known as Patel, Soni, Barsness, & Prescott as a result of two existing partners moving up to become equity partners in the firm.  Chris Prescott has been a partner leading the firm's immigration department and Chris Barsness has been a partner leading the firm's corporate and securities department, both of whom are now equity partners alongside Rakesh Patel, Anish Patel, and Shameer Soni. The firm will be rebranding and transitioning to the new name over the next few months.  Chris Prescott, originally a solicitor in the U.K., brings over 15 years of immigration experience to his practice. He represents clients across the U.S. in employment-based matters such as H-1B, L-1, and E-2 visas, as well as family-based cases including spousal petitions and naturalization.  With over 24 years of experience, Chris Barsness is a corporate and securities lawyer that focuses his practice on business transactions, complex financings, investment funds, M&A, and securities matters. He moved from California to join the firm 4 years ago.  "This change shows the dedication we have to continue to expand and grow our client base and strive to exceed our client's expectations in the areas of asset protection, estate planning, immigration, securities, mergers and acquisitions, real estate transactions, and investment funds. Existing clients will still see the exact same excellence in service that they received with Patel Law Group over the years, but just under a new name. We are excited and grateful to be adding such stellar partners to our team," said partner Rakesh Patel, who leads the EB-5 investment visa immigration practice at the firm.
