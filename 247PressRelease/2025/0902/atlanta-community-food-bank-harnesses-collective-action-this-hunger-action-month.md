# Atlanta Community Food Bank Harnesses Collective Action this Hunger Action Month

ATLANTA, GA, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- September is Hunger Action Month, and the Atlanta Community Food Bank, one of the nation's largest food banks, is calling on community members to step up and join the fight against hunger. Food insecurity in America has reached its highest rate in over a decade, reaching over 47 million people facing hunger, including 14 million children. In Georgia, 1 in 7 people and 1 in 5 children are food insecure. The Food Bank and other Feeding America organizations are joining forces to drive awareness about food insecurity and how individuals, businesses, and organizations can help.   With the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in history now signed into law, food and health care will soon be further out of reach for millions of people. Hunger in America is a crisis—and together, we can meet this moment.  "Now more than ever, we need the support of our community to counter the issue of hunger. Recent cuts to Federal programs are significantly impacting our services and causing an increased strain on our programs and the neighbors we serve, including children, families, and seniors," said Kyle Waide, President & CEO of the Atlanta Community Food Bank. "As a collective, we can make huge strides in the fight against hunger and help the most vulnerable in our communities."   During Hunger Action Month, the Food Bank is asking community members to take action against the hunger crisis. There are several ways to get involved:  DONATE - Throughout the month, donations to the Atlanta Community Food Bank will be matched dollar for dollar, up to $100,000, thanks to a group of generous friends committed to helping neighbors facing hunger. $1 will provide up to 6 meals. Donations may be made directly to the Atlanta Community Food Bank through their website, increasing their giving power.   GO ORANGE - During Hunger Action Month, the Food Bank encourages everyone to wear orange, the color that represents hunger, to draw attention to the cause. This can be in the form of shirts, hats, hair accessories, or whatever way individuals would like to show their support.  HUNGER ACTION DAY - Tuesday, September 9, is Hunger Action Day! Don't forget to Go Orange by wearing your favorite orange apparel and accessories! And on the evening of September 9, as a part of Light Up Atlanta, iconic landmarks around the city will light their buildings orange in solidarity. The following landmarks and companies around Atlanta have already committed to participating:  1105 West Peachtree Tower  Atlanta Zoo (800 Cherokee Ave SE) Georgia's OWN Credit Union (401 Cobb Pkwy N, Marietta) High Street (101 High Street) International Plaza (1 State Farm Dr) Ponce City Market (675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE)  Promenade Central (1200 Peachtree St)  TK Elevator (3005 Chastain Meadows Pkwy NW, Suite 100) Uptown (2300 Peachtree Rd NW)  30 WAYS IN 30 DAYS - Throughout September, the Food Bank is hosting a 30-Day Challenge on social media. This digital campaign will help raise awareness about hunger and offer daily suggestions for actions people can take to lend their support.   VOLUNTEER – Volunteers are always welcome at the Atlanta Community Food Bank to help sort and package food for neighbors. Volunteer opportunities are available at the Food Bank's headquarters or at any of their Community Food Center locations.   Hunger Action Month is observed throughout September by Feeding America member food banks across the country.
