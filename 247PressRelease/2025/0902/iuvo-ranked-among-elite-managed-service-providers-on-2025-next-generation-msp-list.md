BOSTON, MA, September 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- iuvo has been named as one of the world's most innovative managed service providers on the prestigious 2025 Next Generation rankings produced by the publisher of the MSP 501 awards.  MSP Summit is pleased to name iuvo to the 2025 Next Generation.  "iuvo is a high-level IT service company that also does managed services. We've redefined what it means to be an IT partner. Our clients count on us to lead them through complexity and that's possible because innovation is built into our DNA. Our team is made up of curious, forward-thinking people who don't wait for change, they drive it," said Bryon Beilman, President & CEO, iuvo.  "We've already disrupted the industry with customer satisfaction scores more than twice the industry average, and we're pushing even further by embracing AI through first-principles thinking, engineering real solutions that deliver value. While many MSPs are scrambling to integrate AI tools, we're helping businesses responsibly unlock their power through secure, scalable, and compliant strategies.  At the heart of it all is our culture. We invest deeply in our people and create the psychological safety they need to put others first because that's our first core value. When our people thrive, our clients succeed. And we're not keeping that success to ourselves. We actively partner with other MSPs to share knowledge, solve hard problems, and raise the bar for the entire industry. When every business has the strategic IT support it deserves, we all win."  This year's winners were selected based on a proprietary methodology to measure MSP innovation that includes such factors as above-average revenue growth from managed services, partnerships with the industry's leading vendors and delivering AI-powered solutions to their customers.  The Next Generation list, affiliated with the MSP 501, honors the world's highest-performing managed service and technology providers who drive a new wave of growth and innovation for the technology services channel via ground-breaking solutions. Many of these MSPs generate recurring revenue from cloud, security, unified communications, and other solutions to small, medium, and large clients.  Due to their growth, drive, and innovation, Next Generation MSPs represent the future of the technology channel and IT industry. This year's Next Generation winners were selected from all of the 2025 applications received for the MSP 501. They achieved outstanding results in areas such as cloud, cybersecurity, backup and recovery and AI services.  The Next Generation MSPs will be recognized during this year's MSP Summit and during the MSP 501 Gala.  "We're thrilled to announce the 2025 Next Generation award winners—true trailblazers who represent the future of managed services," said Robert DeMarzo, V.P. of content for Informa's channel events.   "These innovative MSPs aren't just meeting industry benchmarks—they're redefining them. With revenue portfolios heavily weighted toward managed services, professional services, and recurring cloud offerings, they've demonstrated exceptional business acumen while serving critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and government. What truly sets this year's winners apart is their commitment to AI integration across their entire service spectrum—from cybersecurity and cloud services to data analytics and network optimization. We look forward to celebrating their achievements at our exclusive MSP 501 Awards Gala on September 17 in Orlando."  "When pouring through the mounds of data we collect to select the MSP 501, we notice true trailblazers that can shake up the cutting-edge strategies and groundbreaking solutions," said Informa's Dave Raffo, manager of the MPS 501 and Next Generation programs. "That was the basis for our MSP Next Generation list, which recognizes the most innovative MSPs poised to skyrocket in the industry, from AI integration pioneers to operational efficiency champions."
