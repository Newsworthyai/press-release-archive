# ILWOOELECTRON's New Product Launch: reevaa S & EGF Ampoule Redefine At-Home Skincare

NEW YORK, NY, February 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ILWOOELECTRON, a leader in beauty and medical device development and manufacturing, is introducing a new EGF ampoule designed for use with reevaa S, incorporating the latest skincare technology. Designed to offer a comprehensive skincare solution, the reevaa S enhances the effectiveness of at-home skincare routines, delivering professional-grade results.  The EGF ampoule, specially developed to maximize the effects of reevaa S, enhances skin elasticity, reduces wrinkles, and promotes overall skin health. This powerful combination helps to improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and promote an overall healthier complexion. By integrating advanced skincare technology with a high-performance formula, ILWOOELECTRON offers an innovative at-home skincare solution that delivers professional-grade results without the need for salon treatments.  The reevaa S is an advanced skincare tool designed for users who seek salon-quality treatments in the comfort of their homes. By integrating multiple skincare technologies into a single device, the reevaa S eliminates the need for multiple tools, making skincare routines more efficient and effective. It features Clean Mode, which helps remove dead skin cells and impurities, leaving the skin refreshed and purified. The Nutrition Mode enhances deep absorption of skincare products, ensuring maximum efficacy of serums and creams. The Boost Mode stimulates collagen production and improves skin elasticity, helping to maintain a youthful appearance.  The heating and cooling functions allow users to control skin temperature for optimal treatment, catering to various skin needs and maximizing the effectiveness of skincare products. The warming function helps to open pores, and enhance the absorption of serums and ampoules, allowing active ingredients to penetrate deeper into the skin. This process boosts hydration and nourishes the skin at a cellular level, making it especially beneficial for dry or aging skin. Conversely, the cooling function helps to tighten pores, reduce redness, and soothe irritation, making it ideal for calming sensitive or inflamed skin. This temperature control feature not only enhances treatment results but also provides a spa-like skincare experience in the comfort of home.  The 3MHz ultrasound waves and galvanic ion therapy further optimize the skin's ability to absorb nutrients and key ingredients from skincare products. The ultrasound waves create micro-vibrations that gently stimulate the skin, while promoting better product penetration. This process supports collagen production and skin renewal, improving elasticity and firmness over time. Meanwhile, galvanic ions work by attracting and pushing charged skincare molecules deeper into the skin, increasing the efficacy of active ingredients like peptides, antioxidants, and hydrating agents. Together, these advanced technologies ensure visible and long-lasting results, making skincare routines more effective and results-driven.  Designed with intuitive controls and a user-friendly interface, the reevaa S is engineered for effortless operation, regardless of skincare expertise. The ergonomic design and lightweight structure make it comfortable to hold and maneuver, allowing users to target specific areas of concern with ease. Whether addressing fine lines, uneven skin tone, or enlarged pores, the reevaa S provides customizable settings to suit individual skincare needs. With a cordless and rechargeable design, it offers convenience and portability, making it an ideal addition to any skincare regimen. By combining professional-grade skincare technology with simple, easy-to-use functions, the reevaa S ensures that anyone can achieve radiant, youthful-looking skin with consistent use.  To further enhance the benefits of the reevaa S, ILWOOELECTRON has developed the EGF Ampoule, a high-performance skincare formula enriched with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and eight types of peptides. This innovative ampoule is designed to improve skin elasticity, brighten the complexion, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The EGF Ampoule is formulated without harmful chemicals such as preservatives, artificial fragrances, or artificial coloring, making it safe for all skin types, even those with sensitive skin.  The EGF Ampoule is a high-performance skincare product enriched with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and eight types of peptides, offering exceptional benefits for skin regeneration and elasticity improvement. EGF promotes cell growth and repair, helping to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, while the combination of eight peptides enhances skin firmness and maintains a healthy complexion. With continuous use, it strengthens the skin barrier, protecting against external aggressors and supporting a firmer, more youthful-looking skin.  In addition, the EGF Ampoule is highly effective in brightening the skin. It regulates melanin production to even out skin tone and improve dullness, resulting in a clearer and more radiant complexion. Its dual benefits of whitening and wrinkle improvement make it an excellent all-in-one skincare solution. The lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin, making it suitable for various skin types and ideal for daily use.  The EGF Ampoule is formulated without preservatives, artificial fragrances, or artificial coloring, ensuring a gentle and non-irritating formula for all skin types, including sensitive skin. By eliminating harmful chemicals, this ampoule prioritizes skin safety while delivering visible skincare benefits. Its clean formula minimizes the risk of irritation while effectively nourishing the skin. With regular use, it helps restore the skin's natural glow, promoting a firmer and healthier appearance.  Clinical tests have confirmed the effectiveness of using reevaa S in combination with the EGF Ampoule, revealing significant improvements in various skin concerns. Results showed a 47.18% reduction in pore volume, making the skin appear smoother and more refined. The number of visible pores decreased by 28.89%, minimizing the appearance of enlarged pores and improving overall skin texture. The clinical study also demonstrated a 10.80% improvement in wrinkle appearance, as fine lines became visibly smoother with continued use. Additionally, skin elasticity increased by 5.58%, reinforcing the skin's firmness and resilience over time.  These remarkable results highlight the synergistic effect of the reevaa S device and the EGF Ampoule, delivering salon-quality skincare benefits from the comfort of home. The advanced technology of reevaa S optimizes product absorption by utilizing ultrasound, galvanic ion therapy, and temperature control, allowing the EGF Ampoule's active ingredients to penetrate deeper into the skin. The combination of these innovative technologies enhances the ampoule's ability to stimulate collagen production, restore elasticity, and promote a visibly healthier complexion. As a result, skin appears firmer, smoother, and more youthful with consistent use.  In addition to its effectiveness, the lightweight texture of the EGF Ampoule absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue, allowing it to seamlessly integrate into any skincare routine. With continued use of reevaa S and the EGF Ampoule together, users can experience a comprehensive skincare solution that reduces wrinkles, tightens pores, and enhances overall skin radiance, redefining the standard for at-home beauty treatments.
