# Assetux is now featured on the Packet Hub for discovery of Gasless Crypto Transactions

CASPER, WY, February 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For years, crypto wallets have been bogged down by complexity, high fees, and interoperability issues. Assetux is changing that equation with a gasless, chain-agnostic wallet that operates entirely within Telegram. This allows users to transact across multiple EVM-compatible chains without worrying about network fees. By eliminating the friction that has long frustrated mainstream adoption, Assetux is positioning itself as the go-to solution for effortless DeFi transactions.  The Packet Hub is an Apple TV-like platform built on Packet — a community-powered, global networking blockchain project. The platform is designed for brands and creators to distribute content and reach audiences directly. Unlike other content hubs, Packet Hub enables platforms to on-board by claiming a free-for-life web domain, which creates a globally discoverable destination within the ecosystem. The web domain can be used as a forwarder to another website, or a destination that can be customized. Users don't need to pay any recurring annual registrar fees or extra costs for domain privacy — it's all included at no cost. This fits perfectly with Assetux's mission to simplify blockchain interactions and onboard users without the usual technical barriers.  This collaboration is about more than just visibility — it's about accelerating the adoption of transformative technology. The Packet Hub acts as a powerful amplifier for emerging Web3 projects, ensuring that groundbreaking innovations don't just get showcased but reach global audiences. The Packet Hub creates an ecosystem where forward-thinking projects like Assetux can gain real traction, engagement, and adoption. For Web3 innovators, this means bypassing traditional gatekeepers and connecting directly with users, investors, and communities interested in the next wave of decentralized technology.  According to Bogdan Sizov, CEO at Assetux, the partnership is about fundamentally changing the way people access and use crypto. "By on-boarding to the Packet Hub, we're not just promoting Assetux; we're accelerating the adoption of Web3 and removing the barriers that have kept mainstream users out of DeFi. Through the Packet Hub, we now have the perfect way to reach new users."  As Web3 continues its push toward mass adoption, partnerships like this one showcase the intersection between content distribution and blockchain innovation. With Assetux eliminating gas fees and Packet Hub working as a gateway to reach audiences, the two projects benefit from this next major shift in crypto accessibility.
