# NPCore Innovates Cybersecurity: Apt Defense Enhanced Through ZombieZERO

MIAMI, FL, January 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NPCore, Inc. (CEO Seung-Chul Han) announced today the deployment of its cutting-edge Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution, ZombieZERO, to the Indonesian National Police. This marks a significant step in providing apt defense against cyber threats. NPCore also conducted a two-day training program in Jakarta on June 9 and 10, 2024, focusing on apt defense strategies. By equipping law enforcement with ZombieZERO, NPCore ensures a robust apt defense framework. This initiative highlights the company's dedication to promoting apt defense within Southeast Asia's public institutions, empowering the police with tools and knowledge for effective apt defense.  The Indonesian National Police, as the primary law enforcement agency of the Republic of Indonesia, plays a crucial role in maintaining public safety and national security. To address the growing threat of cyberattacks, the police have prioritized implementing an apt defense strategy to safeguard sensitive data and critical operations. This focus on apt defense reflects their commitment to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats and ensuring robust protection. By adopting advanced solutions, the police aim to establish an effective apt defense framework for enhanced cybersecurity.  Indonesia has been grappling with a surge in cyber threats, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, hacking incidents, and ransomware campaigns. These attacks have highlighted the urgent need for apt defense to address vulnerabilities in the nation's cybersecurity framework. Apt defense strategies, supported by robust Endpoint security measures, are essential in mitigating these threats. With the integration of EDR and XDR solutions, apt defense has become the cornerstone of Indonesia's long-term cybersecurity resilience.  One of the most notable incidents occurred on June 20, 2024, when a ransomware attack targeted Indonesia's Data Center 2 (PDNS2), causing widespread disruption across more than 200 public institutions and affiliated organizations. The attack exposed critical gaps in cybersecurity readiness and emphasized the need for apt defense strategies to prevent future incidents. Proactive measures, rooted in apt defense, are essential for responding effectively to such critical situations. Advanced endpoint security and XDR capabilities, as part of an apt defense approach, could have significantly minimized the impact of such attacks.  In response, the Indonesian government, under the leadership of the current administration and newly elected President Prabowo Subianto, has prioritized cybersecurity as a national imperative. This effort includes a strong focus on apt defense, ensuring the resilience of critical systems against evolving cyber threats. Collaborations with global cybersecurity leaders like NPCore bring innovative solutions that align with the government's commitment to apt defense strategies. By integrating endpoint security and EDR tools, the administration is reinforcing its determination to build a robust apt defense framework to protect national infrastructure.
