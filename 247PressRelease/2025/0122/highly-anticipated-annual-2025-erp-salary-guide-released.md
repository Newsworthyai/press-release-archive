# Highly Anticipated Annual 2025 ERP Salary Guide Released

SEATTLE, WA, January 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DyNexus Recruiting and Staffing is excited to announce the release of its 2025 ERP Salary Guide. Designed to provide essential insights for job seekers, hiring managers, and businesses, the guide delves into compensation trends, industry shifts, and practical advice for being hired in the evolving job market.  For years, the DyNexus ERP Salary Guide has been a go-to resource for professionals and organizations in the ERP sector. It's helped job seekers negotiate competitive salaries, enabled hiring managers to attract skilled talent, and assisted businesses in budgeting for projects and temporary staffing needs.  "Over the last 11 years, our Mid-Market ERP Salary Guide has become a trusted and go-to resource for understanding compensation trends across the ERP ecosystem. It has provided employers and job seekers with valuable insights and has helped countless companies stay competitive in attracting and retaining top talent amidst an ever-changing industry," stated President/CEO, Julian Schrenzel.  In 2024, the mid-market ERP job landscape experienced significant changes. Once favoring job seekers, the market transitioned to one where employers became more selective. Salaries across many roles stabilized, while larger ERP firms – mostly driven by acquisitions – maintained a steady demand for skilled professionals. By the end of the year, job seekers faced fewer openings and increased competition, pushing employers to focus on candidates with specialized expertise that aligns with their organizational goals.  Recognizing these shifts, DyNexus expanded its contractor staffing services to meet the increasing demand for flexibility and specialized expertise. ERP Contractors have become essential for managing critical projects, including system integrations and data migrations, offering businesses a highly skilled, cost-effective solution without long-term commitments. Schrenzel added, "We're seeing a significant shift this year in the ERP hiring market, with more companies embracing contractors to fill critical roles. This trend reflects the industry's growing need for flexibility and access to highly specialized expertise in an increasingly dynamic environment."  Whether it's benchmarking salaries, strategizing recruitment efforts, or planning project budgets, the 2025 ERP Salary Guide provides actionable information tailored to the needs of the ERP community. This resource highlights DyNexus's dedication to helping businesses and professionals succeed in a rapidly changing ERP ecosystem.
