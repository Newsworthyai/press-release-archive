# Creative Biolabs: Continues Seeking Methods for Drug Discovery Against SARS-CoV-2

SHIRLEY, NY, January 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In recent years, a great deal of attention has been paid to the COVID-19 global pandemic, including studying the mechanisms of virus mutations and their transmissibility, and devising treatment procedures. Each development is a product of researchers' cumulative efforts. Creative Biolabs is actively participating in international research efforts and regularly focuses on introducing new services to respond to the needs of the global fight against SARS-CoV-2.  The process of viral replication and gene expression involves proteolytic enzymes, and one such enzyme, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, is critical for antiviral strategies. At Creative Biolabs, researchers make every effort to understand this clearly, and there is a drive to develop inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In this regard, the development of the protease detection service is of great importance for Creative Biolabs. By precisely measuring the effect of potential inhibitors on the protease, scientists can identify candidate drugs and make a contribution to the subsequent work.  According to a statement made by an expert of Creative Biolabs Covid-19 Research Department, "We supply TMPRSS2-enhanced cell lines, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-enhanced cell lines, etc., as protease inhibitor examples. We provide economical protease assay services using sophisticated protease assay technologies."  Within the effort of enhancing therapeutic development procedures directed towards COVID-19, Creative Biolabs performs protease assays to measure the activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors such as: * Spike-pseudovirus Based Neutralization Test * Counter Screening Test * Thermal Shift Binding Assay * Cytotoxicity Test  SARS-CoV-2 antiviral peptides are indeed one of Creative Biolabs' key directions in COVID-19 research. As a potential alternative treatment, antiviral peptides are done through experiments to block virus attachment or inhibit viral multiplication. Creative Biolabs screens out peptides with potential antiviral activity utilizing peptide microarray analysis to evaluate their function.  In addition, Creative Biolabs provides antiviral peptide discovery services, including: * SARS-CoV-2 peptide microarray analysis * Fusion peptide (EK1) for SARS-CoV-2 *ACE2-based peptides for SARS-CoV-2  Creative Biolabs also applies cytopathic effect (CPE) detection with high accuracy and attention. Using a stable virus-infected cell model and modern microscopic imaging with advanced cell counting methods, a precise evaluation of the viral replication and the antiviral effect of inhibitors can be obtained.  The CPE assay for SARS-CoV-2 encompasses virus propagation, titration, and neutralizing antibody assessment. "We achieve better results by applying Vero E6 cell lines in our assays with beforehand-setting standard procedures of CPE observation and analysis. Therefore, our platform guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the results."  Creative Biolabs has gained extensive experience throughout the years in the area of antiviral drug research and development. Based on a high-tech experimental platform and competent specialists, it provides protection with detailed consultation and prompt service.
