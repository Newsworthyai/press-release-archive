# Milestone Unlimited Residential Proxy Enhancement

HONG KONG, January 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Nearly two years ago, PYPROXY revolutionized the market with its launch of the Unlimited Residential Proxy. While similar to the Rotating Residential Proxy, this version offers the unique advantage of unlimited traffic, quickly earning widespread popularity among proxy users and garnering an abundance of positive feedback and strong support.  Upon its initial release, the Unlimited Proxy was met with great enthusiasm. Since then, PYPROXY has continually worked to enhance its competitive edge and broaden the range of applications across various business scenarios. This effort includes expanding the IP pool and ensuring that each account has a dedicated proxy server. As the market has evolved, PYPROXY recognized the need for further improvements and responded by introducing bandwidth options.  Just last week, the PYPROXY team announced a major upgrade to its Unlimited Proxy. Customers can now choose from five bandwidth options—200 Mbps, 400 Mbps, 600 Mbps, 800 Mbps, and 1 Gbps—allowing them to tailor their proxy plans to meet specific needs and enjoy a significantly improved performance. For existing customers with an Unlimited Proxy server, the upgrade is straightforward—simply click the "Upgrade" button in the Pack Overview on the Dashboard, and the upgrade will be applied immediately, with no need to wait for the next billing cycle.  Key Benefits of the Unlimited Proxy: Dedicated Proxy Server: Enjoy exclusive resources and a stable connection speed with a dedicated server. This also enhances security by minimizing the risk of interference from other users. Real Residential IPs: Trusted by websites, these IPs reduce the likelihood of blocks and effectively bypass geographical restrictions, providing access to region-locked content. Unlimited Traffic Usage: With no data caps, users can freely engage in high-bandwidth activities like streaming and downloading, without limitations. It offers the flexibility to use the internet as extensively as needed.  In today's dynamic proxy industry, only the most innovative and adaptable providers can succeed in an increasingly competitive market. PYPROXY has proven itself as one of these industry leaders, and we look forward to the exciting developments it will bring in the future.  PYPROXY offers high-quality residential proxies for customers who are engaged in web scraping, e-commerce and SERP optimization. You can find almost all types of proxies you need on PYPROXY. Tailored proxy solution is available.
