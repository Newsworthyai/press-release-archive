# 3 Ways AI Can Protect Businesses Against Fraud

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, January 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For Data Privacy Week, Jan. 27-31, Dave Curtis, a trusted pioneer in the field of AI-enhanced business operations, explains how AI-powered spend analytics can help businesses safeguard their data and root out fraud.  AI-powered analytics provide complete visibility of payment systems to help guard against fraudulent payments, says Curtis, Chief Technology Officer at RobobAI, a cutting-edge AI platform revolutionizing how organizations manage their supply chains. Key advantages include:  1.	AI keeps businesses ahead of the payment fraud evolution. As credit card fraud and fraud prevention evolve in tandem, AI-enabled protection is crucial for companies to stay competitive. The best AI-powered systems include intuitive data dashboards for comprehensive visibility of payments and are always learning and evolving to prevent the next level in payment fraud.  2.	AI bolsters compliance in expense management. Almost a quarter of employees admit to some form of expense or reimbursement fraud. AI-powered analytics offer end-to-end expense auditing. They can also pinpoint policy changes or compliance improvements to stop expense fraud.  3.	AI increases payment efficiency across the board. Over 70% of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are impacted by late payments. Late payments from large clients often have devastating consequences for SMBs. AI-powered software can predict payment time behavior and evaluate risks, while creating opportunities to reward early payment with discounts, strengthening B2B relationships.  "AI is the next evolution in fraud protection," Curtis says. "It keeps you one step ahead of fraudsters and their most sophisticated tactics. It bolsters employee compliance with expense management, and it turns your payment system into a passive boon to your business."
