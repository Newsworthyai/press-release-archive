# How One Book Sparked a Worldwide Consumer Movement

SEATTLE, WA, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- International human rights attorney, bestselling author, and activist Shadan Kapri (pronounced "Shadawn Capri") is igniting a global consumer movement—and the world is responding.  Her international bestseller, The Red Movement: Social and Environmental Justice in the 21st Century, urges consumers to use their purchasing power to support companies that prioritize people over profits, and the message is inspiring a global consumer justice movement never seen before in history.   Reviews for the book have come in from around the world, with readers sharing how Kapri's book transformed their spending habits. Campaigns inspired by this movement have been reshaping corporate behavior. The most recent being the public pressure on Disney following its cancellation of The Jimmy Kimmel Show, demonstrating how collective consumer action influences even the most powerful brands.  "Corporations need to understand this new global landscape to survive. People are using their purchasing power to drive societal change, and it's incredibly powerful. This is The Red Movement in action, and it's spreading like wildfire."   The book's message is simple: every purchase is a vote for justice or exploitation. She challenges consumers to ask: Is buying this product a reflection of my deepest values? Was it made by safeguarding human rights and the environment or by exploiting them? And millions are responding, driving social change at a rate never seen before in history.   "Similar to the compelling voices of Barack Obama and Greta Thunberg, this book offers an intense yet pensive exploration of contemporary human rights issues. . . leaving a lasting impact." ~David Khalili, LMFT  Kapri's vision is bold: to make conscious consumerism the global norm, and it's already happening—with The Red Movement at the center. Her message is unwavering: we must stop funding injustice with our wallets—and the world is responding.   This international bestseller is available at  https://www.amazon.com/Red-Movement-Environmental-Justice-Century/dp/1734644648  Shadan Kapri, human rights attorney, bestselling author, and activist, is spearheading a transformative global movement aimed at redefining justice. Through her powerful books and revolutionary campaign, The Red Movement, Kapri is proving that justice extends beyond the courtroom to the choices we make daily--through our purchases, votes, and voices.   As the founder of Kapri Law & Consulting, a law firm specializing in family law, civil rights, and international human rights in Washington State, she quickly became a force to be reckoned with, but it wasn't enough to fight injustice in legal battles alone. Kapri realized that true change extends beyond courtrooms and into the very systems that shape our daily lives. From that idea, her book, The Red Movement: Social and Environmental Justice in the 21st Century, was born, garnering global attention and becoming an international bestseller with one reviewer calling it "a rallying cry for justice if there ever was one."
