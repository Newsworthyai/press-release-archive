# Renaissance BioScience Named One of Canada's Top Food Technology Companies

VANCOUVER, BC, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renaissance BioScience Corp., a global leader in yeast technology for the food, beverage, agriculture, animal health and nutrition industries, is pleased to announce its recent selection as a winner of the inaugural Foodtech Frontier Award program by the Canadian Food Innovation Network (CFIN). Foodtech Frontier is a new Canadian national initiative by CFIN spotlighting 10 established and 25 rising star high-growth Canadian food technology companies that are poised to transform the food industry across Canada and in global markets.   CFIN's Foodtech Frontier program celebrates the most innovative and impactful food technology companies in Canada. Selected from companies across the country, Renaissance was recognized for its strong track record in developing innovative yeast-based solutions to address important food, beverage and flavor industry challenges.   Renaissance has an extensive track record of food innovation, capable of creating non-GMO patented products for license to global food industry partners, as it has done with its acrylamide-reducing yeast and an entire suite of alcoholic beverage yeasts that have been licensed or sold to global industrial partners. In addition, in 2024 Renaissance was awarded a multi-year project grant from CFIN's FoodTech Next program to develop yeast-based technology to improve the flavor of plant-based proteins.  Currently Renaissance is also working in the global foodtech sector in partnership with one of the largest global confectionary companies to develop technology that produces natural flavors from yeast as clean label flavor substitutes for chemical-based flavors. This novel technology not only reduces costs for the food manufacturer and attracts consumers that value natural ingredients but it also has a positive environmental footprint compared to growing and harvesting fruit to extract natural flavor compounds.   Dr. John Husnik, Renaissance's CSO and Co-CEO, commented on the Foodtech Frontier award: "The Renaissance team is honored to be selected as one of Canada's inaugural Foodtech Frontier "Rising Stars."
