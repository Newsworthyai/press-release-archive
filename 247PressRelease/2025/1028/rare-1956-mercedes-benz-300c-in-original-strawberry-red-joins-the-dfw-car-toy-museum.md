# Rare 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300C in Original "Strawberry" Red Joins the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the DFW Car & Toy Museum continues to welcome thousands of automotive enthusiasts through its doors, the collection only gets more impressive. Now on display is one of the museum's most stately and striking additions to date: a 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300C Sedan, finished in its original factory-issued "Strawberry" red (DB543)—an extraordinary color choice for one of the most powerful and conservative luxury sedans of its era.  Known internally as the W186, the Mercedes-Benz 300 series was the brand's flagship long before the legendary 300SL made headlines. This model—nicknamed the "Adenauer" after German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who used a fleet of specially built examples—is a benchmark of 1950s luxury and engineering excellence. Competing with Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Cadillac for favor among global leaders and business elites, the 300C offered an elite driving experience that was both dignified and daring.  Under the hood, this 300C is powered by a 3.0-liter SOHC inline-six, fed by twin Solex carburetors and paired to a 3-speed Borg-Warner automatic transmission. With independent front suspension and a coil-sprung rear swing axle, the ride quality and handling reflect the cutting-edge design Mercedes-Benz was known for—even in its heaviest, most luxurious sedans.  What sets this particular car apart is its rare color and high level of preservation. The factory build sheet confirms the unique "Strawberry" paint color, an unexpected yet elegant hue for a model typically ordered in more subdued tones. The car also features a full-length Webasto sunroof, chrome-on-brass exterior trim, and a meticulously preserved interior with original VDO instrumentation, chrome switchgear, a Becker Mexico radio, and original upholstery details that evoke the era's grandeur.  "This 300C is a showstopper—not just for its presence and condition, but for its individuality," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's rare to find a luxury sedan from the 1950s that feels both dignified and bold, and this car does exactly that."  With only 885 examples built in 1956 and just 1,432 produced in total, the Mercedes-Benz 300C remains a highly collectible piece of mid-century automotive history, and this example is among the most eye-catching of them all.
