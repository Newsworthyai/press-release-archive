# NONSENSE AGENCY CELEBRATES RECORD-BREAKING YEAR — OVER $10 MILLION RAISED FOR CHARITY CLIENTS!

ORLANDO, FL, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After a year that can only be described as nonsense that makes perfect sense, NONSENSE AGENCY is closing 2025 with a bang — celebrating an incredible milestone of raising over $10 million for charity partners across the nation.  To mark this record-breaking year, the team is heading to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, for an unforgettable R&R Celebration in the first week of December — a well-deserved retreat for a crew that turned passion, purpose, and pure energy into real impact.  "What started as a small, fearless idea to help charities fundraise without the stress has turned into a movement," said Simone Suetsugu, Founder & CEO of NONSENSE AGENCY. "We've built a culture that proves business can be fun, creative, and world-changing — all at once."  With a unique approach that blends creativity, marketing strategy, and heart, NONSENSE AGENCY has become one of the fastest-growing fundraising partners in the U.S. The team's campaigns have empowered nonprofits to focus on what truly matters — making a difference — while the agency handles the magic behind the scenes.  And now, as they prepare for their annual R&R Event in the Smoky Mountains, the agency is also expanding its team.  Want to join the movement? NONSENSE AGENCY isn't your average workplace — it's a hub of creativity, purpose, laughter, and leadership. Whether you're into marketing, event planning, design, or simply love the idea of doing good while having fun, this is your sign to jump in.  Because here, making a difference is serious business — but everything else? That's the fun kind of nonsense.
