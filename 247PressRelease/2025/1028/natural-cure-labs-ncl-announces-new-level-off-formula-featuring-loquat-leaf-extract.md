# Natural Cure Labs (NCL) Announces New Level Off Formula Featuring Loquat Leaf Extract

ST. PETERSBURG, FL, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NCL ("Natural Cure Labs") today announced the updated formula of Level Off, the company's metabolic support supplement designed to be taken before meals. The new formula now includes Loquat leaf extract and delivers an upgraded antioxidant blend, while maintaining NCL's (Natural Cure Labs') clean-label approach: no artificial colors, no silica, no magnesium stearate, and no unnecessary fillers.   Level Off was first launched in 2024 and has grown quickly as more customers look for support around post-meal metabolic response, energy, and daily balance. The upgraded formula was developed to help healthy adults moderate normal post-meal glucose spikes and stay in a healthy range, especially around higher-carb meals.   "Level Off was created for people who are mindful of how they feel after meals," said Damon Sununtnasuk, Founder & CEO of NCL. "With the updated formula, we focused on ingredient quality, label transparency, and practical daily use. Loquat leaf extract is a strong addition that supports our goal of offering a clean, reliable, pre-meal routine for adults who care about metabolic wellness."   Why Loquat Leaf  Loquat leaf extract is a plant ingredient that has been researched and tested and is backed by more than 10 published studies on healthy metabolic balance and healthy glucose habits. The ingredient was selected for quality, consistency, and its role in supporting normal post-meal responses.   "We're always improving," said Damon Sununtnasuk, Founder & CEO of NCL. "If we see an opportunity to make a formula cleaner, stronger, or more transparent, we act on it. We listen to our customers, we take feedback seriously, and we keep upgrading our products to match what people are actually asking for."   Intended Use and Testing  Level Off is intended for healthy adults seeking metabolic support around mealtimes and post-meal stable responses as part of an overall wellness routine. The updated formula was internally evaluated using continuous glucose monitoring devices to observe post-meal responses in healthy adult testers. In internal testing, the new Loquat leaf formula performed 50â€“90% better than the original formula in helping maintain healthy post-meal levels for healthy adults.   NCL notes that individual results may vary, and Level Off is not a substitute for medical care, nutrition planning, or lifestyle guidance from a qualified professional.   Built for a Real Need  Metabolic concerns are widespread. Many adults are actively looking for simple, daily habits that support steadier energy and more controlled post-meal responses without having to overhaul every meal choice. Level Off was created specifically for that moment - practical support, right before you eat.  About Natural Cure Labs  NCL ("Natural Cure Labs") is a U.S.-based supplement company founded in 2015.
