# Michele Saegesser Honored as Godmother of Viking Honir — Viking Celebrates 100 Ships Worldwide with Club Cruise™ &amp; Heather Viking

SACRAMENTO, CA, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Viking® has reached a historic milestone in global exploration: the company now sails more than 100 ships across its river, ocean, and expedition fleet. To mark the achievement, Viking hosted a global naming celebration spanning six countries, officially welcoming nine new river ships — each with a distinguished godparent representing Viking's extended family.  From the perspective of travel advisors, Michele Saegesser has long been one of Viking's most trusted champions — ensuring advisors have the tools, knowledge, and partnership they need to guide guests confidently on every Viking voyage.  One of the most meaningful moments was the honor bestowed upon Michele Saegesser, Viking's, Vice President of Trade Development & Training, who was named Godmother of the new Viking Honir during a ceremony in Basel, Switzerland. The name "Honir" comes from Norse mythology, where the god Honir was known for wisdom, reflection, and the gift of reason—helping to bestow intelligence upon the first humans. It's a fitting name for a ship whose godmother embodies those same traits of insight, grace, and leadership. Widely admired for her decades of dedication to travel advisors, Michele continues to shape Viking's world-leading reputation through mentorship, education, and steadfast support for partners.  "This is such an extraordinary and well-earned honor for Michele Saegesser," said Heather Viking, a dedicated Viking travel advisor at Club Cruise™ who has proudly aligned her own professional name and family agency brand with Viking's values of cultural discovery and trusted services.  "Her leadership inspires travel advisors every day — helping us grow, serve guests with confidence, and strengthen Viking's place as the #1 River and Ocean Cruise brand", adds Heather.  Why Travel Advisors Celebrate This Moment  "It's refreshing to see Viking celebrate the leaders who shape the guest experience — not celebrity driven marketing. That's what loyalty looks like. And that's why advisors like me honor Michele and the Viking leaders who believe so strongly in this mission. That is real loyalty — and exactly why I proudly tie my name, my reputation, and my future to Viking, the brand For The Thinking Person™." — Heather Viking  Vision from Viking's Founding Leadership  Viking Founder & Chairman Torstein Hagen has guided the brand with a focus on culture, history, and genuine discovery — revolutionizing the river experience and evolving ocean and expedition travel. His leadership, along with Karine Hagen advancing Viking's enrichment mission, continues to shape why Viking is the most awarded cruise line in the world.
