# MASSAMAGRELL (VALENCIA) PROMOTES A CULTURE OF PEACE AND REGENERATIVE INNOVATION AT THE 9TH CULTURAL WEEK "THE PATH OF THE HOLY GRAIL"

VALENCIA, SPAIN, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The municipality of Massamagrell (Valencia) hosted the 9th Cultural Week "The Path of the Holy Grail" from October 20 to 24, consolidating its position as one of the main European cultural events that unite heritage, knowledge, spirituality, and local development. This edition, organized by the Cultural Association "The Path of the Holy Grail" and the International Association "The Path of the Holy Grail" Cultural Itinerary, with the active collaboration of the Massamagrell City Council and its Local Authority, was an example of institutional cooperation and innovation applied to culture.  Under the theme "Valencia, Jubilee City, The Path of the Holy Grail," the week combined exhibitions, conferences, roundtables, dramatized tours, and radio broadcasts, with a pioneering approach: measuring and enhancing the social, cultural, and environmental impact of the activities through the Local Impact Observatory and the REGENERA Tur-IA CUBE technological platform.  Both tools, coordinated by ARTCARE Consulting, made it possible to collect attendance indicators, citizen perception, and tangible results of the event, contributing to the construction of a regenerative and smart tourism model linked to the Council of Europe's Cultural Route.  The president of the Association, Dr. Ana Mafé García, together with the secretary, Jesús Gimeno, and representatives of the scientific committee, led a programme that addressed topics such as cultural diplomacy, the signage of The Path, the culture of peace, and intercultural dialogue. These axes are part of the process of consolidating the Way of the Holy Grail as a European Cultural Route, currently being certified by the Council of Europe. This recognition places Massamagrell and the Valencian Community on the continent's cultural map, on a par with historical routes such as the Way of St. James (El Camino de Santiago) and the Viking Routes.  During the inauguration on Monday, October 20, the exhibition "The Holy Grail" was presented, accompanied by the recording of a special programme on Play Radio Valencia 107.7 FM, which highlighted the importance of heritage memory and citizen participation.  On Tuesday, October 21, a lecture on the epigraphy of the Holy Chalice and the traditional Pilgrim's Mass were held, officiated by Mr. José Ribes Perea, reinforcing the spiritual and symbolic connection of the route.  On Wednesday the 22nd, the panels "Cultural Diplomacy" and "The Camino and Signage"—moderated by Dr. Fernando Molina Pons and Carmen de la Cagiga—focused on the need for institutional cooperation, participatory design, and shared governance to strengthen the route.  On Thursday the 23rd, a new radio programme aired that broadcast the Camino's progress, and finally, on Friday the 24th, the week culminated with the dramatized route "The Library Path," an immersive experience that united history, art, and the local community.  The event coincided with the 2024 anniversary of the DANA (National Association of Cultural and Cultural Organizations), which provided an emotional tone by highlighting the municipality's resilience and commitment to cultural and social regeneration. Thanks to the methodology applied by ARTCARE Consulting, Massamagrell becomes a living laboratory for regenerative experiences, where the added value that culture generates for the population is measured.  Among the most relevant conclusions are: The demonstration that the Holy Grail Path acts as a driver of local transformation, capable of generating sustainable positive impacts in the community. The usefulness of the Local Impact Observatory as a tool for transparency, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The potential of the REGENERA Tur-IA CUBE platform, which integrates artificial intelligence and data analysis to create smart and supportive cultural routes.  The 9th Cultural Week has demonstrated that Massamagrell is not only the birthplace of the Holy Grail Path, but is also a space for innovation, dialogue, and peace, aligned with the values of the Council of Europe.  The collaboration between the Local Corporation, the International Association of the Holy Grail Path Cultural Route, and the cultural innovation ecosystem demonstrates that the union of institutions, citizens, and technology can turn heritage into a driver of regeneration and hope. We remind everyone who follows this path that they greet each other in a unique way: - Peace and Love to you all. The response is: - Light on the Path.
