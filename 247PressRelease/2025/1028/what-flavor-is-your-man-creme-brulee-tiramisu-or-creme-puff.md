# What Flavor Is Your Man? Crème Brulee, Tiramisu or Crème Puff?

PEORIA, AZ, October 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In her lively and imaginative book, MENOPOLY – A parody about the grim reality of dating in the Techno-Age!, author BA Ball, aka Barby, offers a very funny, light-hearted look at the world of online dating, dating apps, dating in person, or any other way you might date. This book can also serve as an eye-opening tutorial for women on what to watch out for, and for men on how NOT to behave. It's fun, informative and uplifting.  Based in part on the author's dating life experiences, characteristics of the 15 types of men in dating relationships discussed include:  The Pistol Packer, The Hose Dragger, Bi-Polar Man, The Cheetah aka Cheater, Loser/Liar and many more who have seasoned Barby's life with zesty experiences to give her the "edge" on men and dating. Everyone has either dated, or knows someone who has dated, at least one of these colorful characters.  "I dated these guys and took a funny spin on my experiences. Pretty much seen most all the good, bad and ugly out there."  Barby's writing journey started as a blog and after her best friend said she should turn it into a book, she did. She feels she has several more books to offer the world. Another is titled Life in the Hen House, due out soon. It's another fun book which illustrates how women (or men) behave like chickens. For example: when you introduce a new hen into the hen house they will check it out, size it up and if they don't like her…peck her to death, literally.   Sound familiar? Women do the same. Henceforth where the term "Pecking Order" came from.   "About my Sense of Humor …Records show I'm related to Lucille Ball which makes so much sense. It's in my genes!"  Menopoly reflects Barby's sense of humor about life and taking it lightly. She loves writing funny books because it allows her to be extremely creative while using her God given sense of humor. Plus, it offers perspective on the wide variety of dating relationships she has experienced.   Men from her past often ask if they are in the book. If they are, should they be scared or honored?  In summary, MENOPOLY truly is a wildly humorous and an informative parody about the grim reality of dating in the Techno-Age. Enjoy the journey!
