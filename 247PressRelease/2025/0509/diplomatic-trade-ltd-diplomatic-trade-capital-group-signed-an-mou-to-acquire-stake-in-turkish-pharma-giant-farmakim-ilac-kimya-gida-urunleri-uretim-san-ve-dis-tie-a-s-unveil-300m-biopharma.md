The transaction marks a new chapter in the evolution of healthcare manufacturing across the MENA region, bridging biotech innovation, investment banking, and IPO-readiness under one transformative initiative.  Strategic Equity Position Diplomatic Trade Capital has acquired a controlling 49% equity position in the Turkish pharmaceutical conglomerate, securing board-level oversight and commercial rights. While financial terms remain confidential, the deal represents a significant capital deployment in alignment with long-range consolidation and growth objectives across frontier pharma markets.  UAE Biopharma Hub Launch – Q3 2025 The JV will commission a next-generation bio-manufacturing facility in the UAE by Q3 2025. The site will focus on biosynthetic therapies, regenerative compounds, and advanced life-extension pharmaceuticals designed to meet accelerating demand across Gulf states and North Africa. It will also integrate AI-driven QC, biocompatible packaging, and modular production suites aligned with EU-GMP standards.  IPO Pathway and Market Valuation Targeting a listing in Q4 2025 on a leading UAE stock exchange, the newly formed group is currently being valued by a globally ranked Tier-1 advisory firm. Early-stage projections estimate the company's IPO valuation near $300 million USD., supported by robust EBITDA expansion, GCC distribution rights, and proprietary therapeutic pipelines.  Institutional Backing – Morgan Brookshire LLC U.S.-based Morgan Brookshire LLC, the private family office of financier Thomas J. Kent, has structured the underlying financing through its capital markets affiliates. This injection of institutional capital marks a major transatlantic commitment to scaling critical pharma infrastructure across the Gulf and aligns with broader U.S.–GCC economic collaboration in life sciences.  Strategic Commentary "This isn't just an acquisition—it's a launchpad for redefining pharmaceutical sovereignty and access in the region," said a Diplomatic Trade Capital spokesperson. "With UAE's policy tailwinds and healthcare reform momentum, we see this venture as a catalyst for the next decade of precision medicine, biotech IPOs, and regional supply chain independence."
