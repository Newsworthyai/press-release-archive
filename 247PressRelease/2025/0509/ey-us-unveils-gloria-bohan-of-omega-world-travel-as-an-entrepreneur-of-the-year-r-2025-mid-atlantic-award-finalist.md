# EY US Unveils Gloria Bohan of Omega World Travel as an Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2025 Mid-Atlantic Award Finalist

FAIRFAX, VA, May 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ernst & Young LLP (EY US) announced the finalists for the prestigious Entrepreneur Of The Year 2025 Mid-Atlantic Award. Now in its 40th year, the Entrepreneur Of The Year program celebrates the bold leaders who disrupt markets through the world's most ground-breaking companies, revolutionizing industries and making a profound impact on communities. The program honors bold entrepreneurs whose innovations shape the future and pave the way for a thriving economy and a hopeful tomorrow. The Mid-Atlantic program celebrates entrepreneurs from Maryland, Virginia and Washington, DC.  An independent panel of judges selected Gloria Bohan among 36 finalists for their entrepreneurial spirit, purpose, growth and lasting impact in building long-term value.  Bohan is the Founder and CEO of the Omega family of brands. Omega owns Cruise.com, one of the largest online cruise booking platforms, and Travtech, a leading travel technology development firm. Omega World Travel, which has over 50 years of experience as a leader in the travel management industry, has grown from a modest one-person office into a global full-service travel management company.  As one of America's largest business travel management companies, Omega serves corporations, nonprofits, government agencies and contractors, and educational institutions. Omega's full travel management services include business travel arrangements for domestic and international air, car, hotel, and rail made through traditional travel consultants, or made online using automated booking tools. Omega's offerings also include our wholly-owned meeting, conference, and event management services; group air arrangements; international rate desk; VIP services; vendor contract negotiation services; strategic consulting; and 24/7 travel support from our in-house travel service centers.  Reflecting on her nomination, Bohan commented, "I'm truly grateful to be named a finalist on the EY list once again. For me, entrepreneurial spirit is about continuous growth—embracing innovation, maintaining a positive outlook, and taking thoughtful risks. It's also about lifting others up, fostering teamwork, and pursuing shared success. That journey, I believe, reflects a piece of the American Dream. If I'm considered an enduring entrepreneur, it's because I've been fortunate to find purpose and happiness in the work, alongside many others. Thank you to EY for celebrating the stories that shape the future of American business."  Entrepreneur Of The Year honors business leaders for their ingenuity, courage and entrepreneurial spirit. The program celebrates original founders who bootstrapped their business from inception or who raised outside capital to grow their company; transformational CEOs who infused innovation into an existing organization to catapult its trajectory; and multigenerational family business leaders who reimagined a legacy business model to strengthen it for the future.  Regional award winners will be announced on June 18 during a special celebration in Washington, DC, and will become lifetime members of an esteemed community of Entrepreneur Of The Year alumni from around the world. The winners will then be considered by the National judges for the Entrepreneur Of The Year National Awards, which will be presented in November at the annual Strategic Growth Forum®, one of the nation's most prestigious gatherings of high-growth, market-leading companies.  ~~~ Omega World Travel is a Woman Owned travel management company, a full-service travel agency, and a leader in the internet retail travel marketplace.
