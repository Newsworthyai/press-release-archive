# 1959 Ford Ranchero: Vintage Power with Modern Touches on Display at DFW Car and Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly features a bold blend of performance and nostalgia with the 1959 Ford Custom Ranchero, now on display as part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection. This unique vehicle merges vintage utility with modern upgrades, offering visitors a chance to admire an iconic American pickup like no other.  Under the hood, this Ranchero roars to life with a replacement 390ci V8 engine paired with a three-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 3.10:1 locking rear differential, delivering smooth yet formidable performance. From its power-assisted front disc brakes and rear drums to its factory-equipped power steering, every detail of the Ranchero's chassis reflects both strength and drivability.  The ride quality is enhanced by a four-way ball-joint front suspension with shock absorbers and a multi-leaf rear setup with diagonally mounted shocks—an impressive engineering feat for its time. Inside, the cabin pays tribute to vintage charm and modern comfort, featuring vent windows, lap belts, a carpeted dash cover, and a push-button AM radio. A hidden Custom Auto Sound stereo system offers upgraded audio while maintaining a period-correct appearance. The cracked three-spoke steering wheel, complete with a bright horn ring, fronts a 120-mph horizontal-sweep speedometer flanked by fuel and coolant temperature gauges. Keeping things cool in every sense, the Ranchero also includes a Vintage Air conditioning system.  This 1959 Ford Ranchero is more than a classic pickup—it's a rolling reminder of the innovation, style, and spirit of mid-century Americana.
