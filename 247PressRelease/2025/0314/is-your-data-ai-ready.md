# Is Your Data AI-Ready?

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, March 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With new tariffs impacting international trade, RobobAI, a global fintech leveraging AI to create transparent and ethical supply chains, shares five ways companies can reduce risk and boost resilience.  AI is at the core of automation, and success with AI requires stringent Master Data Governance, says Dave Curtis, chief technology officer at RobobAI (pronounced Robo-Buy). For March, Asset Management Awareness Month and National Procurement Month, Curtis explains how integrating AI into supply chains helps companies:  1. Continuously evaluate risks. AI tools can constantly scrutinize all areas of risk, including cyber, sanctions, modern slavery, and payment times reporting systems (PTRS). 2. Reduce tail spend. AI is the only technology with a consistent track record in reducing off-contract spending. 3. Identify opportunities to diversify. Organizations with more diverse supply chains are better positioned to meet threats of disruption. AI can pinpoint opportunities for diversification, either within your current supply chain network or as part of a comprehensive reevaluation. 4. Meet increasing regulatory standards. AI tools can improve your data quality and reporting procedures, both of which will naturally prepare your organization for any imminent increases in regulatory expectations. 5. Streamline vendors to capture cost savings. AI helps organizations reduce their vendor base to increase efficiency and capture savings. (RobobAI saved one company $68 million through vendor consolidation and payment optimization).  "AI can also be trained to target specific objectives, such as greater sustainability or a more equitable distribution of vendors," Curtis says.  An Australian company, RobobAI works with organizations around the globe to provide custom development and proof of concepts (POC). The strong U.S. Dollar currently provides significant cost advantages to US firms utilizing its services.
