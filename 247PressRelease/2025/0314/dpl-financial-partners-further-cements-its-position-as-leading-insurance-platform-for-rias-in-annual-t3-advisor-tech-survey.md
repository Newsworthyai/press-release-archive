LOUISVILLE, KY, March 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- DPL Financial Partners, the leading platform for commission-free annuities, today announced that it led the T3 Inside Information Software Survey list of firms with the largest share of the advisor life insurance and annuity market for the fourth time in five years. DPL also topped the list of services survey respondents are considering to address client insurance needs.  DPL's market share has continued to grow since it was first included in the survey, increasing nearly one percent from 6.51% in last year's survey to 7.38% this year. This result is consistent with the firm's expanding user base and accelerating sales, which surpassed $3B in 2024.  "DPL is the recognized innovator and thought leader driving the modernization of the annuity industry from product innovation to ground-breaking technology," said DPL Founder and CEO David Lau. "We continue to gain market share and attract the largest firms in the industry because we completely change the game for clients and firms alike."  DPL also led the field in terms of advisor interest. When asked which providers they are considering, 48 survey respondents named DPL, almost double the number of advisors who chose the nearest competitor.  "We continue to have growing interest from firms because advisors see the value of our products to deliver better outcomes for their clients and the power of our technology to grow and scale their firms," added Lau.
