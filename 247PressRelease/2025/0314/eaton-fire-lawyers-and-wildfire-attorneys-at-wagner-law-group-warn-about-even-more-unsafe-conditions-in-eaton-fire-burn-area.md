# Eaton Fire Lawyers and Wildfire Attorneys at Wagner Law Group Warn About Even More Unsafe Conditions in Eaton Fire Burn Area

LOS ANGELES, CA, March 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Eaton fire lawyers and wildfire damage attorneys at Wagner Law Group are seasoned veterans when it comes to wildfires and wildfire victims. The initial trauma of the Eaton fire was brutal enough for even the most stoic people but compounding the damage that has already occurred is the risk of mudslides in the burn area. Experts warn that with the heavy rain and possible flooding this week that debris flows could be a significant problem. Governor Gavin Newson has announced that an additional 400 emergency workers and support people will be sent to the area to assist with problems caused by the Eaton Fire.  Eaton Fire Attorneys at Wagner Law Group are available to help victims of the fire recover damages, compensation and rebuild after this 100% percent preventable tragedy. "We are heavy hitters when it comes to protecting and advocating for wildfire victims and the insurance companies and municipalities know this. Our reputation as being very supportive and understanding of the people we represent while being extremely aggressive in pursuing compensation for them sets us apart," says Butch Wagner, Founder of Wagner Law Group.  With up coming weather events personal injury attorneys at Wagner Law Group recommend people avoid the area to minimize the chances of putting themselves in harm's way in order to attempt to circumvent more property damage. "We understand how emotional it is for people to hear that after their lives have been torn apart and put on hold that additional damage to their property could occur as a result of mismanagement by large corporations and government entities that didn't do their jobs to prevent these fires and haven't done enough to protect the area," says Butch.  The cause of the Eaton Fire and the damage that was caused is still under investigation but many Eaton Fire Lawsuits claim the fault or at least some of it lies with Southern California Edison. "We have a lot of experience dealing with litigation involving utility companies, large corporations and municipalities. We will not rest until we get justice for our clients who are victims of the Eaton Fire," says Butch Wagner of Wagner Law Group. While the final cause of the fire may never be fully determined it is highly likely that multiple entities could be held accountable.
