# Subordinating American Democracy by Robert L. Foster Explores the Evolution of Hyperpartisanship

GLENWOOD LANDING, NY, March 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In his forthcoming book, Subordinating American Democracy: Exploring the Functionality of "Dysfunctional" Hyperpartisanship, author Robert L. Foster examines the evolution and perpetuation of hyperpartisanship within America. Rather than being the result of intentional design, Foster argues that extreme partisanship developed in response to changing environmental factors, an adaptive process profiting certain sectors of society while undermining policy-making and legislative processes that democracy depends on.  Foster illustrates how media incentives, political strategies, and structural shifts have contributed to an ecosystem in which division thrives. The book challenges readers to rethink the forces driving modern political dysfunction, not as a conspiracy but as the natural consequence of political and social systems, as well as individuals, adapting over time. "Partisanship is financially, psychologically, and culturally incentivized," Foster states.  About the Book  Set to be released tomorrow, Subordinating American Democracy provides a nuanced exploration of how hyperpartisanship has persisted and expanded because it functions effectively for what Foster refers to as the "Partisanship Industry." "This industry markets partisanship through media and political campaigning," Foster explains. Hyperpartisanship thrives despite its disruption of governance because it works for other powerful sectors of society. "'Dysfunction' is contextual," Foster quips.   Rather than focusing on the substance of our political disagreements, the book invites readers to examine the processes through which these conflicts are managed, and why those processes have become so deeply flawed.  Foster's argument moves beyond simplistic narratives of political manipulation and instead offers a framework for understanding how hyperpartisanship has grown into a dominant force. Recognizing its evolutionary roots helps in addressing the challenges it presents and exploring potential paths forward.  Subordinating American Democracy will be available in multiple formats beginning Thursday, March 14, 2025.

Foster's interest in political division developed over decades of firsthand experience in advocacy, government relations, and policy work. He spent twelve years with a nonprofit environmental organization, where he worked with lawmakers at local, state, and national levels to promote reasonable policy changes. However, his experiences as a construction laborer, courier, and kitchen help provide him with an essentially broader perspective on American society.  Academically, Foster studied environmental science before earning a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and later graduating magna cum laude from law school. His diverse background informs his perspective on how policies are shaped and how political narratives evolve. He practices Iyengar yoga and is currently working on his next books.
