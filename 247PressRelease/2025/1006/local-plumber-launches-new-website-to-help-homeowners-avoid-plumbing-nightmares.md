# Local Plumber Launches New Website to Help Homeowners Avoid Plumbing Nightmares

PHILADELPHIA, PA, October 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Scarpignato Plumbing & Heating, a family-owned plumbing company serving Wallingford, Swarthmore, and Media for 25 years, announced the launch of their new website designed to help homeowners prevent plumbing emergencies and find trustworthy professional service.  The website addresses growing concerns among homeowners desperately looking for reliable plumbers when water damage threatens their homes. With raw sewage backups, burst pipes, and water heater failures becoming costly disasters, the site provides educational resources to help families recognize warning signs before small problems become expensive emergencies.  Addressing Homeowner Needs  The website launch responds to research showing educated homeowners want detailed information about plumbing services before making decisions. Key features include emergency vs. non-emergency guidelines, preventive maintenance education, service area coverage, and professional credentials documentation.  "Our customers do their homework," Scarpignato explained. "They research reviews, check credentials, and want transparency about work being done to their homes."  Community Focus and Professional Standards  The website emphasizes Scarpignato Plumbing's community involvement, including annual charitable donations and school district participation. While larger corporations acquire local plumbing companies, Scarpignato remains independent.  "Our reputation in this community matters more than any buyout offer," Scarpignato noted. "Our neighbors know when they call us, they're getting someone who lives here and cares about doing the job right."  The site also addresses concerns about unlicensed contractors and plumbing scams targeting homeowners during emergencies.  "You wouldn't trust your health to an unlicensed doctor, so why risk your home's plumbing to unqualified technicians?" Scarpignato said. "Our website helps homeowners make informed decisions about who they trust with their homes."  Founded in 2000, Scarpignato Plumbing & Heating is a family-owned business serving Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Led by master plumber Mike Scarpignato, the company focuses on building long-term relationships through quality workmanship, honest pricing, and community involvement.
