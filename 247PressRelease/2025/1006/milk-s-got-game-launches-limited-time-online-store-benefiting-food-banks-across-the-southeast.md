ATLANTA, GA, October 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance is bringing the Milk's Got Game campaign directly to fans and people across the Southeast with its first Online Store, providing a new way to show their school pride while supporting families in need. The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, offers limited-edition Milk's Got Game merchandise, with all net proceeds benefiting food banks across the region.   This season's Milk's Got Game campaign highlights collegiate athletes and their MVPs — their moms — who have supported them from day one with love, encouragement, and real dairy milk. The campaign shows how milk fuels strength, recovery, and everyday performance.   As the campaign celebrates the families and real dairy milk behind athletic success, the Milk's Got Game store gives fans a way to support their teams while giving back to local families through food banks. From family farms to local communities, the net proceeds from each item sold directly support food banks across the Southeast.   The online shop offers t-shirts, hats, sweatshirts, and vests, available through October 20, 2025. Purchases provide nutritious meals for families while reinforcing Milk's Got Game's focus on strength, recovery, and wellness on and off the field.
