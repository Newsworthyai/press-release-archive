# Logistics Employees Bring Action Against Trident Transport, LLC for Unpaid Overtime

MINNEAPOLIS, MN, October 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On September 12, 2025, an Account/Sales Manager filed an overtime lawsuit against Trident Transport, LLC, which is a logistics company that provides brokerage and freight services. The lawsuit seeks unpaid overtime compensation for Account Managers, Sales Managers, Business Development Representatives, Carrier Sales Representatives, and Capacity Sales Representatives who were employed by the company anywhere in the United States within the past three years.  The Complaint alleges that Trident misclassified these employees as exempt from overtime pay and did not pay them an overtime premium when they worked over 40 hours in a workweek. It seeks to maintain the case as a collective action under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The Complaint requests overtime backpay and double damages for workers.  Michele R. Fisher, one of the attorneys representing the workers, stated, "working in logistics is a demanding job that requires long and varied hours to meet customer needs. We believe that these employees were misclassified as exempt from overtime pay and are owed additional pay for their overtime worked."  Plaintiffs are represented by Michele R. Fisher and Alexandra M. Robinson of Nichols Kaster, PLLP, which has offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota and San Francisco, California. The case is titled: Dennis v. Trident Transport LLC, Case No. 1:25-cv-00297 (Eastern District of Tennessee).
