# Morrow &amp; Sheppard Secures $31.4 Million Settlement for Oilfield Explosion Victims in Texas

HOUSTON, TX, July 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Morrow & Sheppard LLP is proud to announce a $31,400,000 settlement on behalf of two clients who suffered severe burns and other serious injuries in a Texas oilfield explosion.  The incident occurred while the two men were cleaning a tank at a remote oilfield site. Within days of the explosion, Morrow & Sheppard Law Firm was retained and immediately launched a full-scale investigation. The firm quickly assembled a team of oilfield and explosion experts, retained leading medical specialists, and filed suit shortly thereafter.  Over the following months, Morrow & Sheppard took more than two dozen depositions, responded to aggressive defense tactics, and successfully defeated multiple efforts by the defendants to dismiss the case. Despite the complexity of the matter and the defendants' complete denial of responsibility, the firm resolved the case in under 24 months—securing a $31.4 million settlement. Attorneys' fees and case expenses totaled $13,157,760.67.  "We knew from the beginning that this would be a hard-fought battle," said partner John Sheppard, who led the case. "The defendants tried to blame our clients for what happened, but the evidence told a very different story. We worked relentlessly from day one to uncover the truth and pursue justice."  Attorney Nick Morrow, co-founding partner of the firm, added:  "This case reflects what our law firm stands for. We take the time to truly understand the people we represent—their stories, their struggles, and their goals. That personal connection drives our commitment to deliver the best possible outcome for every client we serve."  Morrow & Sheppard LLP represents clients nationwide in catastrophic personal injury, wrongful death, and workplace accident cases, with deep experience in oilfield, maritime, and industrial cases.
