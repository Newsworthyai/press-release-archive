# California Tortilla Brings the Fun Back for Discovery Channel's Shark Week

POTAMAC, MD, July 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- California Tortilla, the unique fast-casual restaurant franchise known for its bold "California-style" Mexican food, is taking a bite out of summer with the return of its Shark Week promotion. Starting Wednesday, July 23, guests who purchase a fish taco will receive a free Shark Fin Hat, available only in-store while supplies last. To keep the flavor frenzy going, guests who wear the hat back by the end of the month get a Free Fish Taco when they make any purchase. Plus, any guests who model the hat, post on any social media platform and tag @caltort will get a free taco added to their Burrito Elito account.   "Shark Week has always brought out the fun in our guests and in us," said Keith Goldman, President & CEO of California Tortilla. "This promotion is the perfect mix of flavor, nostalgia, and just plain fun. We're all about delivering bold food and experiences, and nothing says that quite like free tacos and a fin on your head."
