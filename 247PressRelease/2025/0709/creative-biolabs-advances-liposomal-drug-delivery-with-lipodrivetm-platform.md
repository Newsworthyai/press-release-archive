# Creative Biolabs Advances Liposomal Drug Delivery with LipoDrive™ Platform

SHIRLEY, NY, July 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As the biopharmaceutical scientists are put under pressure to work faster and improve formulation stability, liposomes have emerged as a go-to technology once again for encapsulating nucleic acids, peptides, and small molecules. As global demand for precision drug delivery systems continues to grow, Creative Biolabs showcases its advanced liposome production solutions and LipoDrive™ liposome development platform, meant to accelerate the development of lipid-based drugs.  "The LipoDrive™ platform integrates microfluidic technology, custom lipid synthesis, and advanced analytical equipment and drives liposome formulation and manufacture in an efficient way," a scientist who works on lipid-based delivery systems elaborated. "This provides scientists with flexible, high-performance solutions that save on development time and enhance formulation accuracy."  Key Benefits of the LipoDrive™ Platform • Custom lipid synthesis with headgroup/tail functionality specifically designed for specific delivery goals • Microfluidics-based formulation for repeatable, homogeneous batches of liposomes • Diversity encapsulation, including hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphipathic payloads • Surface functionalization for targeted delivery (e.g., PEGylation, antibody/aptamer tagging) • Advanced characterization by DLS, TEM, zeta potential, and ³¹P NMR to confirm structure and function  The platform supports a wide range of applications, including mRNA vaccine manufacturing and CAR-T delivery vectors, as well as cosmeceutical formulation, and is backed by formulation scientists who tailor each project to meet individual research and regulatory needs.  Liposomal Manufacturing Excellence Services offered by Creative Biolabs for liposome manufacturing cover pilot-scale studies of feasibility to commercial-scale manufacturing, supported by: • High-yield and reproducible production through microfluidic scale-up • Process optimization and quality control in accordance with international standards • Encapsulation of active bioingredients such as CoQ10, ceramides, and GSH for enhanced bioavailability • Flexible batch sizes to accommodate pilot studies and commercial demand  The company's manufacturing plants are designed to be cost-efficient, repeatable, and regulatory compliant, ensuring clients' access to high-quality liposomal products suitable for downstream use.   "Our end-to-end approach—bringing the LipoDrive™ platform together with sturdy manufacturing—allows clients to have confidence going from idea to product," stated the scientist. "We're not just a service business; we're a strategic collaborator in lipid-based innovation."
