# U.S. Term Limits Thanks Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins for Longstanding Commitment to Term Limits and Pledge to Ensure Accurate Ballot Language

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, July 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- U.S. Term Limits (USTL), the nation's leading nonpartisan advocate for term limits, commends Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins for his long-standing commitment to protecting term limits and his recent public pledge to ensure truthful, transparent ballot language on any proposed changes to Missouri's term limit laws.  Secretary Hoskins has been a consistent champion of term limits throughout his public service career—first as a legislator and now as Missouri's top election official. While serving in the Missouri General Assembly, he sponsored multiple measures to defend and strengthen term limits, demonstrating his dedication to responsive, accountable government.  Today, that commitment continues with his strong stance on ballot language integrity. In a public pledge, Secretary Hoskins vowed to "write ballot language that accurately reflects any measure to lengthen term limits, ensuring voters are fully informed without the use of misleading terms like 'reducing' or 'establishing' term limits."  This pledge is critical in a political climate where deceptive ballot wording can be used to erode reforms voters overwhelmingly support. Secretary Hoskins' promise to protect the integrity of the ballot box reflects both his principled leadership and a deep respect for the will of Missouri voters.  "Missourians deserve full transparency when it comes to protecting our democratic principles," said Secretary Hoskins. "I'm proud to pledge that ballot language proposed in Missouri will be clear, straightforward, and free from misleading language. Voters must be empowered with the facts—nothing less."  USTL President Philip Blumel praised the move: "Denny Hoskins has once again proven that he stands firmly with Missouri voters. As Secretary of State, he has the power—and now, the public commitment—to ensure that ballot language reflects the truth, not political spin. His leadership is a model for how to safeguard the democratic process."  Missouri voters have consistently and overwhelmingly supported term limits. Any effort to weaken these laws must be presented clearly and honestly—without manipulation or hidden agendas. Secretary Hoskins' action is a vital step in defending that voter mandate.  U.S. Term Limits applauds Secretary Hoskins for his integrity, his courage, and his unwavering dedication to democratic transparency. We look forward to continuing to work alongside him to protect term limits in Missouri and across the country.  U.S. Term Limits is the largest nonpartisan, nonprofit organization advocating solely on term limits. Our mission is to improve the quality of government with a citizen legislature that closely reflects its constituency and is responsive to the needs of the people it serves. U.S. Term Limits does not require a self-limit on individuals. Our aim is to limit the terms of all members of Congress as an institution. Find out more at termlimits.org.
