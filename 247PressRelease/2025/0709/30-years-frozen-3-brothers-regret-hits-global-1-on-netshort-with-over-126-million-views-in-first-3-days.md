# "30 Years Frozen: 3 Brothers Regret" Hits Global #1 on NetShort with Over 126 Million Views in First 3 Days

LOS ANGELES, CA, July 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The success of this story-driven vertical short is no accident — it's the result of a tight-knit, high-caliber team of producers and filmmakers who brought indie discipline to a viral frontier.  Produced by Rion Ezra, George Bladon, and Maximilian Seed, the project was filmed in Los Angeles over just 8 days and came in under budget, defying industry trends. While many productions have begun to shy away from L.A. due to rising costs, this team has proven that with sharp planning, resourceful crews, and creative grit, indie-scale production in Los Angeles is not only possible — it's thriving. Their approach could signal the start of a new wave of lean, high-impact content born right in the heart of Hollywood.  Directed by rising talent Mengfang Yang and lensed by cinematographer Ziggy Jaz van Koeverden, the piece taps into a raw emotional current that resonates across cultures and age groups. The cast includes digital icon Tiffany Alvord, alongside Sam Myerson, Adam Santa Cruz, Mick Krause, and Quincy Symeczek — a blend of vertical-native performers and classically trained actors.  "The vertical space is finally ready for real cinema — stories with substance, risk, and style," said producer Rion Ezra.  30 Years Frozen: 3 Brothers Regret explores themes of time, regret, and fractured family in a stylized, cinematic format optimized for vertical storytelling. This hybrid approach — combining digital-native pacing with indie-film integrity — is fast becoming the new gold standard for short-form content.  With global impact and minimal production time, the project is a shining example of how vertical filmmaking can be both visually rich and culturally relevant — and how Los Angeles might just be the epicenter for its creative future.
