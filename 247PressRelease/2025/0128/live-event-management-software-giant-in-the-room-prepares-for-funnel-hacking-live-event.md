# Live Event Management Software Giant In The Room Prepares for Funnel Hacking Live Event

LAS VEGAS, NV, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Russell Brunson's tenth and final Funnel Hacking Live event is coming soon, and In The Room will be the driving force behind the event registration and management. In The Room specializes in live event software that allows for data collection, lead generation, and maximized monetization for event coordinators. The February Funnel Hacking Live event will be in Las Vegas, Nevada, with speakers like renowned author and life coach Tony Robbins to address thousands of entrepreneurs over four days.   Event attendees and event managers alike appreciate the streamlined event check-in software that In The Room offers. With print-on-demand badges equipped with QR codes, attendees can access all the event information they need in one tap of their phone. Managers can track data from radio-frequency identification (RFID) badges to monitor the movements of attendees in real time. This allows for real-time adjustments to seating, and it provides detailed statistics about the demographics of the attendees to help in preparation for the next event.  "We want event managers to have in-depth statistics about who is 'In The Room' at each portion of an event," explained Blaze Faillaci, Co-Founder and CEO of In The Room. Faillaci appreciates the raw data and statistics that In The Room can now provide to organizers. "When managers have this data, they can make informed decisions about their current event and make marketing or venue changes for future events."   By harnessing the potential of event management with QR codes, In The Room also allows attendees to network efficiently. The same codes that link attendees to event details can also act as a form of digital business card for them to efficiently exchange contact information easily.   In The Room has managed Funnel Hacking Live events for Russell Brunson in the past, yielding an additional $2.8 million in sales through the event technology they provided.
