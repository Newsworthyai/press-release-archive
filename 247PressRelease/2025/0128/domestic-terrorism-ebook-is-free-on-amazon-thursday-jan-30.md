# Domestic Terrorism eBook is Free on Amazon Thursday, Jan. 30

PORTLAND, OR, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Book 3 in the The Anti-Hero Rebellions series, January 6: A Novel, will be available in eBook on Thursday, Jan. 30th on Amazon, author Norman Brewer announced. https://rebrand.ly/odddpev  While works of fiction, The Anti-Hero Rebellions capture story lines that could jump out of today's partisan politics.  In January 6: A Novel, Democracy comes under siege when the President's rally morphs into a mob and storms the Capitol.  Right-wing extremists take the House Speaker hostage, force a horrific standoff and unleash terrorism nationwide. Assassinations, bombings in malls and other attacks inflame civil unrest.  The President weighs declaring martial law to restore order – and justify refusing to leave office.  "Drawing on skills honed as a Washington journalist … Brewer spins an all-too-plausible tale showing how easily events could have followed a worse course, with consequences even more ominous for the future of our democracy. The result is a great read and a work of genuine value," said G. J. Meyer, New York Times bestselling author of A World Undone.  January 6: A Novel was a 2024 Readers' Favorite Award Finalist for political thrillers. Books in The Anti-Hero Rebellions series are Amazon bestsellers.   Book 1 is Blending In: A Tale of Homegrown Terrorism. Casualties mount as two ruthless terrorists attack soft targets – a press conference in D.C., an iconic mall in the Heartland. Civil unrest is rampant. Fear grips the nation. Other right-wing extremists join their horrific crusade. Can they be stopped?  Book 2 is 'Killer Politics - A Satirical Tale of Homegrown Terrorism,' with a Trump-like president inspiring a white supremacist to attack innocents in a treasonous bid to incite civil war. Killer Politics can be read as a stand-alone book or a sequel to Blending In.   Brewer worked for The Des Moines Register and Tribune and for Gannett News Service in Washington, D.C., covering Congress, the White House, and pursuing award-winning investigations. He was also Director of Employee Communications at the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. He can be reached at bbyb1@outlook.com.
