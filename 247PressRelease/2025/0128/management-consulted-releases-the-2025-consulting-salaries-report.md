# Management Consulted Releases The 2025 Consulting Salaries Report

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 2025 version of the annual Consulting Salaries Report has been released by Management Consulted, the world's leading expert on the consulting industry. According to this much-anticipated report, despite an increase in demand for consulting services, starting salaries in the consulting industry remained stagnant for the second consecutive year.  Based on information provided by more than 4 million readers, individual customers, and consulting firms, the research highlights significant trends that impact the sector, such as: Stagnant Starting Salaries: First-year consultants out of undergraduate programs can expect up to ~$112k in base salary, while MBA hires can expect up to ~$192k.  • AI's Impact on Productivity: Enhanced efficiencies are enabling firms to do more with fewer staff, contributing to flat compensation.   • Market Dynamics: The need for consulting is still high, and outsized demand exists in the supply chain, cloud, and healthcare verticals.  • Shifts in Recruitment: In an effort to maintain margins, firms are prioritizing pre-MBA hires over MBA hires.  The report also notes the fact that trends in consulting are a "canary in the coal mine" for what we can expect to see in the broader economy.   Hiring and productivity trends first seen in consulting are the same recommendations that end up being implemented by the large global corporations that are advised by consulting firms.   Where the demand for consulting services is coming from is a leading indicator of where growth in the economy will take place.  However, the report outlines that even if global macroeconomic activity picks up in 2025, challenges are still likely to arise. Opportunities for industry growth could be limited by inflation and persistently high interest rates. There are no signs that the labor market will return to a white-hot state, which will enable firms to hold the line on further salary increases.  Management Consulted continues to drive industry leadership through its partnerships with top organizations like Meta, American Express, and eBay, providing bespoke training programs that upskill teams and improve advisory effectiveness.
