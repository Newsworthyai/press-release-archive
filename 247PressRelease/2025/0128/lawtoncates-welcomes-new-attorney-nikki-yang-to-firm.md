# LawtonCates Welcomes New Attorney Nikki Yang to Firm

MADISON, WI, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- LawtonCates announced today an addition to its South Central Wisconsin law firm with Nikki Yang joining as an attorney in personal injury, civil rights, contract disputes, and criminal defense practice areas.   Yang is a skilled lawyer who graduated from the University of Wisconsin School of Law. Born in China, she grew up in a family of legal professionals and was drawn to fighting injustices even as a child.   "I remember, as a fourth-grader "advocate," I presented "evidence" and delivered "arguments" in front of the school principal in an effort to speak up for a classmate who was bullied by the principal's grandson. I was frustrated when the principal swept the whole thing under the rug, and I thought how wonderful it would be if I was a lawyer to right that wrong," she told Wisconsin Lawyer magazine in a 2021 interview.  Yang is fluent in English and Mandarin, enabling her to represent clients from diverse backgrounds in various legal matters.   "Nikki brings a wealth of legal knowledge to LawtonCates," says LawtonCates attorney Dixon Gahnz. "She is a zealous advocate for every client she represents and a welcome addition to our firm."
