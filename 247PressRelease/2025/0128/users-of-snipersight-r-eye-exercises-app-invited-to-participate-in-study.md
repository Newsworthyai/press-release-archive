# Users of SniperSight®: Eye Exercises App Invited to Participate in Study

CINCINNATI, OH, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The SniperSight: Eye Exercises app is based on Dr William Horatio Bates' eye exercises, which were first trialed 100 years ago as he and his associates recorded hundreds of case studies to prove the efficacy of his method. A century later, it's time for an update. The aim of the new study is to attract one of the largest samples of users ever and have them record their findings on the Apple App Store review platform, possibly using AI to assist with tabulation.  By 2050, according to projections made by researchers at the Brien Holden Vision Institute, more than four billion people globally will require some kind of corrective lenses. In the US alone, more than 61% of the population is projected to need some kind of vision correction. The exercises used in the app were designed a century ago to improve vision naturally. Today, they can also be used to alleviate the eyestrain and distress caused by hours spent staring at screens. SniperSight: Eye Exercises is an exceptional app that can help people who use glasses or contacts to regain clear, effective vision, even allowing some to avoid the need for glasses altogether.   Users are now being given the opportunity to report their findings as part of a new study.  To participate, users just need to download the app, SniperSight: Eye Exercises, from the App Store, use it for at least three months, and report their findings on the Apple App Store review platform, including their responses to the following:  Condition (near-sightedness, far-sightedness, etc.) Age Gender History (how long they have been using glasses) Measurement of current vision (20/..) Treatment (which SniperSight techniques were used) Results (what happened)  The app has a robust, user-friendly interface and offers a pattern of exercises designed for almost all kinds of eye conditions. It is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. The exercises work for any age group and include clear step-by-step instructions with visuals.  SniperSight: Eye Exercises  is available worldwide, exclusively through the App Store in the Lifestyle section.
