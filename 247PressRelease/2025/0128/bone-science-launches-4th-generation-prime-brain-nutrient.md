# Bone Science Launches 4th Generation Prime Brain Nutrient

BOSTON, MA, January 28, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bone Science, a global leader in health innovation, has launched the fourth generation of Prime Brain, a cutting-edge supplement designed to support cognitive development in growing children and adolescents. Building on the rapid sell-out success of its predecessors, Prime Brain continues Bone Science's commitment to fostering holistic growth.  The development of Prime Brain reflects the expertise of Dr. Gene Bruno, now Chief Scientific Officer of Nutraland USA, who has a long history of research and innovation in the field of nutritional science. His contributions have been integral to formulating the nutrients essential for developing brains.  Prime Brain is specifically designed to improve academic focus and reduce academic stress in adolescents, providing much-needed support during a critical time of intellectual and emotional development.  Prime Brain features a powerful combination of nutrients to support brain health, focus, and stress management. Key ingredients include alpha-GPC to support memory and learning, L-theanine to help with relaxation and focus, and Rhodiola rosea extract to enhance mental endurance in stressful situations.  Prime Brain's advanced formulation includes Alpha-GPC, a nutrient known for its ability to enhance memory and learning by increasing acetylcholine production, a critical brain neurotransmitter. Additionally, L-theanine has been included for its dual role in promoting relaxation and sharpening focus, while Rhodiola rosea extract supports mental resilience and endurance, especially in stressful situations. These carefully selected ingredients work together to create a well-rounded approach to cognitive health, addressing the unique challenges faced by growing children and adolescents.  Parents who have incorporated Prime Brain into their child's daily routine have reported noticeable improvements, including increased focus and confidence. "Prime Brain has greatly improved my child's academic performance," said one parent.  Prime Brain is currently available for purchase on the official Bone Science website.
