# JuanTax and Jaz Philippines Merge to Launch First AI-Driven Accounting Software in the Philippines

MANILA, PHILIPPINES, February 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a transformative move to redefine the accounting landscape for Filipino businesses, JuanTax, ​​the Philippines' leading electronic tax software provider, and Jaz Philippines—​​the local business unit of Singapore-based Jaz, have joined forces to introduce Juan Accounting Software (Juan). This pioneering platform integrates accounting, payments, financial reporting, and tax compliance into one seamless, AI-powered solution tailored for small and medium businesses (SMBs).  "Our mission is to empower Filipino businesses to focus on growth and innovation, while we take care of the complexities of accounting and tax compliance," said Marvin Galang, Co-founder and CEO of JuanTax. "With this merger, we've combined local expertise and Jaz's advanced accounting technology infrastructure to create Juan–a solution that's built by Filipinos, for the Philippines."   Simplifying SMB Accounting & Tax Compliance Like Never Before  Juan directly addresses the long-standing pain points faced by Filipino SMBs, which often rely on clunky spreadsheets and multiple tools to manage their accounting and tax needs. The fragmented approach leads to inefficiencies, costly errors, and wasted time.  As the Philippines' only fully integrated accounting solution, Juan deeply understands local business practices, tax regulations, and accounting standards. Its highly localized features, such as adherence to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) regulations, ensure businesses stay compliant while reducing the burden of manual processes. The platform ultimately empowers businesses to streamline operations, increase productivity, and save on costs.  "Thrilled to back Marvin and the Juan team in their vision for the Philippines. They have an impressive track record in building accounting partnerships, communities, and ecosystems, so we are confident about what we'll be able to achieve together," said Ajay Gopal, Founder and CEO of Jaz. "Southeast Asia is at a tipping point in accounting innovation, and we're doubling down on the Philippines being one of the leaders in next-gen accounting and finance tech."  A Localized Solution that Stands Apart  Unlike generic international software like QuickBooks, Juan stands out for its localized, user-friendly design tailored to Filipino SMBs and accountants. Its integration of accounting and tax processes eliminates the need for multiple tools, allowing businesses to focus on what matters most–growing their ventures.  Juan's advanced AI also brings unique value to Philippine accountants and bookkeepers. Building on Jaz's patented multi-agentic system, Juan deploys autonomous agents that specialize in local accounting and tax standards. This innovation addresses the country's accounting labor shortage by enabling firms to scale operations efficiently while maintaining quality and compliance.   Built on Trusted Foundations  The roots of Juan traces back to JuanTax, the Philippines' first fully accredited electronic tax software provider (eTSP) recognized by the BIR. Since its launch in 2017, JuanTax has established itself as a trusted partner for accountants and businesses, with thousands of active users and a growing community of JuanTax-certified professionals.  The strategic merger with Jaz marks the next chapter in its success story, expanding Juan's capabilities into a comprehensive accounting and tax solution designed to meet the specific evolving needs of Filipino SMBs.  With the launch campaign "We Are Juan," Juan embodies the vision of modernizing the Philippines' accounting industry while fostering unity among Filipino professionals and businesses.  "Juan is more than just a software; it's a movement to help Filipino SMBs thrive," added Galang. "Our goal is to simplify bookkeeping, compliance, and reporting, so businesses can focus on growing their profits. We're excited to see how this technology transforms the future of accounting in the Philippines."  Juan is now available to accountants, bookkeepers, and SMBs across the Philippines.
