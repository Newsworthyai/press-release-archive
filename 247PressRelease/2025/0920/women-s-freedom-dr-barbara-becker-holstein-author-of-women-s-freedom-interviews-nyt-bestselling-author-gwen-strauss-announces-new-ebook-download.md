# Women's Freedom: Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein, Author Of Women's Freedom, Interviews NYT Bestselling Author Gwen Strauss, Announces New Ebook Download

WILMINGTON, NC, September 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Barbara Becker Holstein recently interviewed NYT Bestselling Author Gwen Strauss about her historical fiction novel, 'The Nine: The True Story of a Band of Women Who Survived the Worst of Nazi Germany.' She also announced that the ebook version of 'Women's Freedom: Unfinished Love Stories' will be available September 22, 2025 at no charge at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbara-Becker-Holstein/author/B001JXEZ8U?.  The Wall Street Journal called The Nine "[A] narrative of unfathomable courage". 'The Nine' follows the true story of the author's great aunt Hélène Podliasky, who led a band of nine female resistance fighters as they escaped a German forced labor camp and made a ten-day journey across the front lines of WWII from Germany back to Paris.  The nine women were all under thirty when they joined the resistance. They smuggled arms through Europe, harbored parachuting agents, coordinated communications between regional sectors, trekked escape routes to Spain and hid Jewish children in scattered apartments. They were arrested by French police, interrogated and tortured by the Gestapo. They were subjected to a series of French prisons and deported to Germany. The group formed along the way, meeting at different points, in prison, in transit, and at Ravensbrück. By the time they were enslaved at the labor camp in Leipzig, they were a close-knit group of friends. During the final days of the war, forced onto a death march, the nine chose their moment and made a daring escape.  Drawing on incredible research, this powerful, heart-stopping narrative from Gwen Strauss is a moving tribute to the power of humanity and friendship in the darkest of times.  The interview with Strauss is available at Dr. Holstein's website at https://www.enchantedself.com/enchanted-self-returns/.  The no-charge download of the ebook version of 'Women's Freedom, Unfinished Love Stories, will take place September 22, 2025 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbara-Becker-Holstein/author/B001JXEZ8U?.  From 1960 to the present day, the role of women in society has undergone a dramatic transformation. In the early 60s, women were often confined to domestic spaces, their aspirations curtailed by rigid societal norms. But change was on the horizon.  The feminist movements of the 1960s and 70s challenged the status quo, opening doors that had long been closed. Women began to assert themselves in every sphere—education, the workforce, and eventually, the halls of power. By the 21st century, they had not only shattered glass ceilings but redefined them, ascending to leadership roles once deemed unattainable.  The fight is far from over—and stories like Holstein's serve as powerful reminders of how far we've come, and how much remains unfinished.  In 'Women's Freedom, Unfinished Love Stories', Holstein turns back the clock to the 1960s, introducing readers to three young college women at a pivotal moment in both their personal lives and the history of women's rights. Through their experiences—marked by awakening, identity struggles, and the pursuit of purpose—Holstein captures the emotional and psychological terrain that defined a generation.  What do their stories reveal? That while the cultural landscape may evolve, the core desires for autonomy, love, and self-expression remain timeless. Their journeys mirror the collective experiences of women across decades, making this novel not only deeply moving but profoundly resonant.  Dr. Holstein is known for wrapping Positive Psychology concepts in forms of media that people find engaging, relatable and inspiring. These include:  Four bestselling, award-winning books (perfect for school libraries)  Four self-esteem workbooks for girls 8 and up  Award-winning films and coming of age selfie films  Podcasts  Dedicated websites  Stage plays  A library of articles  Ted-style talks  As a school psychologist and in her private practice, Dr. Holstein has worked with many children and parents, helping them to develop life skills in decision-making, recognition of their own talents, feel more courageous, and helping both kids and parents develop more successful inter-generational skills.
