As the Georgia Accounting Food Fight concludes its 12th year, Boyd Search, CEO of The Georgia Society of CPAs, celebrated the campaign's record-breaking impact: "This year was our most successful yet, with CPAs across Georgia raising more than $380,000 to fight hunger. Together, we've now contributed nearly $2.9 million since launching this initiativeâ€”a remarkable reflection of the generosity and commitment of our profession. When we come together with a shared purpose, there's no limit to what we can achieve for our communities."  Right now, 1 in 7 Georgians is experiencing food insecurity, meaning they may not know when their next meal will be. Fundraisers like the Georgia Accounting Food Fight are more crucial than ever. The fundraising efforts will directly support Feeding Georgia's mission to provide nutritious meals to those in need and create a hunger-free Georgia.
