# Captain Steel India Ltd. Launches Captain RustGuard TMT to Protect India's Buildings from Their Silent Enemy: Rust

KOLKATA, INDIA, September 20, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Rust is an unending, expensive problem to anyone who is constructing along the long coastlines of India or in the damp interiors. Captain Steel India Ltd. is a well-known construction company that has a new, robust solution today: Captain RUSTGuard TMT. This high-strength reinforcement bar is combined with durability against corrosion, which is the silent killer of buildings.  Over the years, buildings have been prematurely ended by moisture and salt laden air. Captain RustGuard TMT counters this problem head‑on. The bars are coated with an engineered, fusion bonded epoxy that forms an armoured protective layer that prevents water penetration to the steel. This straightforward but radical element can vastly lengthen the lifetimes of everything as family homes and beach resorts to bridges and industrial factories.  "We've seen too many structures weaken before their time because of something as preventable as rust," said Mr. Avinash Agarwalla, Director of Captain Steel India Ltd. "We asked ourselves: what if we could create a TMT bar that actively fights back? Captain RustGuard is our answer. This is not a matter of selling steel. It means providing peace of mind to families in their homes and also having infrastructure we will build today to be solid to our children and grandchildren. It is about creating a heritage of trust and safety."  In addition to anti‑rust style, Captain RustGuard provides the desired high performance offered by Captain Steel. Its high strength to weight ratio enables architects and engineers to create more daring and beautiful buildings without necessarily being bogged down by weighty materials. Its high bendability ensures that construction workers can handle it comfortably on the ground, which saves a lot of time and efforts.  Key benefits that builders and homeowners can expect from Captain RustGuard TMT  Built for the Coastline: A specialized epoxy shield stops rust before it starts, making it the perfect choice for any project exposed to moisture, salt, or industrial pollutants.  Generational Lifespan: The building under this design has its lifespan increased radically, securing your investment and making it safe over numerous years.  Leaner, Stronger Construction: Build stronger structures with less steel and more efficient and cost-effective designs.
