# Live from the Rhine with Club Cruise™: Heather Viking's Journey Continues—Cycling, Cruising &amp; Connecting Across Europe's Most Legendary River with AmaWaterways® &amp; Backroads®

EUROPE, August 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When you picture a river cruise, you might imagine retirees in deck chairs sipping Riesling. But for Heather Viking, 30-something travel expert, tech tinkerer, and queen of cruise cool—it's a rain-splashed, wine-swirled, pedal-powered journey across four countries, all while wearing smart glasses that translate menus and music in real-time.  In fact, the love for cruising seems to run in the family. Heather joked that after two AmaWaterways sailings, she was tempted to claim the nickname "AmaHuber." But she quickly realized that title really belongs to her mom—Amanda Huber, President of Club Cruise™ and the true Ama authority of the household. "Amanda is the OG AmaHuber," Heather laughed. "Just like Jeffrey goes by Jef or 'el Jefe', it only makes sense we all end up with cruise nicknames. That's what happens when you grow up in a travel family—we're all shaped by the sea."  This month, Heather wrapped a week-long AmaWaterways + Backroads Rhine River tour aboard the ultra-sleek AmaViola, starting in Basel, Switzerland and drifting (slash biking) all the way to Amsterdam. Picture castle towns, croissant stops, a few surprise downpours, and daily cycling through vineyards, valleys, and village markets—all while keeping it stylish in a windbreaker and tech gear.  Her floating home base? A dreamy Category AB stateroom with twin balconies, warm woods, and understated elegance. "Honestly, Ama's ships feel like boutique hotels that happen to float. I'd move in if they let me," Heather joked.  Along the way, Heather tested the latest in wearable travel technology: a prototype pair of AR-enabled smart glasses powered by real-time language translation, AI audio processing, and augmented navigation tools. The device, rumored to integrate Google Glass Enterprise capabilities with custom travel software, allowed Heather to interpret signs, menus, and spoken conversations in five languages while accessing GPS overlays, live camera capture, and synced cultural insights on the go. "It felt like my own concierge, interpreter, and videographer—right in my line of sight,"   Heather Viking explained. "This kind of smart travel gear will absolutely change how luxury travelers explore Europe, especially on immersive cruise and cycling journeys like this." With smart glasses translating five languages and guiding riverside bike paths, she documented everything—from schnitzel dinners and castle climbs to dance-offs onboard the AmaViola.  Each day began with a gourmet breakfast and ended with a curated, wine-paired dinner onboard—often while docked overnight in towns like Rüdesheim or Speyer, allowing for lingering local strolls, surprise chocolate shops, and evening photo walks under the stars. "The food is just next level," Heather said. "Regional flavors, perfect portions, and a rotating menu that always made it hard to choose just one dish."  More than once, the evenings turned festive. With a little nudge from the Cruise Director and a carryover spirit from Heather's recent Windstar sailing in Tahiti—where karaoke, dancing, and theme nights became a nightly ritual—Heather found herself leading a group rendition of ABBA and joining spontaneous dance-offs in the lounge. "The Cruise Director joked I should host," she laughed, "and my friend Nick Valdes is the real deal when its come to starting the Congo-line, who joined us in Bora Bora, who coined the name ' I am the 'Experience.' We made it a whole thing: 'I am the Experience!' Might have to trademark that, anyhow Nick, Lance and Julia on my Viking Department team, will get it."  Her first AmaWaterways cruise was through France's Rhône Valley wine country—and this Rhine follow-up didn't disappoint. From the thoughtful onboard service to menus that match the region you just pedaled through, Heather describes Ama as "the sweet spot between luxury and laid-back."  On land, Backroads.com absolutely delivered. Their e-bike setups, seamless support vans, charming hosts, and detailed ride planning meant that every guest—from seasoned cyclists to nervous newbies—felt empowered, safe, and genuinely part of something special. "It's not just exercise. It's life-expanding. You bond, you laugh, you pause and feel present," Heather said. "The price tag? Worth it. Twice over. This is five-star immersion."  She rode through the Black Forest, wandered Strasbourg's flower-covered canals, tackled castle climbs in Heidelberg, and enjoyed beer garden downtime by Cologne. Along the way? Pretzels. Schnitzel. Champagne. And yes, more pretzels.  There was even a dinner where five languages were spoken around the table—and Heather followed every word again thanks to those superman Meta-Google prototype glasses. These next-gen specs translate in real time, stream music from California playlists, read signs aloud, and even guide with built-in maps. "It's like having a tour guide, translator, and DJ right on your face."  According to Amanda Huber, or perhaps more fittingly "Ama Huber", President of Club Cruise™, "Heather is quietly beta testing what luxury travel is going to look like in the next five years. Her clients are going to have access to tools—and insights—that completely shift the way we plan trips."  And it's not just for the tech set. Heather made it clear this trip is a fit for anyone—including seniors, couples, and solo travelers—looking for adventure without stress. "You're supported the whole way. You feel safe. You get to lean back into the experience while someone else handles the routes, reservations, and gear."  Each evening, the AmaViola welcomed guests back with regional dishes, wine pairings, and cozy lounges that sparked spontaneous conversations and travel bonding.  Heather couldn't help but think of her sister, Chef Sabrina—the family's true culinary powerhouse. A master's graduate of Italy's prestigious UNISG.it (University of Gastronomic Sciences), Sabrina previously joined Heather on their last AmaWaterways sailing through the Rhône wine region, where her passion for food, wine, and storytelling shone brightly. "She would've absolutely loved this itinerary," Heather shared. "The local flavors, the thoughtful pairings, the relaxed rhythm of dinner onboard—it's exactly her thing."  But this summer, Chef Sabrina is holding down the fort as a rising star at Single Thread in Healdsburg, California—one of the world's most acclaimed restaurants with three Michelin stars and a 2025 La Liste #1 Top World Restaurant ranking. "They're not letting her out of the kitchen this season, not even for schnitzel on the Rhine!" Heather laughed. "But she's cheering from afar, and I know we'll sail together again soon." "There's something healing about floating into a new world each day—then pedaling right into it."  As Heather Viking wraps her time on the Rhine and turns toward the Greek Isles aboard Viking Ocean Cruises, she reflects on the quiet power of European river travel. "It's not flashy. It's deeply human. And that's the magic."  More to come... After a quick farewell toast in Amsterdam, Heather heads east for a one-night stay in the storybook city of Prague—a favorite pre- or post-cruise extension on many Danube River itineraries. Then it's wheels up for her next major adventure: flying into Budapest and onward to Türkiye, where she'll reunite with Viking BDM Mario Herrera from Los Angeles, California for 9 days of in-depth Viking Ocean Ship certifications, expert-hosted training, and Greek Island exploration.  From immersive site inspections in Athens to onboard innovation sessions and Aegean adventure stops, Heather's mission continues: learn it, live it, and bring it back to her clients and crew at Club Cruise™.
