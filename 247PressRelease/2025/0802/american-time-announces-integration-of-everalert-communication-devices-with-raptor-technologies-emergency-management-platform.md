# American Time Announces Integration of EverAlert Communication Devices with Raptor Technologies' Emergency Management Platform

DASSEL, MN, August 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This powerful integration enables automated, real-time coordination between Raptor's emergency alerting platform, connected to 911 through RapidSOS, and American Time's EverAlert system, which delivers instant, automated alerts and audiovisual notifications with a variety of activation devices throughout a building or campus during critical situations.  "This partnership brings together two trusted safety solutions to provide a smarter, faster response when it matters most," said George Wilkes, President of American Time. "By integrating Raptor's emergency response capabilities with EverAlert's visual and audible communication tools, we help schools and organizations meet increasingly stringent safety and compliance requirements." The integration reflects American Time's ongoing commitment to innovation in facility communication and safety, building on a legacy of synchronized solutions trusted nationwide.  Supporting Compliance with Alyssa's Law and Emergency Protocols  The EverAlertâ€“Raptor Emergency Management integration supports institutions working to meet mandates like Alyssa's Law, which calls for silent panic alert systems directly linked to law enforcement. In addition to fulfilling compliance, this development reinforces the Standard Response Protocols (SRP) developed by The "I Love U Guys" Foundation, helping schools implement consistent, clear, and effective actions during any crisis. By streamlining communication and reducing emergency response time, EverAlert and Raptor Emergency Management together improve safety, coordination, and preparedness across entire campuses.   Managed on the inCloud management portal, the EverAlert communication system is the result of over 45 years of American Time's experience in designing, developing, and building synchronized facility communication solutions, and exemplifies the continuous development and growing feature set of the EverAlert communication system. Released in 2017, the EverAlert system is employed by schools and businesses across the country to solve their communications needs.
