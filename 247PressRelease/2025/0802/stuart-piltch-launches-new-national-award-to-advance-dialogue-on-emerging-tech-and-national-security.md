What threats do you foresee, and what strategies would you propose to mitigate those risks while preserving civil liberties?"  The scholarship places a strong emphasis on originality, critical analysis, and practical application of ideas. Essays should reflect not only technical understanding, but also a strong awareness of the delicate balance between innovation, national defense, and civil liberty.  Stuart Piltch, the founder and namesake of the award, brings a multidisciplinary background that spans the intelligence, technology, healthcare, and national security sectors. His decades-long career includes contributions to national security strategy and testimony before Congressional Committees.

His commitment to cultivating a deeper national conversation around evolving security priorities reflects a career-long dedication to anticipating change and navigating complexity.  This initiative is not bound by geography and is open to undergraduates across all regions of the United States. The Stuart Piltch Award for National Security continues Stuart Piltch's tradition of supporting academic engagement with real-world challenges—this time through the lens of technology, strategy, and security.
