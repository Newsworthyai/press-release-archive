# Ex-ENT&amp;A CEO Bob Glazer Joins Prosidio as Strategic Advisor

WHITE PLAINS, NY, August 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Prosidio, the surgical-visualization company making premium endoscopy affordable for outpatient practices, today announced that Robert (Bob) Glazer, former Chief Executive Officer of ENT and Allergy Associates (ENT&A), the nation's largest ENT group, has signed on as a strategic advisor. Glazer's three-decade track record of building and scaling physician practices will help accelerate Prosidio's rollout of its suitcase-sized, chip-on-tip endoscopy platform.  "Bob understands the tightrope private practices walk between clinical excellence and capital budgets," said Jonathan Simmonds, MD, co-founder and CEO of Prosidio. "His insight into practice operations will be invaluable as we bring hospital-grade visualization to every exam room."  "I've followed Jonathan since his third-year residency at Tufts. His entrepreneurial drive, real-time surgical insight, and passion for technology are the forces behind Prosidio's chip-on-tip video scope, premium imaging that private practices can finally afford," said Bob Glazer.  Having witnessed Prosidio compress an entire endoscopy tower into a suitcase-sized 4K platform, Glazer says the chance to help private practices adopt the technology "was too compelling to pass up." He will guide the company's commercial strategy and distribution partnerships.  "Prosidio's all-in-one scope nails it for private practices, premium image quality at a price that actually makes sense. I know my colleagues in the otolaryngology space are looking for a state-of-the-art alternative, and I'm excited to help spread the word," Glazer added.  During his tenure at ENT&A, Glazer grew the group from 40 to more than 300 physicians across 60 locations, pioneering many of the operational playbooks now common in private ENT. As Prosidio's advisor, he will guide market expansion and physician-practice adoption. The collaboration underscores Prosidio's commitment to empowering outpatient specialists with cutting-edge tools that drive growth while keeping care affordable.  Prosidio is a privately held medical-device company headquartered in Port Chester, New York. We engineer ultra-compact 4K endoscopy and imaging systems that give surgeons the illumination, resolution, and ergonomics of top-tier hospital towers in a suitcase-sized footprint. By pairing optics designed with ENT and skull-base specialists with a cost-controlled supply chain, Prosidio makes advanced surgical visualization practical everywhere, from community clinics to mission theaters. Our mission is simple: to put world-class sight in every surgeon's hands, everywhere.
