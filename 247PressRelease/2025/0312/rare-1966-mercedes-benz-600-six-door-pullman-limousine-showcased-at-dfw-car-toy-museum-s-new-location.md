# Rare 1966 Mercedes-Benz 600 Six Door Pullman Limousine Showcased at DFW Car & Toy Museum's New Location

FORT WORTH, TX, March 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum, renowned for its impressive collection of 3,000 antique automotive toys and over 150 collector cars, is excited to highlight a truly rare automotive masterpiece—the 1966 Mercedes-Benz 600 6 Door Pullman Limousine.  Originally introduced at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Mercedes-Benz 600 was a marvel of automotive engineering, featuring an advanced hydraulic system that powered nearly every function of the car, including a self-leveling air suspension. Built in both a four-door short-wheelbase and two larger long-wheelbase configurations, including four- and six-door variants, the 600 became the epitome of dignified luxury.  Thanks to its technological sophistication, comfort, and commanding presence, the Mercedes-Benz 600 quickly became the preferred vehicle of world leaders, entertainment icons, and dignitaries—including the Pope.  One of only 428 long-wheelbase 600 Pullman limousines ever built, this particular 1966 model is even rarer—being just one of 42 six-door configurations, and among only 11 to feature a factory sunroof and air conditioning. Unlike most 600s, which were delivered worldwide to elite clientele, this specific chassis was retained by Mercedes-Benz to transport visiting engineers and VIP guests.  The limousine was later sold by the factory to Klaus Kienle, a former head of major repairs and special vehicles at Mercedes-Benz, who played a key role in overseeing the production of the 600 series. Kienle eventually founded Kienle Automobiltechnik in Heimerdingen, Germany, a world-renowned specialist in classic Mercedes-Benz restoration and maintenance.  Now part of the DFW Car & Toy Museum's esteemed collection, this 600 6 Door Pullman Limousine has been meticulously maintained, with documented service from Mercedes-Benz Classic Center USA. Subtly upgraded with modern entertainment amenities while retaining its unmistakable mid-century presence, it remains a symbol of prestige and innovation.  Formerly known as The DFW Elite Toy Museum, the DFW Car & Toy Museum is currently preparing for an exciting transition to Fort Worth. The new location at 2550 McMillan Parkway is set to open in the first quarter of 2025 following a remodel. Admission will remain free, offering enthusiasts and visitors an opportunity to experience this and many other extraordinary vehicles.
