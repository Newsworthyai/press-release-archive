# Gut Microbiota Research: Creative Biolabs Fuels Next-Gen Probiotics Development

SHIRLEY, NY, March 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The shift from conventional probiotics to next-generation probiotics (NGPs) allows for specific microbial manipulations, advancing the scope of disease research. Using deep understanding in microbiome science and live biotherapeutics (LBP), the company provides comprehensive services for NGP development.  In line with the company's strong continuity of NGP research, Creative Biolabs is placing emphasis on candidate strain selection and development that include functional features of immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, metabolism, and gut barrier protection.  For example, considerable attention has been focused on Akkermansia muciniphila due to its unique ability to enhance the intestinal barrier, modulate inflammation, and improve metabolic health. In addition, some Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium strains have the capacity to affect host immunity and metabolic homeostasis.  "Next-generation probiotics are more advanced and target specific ailments rather than treating general issues, which is the case with traditional probiotics," stated a Creative Biolabs' expert on probiotics. "Our group's work is to ensure maximum NGP research value is realized from the isolation, screening, genetic engineering, and even preclinical evaluation."  Next-generation probiotics become more personalized as the gut microbiota research deepens. Creative Biolabs currently offers a wide variety of services that include strain-specific NGP genetic engineering activities, as well as preliminary evaluation services, all to support the development of targeted microbial-based solutions.  • 16S rRNA Sequencing • Real-Time PCR • Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) • Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) • Metagenomics • Metatranscriptomics • Metaproteomics • Terminal RFLP (T-RFLP) analysis  Creative Biolabs also offers custom optimization and characterization services that provide fully defined engineered strains resulting from a process referred to as microbial capture, characterization, and host-microbe interaction model research. Creative Biolabs helps investigators design specific engineered strains with desired capabilities that include responding to biological cues, modulating the microbiota of the host, and even participating in different disease models, employing advanced gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9.  The expert further explained, "Through precise gene modification and pathway optimization, we can provide highly valuable engineered strains for future applications."  Apart from the laboratory research, in vivo safety studies are important for proving the functionality of NGPs and these engineered strains. To evaluate the safety and functionality of the engineered strains, Creative Biolabs employs a number of different animal models to simulate the actual physiological environment of the gut microbiota. Using experimental endocarditis rat models and some immunodeficient mouse models, Creative Biolabs assists clients in choosing the most useful strains.  "In vivo evaluation is a key part of our services, allowing researchers to test microbial strains in preclinical settings and verify the strains' utility in real-world scenarios," the expert told us.
