# Ripcord and Palantir Technologies Announce Strategic Partnership to Unlock New Layers of Enterprise Data with Robotics, AI, and Automation

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, March 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ripcord, the robotic digitization innovator, today announced a strategic partnership with Palantir that will enable customers to turn the trove of information trapped in their records into actionable insights and intelligence they can leverage immediately.   By combining Ripcord's cutting-edge robotic digitization technology with Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), organizations can seamlessly turn their paper and digital documents into data that can be used to drive actionable insights, inform sharper decisions, and train AI models.   This collaboration is poised to transform dozens of industries, from energy to financial services, healthcare, industrials, and more, as well as finance, legal, and operations departments across the globe by unlocking the insights trapped in paper documents. This partnership will also ensure that government missions across civilian and defense agencies are equally served by this groundbreaking technology and by using Palantir's platforms to significantly accelerate the compliance and security requirements of Federal requirements including FedRAMP and CMMC.  From Paper to Power In the United States alone, there are over four trillion paper records, growing at 20% per year. These records contain a wealth of information that, if digitized and analyzed, can create significant business and societal impact. Yet, over 95% of these records remain undigitized, stored in static physical archives, rendering them and the information they contain virtually useless. This is largely because legacy digitization methods are highly manual, slow, and outdated, making them cost-prohibitive and impractical at scale.   Enter Ripcord's digitization robots, which solve this problem by automating the manual work of physically turning paper records into digital files and actionable data. Ripcord's proprietary AI-powered robots prepare, digitize, classify, and extract critical information from documents at scale, delivering unmatched speed, efficiency, and cost savings.   Once digitized, the data derived from documents can be seamlessly ingested into Palantir's AIP, unlocking deeper insights and enabling smarter decision-making. Using this data in Palantir's AIP, government and business organizations can automate workflows, streamline compliance, and gain real-time insights from their most critical records.   "Palantir is proud to partner with Ripcord to unlock vast quantities of data currently imprisoned in paper documents," said Alex Karp, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Palantir Technologies. "By integrating Palantir's AIP with Ripcord's robotic digitization technology, we can empower organizations with an entire new layer of their own information to drive better decisions and more efficient operations for more consequential outcomes."   Ripcord will be showcasing this powerful combination at Palantir AIPCon 6, where customers can witness how their documents can be used to fuel real-time decision-making and intelligent operational impact.   "There is a goldmine of data trapped in documents," said Sam Fahmy, CEO of Ripcord. "Our partnership with Palantir will allow organizations to combine Ripcord's robotic digitization with Palantir's leading edge AIP to unlock the massive value inherent in their own records, leading to significant progress in business, government, and society."
