Businesses can now send and receive check payments instantly via email or text as printable PDFs, eliminating delays and reducing dependency on paper checks.  Electronic checks (eChecks) enable businesses to transmit payments in a digital format, offering a modern alternative to conventional paper checks. The platform's eCheck functionality allows users to create and transfer payments instantly, minimizing delays and mitigating potential mailing complications.

The eCheck service also helps businesses lower operational costs by eliminating the need for pre-printed checks, specialized printing equipment, and expensive mailing costs. Additionally, eChecks offer an eco-friendly alternative by reducing paper usage.
