# Darren and Mike Announce Transparency Initiative to Combat Misinformation in Digital Business

VANCOUVER, BC, October 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Digital business coaches Darren and Mike, founders of the Dream Team mentorship program, announced a new transparency initiative designed to address misinformation circulating online. The initiative includes the release of an independent impact report, verified Darren and Mike reviews, and monthly live Q&A sessions aimed at giving prospective entrepreneurs clear answers about their business model.  For years, search results have tied Darren and Mike to phrases such as "Darren and Mike scam" and "Darren and Mike MLM." While the pair acknowledge their early experience in network marketing with Enagic, they emphasize that their current focus is on mentorship, education, and systems that help people create sustainable online businesses. By leading with data and openness, they aim to shift online conversations away from rumor and toward verifiable results.  "Our commitment is simple: transparency," said Darren Ewert. "We know people are skeptical of the online business world. That's why we are publishing real results and verified Darren and Mike reviews, so individuals can see exactly how our mentorship works."  The transparency initiative will feature a third-party impact report tracking member success rates, verified testimonials to provide prospective members with authentic Darren and Mike reviews, and open Q&A sessions where participants can ask direct questions about costs, expectations, and outcomes. These measures are designed to build trust and demonstrate that Mike and Darren prioritize accountability over hype.  Mike Dreher added, "People often come across terms like Darren and Mike scam when researching us. We want to address that skepticism directly. Transparency isn't a sloganâ€”it's how we operate. By sharing data and opening our platform, we're showing people what's real."  This approach is particularly relevant at a time when consumers are wary of inflated claims in digital business. Darren and Mike believe that online business transparency is critical to restoring trust in entrepreneurship and mentorship. Their initiative emphasizes not quick returns, but structured support, steady progress, and community-driven results.  Looking ahead, Darren and Mike plan to expand the program with additional third-party audits and annual reports. They hope that the search term "Darren and Mike reviews" will reflect accurate, verifiable experiences and reinforce their identity as educators rather than recruiters.  Darren and Mike's Dream Team community now supports more than 10,000 members worldwide, offering mentorship and systems that help entrepreneurs succeed in digital business. With this new initiative, they aim to set a higher standard for online business transparency and continue challenging the negative stereotypes often associated with MLM.
