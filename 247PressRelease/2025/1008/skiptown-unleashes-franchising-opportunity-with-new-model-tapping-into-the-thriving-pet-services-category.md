# Skiptown Unleashes Franchising Opportunity With New Model, Tapping Into the Thriving Pet Services Category

CHARLOTTE, NC, October 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Skiptown, a first-of-its-kind, tech-enabled pet care facility offering dog daycare, boarding, full-service grooming, and dog walking, has launched franchising to expand its national footprint. Building on a strong foundation of corporate-owned locations in Charlotte, Atlanta, and Denver, the brand now invites entrepreneurs to join its fast-growing, premium concept.   The timing aligns with industry trends. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, nearly half of U.S. households have a dog—nearly 90 million in total—making dogs the dominant household pet and fueling demand for specialized care.  "We're proud to announce that Skiptown is now open for franchising, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth as we expand to meet the rising demand for personalized pet care," said Mike Rotondo, CEO of Skiptown. "Skiptown brings an unparalleled standard of care in the pet industry, featuring our proprietary technology that enables convenient in-car drop-off and pick-up, as well as easy customization of appointments. Our highly trained team is well-equipped to extend Skiptown's premium experience to new markets at an affordable cost, putting pups and their people first."  As part of its franchise launch, Skiptown is introducing new facility prototypes designed to deliver its signature services in dog daycare, boarding, grooming, and dog walking. The company is initially targeting growth in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  Chief Development Officer Patti Rother, who brings extensive experience in scaling franchise brands, is leading the company's franchise growth strategy.   "Skiptown has demonstrated strong unit and growth performance and is entering franchising with proven programs and technology that set us apart in the industry," Rother said. "We've already welcomed more than 50,000 dogs in our three corporate locations, and we see a significant opportunity ahead to share the benefits of Skiptown with more pups and their people across the country."   Skiptown is already seeing strong early interest in its franchising opportunity. The company is set to host its initial Meet the Team Day in Atlanta on October 22, welcoming prospective franchise candidates from multiple states. This response highlights the brand's building momentum and that their first three locations are a launchpad for further growth.   For more information on Skiptown, visit https://skiptown.io.
