# Flosser Y, the innovative floss holder for perfect and effortless oral care, launches globally on Kickstarter

ALBANY, NY, October 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Although daily flossing along with brushing twice a day is recommended for proper oral care, traditional floss and disposable floss picks can be inconvenient to use, offer weak stability, and contribute to environmental issues due to discarded plastic waste. To address these discomforts and challenges at once, the next-generation flossing solution "Flosser Y" is being introduced through the global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  Flosser Y goes beyond being just a simple flossing tool—it has been designed with a focus on sustainability and user convenience. The device houses a built-in floss cartridge, which can be replaced in just three seconds by opening the lever with a one-touch button. The floss is firmly secured using a serrated structure and the principle of leverage, while a built-in cutter inside the lever simultaneously trims the floss, maximizing ease of use. This makes it possible to clean not only the front teeth but also hard-to-reach areas deep in the molars with stability.  To ensure it reaches all the way to the back molars, the head has been optimized to 1.02 inches, while its curved tip provides a comfortable experience even when inserted deep into the mouth. The handle can store up to two additional floss cartridges inside, allowing for immediate replacement when needed. Its sliding cover design makes opening and closing convenient, significantly enhancing portability and continuous usability.  The standard cartridge provided contains the equivalent of 150 single-use floss picks, and to reduce plastic consumption, an eco-friendly biodegradable floss option made from bamboo charcoal is also available. Depending on their dental needs, users can choose from 420D (Nylon), 500D (PTFE), or 720D (Bamboo) floss. The device comes in four color options—Midnight Black, Pastel Blue, Cream White, and Sunset Rose—making it not only functional but also a stylish everyday accessory.  The representative of Simflo stated, "Flosser Y is an oral care solution designed to be easy and convenient for anyone to use, while minimizing environmental impact. Our goal is to promote a culture of continuous flossing and contribute to making oral health management more accessible to the public."  Simflo's Flosser Y will be available for backing on the Kickstarter website starting October 7, 2025, with special discount benefits offered to supporters on launch day.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/619706607/flosser-y-fast-swap-firm-grip-flossing-perfected?ref=84wm8p
