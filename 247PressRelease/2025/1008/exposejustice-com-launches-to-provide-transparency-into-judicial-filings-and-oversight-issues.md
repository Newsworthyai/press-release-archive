# ExposeJustice.com Launches to Provide Transparency Into Judicial Filings and Oversight Issues

PHILADELPHIA, PA, October 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new transparency platform, ExposeJustice.com, has officially launched to provide the public with direct access to verified court filings and documentation related to judicial filings, due process violations, and constitutional breaches.  The platform's mission is to restore public trust through transparency and accountability by publishing evidence-based filings, appellate records, and certified documents that are part of the public record.  ExposeJustice.com focuses on providing a factual, document-driven resource for journalists, policymakers, and citizens. Each case or issue featured on the site links directly to public court filings, allowing independent verification and analysis.  "Our goal is not to make accusations, but to present the record," said Joseph Cammarata, founder of ExposeJustice.com. "The public deserves access to the truth — straight from the official filings — so they can form their own conclusions about the integrity of the justice system."  The platform highlights multiple examples where motions, petitions, or oversight requests were filed and remain pending or unanswered, raising questions about systemic transparency. All references are drawn from publicly accessible sources, including appellate dockets and certified filings.  By centralizing this documentation, ExposeJustice.com seeks to promote awareness, encourage oversight, and foster constructive dialogue about improving fairness and accountability in the courts.
