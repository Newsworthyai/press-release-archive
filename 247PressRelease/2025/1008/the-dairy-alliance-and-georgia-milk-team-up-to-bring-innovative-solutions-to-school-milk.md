# The Dairy Alliance and Georgia Milk Team Up to Bring Innovative Solutions to School Milk

ATLANTA, GA, October 08, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, has partnered with Georgia Milk Producers, Inc. (Georgia Milk) to innovatively provide real dairy milk to students across Georgia. The initiative, supported by a $200,000 commitment from Georgia Milk, helps schools improve the milk experience in cafeterias statewide by funding approximately 30 bulk milk dispensers, enhancing the school milk experience while reducing waste from single-use cartons.   Dairy farmers' dedication ensures milk remains a staple in school nutrition. Their commitment to nourishing our children is unwavering. "School feeding programs are critical to ensuring our children are building strong bones and healthy immune systems," said Matt Johnson, President of Georgia Milk's Board of Directors and a dairy farmer from Climax, Georgia. "Our dairy farmers are investing in these programs to cultivate healthier school environments and get students excited about drinking milk."   The Dairy Alliance's Youth Wellness staff works closely with school nutrition directors to promote the benefits of milk and dairy foods. The $200,000 in funding removes a major barrier for schools by covering the cost of bulk milk dispensers and the necessary equipment to maintain them.   "The Dairy Alliance's Dairy Optimization grants encourage schools to explore new ways to deliver nutritious dairy products to students," said Will McWhirter, Youth Wellness Manager for Georgia. While traditional milk cartons have served students well for decades, bulk milk dispensers offer a better school meal experience – providing delicious milk in a cup, reducing packaging waste, and supporting sustainability goals.   Roughly three-quarters of children aged two through eighteen do not consume the daily recommended amount of real dairy. Data collected from a milk dispenser pilot in Tennessee, reported that the combined average milk consumption rose 29% and the combined waste declined 14 points when milk is served from dispensers. Schools receiving milk dispenser grants across the Southeast have consistently reported an average increase of at least 14% in the movement of milk.   And let's not forget what's inside that cup of milk. Real dairy milk delivers 13 essential nutrients – including calcium, vitamin D, potassium plus high-quality protein. These nutrients fuel energy, support learning throughout the day and are critical for growth and development. When we put milk on every tray and the students drink it, we invest in the health and success of every child.
