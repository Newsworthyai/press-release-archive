PITTSBURGH, PA, June 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Entrepreneur, bestselling author, and publisher Mike Fallat has officially launched the Dreamstarters Publishing Academy, an online course that reveals the exact step-by-step process he used to help over 400 entrepreneurs publish bestselling books and build wildly profitable personal brands. The academy teaches students how to write, publish, market, and leverage a book into a lead-generating machine — all in under 30 days and for less than $500.  The launch of Dreamstarters Publishing Academy marks a pivotal moment in Mike Fallat's mission to help entrepreneurs use storytelling as a strategic weapon for authority, trust, and business growth. Through ready-to-use templates, publishing shortcuts, ghostwriter AI tools, private community access, and marketing funnels powered by Lead Marketing CRM, the academy is designed for action-takers who want to own their story, dominate their niche, and print credibility on demand.  "I built this program for the entrepreneur who knows they have a message that could change lives, but they're stuck on the how. This academy is the how," says Fallat. "It's everything I've learned in publishing and marketing, streamlined into one power-packed system."  Mike's recent momentum doesn't stop there. He will be speaking live on June 25th at the Allies Mastermind in Texas, a high-level event hosted by real estate mogul Chris Rood, where he'll break down how to turn a personal story into an income-generating asset. Then, on July 9th, Mike will take the virtual stage at the Blue Collar Millionaire Webinar, sharing strategies on how blue-collar entrepreneurs can turn their hustle into high-ticket authority by publishing their own bestselling book.
