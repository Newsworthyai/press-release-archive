Each of the album's 11 music videos stands alone as a short film, yet together, they form a cohesive journey through themes of identity, mental health, and self-discovery. Firefly's signature genre-defying sound—blending pop, soul, and experimental influences—serves as the heartbeat of the project, while Jesani's visionary storytelling brings each song to vivid life.  Firefly's electrifying sound—fusing pop, soul, and avant-garde influences—serves as the emotional pulse of the album. Jesani's screenwriting and creative direction elevate each chapter with raw honesty, visual poetry, and cohesive storytelling rarely seen in visual albums.  Production Timeline & Creative Process Spanning two years, "Find Your Light" will unfold in strategic phases, allowing each chapter the artistic depth and technical excellence it deserves. A diverse lineup of visionary directors will helm individual videos, unified by Jesani's narrative framework and Firefly's musical vision.  Key Phases:  • Development & Scriptwriting (July–Oct 2025): Jesani crafts the interconnected scripts and narrative arcs for all 11 videos, collaborating closely with Firefly to ensure authenticity and emotional resonance.  • Pre-Production (Nov 2025–Jan 2026): Finalizing scripts, assembling the creative team, and securing directors whose artistic visions complement each video's tone.  • Production & Post (Feb–Oct 2026): Filming and editing in two cycles, with Jesani overseeing all creative and logistical aspects to ensure thematic and visual cohesion.  • Final Mastering & Festival Prep (Nov 2026–Feb 2027): Curating the visual album experience, preparing for festival submissions, and launching the marketing campaign.  • Distribution & Release (Mar–June 2027): Targeting major music video, experimental, and short film festivals, alongside digital streaming platforms and curated showcases.
