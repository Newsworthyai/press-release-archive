# NovaPads Unveils Premium Model Y Mattress Pro for Tesla Owners

LOS ANGELES, CA, June 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NovaPads, a brand dedicated to providing Tesla owners with comfortable, convenient, and cost-effective Tesla camping accessories, proudly announces the launch of its flagship product—the Model Y Mattress Pro. Designed specifically for Tesla Model Y and Juniper, this premium Tesla bed solution transforms Tesla camping into a home-like sleeping experience  Born from a Tesla Enthusiast's Vision The story of NovaPads began with its founder, an avid Tesla camper who struggled to find the perfect mattress for his Model Y. Dissatisfied with options that were either too thin, uncomfortable, or poorly fitted, he set out to create the ultimate solution. The result? The Model Y Mattress Pro—a premium sleeping pad that blends optimal comfort, perfect thickness and flawless compatibility with Tesla's interior.  Custom-designed for Tesla Model Y & Juniper Unlike generic Tesla bed solutions, NovaPads' Model Y Mattress Pro is custom-tailored using advanced 3D scanning technology to ensure a 100% seamless fit in the Model Y's trunk. Its widened design near the rear door armrest maximizes sleeping space, providing ample room for two adults without the discomfort of cramped movement during the night.  Air-Foam Technology: The Best of Both Worlds Unlike memory foam mattresses and air mattresses, NovaPads' Model Y Mattress Pro adopts a unique Air-Foam structural design, combining the comfort of memory foam mattresses with the small storage volume advantage of air mattresses: • High-pressure air chambers eliminate the slope from folded rear seats, creating a perfectly flat Tesla bed. • A 4.5-inch high-resilience foam layer delivers cloud-like comfort—no more stiffness from typical inflatable mattresses.  Built-in compression pump improves mattress convenience and comfort The design of NovaPads' model Y mattress Pro with a built-in compression pump has brought great convenience to Tesla owners. Unlike other inflatable mattresses that require an additional external pump to be carried, this design eliminates the hassle. Thanks to the 6000pa high-power pump, the setup and storage of the mattress have become simple. The setup takes approximately 50 seconds, and the storage takes 60 seconds to achieve compression and folding. The compressed mattress can be easily placed in the front trunk and the trunk for storage, without occupying too much interior storage space.  Additional Features for Tesla Camping: • Made with odor-free TPU material for safe use, ensuring optimal air quality in Tesla's confined sleeping space. • The grooves on the Model Y mattress are designed to avoid blocking the rear AC vents and touchscreen, maintaining airflow and functionality. • A free removable bed sheet is included to keep the mattress clean while Tesla camping.  "Our goal is simple: Make Tesla camping as comfortable as your bed at home," says the NovaPads team.  NovaPads is committed to delivering exceptional customer service and high-quality camping accessories for Tesla owners. From mattresses to window covers and storage solutions, every item is crafted to enhance on-the-go comfort.
