# "Dating Down or Rewriting the Rules? Smart Women, Hypogamy, and the Future of Relationships" A Rational, Candid Discussion on Modern Love, Led by Richard Procida, Esq., Live and Online at 2 pm PDT

WHITTIER, CA, June 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As strong, successful women rise in educational and economic status, the traditional rules of dating are shifting. Once guided by hypergamy—seeking a partner of higher social standing—many women today are exploring new relationship dynamics. Could hypogamy, or "dating down," actually be a reflection of changing values, where emotional compatibility, mutual support, and authenticity matter more than income or titles?  The age-old concept of hypergamy—seeking partners of higher social or economic status—may be giving way to a more complex reality. Some successful women are now embracing "hypogamy," forming relationships with partners of lower economic or educational status, but who offer emotional support, sexual compatibility, and shared values.  In this thought-provoking discussion, author and attorney Richard Procida—once a pro-feminist writer, now exploring men's issues—will guide us through recent research and commentary on this emerging trend. We'll explore key questions: Is hypogamy a real shift or a media narrative? What are smart, strong women really looking for in modern relationships? And can love truly transcend traditional status dynamics?  This timely conversation will be held online by Zoom on July 6th at 2:00 pm PDT. Richard Procida, an author, attorney, and survivor of sexual abuse will lead the discussion. Once a pro-feminist writer, Procida now champions a more balanced perspective on gender issues through the lens of the Nonpartisan Red Pill Men's Group, which he founded. His journey—from studying gender at the University of Southern California to embracing men's rights advocacy—was shaped in part by insights from the Red Pill movement, which helped him make sense of personal trauma and modern gender dynamics.  Richard is the author of Social Issues in Global Perspective: Pornography and a longtime commentator on social justice and intergender relations. Today, he works to build bridges—not walls—between men and women. To register for this discussion, go to https://Tinyurl.com/Hypogamy.
