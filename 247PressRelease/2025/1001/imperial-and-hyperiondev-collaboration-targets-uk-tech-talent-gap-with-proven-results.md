# Imperial and HyperionDev collaboration targets UK tech talent gap with proven results

LONDON, ENGLAND, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The initiative directly responds to the UK's chronic digital skills shortage, which continues to hold back economic growth and productivity.  According to a recent FutureDotNow report, more than 21 million working-age adults in the UK still lack the full set of essential digital skills. This persistent gap is a growing concern for policymakers and employers, particularly as demand for AI, cybersecurity, and green technology roles accelerates.   The UK Government's Skills for Life and Skills Bootcamps initiatives aim to tackle these deficits but bridging the gap requires scalable, outcomes-verified training pathways.  HyperionDev's collaboration with Imperial College London builds on its track record of delivering Department for Education-funded Software Engineering and Data Science bootcamps, which have successfully transitioned individuals with no prior coding experience into entry-level tech roles. HyperionDev's proven model combines human mentorship with outcomes-verified training. Its collaboration with Imperial College London introduces academic rigour and national credibility to a model already tested through Department for Education-funded bootcamps.  The new programmes in Software Engineering, Data Science, and Web Development are designed to provide participants with a job-ready portfolio of projects and one-on-one mentorship from industry professionals. Unlike self-paced or AI-only learning models, HyperionDev's human-led approach ensures learners not only complete their training but are prepared to contribute from day one in the workplace.  HyperionDev and Imperial College London bootcamps have already demonstrated strong, verifiable results. Independent outcomes data shows that 95% of graduates achieved their intended career goal, with 72% employed within three months and many seeing salaries double compared to their previous roles. These results highlight the effectiveness of a human-led, outcomes-verified approach in delivering not just training, but real employability impact.  "The UK tech sector is a global powerhouse, yet its potential is consistently held back by a chronic shortage of qualified talent," said Riaz Moola, Founder and CEO of HyperionDev.   "Our collaboration with Imperial College London provides a direct response to this challenge. By combining our proven, human-centric approach to training with the academic rigour of a top-tier institution, we are creating a pathway for individuals to acquire the specific skills needed to thrive in today's digital economy and contribute to the country's technological advancement."  The collaboration is also designed to address regional and inclusion priorities. By offering online bootcamps accessible nationwide, HyperionDev can extend opportunities beyond London to regions where digital skills training has historically lagged.
