# Why Does It Hurt? New National Survey Reveals That Millions Suffer From Unexplained Pain and Illness

PORTLAND, OR, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new national survey of more than 1,500 U.S. adults has found that nearly half of Americans (48%) are living with ongoing pain or illness that either has no clear explanation or is not responding to medical treatment as expected. The survey, conducted by the Association for the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms (ATNS) in partnership with XandY, also reveals the prevalence of different types of unexplained symptoms and how the public understands their potential causes and treatments.

New research shows that the brain can generate pain or illness anywhere in the body through learned nerve pathways that are reversible. These are called neuroplastic symptoms. Stress, trauma, emotions, and other life challenges are key contributors. Costs to the healthcare system are greater than for diabetes, cancer, and heart disease combined.  "There are highly effective treatments for these conditions, but few people know about them," said David Clarke, MD, President of ATNS and a board-certified gastroenterologist. "They work by training your brain to recognize and turn off unnecessary danger signals. What is most needed now is greater awareness, widespread professional training, and much better access to these solutions."  The Findings at a Glance:   Far from rare, these conditions are among the most common reasons people seek medical care. The survey shows:  • Symptom Duration: Among those most likely to have neuroplastic symptoms, 63% have been experiencing their current symptoms for up to five years, while 37% have had their symptoms for more than five years. • Symptom Diversity: Among those most likely to have neuroplastic symptoms, 65% report chronic back or neck pain; 57% muscle, limb, or joint pain; 43% chronic fatigue; and 35% headaches or migraines. Most live with several conditions simultaneously. • Perceived Psychological Cause: Of people with a symptom, 76-97% believe their symptom could have a psychological cause at least "some of the time." • Acceptance of Psychotherapy: Among those most likely to have neuroplastic symptoms, 47% say they are either "definitely" or "probably" willing to try neuroplastic psychological treatment. Only 20% say they "definitely" or "probably" would not.  Does treatment help? Definitely yes. Recent clinical trials have documented far better outcomes with Neuroplastic Recovery Therapies compared to older methods. In the Boulder Back Pain study, pain improved by an average of 75% in just four weeks. At UCLA, male veterans achieved at least 30% pain relief nearly four times as often (63%) as those treated with traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (17%).  These results offer tremendous hope that people suffering neuroplastic conditions would accept and benefit from effective treatment if they become aware of it and if barriers to access are addressed.  Co-author Matthew Goldberg, PhD added, "This is not a fringe issue. Chronic, unexplained pain and illness are an urgent problem for many. Awareness of and access to effective treatments can be life-changing, as it has been for me."  "These findings are a roadmap for change," said co-author Abel Gustafson, PhD. "Our long-term vision is to dramatically increase the understanding and treatment of neuroplastic symptoms among the public, patients, and practitioners. They must be better equipped to recognize neuroplastic symptoms and see that healing is possible."  To illustrate the human stories behind the research, ATNS has released a short video: Pain Science Paradigm Shift. Featuring leading researchers, clinicians, and patients who have recovered, the video shows how the brain can generate symptoms and be the source of relief. Watch here: Pain Science Paradigm Shift.  "Knowledge becomes healing," expressed David Clarke, MD. "This survey shows that many people suffering from neuroplastic symptoms accept the possibility of a psychological cause. Many are open to trying neuroplastic recovery therapies. Our task now is to expand public awareness of and reduce barriers to access for these treatments. This will ensure people receive the same quality of care as patients with organ disease or injury."
