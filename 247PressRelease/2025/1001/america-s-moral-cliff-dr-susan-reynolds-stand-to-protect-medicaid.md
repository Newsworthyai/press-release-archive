# America's Moral Cliff: Dr. Susan Reynolds' Stand to Protect Medicaid

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Medicaid—the nation's largest healthcare safety net—is facing serious threats. For decades it has prevented millions of Americans from medical catastrophe. The lifeline is now weakening, and many already face its loss.  Dr. Susan Reynolds, President and CEO of the Institute for Medical Leadership, has dedicated her life to preparing leaders to make difficult decisions in complex times. Fresh from receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Los Angeles County Medical Association, she warns of a crisis that she believes will define a generation.  "Medicaid is more than a budget line," Dr. Reynolds said. "It is the mother receiving prenatal care, a child getting therapy, a grandfather managing heart disease. Cuts slice into lives—often the lives that cannot fight back."  The Human Cost Behind the Numbers  Current figures show that nearly 26.1% of Americans (about 89 million people) are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Rural hospitals face growing risk: over 432 rural hospitals are deemed vulnerable to closure, and 46% of rural hospitals operate at a financial loss.   If proposed federal cuts proceed:  · 1.8 million rural community members may lose Medicaid coverage by 2034.  · Federal support to rural hospitals could fall by over $50 billion over ten years.  "These numbers reflect real people," Dr. Reynolds said. "Neighbors, friends, the backbone of our communities. When we undercut Medicaid, we endanger their well-being."  From Honor to Urgency  When she accepted her Lifetime Achievement Award earlier this year, Dr. Reynolds interpreted it as a call to urgent action.  Her upcoming Chief of Staff Boot Camp in February is designed to prepare healthcare leaders for times like this—when professional choices become moral imperatives.  "In every policy decision comes impact," she said. "We must ensure those decisions heal rather than harm."  A Call to Voters, Lawmakers, and the Media  Dr. Reynolds delivers a clear message:  · To voters: Medicaid may protect your family or someone you love.  · To lawmakers: Budget lines represent real lives.  · To the media: Coverage ensures this fight stays visible; public awareness guards against erosion in silence.  "We stand at a moral cliff," she said. "Millions are in danger. This is survival, not politics."  About Dr. Susan Reynolds  Dr. Susan Reynolds serves as President and CEO of the Institute for Medical Leadership. She shapes healthcare executives, physicians, and systems nationwide. She authored educational works and lectures broadly. In February 2025 she will lead her Chief of Staff Boot Camp, empowering leaders to preserve the programs that safeguard our most vulnerable.
