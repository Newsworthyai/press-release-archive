# Bergen County Firm Initiates #EmployersThinkPink to Save Lives by Encouraging Other Companies to Take Meaningful Action in the Fight Against Breast Cancer

TEANECK, NJ, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The personal injury law firm of Davis, Saperstein & Salomon, P.C. has launched the #EmployersThinkPink initiative, a powerful demonstration of corporate responsibility and compassion. In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the firm is offering paid time off to employees who desire or need a mammogram, underscoring the importance of early detection in the fight against breast cancer.   Inspired by the courageous battle against cancer waged by longtime employee Annette, the firm is committed to raising awareness and facilitating early detection of this disease. Annette's journey began in 2009 with a shocking diagnosis of stage 2B Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Despite the overwhelming challenges, her unwavering spirit and the support of her colleagues at Davis, Saperstein & Salomon, P.C. propelled her to victory. After rigorous treatment at Hackensack Medical Center's Betty Torricelli Institute for Care, Annette achieved remission and has been cancer-free since.  To honor Annette's resilience and to prevent others from facing a similar ordeal, Partner Garry Salomon created the #EmployersThinkPink initiative, which aims to encourage early detection, which is crucial in the fight against breast cancer. Annette's experience underscores the importance of regular screenings. Had she not delayed her mammogram, the cancer likely would have been detected at an earlier, more treatable stage. Since her recovery, Annette has dedicated herself to raising awareness through participating in the Making Strides event and by inspiring others to prioritize their health.   Through this initiative, Davis, Saperstein & Salomon, P.C. encourages employers everywhere to join the movement. By providing staff with paid time off for mammograms, businesses can play a meaningful role in saving lives, supporting employees, and fostering healthier workplaces.
