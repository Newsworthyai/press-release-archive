# Butte's Unique Lighting &amp; Home Décor Launches Winter Fandeliers Collection for Comfort and Savings

BUTTE, MT, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With winter bearing down on southwest Montana, homeowners are bracing for higher heating costs and longer nights indoors. Unique Lighting & Home Décor is launching its seasonal collection of lighting, fandeliers, and ceiling fans to help Butte families create warm, welcoming spaces while saving on energy bills.  "Winter is when we all spend the most time inside," said Kellie Gribben, owner of Unique Lighting & Home Décor. "By choosing the right lighting and making simple adjustments like reversing ceiling fans, families in Butte can make their homes cozier and lower their utility costs at the same time. And our new fandeliers offer the perfect combination of function and style for Montana homes."  A Local Response to Rising Energy Costs Montana-Dakota Utilities projects that residential natural gas bills will rise by about 11% this winter compared to last season, adding roughly $51 to the average household's heating costs if weather is typical (Montana-Dakota Utilities, 2024). With heating representing one of the largest expenses in Montana homes, small adjustments can make a big difference.  Ceiling fans set to rotate clockwise in the winter can cut heating costs by up to 15% by circulating warm air trapped near the ceiling (News5 Cleveland).   Lighting for Long Butte Nights With the sun setting before 5 p.m. in mid-winter, lighting becomes essential for Montana households. Nationally, lighting accounts for about 6% of home electricity use (EIA).  Unique Lighting & Home Décor's seasonal collection features LED fixtures that use 75% less energy and last up to 25 times longer than traditional incandescent bulbs (U.S. Department of Energy). The lineup includes layered lighting solutions—from rustic statement chandeliers to cozy table lamps—perfect for holiday gatherings or quiet evenings at home.  Introducing Fandeliers: Style Meets Function The highlight of this winter's collection is the introduction of fandeliers—a hybrid of chandelier elegance and ceiling fan practicality. These fixtures not only provide dramatic visual appeal but also help circulate warm air in living spaces. Available in a variety of styles from modern to rustic, fandeliers are ideal for Montana homes that want both beauty and performance in one centerpiece fixture.  Sustainable Comfort & Style Montana households spend an average of $108/month on electricity (FindEnergy). By upgrading to energy-efficient fans, fandeliers, and LED lighting, families can reduce those monthly bills while enjoying modern design and comfort.  "Our community here in Butte cares about quality and sustainability," Gribben said. "We're proud to bring products that reflect both Montana's style and its values."  Located in the heart of Butte, Montana, Unique Lighting & Home Décor has been helping homeowners elevate their spaces with distinctive lighting, ceiling fans, and home décor solutions. The company is known for blending function, comfort, and style while offering expert guidance to help customers choose pieces that fit their lifestyle and design goals.
