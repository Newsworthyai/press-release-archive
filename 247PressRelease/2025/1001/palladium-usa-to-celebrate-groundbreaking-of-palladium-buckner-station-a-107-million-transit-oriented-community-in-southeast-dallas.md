DALLAS, TX, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Palladium USA will host a groundbreaking ceremony for Palladium Buckner Station on Thursday, October 2, 2025, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM CST at 400 S. Buckner Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75217. This milestone event marks the start of construction on a $107 million transit-oriented, mixed-income multifamily community located adjacent to the Buckner DART Station in Southeast Dallas.  Attendees will enjoy a brief program with remarks from community leaders and development partners, ceremonial turning of the soil, project renderings, refreshments, and branded promotional items.  Palladium Buckner Station will offer 304 amenity-rich residences featuring thoughtfully designed one-, two-, and three-bedroom floor plans. Of these, 244 units are below market rate, available at 60% of the area median income, and 60 units are market rate. Interior finishes will include granite countertops, nine-foot ceilings, hardwood-style flooring, dual sinks in primary baths, and covered balconies. Included in the 304-unit total are 30 three-bedroom two-story townhome units.  Upscale community amenities will include a resort swimming pool, state-of-the-art fitness center, conference center, business center, children's playroom, 1,600 sf community room, playground, basketball court, gazebos with grilling stations, and a clubroom featuring a mini-kitchen with upgraded appliances and quartz countertops. What makes this development truly unique is its public pedestrian promenade, meticulously planned with enhanced landscaping.  "Construction has started, and we are proud to break ground on this transformational community, which reflects Palladium USA's ongoing commitment to providing high-quality, mixed-income housing in Dallas and for the surrounding community. The property will deliver 304 thoughtfully designed homes with convenient access to the Buckner DART Station," said Tom Huth, President and CEO of Palladium USA.  Palladium Buckner Station was designed by ARRIVE Architecture Group, and BBL Building Company will serve as the general contractor, along with Operation Community Care, in a joint venture. The community will be a four-story wrap with elevators and two structured parking garages. The financing structure for this placement included $34m in tax credit equity, $26m in bridge loan proceeds, and a $47m FHA 221(d)(4) loan all provided by Regions Bank, $14.5m City of Dallas funding, $49.9m in tax-exempt bonds issued through the Dallas Housing Finance Corporation, and The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs approved $39m in 4% housing tax credits.  "Buckner Station is exactly the kind of mixed-income, transit-oriented development we need in District 5," says Dallas City Council Member Jaime Resendez (District 5). "It will bring hundreds of quality apartment homes near DART access, schools, and services, and it shows how public-private partnerships can deliver real benefits to our neighborhoods."  "This was a true example of the phrase 'it takes a village' and, in this case, the village included Palladium USA, the Dallas Housing Finance Corporation, DART, the City of Dallas, Regions Bank, and Regions Affordable Housing. The DHFC welcomes this opportunity to partner with Palladium USA to fulfill our mission to provide quality, affordable housing to the residents of the City of Dallas," says Marcy Helfand, President of the DHFC.  "We are thrilled to partner with Palladium USA and the City of Dallas to advance this important transit-oriented development project, converting underutilized parking at DART's Buckner Station into urgently needed mixed-income housing. This is a significant step toward building more connected, sustainable communities within DART's service area where people can live, work, and thrive with access to efficient public transportation," says Caitlin Holland, Vice President, Real Estate & Economic Development at DART.  "This isn't just about building new housing; it's about giving more Dallas families a stable place to call home. With Palladium Buckner Station, we're creating high-quality, affordable homes that are directly connected to public transit. That means hardworking people will have an easier time getting to their jobs, schools, and everything else they need, which is a big win for our community," says Kim Parker, Executive Director of Development and Site Selection for Palladium USA.  The new 6.72-acre multifamily community is located at 401 S. Buckner Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75217, adjacent to the Buckner DART Station in Southeast Dallas, offering convenient access to major highways and the city's core. Preleasing is scheduled for the Fall of 2026, with the clubhouse and first units being delivered in early 2027.  Palladium USA serves as the holding company for all Palladium Group assets across the United States. Since our establishment in 1992, we have been headquartered in Dallas, Texas, solidifying our reputation as a premier leader in the multifamily market. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and community remains at the core of our mission.
