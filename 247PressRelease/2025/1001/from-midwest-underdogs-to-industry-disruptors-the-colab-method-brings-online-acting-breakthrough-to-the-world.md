# FROM MIDWEST UNDERDOGS TO INDUSTRY DISRUPTORS: THE COLAB METHOD BRINGS ONLINE ACTING BREAKTHROUGH TO THE WORLD

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 01, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In an industry dominated by legacy names, famous families, and coastal power centers, The CoLAB Method is rewriting the script. Founded by Thomas and Daniella Adisi, two outsiders who clawed their way into the acting world from unlikely beginnings, CoLAB officially launches online in 2025—bringing its underdog-tested, actor-approved training system to students everywhere.  FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN Neither Thomas nor Daniella came from Hollywood stock. Thomas started as a photojournalist, Daniella as a social worker. With no connections, no shortcuts, and plenty of failures, they learned the hard way what so many dreamers face: the system wasn't built for people like them.  But instead of giving up, they turned their setbacks into fuel. Thomas went on to train under Broadway legend and prolific film/TV actor Raphael Sbarge (Once Upon a Time, Risky Business, Murder in the First) in Los Angeles through his selective Hudson Theater apprentice group. Daniella carved her path through relentless work, study, and coaching. Together, they became living proof that resilience can rewrite destiny.  BORN IN MILWAUKEE, BUILT FOR THE WORLD The CoLAB story didn't begin in L.A. or New York—it began in Milwaukee. Between 2016–2018, Thomas ran acting classes alongside three seasons with the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, later adding workshops with local arts high schools and extended teaching sessions for corporate professionals.  By 2018, he and Daniella launched CoLAB Studio on Milwaukee's Upper East Side. Their classes drew theater students and working adults alike, all hungry for something missing in traditional training: a roadmap for screen acting that was practical, holistic, and accessible.  That spark became a mission. And after years of refining their system, the Adisis are now unveiling CoLAB's online transformation model to the world.  THE 3MS: A SURVIVAL MAP FOR DREAMERS At the center of CoLAB is the proprietary "3Ms" framework:  Mindset: cultivating unshakable confidence and resilience in the face of rejection  Mastery: sharpening on-camera technique for auditions, scenes, and storytelling  Marketplace: navigating branding, self-tapes, and the business of breaking in  Together, these three pillars form what the Adisis call a "time and opportunity multiplier." Instead of stumbling through years of confusion, students move with clarity, confidence, and speed.  A CHANGED INDUSTRY, A NEW OPENING After Covid, the entertainment industry transformed. Auditions went digital. Self-tapes became standard. Suddenly, actors no longer needed to uproot their lives for the coasts.  That's where CoLAB shines. Most of its students aren't from New York or Los Angeles—they're from small towns in the Midwest and beyond. They're living proof that with the right system, anyone can find their way into the industry spotlight.  "Hollywood doesn't just live on the coasts anymore," says Daniella. "It lives wherever you have a camera, a story, and the courage to show up."  MORE THAN ACTING—A CALL TO CREATIVE FREEDOM While designed for actors, CoLAB's impact stretches wider. The Adisis' freeing, relational, and exacting style resonates with all creatives, entrepreneurs, and professionals seeking bolder self-expression.  It's why they're already developing their first book, blending their personal story of trial and resilience with the CoLAB framework, offering a roadmap from being "locked up" to living in creative freedom.  HUMOR IN THE HUSTLE Even in their grit-driven journey, the Adisis know the power of humor. One of Thomas's stock photos went viral years ago as the meme "How I Sleep at Night." Today, they embrace it as part of their brand—a wink at authenticity and the unpredictable nature of creative life.  PROGRAMS & COMMUNITY CoLAB's flagship program, 10XACTIVATE, distills their system into 50 video lessons with live coaching and community masterminds. Students gain lifetime community access and a year of guided content—delivering clarity and results in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional training.  In every way, CoLAB is built for the overlooked, the underestimated, and the underdog—because that's exactly who built it.  ABOUT THE COLAB METHOD Founded in 2018 in Milwaukee, WI, The CoLAB Method (CoLAB Studio) is an online acting and creative training platform built on the belief that persistence beats privilege. CoLAB's founders, Thomas and Daniella Adisi, rose from unlikely beginnings to create a proprietary **3Ms framework—Mindset, Mastery, Marketplace—that transforms both screen actors and creative professionals.  After years of in-person workshops tied to the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, CoLAB evolved into a full system tested by students from college actors to corporate professionals. Today, CoLAB empowers small-town dreamers across the U.S. and abroad to launch screen careers and unlock personal creative freedom.  With its flagship 10XACTIVATE course, live coaching, and private community, CoLAB is more than training—it's a movement for the overlooked to rise.
