# Hero Awards Celebrate AI and Social Media-led Progress towards UN Sustainability Goals

CAMBRIDGE, UK, February 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Hero Awards, which has recognized outstanding achievements in pursuit of Global Sustainability since 2019, has announced a new program aimed at allowing citizen activists to achieve recognition for their efforts through following a standardized format, according to CIO Savannah Partridge.  "We noticed that there isn't a way for everyday 'heroes' to be recognized for devoted efforts towards planetary improvement" says Partridge. "So we created a protocol, involving the most efficient ways of harnessing both AI and social media, to build a system wherein each of the UN's sub-queries within the larger 17 Sustainability Goals can be addressed thoroughly."  According to the Hero Awards Community Officer John Toomey, to be considered for the Award, participants must choose one of the 231 unique global indicators the UN has designated to track progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (see below).  Example: UN Goal 12 is "Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns"  Within Goal 12, Unique Global Indicator 12.3 is "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses."  After choosing a Global Indicator, participants then devise AI prompts directed at gleaning the most actionable and useful insights from each AI in the program, which currently include ChatGPT, Meta's Llama 3.3, Claude 3.5, Perplexity, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Microsoft's Copilot, DeepSeek, and Qwen 2.5-Max.  "Each of these AI's 'thinks' differently", says the Hero Awards Chief Judge Anna Chu Lin, "so the skill lies in playing with prompts and iterating until you derive the most powerful answers from each. AI's still hallucinate, so by using the same query with so many AI programs we drastically reduce the likelihood of unproductive answers."  The Hero Awards staff recommends that those who want to improve their AI prompting skills to increase their likelihood of winning follow the work of people like Andrew Ng, Jennifer Strong, Matt Shumer, Riley Goodside, and Santiago Laplagne.  After receiving answers from the AIs, participants turn the most successful prompts into evocative questions on social media sites, including Facebook, X, Instagram, Linkedin, Pinterest, Reddit, and Douban. Just as they did with the AI prompts, they test, refine, and iterate social media posts till they land on ones that produce the most intelligent engagement.  Those judged to have achieved the most impactful and goal-furthering content through both AI and social media will be honored with a Hero Award. Winning content will be publicised extensively and archived in the Hero Awards academia.edu site.  "We see this as a way of democratizing efforts towards planetary preservation and human thriving", says Partridge. "It does involve a bit of work, but it's work that many average people are familiar with. It has the potential to build a global mindset that shows that change, in the context of maximizing both human and artificial intelligence, is both possible and personally rewarding. A lot of our nominees are students, and the skills they build and refine by doing this will make them powerfully transformative visionaries who can expertly approach whatever new challenges emerge in the 21st century".
