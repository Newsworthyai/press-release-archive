# New Book Chronicles Progressive Rock Icons Yes During Eras Without Founding Vocalist Jon Anderson

CORNERS, GA, October 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Music historian and author Preston Frazier has released his latest work, Yes Indeed: Tales from Yes Without Jon Anderson, a compelling exploration of the iconic progressive rock band Yes during the pivotal periods when founding vocalist Jon Anderson was absent. Published independently, the book offers a detailed and thoughtful examination of the band's evolution during some of its most creatively challenging and transformative years.  Focusing on the albums Drama, Fly From Here, Heaven & Earth, The Quest, and Mirror to the Sky, Frazier dives deep into a lesser-celebrated chapter of Yes's legacy. With a combination of thorough research, artist interviews, and insights from devoted fans, Yes Indeed provides a clear-eyed narrative of how the band continually reinvented itself amid shifting lineups and musical directions.  The book highlights the vital contributions of artists such as Trevor Horn, Benoît David, Jon Davison, and Billy Sherwood, while also honoring the enduring presence of long-time members like Steve Howe and the late Chris Squire. Beyond its analysis of studio work, Yes Indeed captures the essence of the band's touring legacy and chronicles the often-divided fan response to this era of experimentation and change.  Enriched with personal anecdotes and rare photographs, the book brings an intimate, human perspective to the band's complex history. Frazier—well known for his work on the Slang of Ages podcast—delivers both a fan's tribute and an authoritative account of a band that continues to evolve decades after its formation.  Yes Indeed: Tales from Yes Without Jon Anderson is now available in both print and digital editions through major online booksellers.
