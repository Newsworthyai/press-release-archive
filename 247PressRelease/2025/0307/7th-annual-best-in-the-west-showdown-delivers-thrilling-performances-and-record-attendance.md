# 7th Annual Best in the West Showdown Delivers Thrilling Performances and Record Attendance

BIG SKY, MT, March 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 7th Annual Best in the West Showdown, held February 7-9, 2025, in Big Sky Town Center, once again brought together the best skijoring teams in North America to battle it out for $15,000 in prize money. Presented by Rentbiz, Lone Mountain Land Co., Lone Mountain Ranch, and the Big Sky Ski Education Foundation, this year's event reached new heights with dominating performances by top teams, next level showmanship, an expanded three day format to allow for more novice racers to participate, and record-breaking attendance by spectators and fans.  Over 6,000 spectators gathered over the three-day event to witness the dynamic sport of skijoring, where horse-mounted riders pull skiers/snowboarders at high speeds through a challenging course of tight gates, steep bank turns and flaming gap jumps. The event's growing popularity was further amplified by a live broadcast on the Cowboy Channel, extending its reach to audiences and fans nationwide.  The Open Ski Division witnessed fierce competition, with teams pushing the limits of speed and precision. The team of Richard Weber and Jim Ryan clinched first place with their winning run and a combined time of 37.26 seconds, showcasing exceptional speed, line selection and rope work.  The Pro Snowboard Division witnessed a dominating performance by snowboarder Kurt Layton. Layton (working closely with his teammates Lucas Garrett, Kimber Cook, Steve Noyes) swept the podium and took home the top three team spots.  In the Switcharoo Division the father daughter duo of Dennis & Phoebe Alverson took first place with a combined time of 45.71 seconds, displaying seamless transitions and coordination.  in the Junior Division Sawyer Anderson & Kate Thompson demonstrated outstanding synergy, securing first place with a combined time of 50.74 seconds.  Between heats, attendees were treated to two awe-inspiring exhibitions. The Keith Sayers FMX team returned again this season to showcase the cutting edge of freestyle snowmobiling. X-Games athletes and living legends Brett Turcot and Willie Elam left the crowd in amazement with their aerial maneuvers, including a jaw dropping gap jump as the two styled out tandem nac-nac and kiss of death flips over Chevy trucks, tents and spectators in the infield area.   "It was soo good to be back in Big Sky with Keith Sayers FMX," said Brett Turcotte (8 time X-Games medalist). "The vibe they have created here for the Showdown is insane and the crowd is awesome! I love seeing all the people stoked on the snowmobile expo and pushing us to see what's possible on our sleds."   A new addition to this year's Showdown was the Slopestyle Expo presented by Big Sky Thrift. A special rail and jump feature were created and added to the course. Pro skiers Luke Price, Bryan Coll, and snowboarders Rhett Leuzinger and Viktor Simko were pulled into these features by the team of wranglers from Jake's Horses. The athletes sessioned the features and threw down a variety of tricks; including backflips, box/board slide to front 270 and more.   "Big Sky Skijoring Association's mission is to harness a piece of the cultural history and charm of a true Western event and offer it to our Big Sky residents and guests, said Erik Morrison (member of the Big Sky Skijoring production team). "This year's Expo was just that; a blending of key aspects of the skijoring tradition with Big Sky's modern freestyle/freeride culture to create something that is authentic and true to Big Sky. I expect to see the Freestyle Expo become a key part of the Showdown in the years to come."  From its modest beginnings, the Best in the West Showdown has evolved into a premier event on the skijoring calendar. This year's record attendance and expanded programming underscore the community's dedication to the Big Sky Skijoring Association's mission and fostering a vibrant skijoring culture here in Big Sky.  "What a weekend in Big Sky!" said Justa Adams (Big Sky Skijoring Association's Executive Director). "The dreamy landscape, majestic horses, and thrilling skiers brought together family and friends of all ages. Our team felt the love from both competitors and spectators—smiles all around for the best weekend of the year! Can't wait for next year!"  Participants and spectators alike expressed similar enthusiasm for the event. One competitor noted, "The energy this year was unparalleled. It's incredible to see how much this event has grown and how the community comes together to support it." A spectator shared, "Attending the Showdown has become a family tradition. The thrills, the atmosphere—it's an experience we look forward to every year."  As the 6th Annual Best in the West Showdown concludes, anticipation is already building for next year's event. The Big Sky Skijoring Association extends its deep gratitude to all sponsors, volunteers, athletes, and fans who contributed to this year's success. Plans are underway to make the next Showdown even better, continuing the tradition of shaping the future of skijoring through blending cutting edge course design with elements of mountain culture.
