# Freedom Demands Sacrifice: A Sweeping Tale of Exile, Loyalty, and Revolution

DALLAS, TX, March 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Pawn to King's End, the electrifying new historical novel by Douglas A. Gosselin, plunges readers into the chaos and peril of 18th-century North America. As the British forces unleash their brutal expulsion of the Acadian people in 1755, one man is forced into a harrowing battle—not just for survival, but for the soul of a nation on the brink of revolution.  Clément Gosselin never sought war, but war found him. With the forests of Nova Scotia as both sanctuary and battleground, he must outwit ruthless enemies, navigate shifting alliances, and safeguard his family from forces that would see them destroyed. As whispers of rebellion spread across the Atlantic, Clément is drawn into a high-stakes game of espionage, where a shadowy figure known only as Mr. Smith offers salvation—at a cost too steep to ignore.  "This is more than just a historical novel," says Gosselin. "It's a story of resilience, sacrifice, and the choices that define us. In a world where kings move freely and pawns are sacrificed, Pawn to King's End asks a timeless question: How far would you go to change your fate—and at what cost?"
