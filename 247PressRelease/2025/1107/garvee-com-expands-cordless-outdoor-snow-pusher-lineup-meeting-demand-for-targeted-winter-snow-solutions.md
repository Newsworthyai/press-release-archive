# GARVEE.com Expands Cordless Outdoor Snow Pusher Lineup, Meeting Demand for Targeted Winter Snow Solutions

ONTARIO, CA, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- GARVEE.com Expands Cordless Range for the 2025 Winter Season  GARVEE.com today announced a significant expansion of its cordless outdoor equipment lineup with the introduction of a new 12-inch battery powered snow blower. The product is designed to address growing consumer demand for lighter, low-maintenance winter tools and provides a battery-powered alternative for targeted, "last-mile" snow removal on steps, walkways, and decks.  This strategic move aligns with the industry trend toward zero-emissions technology and greater user convenience in home maintenance.  Market Shift: Lightweight and Battery-Powered Tools on the Rise  According to recent market insights, the U.S. outdoor equipment sector has seen a steady shift toward battery-powered and cordless designs. Consumers increasingly prefer tools that minimize setup time, reduce noise, and eliminate fuel maintenance. GARVEE's expansion aligns with this trend, offering sustainable, lithium-ion–powered alternatives for winter conditions that demand speed and precision.  The 12-inch model complements the company's wider cordless outdoor lineup, which already includes electric snow blower, leaf blowers, hedge trimmers, and power washers—all designed for homeowners seeking compact, versatile performance across seasons.  Technical Highlights: Practical Power in a Compact Form  The new GARVEE 12-Inch Cordless Snow Blower combines compact engineering with modern lithium-ion technology to deliver powerful, efficient results in everyday residential settings.  Key Features: Suitable Scenarios: Driveways, Sidewalks, Decks, Stairs Power Source: 1 x 4.0Ah 12V Battery Powered Clearing Area: Clears a 3-4 car driveway Clearing Width: 12 inch max Clearing Depth: 6 inch max Charging Time: 90 Min Runtime: 20 Min (High Speed) , 40 Min (Low Speed) Maximum Throwing Distance: Up to 16.5 Feet Weight: 13 Lbs Noise Level: Significantly quieter than comparable gas-powered units Operation: Push-button start, no cords or pull-start required  The blower's cord-free design minimizes the risk of tripping and enhances maneuverability in tight spaces, such as steps or patios. A low-vibration handle and ergonomic grip provide better control, while the enclosed motor housing prevents snow clogging during extended use.  Safety, Efficiency, and User Comfort  Unlike traditional snow pusher shovel, metal snow shovel, gas or corded snow pusher models, GARVEE's 12-Inch Cordless Snow Blower requires no fuel mixing or heavy maintenance. The zero-emissions motor makes it suitable for enclosed areas like garages or urban neighborhoods, while its instant-start trigger offers reliable performance even in freezing conditions.  Each unit is built with flame-retardant materials, weather-sealed switches, and reinforced battery housing to ensure consistent performance and operator safety.  Executive Perspective: Innovation for Everyday Use  "We're not competing on horsepower alone," said Lucas, GARVEE's COO. "We focus on creating tools that fit the rhythm of everyday life—compact, cordless, and ready when you need them. This snow blower is part of our broader vision to help customers simplify seasonal maintenance while moving toward cleaner energy solutions."  Availability and Winter Preparation  The new cordless Snow Pusher is now available exclusively through GARVEE.com. Its launch is timed to provide homeowners with reliable, lightweight snow tools well in advance of the coming winter season. While the company focuses on delivering value through its direct-to-consumer model, the product's launch reinforces the availability of high-quality tools needed for emergency winter gear and routine home upkeep.
