# Empowering the Future of Data Protection: Vinchin Announces Backup &amp; Recovery V9.0

CHENGDU, CHINA, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Vinchin Backup & Recovery 9.0: What's New?  With version 9.0, Vinchin Backup & Recovery brings smarter, faster, and more dependable backup and recovery solutions.  This release focuses on improved data security, recovery reliability, faster failover, and simpler cross-platform migration. New security and integrity features protect backups from tamper and malware. New migration and recovery paths reduce manual work and speed time to service.  Under the hood, a range of optimizations improve performance for virtualized and database environments. The result: less risk, lower operational cost, and faster business recovery.  Newly-Added Kubernetes Backup  Vinchin 9.0 now supports Kubernetes environments, providing reliable and consistent backup for container workloads. It uses the native CSI interface to take snapshots of PVC persistent volumes, ensuring backup consistency with minimal impact on production volumes.  Administrators can backup and restore at the cluster, namespace, application, or PVC level. Custom pre- and post-backup scripts can freeze applications, flush caches, or perform other tasks to maintain application consistency. The system can automatically detect applications and add new workloads to backup tasks, providing intelligent and continuous protection for dynamic Kubernetes environments.  Newly-Added Virus Scan  Vinchin 9.0 integrates Kaspersky antivirus to protect backup data. It automatically scans backups for viruses and removes any detected threats before restore. This prevents infected systems from being recovered and ensures backup data remains safe and reliable.  Newly-Added Emergency Takeover in DR Lab   An integrated built-in DR lab enables fast emergency takeover when production systems fail. Spin up recovered VMs and physical servers inside the DR lab to resume critical services without environment deployment. The feature supports post-recovery scripts to validate applications, open services, and run basic smoke tests automatically after failover.  Newly-Added Instant Recovery to DR Lab  Instant recovery now supports direct failover into the built-in DR lab. Customers that run a single production environment and lack a dedicated DR site can launch recovered VMs inside the lab to take over services quickly. Combined with post-recovery scripts, this feature automates basic service checks and accelerates verification. Instant recovery also shortens overall X2X migration time in many scenarios.  Newly-Added Any-to-Any Migration  Previously Vinchin supported only V2V. With version 9.0, it now supports any-to-any migration, such as V2V, P2V, C2C and C2V. The process automates disk format conversion and configuration mapping. The system replaces incompatible drivers and repairs the boot when needed. Vinchin includes a library of 200+ built-in drivers and allows administrators to add custom drivers. These capabilities simplify migration, reduce manual effort, and increase success rates for heterogeneous migrations.  Newly-Added Backup Data Integrity Check  When a backup completes, Vinchin generates a unique checksum from the backup data's metadata file. Before storage operations or before any restore, the system recalculates the checksum for that backup data and compares it with the original value. If the two values do not match, Vinchin marks the backup as corrupted, blocks the restore, and notifies administrators. This mechanism ensures backup integrity, prevents silent data corruption, and raises confidence in every recovery.  Newly Added WORM Support  WORM protection prevents backup files from being altered or deleted for a defined retention period. This feature helps meet regulatory requirements and protect critical backups from accidental or malicious tampering.  Newly Added Backup Cluster  9.0 introduces clustered backup deployments: one Server plus multiple Nodes form a backup cluster for high availability. Clustering removes single points of failure and supports failover of the backup service. Resource pools enable high availability and load balancing for compute, storage, proxy, and network resources.  Newly-Added Multi-level Retry Strategy  A new multi-level retry policy improves task resilience. Network glitches, transient operation errors, or temporary environmental issues trigger automated retry logic across multiple layers. This raises job success rates without manual intervention.  CDP and Replication Separation and Improvements  CDP (continuous data protection) and replication now operate independently. CDP supports real-time protection and point-in-time recovery. Replication focuses on reducing RTO and RPO and enables full-system migration scenarios. Both features can use heartbeat detection and scripted automation for automatic takeover, and CDP integrates with the built-in DR lab for streamlined failover.  VMware Backup Enhancements  Vinchin 9.0 improves VMware backup performance in several key areas. Source-side compression now allows data to be compressed on the virtualization server before transmission to the backup repository. This greatly reduces network traffic and data transfer volume, leading to faster backup speed and lower bandwidth usage.  The scanning process has also been optimized to shorten full-disk scanning time. Adding and initializing virtualization environments is now faster and more efficient, allowing administrators to complete configuration and backup setup in less time.  VM filtering lets administrators add multiple VMs to a job by name, streamlining task creation. During restore, the console now exposes more options for disk, network, and system reconfiguration to match the target environment precisely.  Oracle Backup Optimization  Oracle workflows gain multiple efficiency features: skip bad datafile blocks to avoid failed backups when corruption exists; multi-segment transfer splits large files and sends segments in parallel; custom RMAN commands let advanced users tailor backup logic; and parallel backup tasks let data and log backups run concurrently. Together these changes reduce backup time for very large Oracle databases and lower recovery complexity.  Granular Recovery Improvements  Granular restore gains new delivery options. Instead of browser download only, administrators can push recovered files directly to specified workloads or to a network share. This simplifies large restore operations, speeds file delivery, and makes granular restores more practical in production workflows.  Web Interface Refinement  The UI receives a major cleanup. Menus and navigation reduce clutter. Product capabilities sit in clearer sections so users find common tasks faster. The simplified layout shortens the learning curve and reduces click depth for everyday operations. A number of additional enhancements reduce backup windows and increase flexibility. You can try it or contact sales to get more information.  Summary  Vinchin Backup & Recovery 9.0 delivers stronger protection, smoother migration, and faster recovery for modern IT environments. New security and integrity controls reduce risk. Cluster and retry enhancements increase availability. Database and virtualization optimizations shrink backup windows and speed restores. If you manage backups, disaster recovery, or system migration, this release makes operations safer and simpler.
