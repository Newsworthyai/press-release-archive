# ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK ANNOUNCES 2025 HUNGER CHAMPIONS

ATLANTA, GA, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Atlanta Community Food Bank, one of the nation's largest food banks, recently announced their 2025 Hunger Champions, the people and organizations that have gone the extra distance to help in the fight against hunger in the community. The Food Bank recognizes five categories: Food Donor of the Year, Partner Agency of the Year, Public Official of the Year, Supporters of the Year, and Volunteer of the Year. The winners were announced at a luncheon hosted at the Atlanta Community Food Bank headquarters.  "As food insecurity continues to rise in Georgia and funding sources shift, we depend on our community more than ever to sustain vital programs for neighbors in need," said Kyle Waide, President & CEO of the Atlanta Community Food Bank. "Our Hunger Champions embody true community leadership, generously committing their time and resources to the fight against hunger. These awards celebrate those who have gone above and beyond to advance our mission and expand access to food across the region."  Nominees for the Hunger Champions are selected based on their contributions during the previous fiscal year.  2025 Hunger Champions  Meet this year's Hunger Champions, who stepped up in the fight against food insecurity and made a significant impact for those in need across metro Atlanta and north Georgia.  Food Donor of the Year: The Kroger Company  The Kroger Company launched its partnership with the Food Bank in 1999 and has steadily grown its support for neighbors in need. They currently donate nutritious food seven days a week. Last year, their contributions helped provide more than three million pounds of food, with more than 1.4 million pounds of perishable foods including meat, deli items, refrigerated items and produce. Their team's regular collaboration with the Food Bank ensures that donations meet local needs.  Partner Agency of the Year: Margie's House  Marjie's House made a tremendous impact in the past year. Highlights include distributing more than 409,000 pounds of food, with more than 42 percent being produce. The nonprofit organization was also the largest Commodity Supplemental Food Program partner with an allotment of 371 boxes. Additionally, their comprehensive services include programs that assist area neighbors such as a clothing closet and a community garden. The extensive support of Margie's House is highlighted with their Saturday distributions, which accommodate neighbors during times that are much more accessible to them.  Public Official of the Year: Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper  Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and his office have continuously supported the work of the Atlanta Community Food Bank, and all eight Georgia food banks, through their work to increase the state budget for the Georgia Grown Farm to Food Bank Program. In addition to ensuring funding support, Commissioner Harper has been an advocate, testifying about the work of the food banks and how this program helps organizations fulfill the high demand that they are experiencing. The Commissioner also provides valuable guidance and support that have expanded awareness of the Food Bank and the important work of food banks with state officials and legislators.  Supporters of the Year: The Schoen Foundation  Last year, the Schoen Foundation generously invested a total of $1.5 million to bolster the Food Bank's response to food insecurity across metro Atlanta and north Georgia. The foundation contributed $1 million toward the Transforming the Neighbor Experience campaign to support the expansion of the Community Food Center model and accelerate Digital Transformation at the Food Bank. Their generous contribution also helped the Food Bank procure, store, and distribute nearly 1.5 million meals directly to neighbors in need.  Volunteer of the Year: Raymond Wright  Raymond Wright's commitment to the Food Bank is truly admirable. He is a vital part of the Stone Mountain Community Food Center (CFC), where he volunteers. Wright can be found carrying groceries through the rain to a neighbor in need or greeting someone with a warm welcome at the door of the CFC. The staff rely on his knowledge, dependability, and even his trusty box cutter to help serve more than 180 households a day and distribute more than 150,000 pounds of food each month.  "We are truly honored and fortunate to celebrate these individuals and teams who contribute to our cause and strengthen us each and every day with their generous support," continued Waide.  The Atlanta Community Food Bank is the Southeast's largest food bank and throughout the year connects more than 820,000 people with healthy and nutritious food. The organization works with more than 700 nonprofit partners to help fight food insecurity in the communities they serve.
