# Descendant Films, LLC Announces Vedant Dave as Director of Photography for the Premium Television Series "Rivals to Lovers"

LOS ANGELES, CA, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Directed by Erik Lu and produced by Karpit Patel. This premium, dual-format project is set to redefine the visual and emotional language of modern serialized storytelling when it enters production in early 2027.  Blending elements of romance, business rivalry, suspense, and personal transformation, Rivals to Lovers follows Ananya, a bold entrepreneur in the tech-fashion world, and Daniel, a charismatic but ruthless CEO of a competing startup. Their intense professional rivalry evolves into an equally charged emotional relationship, forcing both to confront ambition, betrayal, and the blurry line between competition and connection.  What sets Rivals to Lovers apart is its innovative dual-format production strategy, designed for both traditional global streamers like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+, as well as for mobile-first vertical platforms dominating Asian markets such as Tencent, iQIYI, and Youku. By capturing in both horizontal (16:9) and vertical (9:16) formats simultaneously, the production maximizes its global and cross-platform reach—a first-of-its-kind endeavor in long-form television production.  As Director of Photography, Vedant Dave will lead the visual development of this ambitious series, uniting cinematic storytelling with cutting-edge technical precision. His responsibilities include defining the show's visual identity across both capture formats, ensuring aesthetic consistency and emotional resonance regardless of screen orientation or platform. Working with multi-camera setups including the ARRI Alexa 35 for cinematic visuals and the Sony FX3 for mobile-oriented framing, Dave will craft an immersive world balancing sleek corporate precision with intimate, character-driven vulnerability.  According to Director Erik Lu, "This series is built around contrast—between love and rivalry, intimacy and ambition, big-screen spectacle and mobile immediacy. Vedant's mastery of light and visual tone makes him the ideal collaborator. His ability to create worlds that are both cinematic and emotionally accessible ensures that Rivals to Lovers will resonate with audiences everywhere."  Throughout filming in iconic Los Angeles and San Francisco locations, Dave will supervise lighting design, lens aesthetics, and camera movement for both the grand scale of Silicon Valley innovation and the emotional subtleties of romantic drama. His approach emphasizes modern color palettes, reflective surfaces, and evolving visual motifs that mirror the power struggles and emotional arcs of the protagonists.  Post-production will include parallel editing workflows to shape both horizontal and vertical versions concurrently, a process supervised closely by Dave to preserve performance nuance and visual coherence across formats. With sleek corporate hues, naturalistic lighting, and emotionally tuned framing, Dave's photographic direction will serve as the visual backbone of the series.  Descendant Films, LLC, led by Erik Lu, continues to push the boundaries of cinematic storytelling for global markets. With prior collaborations spanning the United States and Asia, Lu's work is recognized for its aesthetic discipline, narrative clarity, and forward-looking technical innovation.  Production for Rivals to Lovers runs from January 16, 2027, through January 23, 2028, with post-production concluding in early 2028. The series is positioned as a flagship cross-market production, built to engage both Western premium streaming audiences and the rapidly expanding Asian serialized drama landscape.  With Vedant Dave's leadership in cinematography, Rivals to Lovers aims not only to tell a compelling story of love born from rivalry but also to set a new industry standard for multi-format global storytelling.
