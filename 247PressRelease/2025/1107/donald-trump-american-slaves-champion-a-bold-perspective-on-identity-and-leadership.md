# Donald Trump: American Slaves' Champion — A Bold Perspective on Identity and Leadership

SACRAMENTO, CA, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Renowned historian and author Dr. Norris Shelton, PhD, founder of American Slaves, Inc., announces the release of his latest book, Donald Trump: American Slaves' Champion.   As the founder of American Slaves, Inc., Dr. Shelton spent his whole career writing the history of American slaves and speaking up for their descendants.   Dr. Shelton is a lifelong advocate for the recognition of the American Slave Nation who presents a compelling and deeply researched narrative exploring the distinct cultural identity of the descendants of American slaves. He argues that these descendants represent a unique cultural group, separate from the broader African American designation, and that their specific history deserves acknowledgment and respect.  For hundreds of years, American slaves have had to deal with this constant misidentification. At its core, we invite you all to reconsider how cultural and historical recognition can contribute to a more inclusive society.  "Let's reclaim the true identity of the American Slave Nation," says Dr. Shelton. "Our story deserves to be told with accuracy, dignity, and pride."  This book isn't a political argument; it's a message to reexamine how the story of the American slave has been passed down through generations. Dr. Shelton also shares his perspective on President Donald J. Trump, crediting him for recognizing and speaking to issues affecting the descendants of American slaves. The author portrays President Trump as a leader who encouraged honest discussion and challenged conventional narratives surrounding race and equality in America.  "President Trump's approach inspired renewed attention to fairness and truth for all Americans," Shelton adds.  Both timely and thought-provoking, the book serves as a call to rediscover the foundation of cultural identity and to engage in honest discussion about how history shapes the future.
