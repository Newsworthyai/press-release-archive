# 2022 Mercedes-AMG SL 55: The Reborn Roadster That Balances Power and Prestige

FORT WORTH, TX, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to showcase the rebirth of a legendary nameplate with the arrival of a 2022 Mercedes-AMG SL 55 in sleek black—one of the latest additions to The Ron Sturgeon Collectionand a striking tribute to the enduring legacy of the SL-Class, which dates back to the iconic 300SL Gullwing.  After several years of lukewarm reception and competition from newer grand touring rivals, the SL-Class has returned with new firepower and focus, positioning itself as a true driver's car while still retaining the luxurious DNA that made it famous. The AMG-developed SL 55 is powered by a 469-horsepower twin-turbo V8, paired with standard all-wheel drive and four-wheel steering—features designed to deliver precise handling and impressive acceleration without sacrificing everyday comfort.  A redesigned platform and lightweight fabric folding roof replace the outgoing hardtop, bringing back the SL's beloved open-air character while also reducing weight and improving agility. Inside, the SL 55 features a tech-rich, driver-centric cabin that fuses high-performance intent with premium materials and modern connectivity.  "This car represents the evolution of a legend," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "The SL has always been about elegance and engineering—and this new SL 55 is a bold return to form. It's fast, refined, and unmistakably an AMG."  Whether admired for its cutting-edge technology or its motorsport-inspired performance, the 2022 SL 55 shows that Mercedes-Benz isn't just reviving an icon—it's reimagining it for a new generation.
