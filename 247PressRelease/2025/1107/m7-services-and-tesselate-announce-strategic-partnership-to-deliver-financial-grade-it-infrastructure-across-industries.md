# M7 Services and Tesselate Announce Strategic Partnership to Deliver Financial-Grade IT Infrastructure Across Industries

HOUSTON, TX, November 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- M7 Services, a Houston, Texas-based leading provider of enterprise-class IT and infrastructure solutions, today announced a strategic partnership with Tesselate, a Paris, France-based international consulting and technology firm recognized for modernizing financial institutions worldwide. This partnership will introduce a new standard for managed IT and compliance, merging financial-grade governance and automation with hospitality-level service and agility.  The collaboration between Tesselate and M7 Services brings together two complementary strengths: Tesselate's deep expertise in corporate banking, process optimization, ecosystem and operational orchestration, and M7's secure, always-on IT infrastructure and proactive services. Together, they establish a robust managed services framework designed to support sustainable digital transformation for corporate banks, enabling a unified, scalable environment that ensures reliability, security, and measurable efficiency allowing clients to focus on growth and innovation while their day-to-day operations run seamlessly.  "M7 has spent years redefining how technology supports performance, experience, and compliance across the industries we serve," said Charif Zahrane, Chief Innovation Officer at M7 Services. "Partnering with Tesselate allows us to extend that foundation even further, combining our infrastructure and service reliability with their world-class financial operations expertise to deliver secure, scalable solutions that anticipate and prevent issues before they ever reach the client."   "This partnership also accelerates our expansion into Europe and the broader EMEA, bringing our 24/7 model to clients who need audit-ready operations that meet EU regulatory expectations, without sacrificing uptime," Zahrane added.  "Tesselate has long set the standard for managed services within the corporate banking ecosystem, acting as an enabler for clients to focus on their business growth and digital transformation while we manage the day-to-day operations," said Yuri Herman, Head of Corporate Banking at Tesselate Group. "Our collaboration with M7 Services enhances that standard even further, combining operational depth with ecosystem scalability to deliver measurable value across our clients' technology landscape."  Organizations are under increasing pressure to modernize legacy systems without compromising compliance or uptime. By combining M7's high-touch managed-services approach with Tesselate's advanced automation and regulatory frameworks, clients can now bridge hospitality-grade responsiveness with financial-sector precision. This will create a cohesive operating environment where every transaction, system, and support function is proactive rather than reactive.  "M7 was founded on the idea that technology should simplify operations, not complicate them," said Jessie McMahon, CEO of M7 Services. "Working with Tesselate means we can extend that same level of performance and protection to global organizations that expect financial-grade reliability every day."  Leveraging predictive monitoring and automated resolution tools, the combined platform identifies potential issues before they disrupt performance. That intelligence, paired with M7's U.S.-based 24/7 helpdesk and Tesselate's deep expertise capability, delivers the reliability global organizations require to operate confidently across markets.  M7's culture of accountability has driven industry-leading results over the past year including: • Same-day resolution rate: 75 percent • Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): 99.5 percent • Resolution SLA compliance: 99 percent • Response SLA compliance: 97 percent • Proactive services: Resolved 2.5x more issues than were reported  These metrics underscore M7's unique service model, where prevention, transparency, and speed are built into every client engagement. Through this partnership, those standards are now being applied to financial-grade environments, offering an unprecedented level of reliability to industries that cannot afford downtime. Their joint framework offers organizations a path to modernization that is both compliant and cost-effective, setting a new benchmark for managed services rooted in measurable business outcomes.
