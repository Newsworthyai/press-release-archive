The personal narrative begins in the dark world of organized crime, where the author's first husband brings a sense of danger into their lives. Dinner guests are asked to check their firearms at the door. She then stepped into an unexpected relationship with a younger man whose charm proved timeless, even if his ID was still getting doublechecked.

This raw, candid memoir transforms heartbreak into hope, offering both laughter and practical wisdom for anyone rebuilding after loss. But make no mistake, these aren't your typical fresh starts.

Her stories offer humor, heart, and the kind of wisdom you only earn the hard way.  "I wrote this book because I believe that life's most devastating losses can transform into powerful new beginnings, and starting over isn't just surviving; it's where your best chapter begins," Bennett stated. "Readers will discover how to collect meaningful experiences rather than dwelling on regrets, find laughter even when everything seems to go wrong, and navigate the practical realities of rebuilding with both wisdom and humor. This book offers hope and guidance for anyone ready to embrace the truth that widowhood, while challenging, can be the start of an unexpectedly fulfilling new adventure."
