# DVDFab 23rd Anniversary Release: Core Suite Enhancements and Mac/AI Expansion

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, September 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Marking 23 years, DVDFab rolls out AV1-ready ripping, sturdier copy engines, richer creator tools, Mac‑native UHD authoring, and new AI upscaler/HDR modules.  About DVDFab  DVDFab—founded in 2003—offers a complete toolbox for DVD/Blu-ray/4K UHD copying, ripping, conversion, authoring, and playback across Windows and macOS, covering everyday needs like converting DVD to MP4 alongside dedicated utilities such as DVD ripper and DVD copy software. The suite also includes AI modules for upscaling and SDR-to-HDR conversion, plus utilities that expand drive participation in UHD workflows. DVDFab 13 unifies these components into a cohesive experience with formats, menus, and disc structures that adhere to industry norms for reliable playback in living rooms and screening rooms alike.  Feature Upgrades to DVDFab's Core Products  DVDFab Ripper converts DVDs, Blu-rays, and UHDs (or ISOs/folders) into device-ready files with full control over codecs, audio tracks, and subtitles; it now adds AV1 output in MP4/MKV for DVD/Blu-ray (efficient, high‑quality SDR) and native AV1 HDR10 for UHD Ripper, plus a more accurate SRT subtitle OCR engine and 100 new device presets for faster, one‑click targeting.   DVDFab Copy handles reliable 1:1 cloning and smart compression (e.g., DVD‑9 to DVD‑5, BD‑50 to BD‑25) to disc, ISO, or folder while preserving menus; it continues to track new Java protections—including recent Japanese adult DVDs—to keep backups compatible with current releases.   DVDFab Creator authors playable DVD/Blu‑ray/UHD titles with menus, chapters, and proper BDMV/VIDEO_TS structure for standalone players; it now integrates a built‑in Video Editor for trimming, cropping, effects, subtitles, and audio tweaks, and Blu‑ray Creator adds new themed menu templates (wedding, birthday, travel) for polished results with less setup.  New Releases: AI Lineup and macOS Expansion  DVDFab introduces AI Upscaler and AI HDR Upconverter to elevate baseline image fidelity—cleanly enlarging HD/SD sources and converting SDR libraries to HDR10—with NVIDIA AI Enhancer providing GPU‑accelerated upscaling and SDR‑to‑HDR pipelines that plug directly into Ripper and Creator for end‑to‑end quality gains.   On macOS, DVDFab expands parity with UHD Creator for Mac, enabling true 4K Blu‑ray authoring from a range of 4K formats that play on standalone UHD players, alongside Blu‑ray to UHD Converter for Mac and UHD to Blu‑ray Converter for Mac, which bring cross‑standard conversion and authoring workflows natively to Mac for mixed‑OS teams.  As part of the 23rd Anniversary Celebration, DVDFab invites users to join an interactive wheel game and secure limited-time savings. Participants get up to two attempts to win a coupon bundle worth as much as $45, with denominations including $30, $35, and $40.
