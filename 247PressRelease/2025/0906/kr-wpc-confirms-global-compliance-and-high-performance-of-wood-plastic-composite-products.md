# KR WPC Confirms Global Compliance and High Performance of Wood-Plastic Composite Products

XUANCHENG, CHINA, September 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KR New Materials Co., Ltd. (KR WPC), a leading Chinese manufacturer and exporter of premium wood plastic composite decking, cladding, fencing, and accessories, today announced that its product lineup fully complies with key international standards across Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia. Backed by ISO 9001, CE, and FSC certifications, and verified through rigorous independent testing, KR WPC reinforces its commitment to delivering sustainable, safe, and high-performance outdoor solutions worldwide.  As demand for WPC continues to grow globally due to its durability, eco-friendliness, and design versatility, KR WPC's offerings—including 3D embossed decking, co-extrusion panels, and solid/hollow boards—consistently exceed market expectations for safety and longevity. "Quality drives us," said CEO Mr. Chen. "Our certifications and technical testing demonstrate that KR WPC meets the evolving requirements of global construction and outdoor markets."  Proven Compliance Across Major Markets  In Europe, KR WPC products conform to EN 15534 standards, ensuring exceptional water resistance, minimal swelling, and excellent indentation resistance—establishing the brand among trusted composite cladding manufacturers. Tests show that after 28 days of water immersion, the decking exhibits only 0.5% thickness swelling and 0.1% swelling in width and length, with water absorption limited to 0.5%. Fire safety testing achieved EN 13501-1 Class Bfl-S1, demonstrating superior flame retardancy. Brinell hardness averaged 104 MPa with an elastic recovery of 74%, confirming structural integrity and longevity for commercial and residential applications.  In the United States, products comply with ASTM standards such as D7031, D7032, and D6109. Flexural strength (MOR) measures 39.3 MPa with a modulus of elasticity (MOE) of 4168 MPa under standard conditions. Extreme temperature testing confirmed that at 50°C, MOR is 30.3 MPa and MOE 3145 MPa, while at –29°C, MOR reaches 55.2 MPa and MOE 7306 MPa. UV resistance is rated Grey Scale 4, maintaining appearance under prolonged sun exposure. Freeze-thaw testing confirmed consistent performance, and mechanical fastener holding strength measured 6519 N, ensuring secure installation even under heavy load.  For Southeast Asia, KR WPC products demonstrate exceptional resilience under tropical conditions, further strengthening its role as a reliable wpc fencing supplier. With an average density of 1.317 g/cm³, the decking shows excellent dimensional stability, UV and humidity resistance, and maintains color vibrancy while resisting insect attack. This makes the products particularly suited for markets in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and other high-temperature, high-humidity regions.  Sustainable Design and Manufacturing Excellence  KR WPC utilizes a combination of wood fiber, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, and advanced chemical additives in its production process. Each product is molded and extruded with precision under strict quality control, resulting in eco-friendly, waterproof, fireproof, UV-resistant decking, cladding, and fencing with a service life exceeding 20 years. The company operates 40 production lines, including in-house mold design with over 340 mold types, enabling both standard and fully customized solutions. Products are shipped globally to more than 24 countries, from Europe to Southeast Asia and the Americas.  The company's technical and environmental rigor ensures that every product meets or exceeds international performance benchmarks. In addition to European and U.S. certifications, KR WPC aligns its products with regional ASEAN standards, combining ISO, ASTM, EN, and local regulations such as BCA Singapore and TIS Thailand. Customers can rely on consistency in strength, durability, and aesthetic performance regardless of climate or application type.
