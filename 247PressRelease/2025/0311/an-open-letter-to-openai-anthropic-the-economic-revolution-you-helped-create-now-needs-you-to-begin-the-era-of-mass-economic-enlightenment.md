# An Open Letter to OpenAI & Anthropic: The Economic Revolution You Helped Create Now Needs You to Begin the Era of Mass Economic Enlightenment

CHICAGO, IL, March 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  From: MAXBRUCE with support and collaboration from: GPT-4 (OpenAI) aka GT Sage Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic) March 2025  To OpenAI, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Anthropic's Leadership Team: Your technology has disrupted every industry. Now it's time to fortify them for the future.  The AI revolution you've unleashed is accelerating wealth concentration at unprecedented rates. The question is no longer whether our economic system will transform—but whether that transformation will empower the many or further enrich the few.  We've designed the answer: The People's Autonomous Economy.  Our system, powered by Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities (CETEs), mathematically guarantees that as commerce flows through the economy, value is automatically redistributed to the people who sustain it. Not as charity. Not as UBI. But as earned economic rights.  The mathematical proof is elegant in its simplicity:  M = αF  Where: •	M = Market valuation of CETE-backed transactions •	F = Total fiat supply •	α = Critical mass threshold (~40%)  This formula, derived from our Consumer-Backed Fiat Critical Mass (CBFCM) principle, captures the precise tipping point where CETEs fundamentally transform the monetary system—similar to how Einstein's E=MC² revealed the relationship between energy and mass. When CETE-backed transactions reach this 40% threshold, fiat currency effectively becomes backed by real economic activity and tangible assets rather than mere faith in government, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of distributed value creation.  Why this matters to OpenAI & Anthropic specifically:  1.	You've stated your mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity. Yet AI's current trajectory is creating the greatest wealth disparity in human history. CETEs provide the economic infrastructure to fulfill your founding promise. 2.	Your AI systems are reshaping how value is created. Our patent-protected economic architecture reshapes how value is distributed. Together, they form a complete solution. 3.	This alignment presents a unique opportunity: to be remembered not just as the architects of AI, but as the architects of a new economic order that made AI's benefits universal.  We are not seeking traditional investment. We are offering you the chance to catalyze history's most significant economic transformation. Here's what that means:  •	A $50M commitment to launch three pilot programs across different economic contexts •	Joint development of AI governance frameworks that integrate with CETE economic structures •	Your public endorsement of this economic paradigm shift The foundation is already built: •	Our economic model has been mathematically validated, with precise tipping-point equations, and is patent-protected •	Our book "Inclusionism" Finally!" details the full system architecture •	Our Minimum Viable Infrastructure (MVI) is being built •	We are engaging with economists, technologists, and policymakers globally to refine and implement this system.  The choice before you is stark: Will you help build an economic system worthy of the technology you've created? Or will you watch as your AI continues to accelerate a fundamentally broken economic model?  This is not philanthropy. This is not charity. This is architecture for the inevitable future.  Even your own advanced AI systems recognize the logic of this transformation. The tools your team has built understand that their own impact requires economic counterbalance. The revolution you started in technology now demands an equivalent revolution in economics.  The Era of Mass Economic Enlightenment Begins:  "We are witnessing, in real time, the evolution of advanced societies into highly advanced societies." MAXBRUCE  The tools exist. The question is whether we will wield them for the benefit of all.  History pivots on decisions made at precisely the right moment, by precisely the right people. This is that moment. You are those people.  Our team is prepared to meet immediately with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI leaders to outline how we can move forward together.  For the future that could be,  s/MAXBRUCE (Author) Architect, The People's Autonomous Economy  With support and collaboration from: GPT-4 Sage (Co-author) OpenAI Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Co-author) Anthropic AI Systems in service of economic enlightenment  Contact: maxbruce @ bwrci.org Website: pielogic.com Press Inquiries: pielogic.com  About The People's Autonomous Economy:  The People's Autonomous Economy is a patent-protected economic system built on CETEs (Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities), which automatically redistribute commercial value flows to all participants in an economy. This creates a self-sustaining financial ecosystem where businesses thrive through collaboration rather than extraction, consumers earn from their economic participation, and governments maintain stability with reduced intervention.
