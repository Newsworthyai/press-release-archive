NEW YORK, NY, March 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/  [PROTIA's Companion Animal & Equine Allergy Diagnostic Product Line] Equine Allergy Diagnostic Kit 'ANITIA Equine IgE (Top),  Canine Allergy Diagnostic Kit 'ANITIA Canine IgE (Bottom Left), Feline Allergy Diagnostic Kit 'ANITIA Feline IgE (Bottom Right).  A globally leading company in in-vitro diagnostic medical devices PROTIA (CEO Lim Kook-Jin) announced on March 4, 2025 that it will participate in the Western Veterinary Conference (WVC), which will be held from March 2 to 5 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, USA.   At this exhibition, veterinary professionals—including veterinarians from around the world—are expected to attend, along with more than 600 companies and over 20,000 visitors. PROTIA will primarily showcase its companion animal allergy diagnostic product, 'ANITIA Canine/Feline IgE', its equine allergy diagnostic product, 'ANITIA Equine IgE', and its IgG measurement technology for colostrum and blood in horses and cattle.  'ANITIA Canine/Feline IgE' is a product designed to rapidly and accurately diagnose allergens in dogs and cats. It enables veterinarians and pet owners to quickly identify the causes of pet allergies and develop appropriate treatment plans.  Additionally, PROTIA successfully launched 'ANITIA Equine IgE' in July 2024, allowing for the effective diagnosis of various allergic reactions in horses and providing appropriate management and preventive measures. This product utilizes a Parallel Line Array (PLA) system, allowing for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of 120 allergens through equine serum. By doing so, it offers optimal preventive solutions to maintain the health and performance of horses.  Newborn calves and foals acquire immunity immediately after birth by consuming their mother's colostrum. PROTIA's 'AniCheck Bovine/Equine IgG' measures the IgG concentration in colostrum within just 10 minutes, helping select colostrum rich in immune substances. By providing this high-quality colostrum to calves and foals, the product aids in increasing survival rates and reducing disease incidence. Additionally, it measures IgG antibody levels in blood, allowing for the assessment of immune health status in cattle.  PROTIA's participation in the Western Veterinary Conference (WVC) is expected to serve as a significant opportunity to expand its influence in the global veterinary market, share the latest research achievements, and further strengthen its international network.  Lim Kook-Jin, CEO of PROTIA, stated, "Through our participation in WVC, we aim to introduce PROTIA's innovative companion and large animal diagnostic technology to the global market and expand collaborations with international veterinary professionals and companies." He added, "We will continue to focus on developing innovative diagnostic technologies for the health management of both companion and large animals."
