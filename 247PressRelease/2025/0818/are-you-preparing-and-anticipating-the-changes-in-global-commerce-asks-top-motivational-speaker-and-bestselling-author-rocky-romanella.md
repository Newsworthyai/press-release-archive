# Are You Preparing And Anticipating The Changes In Global Commerce Asks Top Motivational Speaker And Bestselling Author Rocky Romanella

WILMINGTON, NC, August 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors have made it possible for customers to browse and purchase products from anywhere at any time. Though this is not necessarily new, this landscape can change at lightning speed. It is vitally important that organizations keep their eyes on the puck, while simultaneously making correct projections about where that puck is going to be, both short-term and long-term.  As a top keynote speaker, Rocky Romanella spends a good deal of time speaking to groups of people, large and small, most of whom hope to take away actionable ideas regarding how to stay abreast of this ever-changing landscape. Romanella addressed some of the issues involved in a recent newsletter titled, "A Whole New World: Optimizing It Through E-Commerce." In that piece he wrote in part:  We have all been touched by the e-commerce wave, whether as a consumer or a business supplying goods and services. It is clear the internet allows small companies to look and feel like big companies, and large companies to feel like a small company with the way they portray their businesses on the web. This also provides you with an opportunity to support your marketing strategy and position your brand to support your organization's strategy and mission, and build your brand identity around the world.  A few thought-provoking questions to start the critical analysis: Do you and your organization possess the leadership competencies of Strategic Perspective & Vision, developing a compelling vision and strategy for the organization and its units? Do you and your team understand both the short-term and long-term view of both the organization's and the overall industry's strengths, challenges, and opportunities?  In this newsletter, let's discuss the following questions as you begin the global strategic journey:  Is e-commerce something for you to consider for your business?  What are some of the things you will need to consider?  The World Wide Web is global—are you?  Are you preparing for today and tomorrow's new normal?  If we bring back manufacturing and markets open to countries worldwide that we have little to no business in, are you prepared to manage these needs?  Are you preparing to support the growth of the manufacturing boom in the U.S.?  How do your customers view you today?  Are you a preferred vendor, solutions provider, or a trusted advisor?  Let's start from a historical perspective as a level set and move from there.  Significant Events Have Shaped the Future of Companies, Markets, and People  For example, in retail, the first disruption arrived in the form of department stores. Retailing was originally dominated by local merchants who provided value to their customers by keeping large inventories, extending credit, and offering personalized advice. The industry changed dramatically in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a result of the first retail disruption: the launch of department stores like Marshall Field and R.H. Macy, to name a few.  In manufacturing, for the first time, Henry Ford's entire Highland Park, Michigan automobile factory was run on a continuously moving assembly line when the chassis—the automobile's frame—was assembled using the revolutionary industrial technique. A motor and rope pulled the chassis past workers and parts on the factory floor, cutting the hours required to complete one "Model T" from 12-1/2 hours to six. Within a year, further assembly line improvements reduced the time required to 93 minutes. The staggering increase in productivity affected by Ford's use of the moving assembly line allowed him to drastically reduce the cost of the Model T, thereby accomplishing his dream of making the car affordable to ordinary consumers.  Thirty years ago, listeners tuning into Morning Edition heard about a futuristic idea that could profoundly change their lives.  "Imagine being able to communicate at will with 10 million people all over the world," NPR's Neal Conan said. "Imagine having direct access to catalogs of hundreds of libraries as well as the most up-to-date news, business, and weather reports. Imagine being able to get medical advice or gardening advice immediately from any number of experts.  "This is not a dream," he continued. "It's internet."  Events Shape Companies, and Without Change, Your Current Company's History and Success Do Not Guarantee Future Success  A key lesson for leaders is that a company's current success does not guarantee future success.  There are many great American brands that have stood the test of time.  The key to longevity is: a. Anticipating where the market is going, b. Making tough decisions, c. Effectively communicating when changes need to be made.  Leaders Anticipate One of the key lessons I like to share with you is this… leaders anticipate! Leaders go to where the puck is going, not to where the puck has been.
