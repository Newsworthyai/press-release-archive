# Unleashing the Bull: 2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 Now Roaring at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, August 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to welcome one of the most iconic supercars of the modern era to its collection: the 2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 Coupe, a sleek black beast now on display as part of the prestigious Ron Sturgeon Collection.  Designed by Filippo Perini, the Aventador debuted as the spiritual successor to Lamborghini's legendary V12 flagships — a bold leap into the future of supercar performance and design. Beneath its angular bodywork lies a heart of pure power: a 6.5-liter naturally aspirated V12, factory rated at a jaw-dropping 691 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque.  "The Aventador LP700-4 represents everything a modern Lamborghini should be—bold, aggressive, and unapologetically thrilling," says Brian Sturgeon, Director of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a true privilege to showcase this engineering masterpiece for our visitors."  Power is delivered to all four wheels through a seven-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system, ensuring the Aventador's legendary acceleration and handling. The car also features a limited-slip rear differential, keeping all that power firmly planted to the pavement.  Engineered to deliver performance as stunning as its design, this Aventador comes equipped with carbon-ceramic brakes, a front-axle lift system, bi-xenon headlights, an active rear wing, and a transparent engine cover that proudly displays the mid-mounted V12.  The cabin blends cutting-edge technology with Italian craftsmanship. The leather-trimmed multi-function steering wheel fronts a fully digital gauge cluster, with a central tachometer, speed readout, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature.   Comfort and convenience are ensured with power-adjustable heated seats, a premium Sensonum sound system, and automatic climate control.  Finished in stealthy black with yellow-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors, this example displays just 11,000 miles on its digital odometer—a pristine modern collectible and a standout example of Lamborghini's relentless pursuit of performance.  Now proudly displayed alongside more than 200 cars and thousands of rare toys and collectibles, the 2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 offers museum visitors a visceral encounter with one of the most desirable supercars of the 21st century.
