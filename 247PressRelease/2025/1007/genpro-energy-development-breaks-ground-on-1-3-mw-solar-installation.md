# GenPro Energy Development Breaks Ground on 1.3 MW Solar Installation

RAPID CITY, SD, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- GenPro Energy Development today announced the start of construction on the Camden Heights Solar Project. This 999kW-ac solar installation will power seven affordable housing buildings containing 252 apartment units in Rapid City, South Dakota. The solar component is part of Elmington Capital Group's ambitious $78 million Camden Heights development, one of the largest affordable housing initiatives in the region.  The ground-mounted solar system, located at 1700 Camden Drive in northeast Rapid City, will generate clean energy to offset approximately 90% of the apartment complex's energy needs. This groundbreaking project represents a significant step forward in making renewable energy accessible to low-income communities while reducing utility costs for seniors and families.  "This project exemplifies the mission of GenPro Energy Development, which is to build projects that promote economic development at the local level," said Molly Brown, Managing Partner at GenPro Energy Development. "By bringing solar power directly to affordable housing, we're not just stabilizing and reducing energy costs for the Camden Heights residents â€“ we're creating a replicable model for sustainable community development that other South Dakota cities can adopt."  Elmington, the developer behind the broader Camden Heights initiative, selected GenPro Energy Development to design and implement the solar component of this transformative project.
