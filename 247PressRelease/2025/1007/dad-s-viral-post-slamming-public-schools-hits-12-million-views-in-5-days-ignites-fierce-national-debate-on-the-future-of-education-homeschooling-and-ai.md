# Dad's Viral Post Slamming Public Schools Hits 12 Million Views in 5 Days, Ignites Fierce National Debate on the Future of Education, Homeschooling, and AI

CHARLESTON, SC, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- "Public school is a joke."  With that blunt statement, entrepreneur and father of three Mike Wingard unleashed a tidal wave. In just 5 days, his Facebook post skyrocketed to 12 million views and 15,500 comments , making it one of the most viral social media posts in the U.S. this year.  The post, which described Wingard's frustration after pulling his kids out of school for a family trip, struck a national nerve. Teachers told him not to worry about missed work and to "have fun on the trip." But when his son returned, he was handed a "mountain of meaningless worksheets," threatening truancy letters, and told he was now failing English. "Our kids are in elementary school, and this is already the circus we're dealing with," Wingard wrote.  The internet erupted. Supporters urged Wingard to "pull your kids out and homeschool immediately." Critics fired back, "Be a responsible parent, follow the rules, and take vacations in the summer."  Another flashpoint came when parents and teachers questioned whether schools exist to educate kids or protect their funding. Many argued the system now values attendance numbers and test scores over real learning. "Schools don't prepare students for the future," one parent said. "Public school is nothing more than a people factory."  Despite spending over $800 billion a year, many graduates leave high school without basic proficiency in reading or math. "We're spending record money on schools, but kids are graduating without knowing how to think critically, read proficiently, or solve problems in the real world. That's not education, that's a disgrace," Wingard said.  Through his brand, Legacy Mike, Wingard is building resources to equip families with future-proof skills: leadership, creativity, problem-solving, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship.  "This isn't about complaining," Wingard added. "The public school system is broken, and if we don't fix education now, we risk losing another generation."
