FORT WORTH, TX, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car and Toy Museum (Texas' largest car museum) in Fort Worth, Texas is proud to announce that it has been named Fort Worth Magazine's 2025 "Best of Fort Worth" Reader Pick Winner in the Family Outing subcategory of the Nightlife and Entertainment category. The museum opened in April, 2025, just 7 months ago.   "We're elated by the outpouring of votes," said Ron Sturgeon, founder and owner of the DFW Car and Toy Museum. "It's genuinely an honor to be chosen by the good people of Fort Worth for a prestigious award such as this." A write up by Fort Worth Magazine includes highlights of the museum and its origin story. A pdf includes more on the museum and information about it as an event venue.  The car museum is the brainchild of Sturgeon, who first started collecting toy Mercedes cars more than 40 years ago. Sturgeon expanded his interests to include rare and vintage automobile themed items such as race cars and scale models. As the years progressed, Sturgeon's interests expanded to include vintage toys, unique signs, automotive memorabilia, and other rare and historic collectibles. As his burgeoning collection grew, Sturgeon realized he had to come up with a planâ€¦a way to share his treasures with everyone. That's when he landed on the brilliant idea of opening a toy and car museum.  "At this point, it's more than just a classic car collection," Sturgeon said. "It's an experience. We're proud to offer a space where visitors can immerse themselves in automotive culture. Whether you're admiring a beautifully restored car, reliving childhood memories through our toy collection, or learning about the evolution of automobile design, our museum will leave you inspired."  To be sure, the DFW Car and Toy Museum offers an unforgettable experience for all ages. Located in Fort Worth, Texas, the museum features a captivating combination of whimsy and delight, with its extraordinarily rare exhibits and breathtaking backdrops.  Visitors to the museum will discover a veritable treasure trove of more than 3,000 vintage collectible toys and an extraordinary, multi-million-dollar collection of more than 200 classic and unique cars. Occupying more than 150,000 square feet of dynamic display space, the museum is sure to delight folks of all ages.  The automotive area showcases an extraordinary lineup of rare exotic cars, European masterpieces, celebrity-owned vehicles, unique oddities, and historic race cars. Each car on display has a fascinating story, representing decades of automotive innovation and craftsmanship. The museum even features a special section dedicated to cars that defy expectations.  The museum has an impressive collection of modern supercars, including a 647 hp 2017 Ford GT and a 986 hp 2022 Ferrari SF90. The museum also features a row of 1 million rare classic cars.  A perennial visitor favorite is the carefully curated cache of favorite space toys from the mid-1900s, including a rare collection of 1950s and 1960s robots such as Gumbo, Electroman, and Big Loo.  At nearly five feet tall, Gumbo the Robot Dispenser is a rare Italian coin-operated gumball vending machine manufactured in the late 1950s. Crafted of polished metal, Gumbo features orange illuminated eyes and mouth, and a clear chest panel that displays the gumball storage area.   The exceptionally rare Electroman is known as "the holy grail" of robot collectors. Powered by 2 D-cell batteries, Electroman is made of tin and features stunning lithograph detailing. Electroman's mouth opens and closes automatically when the robot is in action. The energy chamber is illuminated by a red light, and three small tin pistons move rapidly when the robot is in action.  Manufactured by Louis Marx and Company for the 1963 holiday season, Big Loo had a limited production of about 5,000, making this guy quite rare. Described by the catchphrase of "Your Friend from the Moon," Big Loo was one of the largest toy robots made, with a height of more than 38 inches. The elaborate design and attention to detail on Big Loo is truly remarkable. A rocket-firing launcher with two rockets operates from his base. Battery operation controls his flashing red eyes, and Big Loo can turn his head, roll forward, take a bow, launch balls, shoot darts, squirt water with his "water ray," and grasp objects with his spring-operated hand.  The DFW Car and Toy Museum offers free admission to all, and there is lots of free parking available for visitors.
