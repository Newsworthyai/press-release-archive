# Where Art and Engineering Meet: 1954 Mercedes-Benz 220A Cabriolet by Hiro Yamagata

FORT WORTH, TX, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A dazzling fusion of automotive craftsmanship and fine art, the 1954 Mercedes-Benz 220A Cabriolet by Hiro Yamagata captures the imagination like few vehicles can. Proudly displayed as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, this one-of-a-kind work is more than a car—it's a rolling canvas born from the mind of one of the world's most vibrant contemporary artists.  One of only 1,278 Cabriolet A models bodied by Sindelfingen between 1951 and 1955, this particular chassis, 3503688, was hand-selected by Hiro Yamagata for his celebrated Earthly Paradise series. In preparation for its transformation, the car was meticulously refurbished in 1996 before being coated in a roughened matte white acrylic, ready for Yamagata's vivid brushstrokes. Inspired by the natural beauty of Fiji, Yamagata adorned the car with a midnight blue base and intricate, tropical-themed imagery, including a Scarlet Macaw on the hood, a peacock along the rear bodywork, vibrant hibiscus flowers, palm trees, a rainbow, and a burst of multicolored birds. His signature graces the left-rear fender, marking it unmistakably as a piece of living art.  Earthly Paradise debuted at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery in 1994 and captivated audiences in museums across Los Angeles, Austria, Italy, and Japan. Out of the 24 cars envisioned for the series, only a select few were completed, making this 220A an exceptionally rare and significant artifact.  Beneath its artistic exterior lies the engineering excellence of the W187 platform, featuring a 2.2-liter M180 inline-six engine producing 80 horsepower, paired with a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Luxurious details such as a three-piece fitted luggage set in the trunk, VDO instrumentation framed by a three-spoke steering wheel, and classic Mercedes-Benz craftsmanship reinforce that this is as much a car as it is a creation.  Today, the 1954 Mercedes-Benz 220A Cabriolet art car stands as a celebration of creativity, beauty, and engineering—a vibrant reminder that even the finest machines can be reborn as masterpieces.
