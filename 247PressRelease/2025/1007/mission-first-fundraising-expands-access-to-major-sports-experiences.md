# Mission First Fundraising Expands Access to Major Sports Experiences

ROCKFORD, IL, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Earlier this year, Mission First Fundraising embarked on a bold mission to bring more sports experiences to donors at fundraising events. As a result, Mission First Fundraising has created a set of experiences that bring donors and fans closer to the game than ever before.  Often, the challenge with many non-profits who are looking to raise money at special events are challenged to gain access to sports experiences that are unique, one-of-a-kind, exciting experiences that otherwise cannot be accessed. If you offer two tickets to a game, how does that motivate any donor or fan to bid or donate to your mission for something they can get on their own?  Leveraging key partnerships around the industry, Mission First has now developed several packaged offerings that can bring those unique experiences to their donors. In a competitive space where fundraising dollars are coveted, each non-profit is looking for those opportunities to stand out and get the donors a reason to engage.  Mission First Fundraising offers a variety of vacation experiences around the globe, as well as culinary and cuisine experiences, concert and entertainment experiences, for both couples and families. Many of these are standard fare at a fundraising event and have brought additional fundraising dollars to events around the world. To date, over 10,000 non-profits have utilized Mission First experiences to augment their fundraising success, often doubling their return on investment as a result.  Now, Mission First is leading the way with popular sports packages that elevate the donor experience beyond what they can achieve on their own, such as:  In the Pits Experience – imagine being at the Indy 500 with garage and pit access, getting a chance to meet your favorite driver and his crew. Add start/finish line seats and all-inclusive food and beverage, this is an experience that is on many bucket lists.  Behind the Plate Experience – next season, you can be attending a baseball game to watch your favorite team at some of the most iconic baseball venues, such as Yankee Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Wrigley Field, and Truist Park, home of the Atlanta Braves. Getting seats behind the plate, and getting first class service, all food and beverage makes this experience another must have for any fundraising event!  FIFA World Cup 2026 – getting tickets to the hottest tournament in sports can be a challenge, but with Mission First Fundraising, you can get access to tickets to any of the venues for the qualifying rounds. Add in hotel stays and amenities, and you are able to follow your favorite team in style!  Sunday at the Masters – the Masters is the ultimate golf experience for any purist, so getting a chance to see this year's champion crowned, getting to watch the top players in the world navigate 'Amen Corner' is as exciting as it gets!
