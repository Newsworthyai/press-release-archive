LONDON, ENGLAND, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Quirkitude, a wellness brand dedicated to supporting neurodivergent individuals with natural alternatives to conventional medications, is proud to announce the release of "Ancient Herbal Remedies for Stress, Anxiety, and Neurodivergent Balance" by author Eleye Abdi.  This transformative book blends time-honored ancestral wisdom with cutting-edge scientific research, offering practical tools, herbal remedies, and personal stories to help readers achieve emotional balance, cognitive clarity, and sensory support.  Drawing from Eleye's own journey of overcoming anxiety, depression, and the challenges of neurodivergence, the book serves as a compassionate roadmap for those seeking to reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals. Inspired by the author's grandmother's herbal practices and a deep respect for cultural healing traditions, it explores remedies like ashwagandha, lavender, and valerian root, rooted in ancient systems such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine.  The book addresses the growing demand for holistic mental health strategies, particularly among neurodivergent communities facing sensory sensitivities, focus challenges, and emotional overwhelm. It highlights how these natural approaches can foster inclusivity and dialogue around neurodivergence, creating opportunities for self-discovery and empowerment.  As noted in The New York Today, supplements like valerian root can reduce "levels of anxiety and stress," while lavender oil is recognized for being "calming for body and mind."  Abdi's work builds on such insights, providing evidence-informed remedies backed by modern studies, while emphasizing ethical sourcing and sustainable practices.
