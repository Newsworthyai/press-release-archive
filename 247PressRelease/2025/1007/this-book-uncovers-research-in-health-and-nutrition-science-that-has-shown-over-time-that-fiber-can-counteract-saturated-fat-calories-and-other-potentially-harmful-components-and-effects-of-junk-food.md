# This Book Uncovers Research in Health and Nutrition Science That Has Shown Over Time That Fiber Can Counteract Saturated Fat, Calories and Other Potentially Harmful Components and Effects of Junk Food

CHICAGO, IL, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Research in health and nutrition science published in scientific journals has shown that a diet high in fiber, antioxidants and other essential nutrients can mitigate the health risks associated with junk food by counteracting the physiological effects of saturated fat, calories and other potentially harmful components and effects of junk food. This is a less restrictive approach to controlling cholesterol and weight, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases in healthy individuals with no history of chronic, debilitating illnesses and/or binge-eating disorders — and is uncovered in the book Counteract the Fat: How Scientific Studies Have Shown That Fiber and Antioxidants Can Counteract the Physiological Effects of Junk Food and Promote Cholesterol and Weight Control With Less Restriction by DéShond L Barnes — ISBN: 9798398923704. Complimentary review copies will be sent to journalists, editors and other members of the media upon request. With one exception, this research has been ongoing since the 1990s and has been conducted by a number of research teams at various research centers and institutions across America and abroad. Indeed the research goes back more than two decades, and is the type of health and nutrition science research that you can TRUST.
