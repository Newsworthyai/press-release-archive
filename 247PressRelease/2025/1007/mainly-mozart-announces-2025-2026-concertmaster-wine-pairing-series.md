# Mainly Mozart Announces 2025/2026 Concertmaster Wine Pairing Series

SAN DIEGO, CA, October 07, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Mainly Mozart – the San Diego nonprofit behind the acclaimed Mainly Mozart All-Star Orchestra Festival – today announced the return of its Wine Pairing Series, following the enthusiastic response to its 2024 debut. Presented by Jean-Charles Boisett Wineries, this year's series features four concertmasters across four weekends of performances, an expansion from last year's three, and adds Saturday concerts alongside Sundays. The series will again be hosted at the Fairbanks Ranch Country Club.  The 2025/2026 series showcases four of America's leading concertmasters: Jun Iwasaki of the Kansas City Symphony (Nov. 15–16, 2025), Nurit Bar-Josef of the National Symphony (Jan. 10–11, 2026), Nathan Cole of the Boston Symphony (Feb. 21–22, 2026), and Frank Huang of the New York Philharmonic (April 11–12, 2026).   The Mainly Mozart Wine Pairing Series events begin with an open hors d'oeuvres reception before audiences are seated for an intimate concert and tasting experience. Each piece on the program is paired with curated wines, chosen to mirror the style and emotion of the music. Wines are poured and selection commentary is provided before each musical work, setting the stage for a multi-sensory experience.   "It's not every day you get to enjoy a glass of wine inspired by the music you're hearing in the moment," said Nancy Laturno, Mainly Mozart Co-Founder and CEO. "We loved this idea, and the enthusiastic response from attendees encouraged us to expand the series this year — adding Saturday concerts and a fourth concertmaster. The wine selections are exceptional on their own, but paired with the music, they elevate both the flavor and the experience."  Tickets are available at www.mainlymozart.org/wine-series. Seating is limited and early purchase is recommended.  2025/2026 Wine Pairing Series Lineup  Kansas City Symphony November 15 and 16, 2025 Jun Iwasaki, Concertmaster Sean Chen, Piano  National Symphony January 10 and 11, 2026 Nurit Bar-Josef, Concertmaster Loewi Lin, Cello Erich Heckscher, Bassoon  Boston Symphony February 21 and 22, 2026 Nathan Cole, Concertmaster Steve Ansell, Principal Viola Blaise Dejardin, Principal Cello  New York Philharmonic April 11 and 12, 2026 Frank Huang, Concertmaster Cynthia Phelps, Principal Viola  Concert Times Saturdays: 5:00 PM Wine Reception | 6:00 PM Wine Pairing Event Begins Sundays: 4:00 PM Wine Reception | 5:00 PM Wine Pairing Event Begins  About Mainly Mozart Since 1988, Mainly Mozart has brought the San Diego community together to experience the finest in orchestral music, intimate concert experiences and extraordinary music education for young people through the Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra and its string programs.
