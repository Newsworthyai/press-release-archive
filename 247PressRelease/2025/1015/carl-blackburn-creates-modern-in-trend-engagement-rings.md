# Carl Blackburn Creates Modern, In-Trend Engagement Rings

SAN DIEGO, CA, October 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Long celebrated for his vintage-inspired engagement rings, La Jolla jewelry designer Carl Blackburn is redefining his signature style with a new focus on modern, in-trend engagement rings that reflect the individuality of today's couples.   Drawing on decades of estate-jewelry expertise, Blackburn's latest designs unite contemporary aesthetics with the enduring craftsmanship that has made C. Blackburn Jewelers a leading destination for custom engagement rings in La Jolla, San Diego.  The shift marks an evolution for a designer best known for Edwardian style filigree and Art Deco inspired jewelry. "Vintage design will always be part of my DNA," Blackburn says, "but many of my clients today want something sleek, architectural, and modern. What makes this exciting is that the precision required in antique jewelry is the same precision modern minimalism demands."  Blackburn's new custom rings often incorporate the top bridal trends of 2025. Multi-stone rings and bold side accents offer statement appeal. Unique shapes (marquise, pear, Asscher, and emerald cuts) can be oriented east-west for a contemporary edge. Minimalist solitaires conceal hidden halos and petal-shaped prongs, while mixed metals and textured finishes add warmth and individuality.   Colored gemstones such as sapphires, morganite, and fancy diamonds continue to rise in popularity, chosen for their symbolism and distinctive character. For the more adventurous, Blackburn explores asymmetrical and tension-set designs in platinum, rose gold, and other premium metals — pieces that blur the line between fine jewelry and wearable art.  Open Band Wedding Rings & Spacer Bands  Among the modern trends Carl Blackburn has embraced are open band wedding rings and spacer bands, two styles now popular with contemporary brides. The open band, designed with an intentional gap, frames the engagement diamond without enclosing it, preserving the stone's silhouette while symbolizing space and growth within marriage.   The spacer band, a slim ring worn between the engagement and wedding rings, ensures a flush, comfortable fit and prevents gemstones from rubbing. Each band is custom-made to complement the height and contour of the engagement ring, creating a seamless, balanced stack that reflects modern simplicity and technical refinement.  A Collaborative Process  Behind every design is a collaborative process that merges artistry with technology. Blackburn personally oversees each project in partnership with leading California jewelry artisans. Every custom ring begins with a private consultation — either in the La Jolla studio or virtually — where clients share ideas, inspiration, and budget.  Advanced CAD (Computer-Aided Design) modeling and photorealistic renderings allow clients to preview their ring from all angles before production. Unlike most jewelers who provide only four still images of the CAD design (top, front, angle, and side), Blackburn takes the process much further.   Clients first receive a 30-second photorealistic CAD render video showing their ring in full 360-degree rotation lying down and standing upright, revealing every angle of the design. Once this video is approved, a resin model prototype of the ring is created, allowing the client to try it on, place their actual stone(s), and examine every specification, angle, and detail before the final piece is cast in precious metal.  This multi-stage design verification process — from CAD video to photorealistic render to resin model — is a level of service currently unmatched by any other custom jeweler in Southern California. It ensures that clients are never left guessing and are consistently "pleasantly surprised" by how closely the final piece matches their expectations. This meticulous approach virtually eliminates the possibility of disappointment and has become a hallmark of C. Blackburn Jewelers' bespoke experience.  Affordability & Tradition  Carl Blackburn's approach also reflects a commitment to affordability and tradition. The designer regularly incorporates heirloom gemstones, giving clients an ethical way to honor their heritage while creating something new. He sources each diamond or colored gemstone himself—whether natural or lab-grown—to ensure both beauty and value.   Clients often describe working with Blackburn as refreshingly personal. Consultations are informal yet professional, with clear guidance, realistic timelines, and honest budget discussions. Many note the contrast between C. Blackburn Jewelers' welcoming studio and the impersonal atmosphere of large jewelry chains.   As one client shared in a recent review, "Carl guided us through every step. The process was collaborative and transparent—and the ring turned out even better than we imagined."  By blending modern design with traditional artistry, Carl Blackburn is bridging eras in San Diego's jewelry scene. His latest engagement rings and wedding bands embody both contemporary elegance and the timeless values of integrity and craftsmanship.   For couples seeking a custom engagement ring in La Jolla or anywhere across San Diego County, Carl Blackburn offers something rare: a modern designer with a heritage heart.
