# Award Winning Author Sid Nachman Announces New Book, Inside Bugsy Moran

WILMINGTON, NC, October 15, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Award-winning author Sid Nachman has announced the release of a new book, 'Inside Bugsy Moran'. The new book is the story of a boy who grows up not knowing who or what he is. That doesn't stop him, at least in his mind, from becoming a Jewish Huckleberry Finn and Jiminy Cricket with a smidge of Captain Marvel thrown in at no extra charge. He loves to tell you, "I'm Bugsy Moran and don't you forget it! I can leap over one-story buildings, jump over small puddles, and beat up anyone who gets in my way!"  Don't let Bugsy's bravado fool you, because Bugsy's a God-fearing man with a good heart. You may hate him, love him, or feel something in between, but you'll never get bored following Bugsy on his great adventures.  The booklet is available at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Sid-Nachman/author/B007EE5NGQ?.  Sid Nachman is a writer who is known for his acerbic wit and his ability to knock readers to the floor in fits of laughter. His writing style is unlike any other. He is especially adept at creating works that center around his Jewish upbringing, spinning tales that seem too funny to be true - but they are.  He recently released a new travel book entitled, 'Take a Trip with Morris the Trailer and Two Fruitcakes Down the Yellow Brick Road'. While his road trip with his wife and a talking trailer does not take him to Kansas, it does take him nearly everywhere else - or so it seems.  In this new book, readers can discover customs and cultures they never knew existed. Get sage and oregano advice from Morris, who rarely stops talking. Share the absurd thoughts in the minds of Sammy and Libby, the two other main characters in this travelogue. This trip was the dream of a lifetime for all three of them. It actually happened, something few of us will ever experience. Readers can just sit back, relax, and enjoy their great adventure.  'Bipolar Me' provides an insightful and captivating glimpse into the day-to-day experience of a man who dealt with this condition - during a time when this type of affliction might be diagnosed as a form of schizophrenia. In those days the treatment might involve electric shock treatment or, in severe cases, being locked away.  'Bipolar Me' has garnered high praise from readers and reviewers alike. Sid's no-holds-barred writing style produces a work that is filled with hilarious stories that show us that life is just plain good. It is a highly entertaining memoir that allows readers a glimpse into the unfettered mind of a bipolar boy who never grows up until his hair turns white. Readers will get to see his world in black and white and vivid color and will feel what he feels when he feels like he weighs three thousand pounds and a minute later can leap over tall buildings. Sid's life is a life gone wild that settles down only when it's almost too late.  Sid's first book, 'Strictly For Seniors' is a nonfiction work of short stories about what happened to Sid "after breakfast on Delancey Street" in West Philly during the 30's and 40's when his Mom gave him a big hug and kiss and sent him on his way. Sid had great fun, survived bullying by hitting the bigger boys about the head with his violin case and developed his own singular brand of "street smarts".  He also published 'Leena â€“ An Abused Bruised and Bloodied Woman', a true account of a little girl who climbs out of mind-boggling mental and physical abuse, faces prejudice and misunderstanding as an adult, knocks the chip off her shoulder and leads a normal and healthy life.  Nachman's books have received fantastic reviews. One stated, "Like James Joyce, Sid Nachman can take the ordinary and turn it into magic with a fluency that's imperceptible." Another said "Sid's stories touch the human soul with wit, charm and realism."

About Sid Nachman:  Sid Nachman was the only child of immigrant parents from Russia and Germany who tried for 13 years to have him and were very tired from trying so hard. His initials are S.I.N. for Sidney Irving Nachman. He never found out if he was a sin or a joy. Sid resides in Florida with his wife, Linda and his new Shih Tzu puppies Shayna and Maylee, and in spite of his big mouth is still loved by all.
