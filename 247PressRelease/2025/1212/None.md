# PG&amp;E Gas Explosion Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Announce a New Gas Explosion Hotline at (833) 200-7111

OAKLAND, CA, December 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- PG&E gas line explosion lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are announcing a Gas Line Explosion Victim Hotline for people affected by the underground gas line explosion that occurred in Hayward, CA, on December 11, 2025. The Alameda Fire Department was already dispatched to the area early on Thursday morning due to reports of a gas leak, but they were cleared by PG&E over an hour and a half prior to the explosion, according to officials. As a result of the blast, one house was completely destroyed, and several nearby homes were damaged by the PG&E underground gas pipeline explosion.  Personal injury lawyers at The Wagner Law Group confirm that at least six people were transported to trauma centers in the Bay Area, and most are expected to survive. An entire block of the Hayward neighborhood was affected by the blast. Several homes had windows blown out due to the impact of the underground gas line explosion. "PG&E doesn't do enough to maintain its outdated gas line infrastructure," says Butch Wagner of The Wagner Law Group.  PG&E underground gas line explosions are usually caused by breaches in the gas pipe infrastructure. PG&E has gas leak detection technology to help employees detect leaks, but not enough resources are being dedicated to maintaining public safety. "This tragedy may have likely been avoided if more resources were dedicated to inspecting current gas line infrastructure," says Wagner. Accident lawyers at The Wagner Law Group can help explosion victims recover damages.  Alameda County Fire Department crews were dispatched to the 800 block of East Lewelling Blvd. for reports of a natural gas leak. Firefighters arrived on scene at 7:50 a.m., officials said they were cleared by PG&E crews at 7:55 a.m., and at 9:38 a.m., Alameda County firefighters were called back out to the same location after the gas explosion occurred. "This type of negligence is unparalleled. PG&E crews cleared the area, and then there was an explosion," says Wagner. Accident attorneys at The Wagner Law Group have a proven track record of holding PG&E accountable for the harm they cause to people, property, and communities.  The Wagner Law Group has been very successful in recovering damages for victims affected by PG&E's negligence. With over $300 million recovered for accident victims, The Wagner Law Group is recognized as a premier law firm for victims of PG&E fires and explosions. "We encourage anyone affected by the PG&E underground gas explosion in Hayward to call the Gas Line Explosion Victim Hotline," says Wagner.
