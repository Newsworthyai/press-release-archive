# KODA Entertainment Presents Poof!

LOS ANGELES, CA, December 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- KODA Entertainment has announced Poof!, a visually arresting feature film written and directed by Student Emmy nominated filmmaker Rohit Relan and starring Kranthi Nag. Blending existential fantasy with silent-era storytelling, Poof! is a melancholic, fable-like exploration of loneliness, fixation, and the fragile boundaries of love.  Set in an isolated, decaying bed-and-breakfast, Poof! centers on a man aching for connection, whose solitude is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious, silent figure wrapped in white bandages. What begins as a fragile companionship unfolds through gesture, rhythm, and shared space rather than words. Poof! is a silent film that unfolds through expressive physical performance and bold visual design, evoking a heightened, dreamlike tone drawn from silent cinema and theatrical ritual.   The film stars Kranthi Nag and is written and directed by Rohit Relan, with Simran Sawhney serving as the director of photography, alongside production designer Bala Govind Kumar and editor Adhyaksh Amarnath. Poof! as a meditation on the human need to be seen, and the panic that can arise when we finally are. Rather than offering comfort or resolution, the film leans into surrender, asking what happens when love is pushed too far, and when intimacy becomes a demand rather than a gift.  Produced under the banner of KODA Entertainment, Poof! is scheduled to begin filming in fall 2026, continuing the company's commitment to emotionally resonant, performance driven storytelling that challenges conventional narrative form. The film is positioned for major festival exhibition and curated screenings, aimed at audiences drawn to bold, unconventional cinema.  Founded in Los Angeles, KODA Entertainment is a full-service film production company focused on performance-driven, original storytelling. The company develops and produces feature films, series, commercials, and music videos with an emphasis on cinematic craft, emotional precision, and actor-led narratives.  KODA's slate includes Chop Chop, written and directed by Rohit Relan and starring Kranthi Nag, which earned Best of Fest, Best Screenplay, and Best Acting at the 3x5 Film Festival in Los Angeles and was later acquired by KODA Entertainment for global distribution. The company continues to champion bold, character-driven projects and collaborates with select filmmakers and performers whose work aligns with its creative ethos.
