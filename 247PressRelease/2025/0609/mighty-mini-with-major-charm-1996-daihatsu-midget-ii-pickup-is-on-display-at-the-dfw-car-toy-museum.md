FORT WORTH, TX, June 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- It's small, silver, and stealing the spotlight at the DFW Car & Toy Museum. The 1996 Daihatsu Midget II RHD Pickup is one of the latest additions to the celebrated Ron Sturgeon Collection, offering visitors a delightful glimpse into Japan's micro-truck innovation—now road-legal in Texas.  This compact yet capable right-hand drive (RHD) pickup features a 659 cc, 3-cylinder, water-cooled inline engine paired with a 4-speed manual transmission. With just 56,717 kilometers (35,242 miles) on the odometer, this Midget II is a rare find that effortlessly blends quirky retro styling with practical utility.

"Micro-trucks like the Midget II are cult classics in Japan, and now they're gaining a following in the U.S.—especially since Texas changed its laws," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the museum. "This one turns heads every time, and now, it can legally hit the road."
