# A Must-Read Book for Young People Worldwide Has Arrived — Inclusionism: Finally! Offers a Radical Economic Shift

CHICAGO, IL, May 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A bold new book is sending ripples through global economic and policy circles. "Inclusionism: Finally! A Blueprint for the Bold Transformation of Capitalism" has just been released, delivering a powerful wake-up call to the generation that will inherit the world's systems—and a framework to help reshape them.  Co-authored by visionary designer MAXBRUCE and two of the world's most advanced artificial intelligences—ChatGPT and Claude—this book offers more than a critique of capitalism. It is a design for how value will likely flow in the future: through stakeholder economies, programmable equity, and systems that reward participation rather than speculation.  "We're on the verge of the greatest distribution of wealth in history," says MAXBRUCE. "It can't be said enough: 'We the people' need to be ready if we don't want the game to continue as it is. Digital and financial literacy is a must-or-bust situation. People need to know they truly have the power to change the game and no longer have to be NPCs in someone else's world. Because finally, a new system is on the horizon—one that shares growth, prosperity, and a more vibrant existence."  The book introduces a new framework powered by CETEs (Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities), a class of programmable assets designed to circulate wealth and empower everyday contributors. Backed by the Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc. (BWRCI), this framework includes regulatory governance, jurisdictional coordination, and a future-forward ecosystem for equitable value flows.  With sovereign wealth funds, policymakers, and institutional leaders increasingly seeking inclusive strategies that do not rely on redistribution, Inclusionism positions itself as a rare fusion of economic theory, technological feasibility, and moral clarity.  "The U.S. still hasn't established a sovereign wealth fund with global stakeholder ambition, and that absence is a historic opening," MAXBRUCE adds. "We're extending a hand to policymakers and people alike. The goal isn't chaos. It's a new alignment."  Designed for activists, citizens, and visionaries, the book balances high-concept economic design with grounded realism. And for young people especially, it arrives with a message of empowerment:  "You didn't break the system—but you're expected to survive it. This book is your map."  The book is now available globally, including special regional editions for the UAE, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia.
