# Fashion Designer Creates Viral Chained Prom Gown Inspired by Versace Using Only One Hand!

NEWARK, NJ, May 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fashion designer Qaysean Williams, known professionally as The One Hand Sewing Man, has captured the world's attention with a breathtaking, hand-stitched gold chain prom gown inspired by Cardi B's 2022 Met Gala Versace ensemble. Born with Erb's palsy, a condition affecting mobility in his left arm, Williams completed the gown using only his right hand—a feat that has since gone viral and earned acclaim from Cardi B.  When a client requested a recreation of Versace's iconic gown worn by Cardi B, Williams embraced the challenge. The result is an intricate showpiece featuring hundreds of hand-sewn gold chains, merging technical precision with bold, high-fashion artistry. The gown debuted online on April 25, 2025, and quickly captivated audiences internationally across TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook.  The internet responded with admiration, not only for the gown's craftsmanship but for Williams's inspiring story of talent and perseverance in the face of physical adversity. On April 29, 2025, Cardi B reposted a viral side-by-side comparison of her Met Gala look and Williams's recreation, originally shared by journalist Ken Barbie. The caption read: "This diva recreated Cardi's 2022 Versace Met Gala look for her prom and ATE!"  "Seeing Cardi B share my work was incredible validation," says Williams. "She's been a huge creative inspiration to me."  Williams first stepped into the national spotlight as a contestant on Netflix's Next In Fashion (Season 2) hosted by Gigi Hadid and Tan France. Though his run on the show was brief, his heartfelt farewell — "This is only the beginning" — has proven prophetic. Today, he leads his fashion brand Manikin as a proud and visible advocate for disability inclusion in fashion.  Next, Williams will attend Vogue Club's official Met Gala watch party: Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, which celebrates the impact of Black creativity and culture in the fashion world. "The fashion world can expect something extraordinary," Williams promises.  Manikin LLC is a fashion design house founded by Qaysean Williams, aka The One Hand Sewing Man. The company is dedicated to creating innovative, high-quality designs that push the boundaries of fashion and inclusivity. With a focus on sustainability and accessibility, Manikin LLC aims to revolutionize the fashion industry and bridge the gap between adaptive fashion and mainstream fashion.
