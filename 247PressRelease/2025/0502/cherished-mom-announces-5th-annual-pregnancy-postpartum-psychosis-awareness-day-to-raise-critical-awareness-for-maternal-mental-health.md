# Cherished Mom Announces 5th Annual Pregnancy & Postpartum Psychosis Awareness Day to Raise Critical Awareness for Maternal Mental Health

CHATTANOOGA, TN, May 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cherished Mom, a nationally recognized nonprofit organization committed to transforming the landscape of maternal mental health, has announced the 5th Annual Pregnancy & Postpartum Psychosis (PPP) Awareness Day, taking place on Friday, May 2, 2025.  Founded by Cherished Mom in 2020, Pregnancy & Postpartum Psychosis Awareness Day is an annual campaign dedicated to raising awareness and understanding of postpartum psychosis—a severe perinatal mood and anxiety disorder. Affecting 1 to 2 out of every 1,000 deliveries, postpartum psychosis can onset suddenly with symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, confusion, and rapid mood swings. Without timely intervention, PPP carries an estimated 5% suicide rate and a 4% infanticide rate, making it a critical public health concern.   "Behind these numbers are real mothers, real babies, and real families whose lives have been forever changed," said Kristina Dulaney, RN, PHM-C, founder and executive director of Cherished Mom. "Through increased awareness, education, and advocacy, we can prevent unnecessary tragedies and ensure that no mother has to suffer in silence."  Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency, but with early identification and appropriate intervention, recovery is possible. Cherished Mom's efforts seek to break the stigma, foster early diagnosis, and provide pathways to healing for mothers and families across the country.  Individuals, healthcare providers, organizations, and community partners are encouraged to participate in PPP Awareness Day by sharing educational resources that Cherished Mom has created and amplifying the message online so that greater awareness of PPP can save lives.
