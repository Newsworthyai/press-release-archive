Under the leadership of Jef Huber, Founder, President, and CEO, and Heather Faith Huber (known as Heather Viking), Club Cruise is riding the wave of the cruise industry's resurgence, with a particular focus on Viking River and Ocean Cruises.  The company has seen significant growth, with bookings trending higher than ever before. Heather Faith Huber's leadership of the Club Cruise Viking Department and her role in the strategic expansion of Viking's itineraries have contributed to the company's continued success. Huber, recently named to the prestigious 30 Under 30 list, is at the forefront of the company's growth, driving strong demand for luxury cruising experiences . "I've seen the cruise industry evolve over the years, and I'm incredibly proud of the role Club Cruise has played in that journey," said Jef Huber, Founder, President, and CEO of Club Cruise. "We've seen demand rise to unprecedented levels, especially with the expansion of Viking Cruises, and we're fully committed to continuing to offer our clients the best services and personalized cruise experiences available."  Club Cruise is experiencing record growth, particularly in corporate, incentive, and group bookings at sea, as well as meetings and conventions aboard large ships. The demand for large group events, including ship charters, is at an all-time high. With years of experience managing ship charters, Huber has positioned Club Cruise as a go-to expert for corporate retreats, incentive trips, and group cruises.  "Corporate, incentive, meetings, and conventions at sea have been a huge focus for us, and we're seeing remarkable interest in hosting these types of events on cruise ships," shared Huber. "We specialize in ship charters, which provide a completely unique and customizable experience for large groups. Whether it's a corporate retreat, a conference, or an incentive trip, we're here to make it an unforgettable experience."  Huber continued, "Ship charters, in particular, have been a major focus for us. These fully private, bespoke experiences allow our clients to control every aspect of their voyage, from the itinerary to the onboard activities. It's truly an unparalleled offering, and we're seeing more businesses and organizations take advantage of this exclusive service. The ability to create a completely tailored experience for their team, clients, or partners is a game changer."

So, if you're not shy and are up for being made a fool on reality TV, we can connect you with Below Deck charters—perfect for those looking for a fun and unique experience on the water. "It's a great way to mix luxury cruising with some TV excitement!" said Huber. "If you're up for a little adventure and some reality TV fun, we've got the charters for you!"  One loyal passenger, Frank from Lincoln Hills, has been enjoying World Cruises with Club Cruise for years. Now in his 90s, Frank has made countless memories traveling with both of his sons. "It's been a privilege to experience the world with my family, and Club Cruise has always made our travels seamless," Frank shared. "Last year, we had an unforgettable trip to Rome, and this year, we're exploring New Zealand together. The best part is being able to continue these journeys, even at my age. Club Cruise has been there every step of the way, and I know we'll be cruising for many more years."  Heather Faith Huber, "Heather Viking," Driving Growth and Innovation in the Club Cruise Viking Department  In the midst of these exciting trends, Club Cruise is proud to highlight the accomplishments of Heather Faith Huber, a driving force behind the company's incredible growth. Known in the industry as Heather Viking, Heather was recently named to the prestigious 30 Under 30 list, recognizing her leadership and innovation in the luxury travel industry. Heather's vision and strategic marketing efforts have played a key role in the expansion of Club Cruise's Viking Cruises portfolio, as well as the rise in demand for both Viking River and Ocean Cruises.  As the head of the Club Cruise Viking Department, Heather has been instrumental in the company's success, overseeing growth in Viking bookings and developing relationships with the cruise line that have allowed Club Cruise to offer exclusive access to Viking's world-class itineraries. Under her leadership, Club Cruise is seeing a major uptick in Viking bookings for 2025 and beyond, as well as a growing interest in Viking's expanding fleet of ships.  Heather shared, "The demand for Viking Cruises has never been higher, and I'm proud to lead our Viking Department as we continue to offer our clients the best in river and ocean cruising. With Viking's commitment to expanding their fleet and their focus on providing exceptional travel experiences, it's no surprise that so many of our clients are choosing Viking for their next journey. Our team is here to ensure that every Viking cruise is a seamless and unforgettable experience."  Heather's role in the company's growth extends beyond just booking and reservations. Her strategic marketing initiatives, including collaborations with Viking to create exclusive offers, have helped raise awareness of Club Cruise's offerings, making it a top choice for luxury cruise bookings.  "We are seeing amazing growth in bookings, especially for 2025-2027," Heather added. "I'm incredibly excited about what's ahead for Club Cruise and our clients. The demand is growing, and we're riding the wave of Viking's expansion as we continue to offer exceptional travel experiences for new and returning cruisers alike."  Royal Caribbean's Record-Breaking Sales Boost Industry Confidence  Club Cruise's growth is also buoyed by the outstanding performance of Royal Caribbean Cruises, with record-breaking sales and bookings for the first quarter of 2025. Ginny Tujague, Royal Caribbean Cruises' Northern California Business Development Representative, shared, "We've set all-time highs in sales and bookings for the first quarter of 2025. The cruise industry is experiencing an extraordinary surge in demand, and it's clear that travelers are more eager than ever to get back on the water. The optimism in the market is unmatched, and we are excited about the continued recovery and growth."  Reflecting on the broader cruise market, Huber added, "The demand for cruises has never been higher, and this is the perfect time for Club Cruise to help our clients navigate this incredible growth. The cruise industry has proven its resilience, rebounding from both the 9/11 tragedy and the COVID pandemic, and now it's stronger than ever. With incredible new ships, expanded itineraries, and a growing global appetite for travel, we're ready to help more travelers explore the world than ever before."  While current movements and changes in the U.S. appear to have some reversing effects on global travel, the desire to travel internationally has never been stronger. More and more travelers are eager to get abroad, with bucket lists spilling over and a renewed sense of urgency to experience the world like never before. As "Father Time" knocks at the door, many are realizing that it's no longer about spreading out those dreams over many years. It's about emptying that bucket list and checking off those travel goals by taking multiple trips within a year—seizing the moment and embracing the luxury of travel now.  With inventory across popular cruise lines like Viking and Royal Caribbean beginning to deplete and per diem pricing increasing, the window of opportunity to book the best cruise vacations is shrinking. Club Cruise is encouraging all travelers to book their dream cruises for 2025 and beyond as soon as possible to secure the best cabins and itineraries. With decades of expertise, Club Cruise offers exclusive access to top-tier cruise lines, ensuring clients receive the best service and value.  "We're seeing so much optimism in the market, not just for Viking but for the entire cruise industry," Heather added. "With Viking's commitment to expanding its fleet and offering new, immersive experiences, there's never been a better time to book a river or ocean cruise. Whether you're looking to explore the ancient wonders of the Mediterranean, sail the scenic rivers of Europe, or embark on a bucket-list adventure to Alaska, Club Cruise is here to make those dreams a reality."  In addition to Viking, Club Cruise is seeing a rise in demand for Royal Caribbean's newest offerings, with travelers eager to experience the innovative ships and exciting itineraries. With Royal Caribbean's expansion, including the addition of new ships to its fleet and a growing global presence, Club Cruise is poised to lead the charge in booking extraordinary vacation experiences . As the cruise industry heads into an exciting new era, Club Cruise remains committed to providing exceptional travel experiences to its clients. The team's dedication to curating personalized, unforgettable vacations, combined with their strong relationships with top cruise lines like Viking and Royal Caribbean, positions Club Cruise as a leader in the industry.
