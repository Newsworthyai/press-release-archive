# Renowned Geneticist, Dr. David E. Comings Urges U.S. Leaders to Embrace Science and Act Decisively on the Climate Crisis

NEWPORT BEACH, CA, May 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. David E. Comings, a respected geneticist and founder of The Comings Foundation, is issuing a stark warning to U.S. leaders: the world is nearing an environmental point of no return, and it's time for the United States to lead a bold new chapter in combating climate change. In his recent book, If I Were a Billionaire, These are Four Things I Would do to Combat Global Warming and Help Save the Planet. In The Science of Global Warming he outlines in urgent detail the science showing that climate change is real and if steps are not taken to combat it, it will get progressively worse and more deadly. The book is currently available on Amazon and soon will be in bookstores and libraries.  There are two major scientifically measurable findings that drive Dr. Comings' concerns:   1. The level of atmospheric CO2 is steadily increasing from 320 ppm in 1967 to 420 ppm currently. This is not surprising given that fact that we have not yet reached Net Zero, the point at which we no longer emit greenhouse gases. What is surprising and extremely concerning, is that in addition to the amount, the rate of increase is also progressively increasing from 1.0 ppm per year in 1967 to 2.8 ppm pe year in 2023.   2. This is probably due to the earth's massive heat imbalance. That is the ratio of the amount of the sun's heat that is retained by the earth versus the amount that is reflected back into space. This is driven by the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the loss of the earth albedo (reflectivity) from the melting of glaciers and sea ice. The heat imbalance is currently equivalent to 432,000 Hiroshima type atom bombs going off in the ocean each day! This not surprisingly, heats the ocean causing it to release its stored CO2. This increases the greenhouse effect leading to greater heat imbalance, producing a deadly feedback loop that can only be eliminated by the removal of atmospheric CO2.  His call to action is directed squarely at the Trump administration and current members of Congress, urging them to rise above partisan gridlock and act decisively.  Dr. Comings explains: "What's needed now is aggressive, immediate intervention—and that means removing CO₂ from the atmosphere on a scale we've never attempted before."   He proposes four different science-driven, scalable strategies to combat global warming including:  • Repairing the earth's lost albedo to help decrease the earth's huge heat imbalance.  • The use of hundreds of catamarans equipped with technology to remove and sequester the ocean's CO2 and combat ocean acidification.  • The use of enhanced weathering through deployment of minerals like olivine that naturally absorb CO2 and safely store it above ground in mineral form. By using inexpensive drones to spread crushed olivine, the average citizen can participate in the process of removing atmospheric CO2.  • By using updated and more effective adsorbents, remove CO2 from the atmosphere and safely store it in mineralized form in basalt formations. It has been suggested that this approach, called in situ sequestration, if used worldwide, has the capacity to sequester trillions of tons of CO2.   "We already possess the technologies. What we lack is the political will to prioritize saving the planet," says Dr. Comings. "The Trump administration has the chance to surprise the world—by pairing conservative leadership with cutting-edge environmental action."   Dr. Comings plans to send his report directly to every member of Congress and the White House, making it clear that climate leadership must transcend political ideology. In a historic moment when the nation is divided on many fronts, he believes restoring the Earth's atmosphere could become a unifying priority.  "President Trump has always promoted American exceptionalism. Well, this is their opportunity to be exceptional—not just economically, but ecologically," Dr. Comings asserts. "We can lead a global restoration effort that secures our children's future."  He recommends the creation of a National Climate Restoration Office, increased funding for CDR pilot projects, and a bipartisan legislative commitment to carbon removal as a complement—not a substitute—to emissions reduction.  The Comings Foundation's work goes far beyond academic theory. With a mission rooted in making climate science actionable and accessible, the foundation offers free educational materials and policy guidance. Dr. Comings hopes this will spark a new generation of environmental thinkers and problem-solvers—regardless of political affiliation.

Today, he applies that same rigor and passion to climate change.  "Just like in medicine, prevention is more effective than treatment—but we've passed the stage of prevention. Now, it's time to reverse the damage, boldly and intelligently," he says.  "We are not helpless, and we are not too late. But we must stop waiting for consensus and start executing solutions. I believe this administration has a unique opportunity to lead us into an era of restoration."  Media Contact: www.TheComingsFoundation.org
