# International Crisis Management Group and Response24 launch Response24 Connect, transforming Crisis Management and Response for the Insurance Market

NEW YORK, NY, July 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With decades of experience across both companies helping organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from critical incidents on a global basis, Response24 Ltd and International Crisis Management Group (ICMG) have joined forces to launch Response24 Connect, a new venture designed to enhance risk communication between insureds and their crisis management consultants through a state-of-the-art tech-based interface.  From policy inception, insureds will be able to access bespoke risk intelligence, configure real time alerts, access document templates, arrange online consultations and summon urgent assistance in the event of a critical incident, all via an app on their smartphones. An integrated geo-location function will pinpoint the precise location of victims of critical incidents and enable swift and effective response, vital in cases of war, terrorism or natural disaster where evacuation and repatriation may be required. Response24 Connect will also enable ready access to complex risk assessments and specialist security consultancy, thereby offering the full spectrum of security risk management disciplines through a greatly enhanced customer service delivery mechanism.  Whilst Response24 Connect will be accessible to all insureds as an added benefit to their insurance policy, it will be of particular value to mid-market companies and private clients without ready access to in-house crisis management resources.  Erika Koutrakis, CEO of ICMG said, "Through this new and exciting venture, we're delighted to be aligning with such a well-respected team in the London market. In a period of significant geopolitical instability, we know that organizations are looking for partners to help them navigate uncertainty; so by connecting our skill sets in this way, we can now offer our combined client base comprehensive solutions to a range of complex issues."  Rupert Reid, CEO of Response24 Connect added: "With its long-established presence in the US market, the ICMG leadership team brings with it a wealth of operational experience and a deep understanding of the security risk management discipline; so our insurance market clients will benefit from our combined experience in this increasingly challenging field, delivered through our innovative tech platform. We are also delighted to welcome Chris Holt, a seasoned and much respected insurance market operator, who joins the Response24 Connect Board to advise on our strategic initiatives going forward."
