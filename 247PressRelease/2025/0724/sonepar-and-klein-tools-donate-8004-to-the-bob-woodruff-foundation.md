# Sonepar and Klein Tools Donate $8,004 to the Bob Woodruff Foundation

CHARLESTON, SC, July 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sonepar and Klein Tools are proud to donate $8,004 to the Bob Woodruff Foundation as part of a collaborative initiative supporting veterans. This contribution marks the culmination of the program's inaugural year, during which a portion of proceeds from each sale of custom Klein Tools pliers was directed to the foundation. These funds help support vital programs for wounded veterans and their families. The limited-edition lineman's pliers, engraved with the American flag, are available exclusively through Sonepar company branches and websites.  "Sonepar and Klein Tools are proving once again that they have the backs of our nation's heroes," said Anne Marie Dougherty, CEO of the Bob Woodruff Foundation. "Our partnership with these great companies has allowed us to fund critical veterans services programs providing housing assistance, mental health care, and job training in communities across America. We are so excited for what the second year of our campaign will mean for our military veterans and their families."  The joint program launched on Veterans Day in 2024 and will continue as an annual partnership to show appreciation for the military community. The patriotic plier design is also a nod to Klein Tools' iconic American-made products.   "We're proud to make this donation to the Bob Woodruff Foundation, which provides aid to the military families who've made so many sacrifices to our country," said Bill Mortimer, Director of Strategic Vendor Engagement for Sonepar. "The partnership between Sonepar, Klein Tools and the Bob Woodruff Foundation is one we hope to grow in the years to come."  As part of Sonepar's larger commitment to the military community, the company has established more than 25 partnerships with military-focused organizations to help integrate veterans, reservists, and military spouses into its workforce. Over the past two years, Sonepar representatives have participated in more than 300 veteran-focused recruiting events, contributing to an increase in military hires. Internally, the Military and Veterans Employee Resource Group (MERGE) provides a strong support network, fostering connection and belonging among its members.
