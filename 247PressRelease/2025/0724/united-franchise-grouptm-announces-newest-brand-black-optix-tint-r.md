# United Franchise Group™ Announces Newest Brand, Black Optix Tint®

WEST PALM BEACH, FL, July 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Black Optix Tint®, a fast-growing franchise specializing in upscale auto styling and window tinting services, has joined United Franchise Group™ (UFG), a global leader in franchising. UFG partnered with Black Optix Tint to build and diversify its Starpoint Brands division, which includes Signarama, the world's leading sign franchise, and Fully Promoted, a top provider of promotional products and marketing solutions.  Black Optix Tint was founded in 2014 by entrepreneur Randal Moore, who opened a single auto styling shop in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. He quickly led it to become the area's No. 1 auto tinting company. Moore built it into a multimillion-dollar franchise with the help of Accurate Franchise, Inc. (AFI), a UFG affiliated company that guides emerging brands through the complex journey of franchising.   Today, Black Optix Tint has 27 active franchises in 52 territories in Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and Utah. It offers a wide range of products and services, including vehicle wraps, paint protection film, auto accessories, ceramic coating and both commercial and residential tinting solutions.   "I'm thrilled to be part of the UFG and Starpoint Brands family," said Moore, who will remain involved with the brand. "They have so much experience and so many resources to support us, but more importantly, they truly understand the entrepreneur's experience and believe their success comes from our success. Joining them was one of the easiest decisions I've ever made." Moore began working with AFI in 2023. The firm introduced him to UFG Founder and CEO Ray Titus, who was impressed by the franchise's business model and achievements and decided to bring it into the UFG family.   "With its incredible growth, dedication to quality and value, and firm roots in the community, Black Optix Tint is a strong addition to the UFG ecosystem, and we're proud to welcome Randal to our team," Titus said. "They bring something unique that we haven't offered before, while perfectly complementing our existing Starpoint Brands portfolio of brands and aligning with our belief in delivering top-notch products with unmatched customer service."  Starpoint Brands is a constellation of exceptional brands in the professional services and retail industries.
