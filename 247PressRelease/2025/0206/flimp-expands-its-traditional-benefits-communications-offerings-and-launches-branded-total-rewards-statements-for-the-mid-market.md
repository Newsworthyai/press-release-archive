"We're excited to be expanding our team and our offerings to include more traditional benefits materials to help mid-market employers better promote their total rewards investments," said Wayne Wall, CEO of Flimp. "As an extension of our clients' teams, we take benefits communications content from design to delivery. Our Total Rewards Statements help employers do just that by delivering beautifully designed, easy-to-read reports that give employees a clear view of their full compensation package—something that goes far beyond just a paycheck."  Flimp's Total Rewards Statements are completely customizable, branded to fit each company's unique culture, and individualized for every employee, allowing employers to reach them one on one with the most critical information needed to showcase their overall compensation package.  Benefits of Flimp's Total Reward Statements: • Seamless process: We make it easy with step-by-step instructions for pulling total rewards data from more than a dozen different HR/payroll systems. Statements are customizable with up to 14 benefits and five compensation categories. And they can be delivered in just two weeks.  • Increased transparency and employee engagement: Employees get a clear view of their total compensation package, increasing appreciation, retention, and affinity.  • Data-driven insights: Personalized insights for each employee that highlight benefit usage and help them take advantage of all the benefits available to them.   • Designed to match your brand: Employers choose one of Flimp's 10 style templates, or a custom design can be created to align with the organization's culture and brand.   • Secure delivery: Standard distribution includes PDF files. Alternatively, clients can also opt to deliver statements directly to employees using Flimp Connect, its HITRUST messaging platform, or via print/mail services for an additional cost.  Total Rewards Statements from Flimp are valuable to employees because they include both compensation and the company's overall employer value proposition with things like wellness benefits, career-development opportunities, time off, and other perks to support a better work-life balance.

Flimp's solutions are used by some of the world's most recognized brands including Georgetown University, NPR, Swire Coca-Cola, and Tripadvisor. The majority of clients come back year after year because they know the team at Flimp is dedicated to their success.
