# ADAP Advocacy Names William Sarraille as Special Counsel for 340B Issues

WASHINGTON, DC, February 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today announced that William "Bill" Sarraille will serve as Special Counsel on issues related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Sarraille will advise the organization, and its 340B Patient Advisory Committee, on 340B public policy, federal and state legislative and regulatory matters, and efforts to reform the program to better serve patients.  Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, summarized: "Bill's insights on the 340B Program are legendary among healthcare public policy stakeholders because he understands the legislative intent of the law, as well as current and emerging trends with the program, and why the real-life application of the program's explosive growth is not helping underserved patients. He has been yelling from the rooftop asking why sick patients are paying cost sharing amounts to enormously profitable, large 340B hospitals, some with endowments in the hundreds of millions of dollars? We share that sentiment and our alignment on the need to return the program to its original legislative intent makes this a match made in Heaven."  Bill Sarraille is widely known for his expertise in a broad array of healthcare matters, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, coverage and coding, pharmaceutical price reporting, issues related to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, clinical research issues, Stark and Anti-Kickback Law compliance, Medicare and Medicaid audits, healthcare privacy and security, and coverage for new devices and services. Bill also serves as an independent director at Kalderos, Inc. Learn more about Bill Sarraille.
