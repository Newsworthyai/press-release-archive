# SEO Consultant Damon Burton Announces Funnels SEO Training Ahead of Hosting Funnel Hacking Live Round Table

LAS VEGAS, NV, February 06, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Damon Burton, SEO to Russell Brunson, professional sports teams, and other respected businesses, is bringing his two decades of search engine optimization expertise to the public through his new Funnels SEO™ course, and hosting a round table at the industry leading event in Las Vegas, Funnel Hacking Live.   Funnel Hacking Live ("FHL") brings thousands of entrepreneurs and marketers together to learn how to build and optimize their sales funnels more effectively. This year's event will take place at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, February 12-15, 2025.   Burton's course launch coincides with Funnel Hacking Live, which has been dubbed the premier "rock concert for marketers." Damon was hand-picked to play a prominent role at the event, serving as a Round Table Host, sharing SEO strategies for ClickFunnels users.   ClickFunnels is a SaaS platform that helps businesses design and automate sales funnels through its suite of sales, marketing, e-commerce, and analytics tools. ClickFunnels was co-founded by Russell Brunson, who also leads the annual Funnel Hacking Live event.  Burton's Funnels SEO course and FHL roundtable aim to support entrepreneurs and marketers that use ClickFunnels, and are looking to diversify their opportunities using search engine optimization.  Burton will discuss:   - Why SEO doesn't have to be expensive - Why getting more organic traffic doesn't have to be hard  - How to get more traffic without bleeding money into paid ads  "Many entrepreneurs think of paid ads as the only way to generate leads. But as little as 2% of paid ads get clicked on in search engines," said Burton. "On the other hand, organic traffic drives upwards of 90% of all clicks on Google. It's not that paid ads are bad. If you're successful with them, keep paying. But SEO is an additional opportunity—a massive one— that is being overlooked."   Burton, SEO behind multiple websites of Russell Brunson made waves in the ClickFunnels community when he dispelled myths that funnels can't be optimized and successfully search engine optimized a funnel using ClickFunnels, quickly driving the site to page 1 of Google. He is also an award-winning member of Bruson's Inner Circle mastermind. And at Funnel Hacking Live, Damon will discuss how others can also leverage ClickFunnels to dominate search engines.   "ClickFunnels is already a wildly successful platform that supports many businesses, but few of them are maximizing the software to its fullest potential. Most marketers lean heavily into paid ads, and are completely overlooking ClickFunnels potential for search engine optimization to drive organic traffic," said Burton.   The Funnels SEO course is the latest training from Damon Burton, following his successful career of nearly two decades in SEO since founding SEO National™, which has helped hundreds of companies—including NBA team stores, Inc. 5000 companies, and Shark Tank-featured businesses—outrank their competition on Google.
