# National Term Limits Day Is February 27th

WASHINGTON, DC, February 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- U.S. Term Limits announces National Term Limits Day is February 27, 2025. This annual celebration of the 22ndAmendment helps to raise awareness of today's most popular and bipartisan issue – congressional term limits. U.S. Term Limits selected February 27th because that is the date the 22nd amendment, which limits presidential terms, was ratified into the Constitution in 1951. Congress adopted the 22nd amendment in response to growing popular support to set terms for a President. Today, that same type of sentiment is fueling support for congressional term limits with a recent recent Pew Poll showing 87% of Americans regardless of political affiliation support congressional term limits. Events will be held throughout the nation showing support for congressional term limits on National Term Limits Day.  "Presidential term limits have been a big success and remain broadly popular with the public," said Philip Blumel, President of U.S. Term Limits. "It is time to celebrate this great reform as we work to expand it to Congress."  A key part of Term Limits Day will be citizen activism. U.S. Term Limits is encouraging supporters to wave term limits signs or post them on their lawns, hold community events, contact state legislators, and publicize support on social media platforms, like Facebook and X, using #TermLimitsDay. More information can be found at www.TermLimits.com/TermLimitsDay.  "This is a crucial step toward making Washington listen again," concluded Blumel. "We can only restore our republic and founding values by bringing back a citizen legislature."  As Congress has not acted on congressional term limits, the states have begun to do so. How? By calling for a convention to adopt a congressional term limits amendment. When enough states request a convention to add a congressional term limits amendment to the Constitution, Congress is bypassed, and the amendment can be proposed by the states for ratification.  Nine states, – Florida, Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Louisiana – have called for a limited convention to propose a congressional term limits amendment to the Constitution. Other states have legislation pending that would have them join the roster of states calling for congressional term limits.
