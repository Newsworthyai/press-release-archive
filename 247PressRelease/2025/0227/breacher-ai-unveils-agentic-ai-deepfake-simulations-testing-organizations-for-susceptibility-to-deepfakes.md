# Breacher.ai Unveils Agentic AI Deepfake Simulations: Testing Organizations for Susceptibility to Deepfakes

ORLANDO, FL, February 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Breacher.ai, a leader in AI-driven security training, has launched Agentic AI Deepfake Simulations, a groundbreaking approach designed to help organizations prepare for the growing threat of AI-generated deception and social engineering attacks.  As deepfake technology advances, businesses and security teams must stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts. Breacher.ai's Agentic AI Deepfake Simulations offer highly realistic, adaptive attack scenarios that mirror real-world threats, enabling organizations to train employees and test defenses like never before.  "Deepfakes aren't science fictionâ€”they're an active threat," said Jason Thatcher, Founder & CEO of Breacher.ai. "Our simulations give organizations a safe yet highly realistic environment to experience and counteract AI-driven attacks before they happen."  How Agentic AI Deepfake Simulations Work:  Unlike conventional security awareness training, Breacher.ai's deepfake technology delivers:  Tailored deepfake attack scenarios that align with specific industries, risk profiles, and internal threats.  AI-driven impersonations of executives, employees, or external contacts to test response protocols.  Real-time conversational engagement that adapts based on user interactions.  Detailed analytics and risk assessments to measure vulnerabilities and improve security posture.  Why This Matters  The rise of deepfake technology means attackers can convincingly impersonate individuals in ways traditional security training does not address. Breacher.ai's Agentic AI Deepfake Simulations empower organizations to proactively test and strengthen their defenses before becoming a target.  "Companies need to move beyond static email training exercises," added Thatcher. "Our simulations let security teams test their organization for deepfake threats in a controlled setting, equipping them with the knowledge to detect and mitigate real attacks."
