# "LovelynPureStyles" Hair Salon Opens at Mansfield Salon & Spa Galleria in Arlington, TX

ARLINGTON, TX, February 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ashley Willis has had a passion for braiding since her mom taught her beginner techniques when Ashley was just eight years old. Today, she is a Professional Braider and Loctician who recently took the bold step of opening her own shop. The aptly named "LovelynPureStyles" salon is located in Suite #213 of the Salon and Spa Galleria Sublett at 5100 W Sublett Road in Arlington, Texas 76001.  LovelynPureStyles will focus on all things locs and braids. While locs and braids are known to have many benefits — among them low maintenance and the protection of natural hair — the wide variety of styles available today ensure that just about anyone can find a look that will not only accommodate their lifestyle but will enhance their natural beauty as well.  The salon will offer a wide range of styles for men, women, and children including individual and multi-strand twists, box braids and stitch braids, micro locs, crochet faux locs, knotless braids and bobs, freestyle and layered cornrows, starter dreadlocks, tribal braids, braided ponytails, and much more. According to Ms. Willis, each appointment will start with a one-on-one consultation to evaluate your hair and talk about the look you want to achieve. You are welcome to bring a photograph of your desired look as well.
