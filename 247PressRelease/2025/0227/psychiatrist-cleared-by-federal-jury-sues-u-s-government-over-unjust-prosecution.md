# Psychiatrist Cleared by Federal Jury Sues U.S. Government over Unjust Prosecution

EASTON, PA, February 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Muhamad Aly Rifai, MD, a highly regarded psychiatrist and internist in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, is taking legal action against the U.S. Department of Justice following his exoneration in federal court. After a lengthy and costly prosecution and a six-day trial, a federal jury acquitted Dr. Rifai in a matter of hours in May 2024. Now, he is fighting back. Dr. Rifai will hold the government accountable for what he describes as an unjust and baseless case that damaged his reputation and professional standing.  Dr. Rifai has filed legal action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under a federal law called the Hyde Amendment, seeking $1 million in attorney fees and legal costs. His lawsuit and legal action highlight the misuse of prosecutorial power to target physicians—particularly minority doctors—over disputed civil billing matters. Dr. Rifai's trial exposed overwhelming weaknesses in the government's case. The prosecution's key expert witness backtracked on the stand, leading the jury to swiftly reject the government's claims. Dr. Rifai presented testimony from two independent experts who dismantled the allegations, reinforcing his complete innocence.  "This case was never about justice—it was about government overreach," said Dr. Rifai. "I dedicated my career to caring for patients, only to find myself wrongly accused in a prosecution that should never have been pursued. I am committed to ensuring that no other physician endures the same ordeal". Dr. Rifai's legal action seeks to raise awareness about the dangers of politically or bureaucratically motivated prosecutions, which he argues undermines public trust in the justice system.   Dr. Rifai was a victim of the weaponized Department of Justice under US Attorney Jacqueline Romero, Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Joe Biden. He is standing up for himself and others who have suffered the same injustice.  Legal Action Filed Under:  United States of America v.
