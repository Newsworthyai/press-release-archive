ARLINGTON, TX, July 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Professional stylist Querita Lewis proudly announces the opening of Ques Cut Lounge, located at the Salon and Spa Galleria Six Flags Dr in Arlington, Texas. Lewis specializes in hair and beauty services, including regular and pixie cuts; braids; sew-ins; silk press; quick weave; halo relaxer; brow tinting and waxing; along with color and conditioning scalp treatments.  "It's my goal to help my clients look and feel better," Lewis said. "I enjoy using my talents and skills to make sure the details are just right." Lewis is famous for her pixie cuts, which are the perfect choice for anyone who wants to look great, but doesn't want to spend hours on their hair. "From low-maintenance to high fashion, a pixie cut is an excellent choice for almost anyone," she said.  Lewis explained that short hair is not only easy to care for; it can help you look younger and more stylish. Through the years, short haircuts have enjoyed perennial popularity, and they're just as flattering as long locks. It doesn't matter what type of hair you have â€“ there's a short hairstyle that'll work for you.  "Take a pixie cut, for example, which is stylish and looks great in any setting," Lewis said. "Pixie cuts are relatively low-maintenance, as short hair is easier to manage and care for than longer hair, especially in the heat of summer. And short hairstyles are the perfect choice for anyone who enjoys an active lifestyle. You don't have to worry about your hair sticking to your face or neck during a workout," she added.  Ques Cut Lounge is currently accepting new clients by appointment only. Hours are from 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Thursday-Friday, from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday, and from 1 p.m.-5 p.m. Sunday.
