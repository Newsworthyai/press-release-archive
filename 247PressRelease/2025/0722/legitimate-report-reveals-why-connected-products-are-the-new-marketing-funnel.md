# Legitimate Report Reveals Why Connected Products Are the New Marketing Funnel

NEW YORK, NY, July 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Legitimate, a technology company at the forefront of NFC innovation, today released a data-backed report proving that the future of marketing starts after the point of sale. By embedding NFC tags into physical goods—from merch and footwear to artist drops and event wristbands—Legitimate unlocks a new era of post-purchase engagement, loyalty, and first-party data collection.  "Most analytics stop when the transaction ends. Legitimate begins where others leave off—at ownership, re-engagement, and experience," said Calvin Chan, Founder and CEO.  This report is built on tens of thousands of post-purchase interactions—every one of them triggered by a tap on a physical product. No cookies. No tracking pixels. Just people engaging with real-world objects and unlocking something worth their time. Across hundreds of tagged items—from merch and footwear to artist drops and live events—we've collected a behavioral dataset that reveals not just who scanned, but how often they came back, where they were, and what they did next.  Read the full report here.  Why It Matters Most data stops at purchase. We extend it into ownership and re-engagement. Every scan = zero-party data -opted-in, verified, tied to real usage. No cookies. No rented audiences. Just direct, actionable insight.  Global Snapshot Page Views: 75k+ Product Taps: 30k scans across all SKUs Marketing Opt-In Rate: 95% Scanned in over 65 countries Over 250+ hours of digital content streamed  Yes, that beats most email capture forms.  How to Read This Data Product (SKU): A unique item embedded with an NFC tag—whether a hoodie, bottle, wristband, or sneaker. Scan: Every time someone taps a tagged product, a scan is recorded. Multiple taps = multiple scans. Re-scan Rate: Average scans per unique user. Indicates post-purchase engagement and loyalty. Unique Users: Total distinct people who scanned a product. Claim: A user verifies ownership, unlocking personalized content and tying the item to their identity or wallet. Verification: A confirmed, authenticated scan—proving the item is real and Legitimate-enabled. Opt-In: Users who submit email or SMS during the experience. Higher when content or value is meaningful.  Key Behavioral Trends 1. Event Launches Trigger Real-Time Spikes Across adidas, Gillian, Sango and more, scan volumes surged 3x–5x on launch or event days. Example: Gillian's merch hit 713 scans in a single day—70% of its weekly total.  2. Re-Scan Behavior Is the Norm The average re-scan rate is 1.67x, showing that consumers come back—an outlier for physical products.  3. Multi-Product Fans = Your Next CRM Strategy The most engaged users scanned 6+ unique products, often across verticals. These omni-channel superfans are ideal for loyalty tiers, early access drops, or surprise-and-delight campaigns.  4. Engagement Persists for Weeks Over 40% of scans happened after Week 1. Legitimate's tags extend lifecycle marketing far beyond the moment of purchase.  5. Time-of-Day Patterns Unlock Activation Windows Scan behavior peaks between 12–3 PM and 7–9 PM local time—ideal moments to trigger new content or follow-ups.  6. Location = Intent (Geo-Marketing Goldmine) We've been seen in over 65 amount of countries. Every scan is real. In-person. Product-level. No guesswork.
