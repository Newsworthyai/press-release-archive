# Attorney Brad Coates Secures $1.25 Million Policy Limit Settlement in Devastating Londonderry DUI Crash

NASHUA, NH, July 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Attorney Brad Coates of Coates Law Office has secured a $1.25 million settlement, the full available policy limits, on behalf of a seriously injured client involved in a catastrophic DUI crash that occurred on March 11, 2023, on Litchfield Road in Londonderry, New Hampshire.  The high-impact, head-on collision happened around 3:40 p.m. near 34 Litchfield Road. The defendant, driving a Mini Cooper while under the influence, crossed into oncoming traffic and caused a violent crash that left both drivers critically injured and closed part of the roadway for several hours.  Emergency responders arrived within minutes. The defendant was ejected from the vehicle and airlifted via Boston MedFlight to Lahey Hospital in Burlington, MA. Attorney Coates' client was transported by ambulance to Elliot Hospital in Manchester, where a trauma team was activated.  Attorney Coates's client suffered multiple life-threatening injuries, including fractures to the pelvis, sternum, both femurs, and arm, along with internal injuries to the kidney and spleen. The client required multiple surgeries, extensive hospitalization, and long-term rehabilitation.  "The damage done to our client, physically, emotionally, and financially, is something no person should ever endure because of another's reckless decision to drive under the influence," said Attorney Coates. "While no amount of money can undo what happened, this settlement brings our client some measure of justice and ensures they have the resources needed to move forward with their recovery."  The $1.25 million settlement reflects the full amount of the defendant's available insurance coverage, highlighting both the seriousness of the collision and the strength of the case presented by Coates Law Office.  Londonderry Police investigated the circumstances of the crash, and the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was ordered to serve a jail sentence for his reckless conduct.  Coates Law Office, based in Nashua, is recognized for its dedicated representation of injury victims and its consistent record of securing significant settlements and verdicts across New Hampshire.
