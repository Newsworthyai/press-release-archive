# Haltom City Lags the Rest of Texas in Updating its Parking Requirements to Spur Development

HALTOM CITY, TX, July 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ron Sturgeon, the founder of the Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) says he talks to someone almost every week who has tried to open a business in Haltom City, but was held up by regulations that seemed unreasonable.   Many of those people are unable to move into a property and open for business because of the outdated parking regulations.  Ron says, "Commercial vacancy rates continue to rise in Haltom City for the third year in a row in the major corridors. I have personally spoken with people who have tried to rent buildings in the major corridors and were unable to start a business or move there from another city."  Sturgeon notes, "Haltom city staff and council seem to be in complete denial about the high vacancy rates and the burdens that are preventing new small business from getting launched in Haltom City and what that means for the city and its residents relative to the tax burden, crime and revenue."   Here's the hard truth. These older main corridors of Haltom City have lost all of the major businesses, and the only way they will be repopulated is one business at a time by a small business. Small businesses simply cannot navigate the requirements in Haltom City and of course, because of parking restrictions, no one can.  HUBA presented a list of no-cost options to the city three years ago and several times since. The list included many things that the city could change in their code that would encourage and allow small businesses to come to Haltom City. But the city has never followed up or requested more information. It's pretty clear that current leadership is in denial about the decline in the south and central parts of Haltom City.  While Haltom City leaders stand still, other cities are taking bold action to make themselves more hospitable for small business. Dallas is just the latest city to do away with parking requirements to ease the burden on new and existing small businesses.   A KERA News article about the reform in Dallas notes advocates for the changes expect the reforms to spur economic development, help create more walkable neighborhoods and spur more housing.  About Haltom United Business Alliance Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) wants to give members of Haltom City's business community an advocate and to keep those businesses informed about issues that affect them. They want to make sure Haltom City is business friendly and nurtures small business growth, including automotive businesses in the industrial districts, and bring more restaurants including breweries and eventually a major grocery store to the city. New businesses and growth in existing businesses will create a stronger tax base which will allow the city to pay its first responders wages that are competitive with surrounding cities while improving Haltom City's facilities and infrastructure. HUBA believes that the southern and central parts of the city need a revitalization plan, to prevent further degradation in those areas, and wants that to happen before the inner-city experiences increased crime and more blight. As retail and office uses are in decline, it's more critical than ever to attract new businesses. They believe that such a plan requires a strong relationship and support of the business community. Anyone who owns a business in Haltom City is eligible to join HUBA. Dues are $20 annually or $50 for a lifetime membership, and membership is 100% confidential. To join, contact Joe Palmer at (682) 310-0591 or by email at HUBAgrp@gmail.com. Visit the group's Facebook at Haltom United Business Alliance.
