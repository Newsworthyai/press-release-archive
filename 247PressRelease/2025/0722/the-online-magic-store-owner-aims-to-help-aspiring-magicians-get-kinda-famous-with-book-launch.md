VANCOUVER, BC, July 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- What does it take to get kinda famous in the magic world? That's the question at the heart of a candid new ebook, How to Get Kinda Famous - written by underground creator Zee J. Yan and released to the public thanks to a push from Rich Tsai, owner of The Online Magic Store.  Rich, a longtime curator and collector in the magic and playing card world, convinced Zee to finally share the book after years of it sitting on the digital shelf. It's not a sales pitch. It's not hype. It's a raw, reflective guide for magicians who want to carve out a name for themselves - even if they don't have the world's greatest trick. For more, go to https://theonlinemagicstore.com/products/how-to-get-kinda-famous?variant=35642556514461  Making money as a magician is something certain people dream about. Not all magicians aspire to become entertainers; some seek to contribute to a legacy that will endure in the history of magic. Think Harry Houdini and escapism.  The truth is, only a few can achieve that with pure raw talent in magic. However, it is possible to build a name even without groundbreaking magic materials and tricks.   As a smaller version of the real world, amateur magicians can unlock recognition in the community that can feel like rock star status in the right scenarios. With a niche, it's possible to achieve community recognition that includes:  • Acknowledgement at the magic stores and conventions • Autograph requests • Influencing younger generations of magicians  Magicians may not reach celebrity or influencer status, but a few, including the author, have achieved moderate fame. The ebook is a self-reflective story of trial and error that aims to help serious magicians take action and hone their craft.  Stop worrying about what other people think, advises Zee. Practitioners serious about building fame as magicians can't rely on others; it's up to individuals to decide what they want and then work towards an end goal.
