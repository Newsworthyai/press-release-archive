# Waukesha Mold Remediation & Prevention: Antimicrobial Coating Service Update

WAUKESHA, WI, April 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As part of its professional mold remediation service, Waukesha-based Silver Lining Property Restoration now uses an advanced mold-proof coating on indoor surfaces, designed to help prevent recurrent infestations. The latest solution forms part of a multi-stage process, which can include inspections, testing, containment, cleanup, sanitization, and ongoing preventive measures.  More details can be found at https://silverliningpr.com/services/mold-removal/   The Wisconsin Department of Health Services states that exposure to mold spores can cause a variety of allergic reactions, such as itchy eyes, coughing, and sneezing, with a heightened risk for those who have asthma or other respiratory problems. The department points out that a building can never be entirely mold-free, and homeowners should avoid contractors who claim this ability.  Silver Lining Property Restoration makes it clear that its goal is to reduce and control mold levels, and the firm's latest antimicrobial coatings are designed with this in mind. The firm states that home and business owners also have a role to play, and the team provides advice and guidance on how they can manage indoor conditions, such as moisture.  "Mold remediation is the term used to describe all the processes involved in eliminating harmful mold growth, including testing, removal, sanitizing, containment, and/or cleaning," a company representative explained. "Here at Silver Lining Property Restoration, we don't make false promises about total mold removal, we offer comprehensive remediation to reduce mold levels to the point of being harmless."  To further assist local homes and businesses, Silver Lining Property Restoration is creating a series of guides on mold growth in the Waukesha area. The first piece covers the common misconception that mold is dormant in the winter months and offers tips and guidance on how to control indoor humidity.
