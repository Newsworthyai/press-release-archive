# The Compact Classic That Saved BMW: 1962 BMW 700 Sport is Being Displayed at the DFW Car & Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, April 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to present the 1962 BMW 700 Sport, a rare and historically significant model from BMW's early years. As part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection, this compact coupe represents a pivotal moment in BMW's history, blending sleek design, innovative engineering, and an unmistakable driving experience.  Designed by Giovanni Michelotti, the BMW 700 features a steel monocoque chassis, making it a lightweight yet rigid platform that contributed to its agile handling. The coupe body boasts a shorter greenhouse and an increased rear-window rake angle, distinguishing it from the two-door sedan model. The Sport variant was further enhanced with a rear anti-roll bar, ensuring improved stability and cornering capabilities. Stopping power is handled by drum brakes on all four corners, a standard for its time but still effective in delivering confident braking performance.  Inside the 1962 BMW 700 Sport, the cabin offers a driver-focused layout with essential yet refined features. Appointments include seatbelts, hand-crank side windows, a fire extinguisher, a glove compartment, a floor-mounted shifter, and a heater, providing both comfort and safety for its occupants. A wood-rimmed aftermarket steering wheel frames a 90-mph speedometer and an AutoMeter tachometer, keeping the driver informed of the car's performance. The five-digit odometer currently displays 42k miles.  Powering this classic coupe is an air-cooled 697cc flat-twin engine, which underwent a complete rebuild under previous ownership. The restoration included rebuilding the cylinder heads, crankshaft, and camshafts, as well as the installation of a replacement oil pump, bearings, pistons, and modified carburetor jets. The dual Solex carburetors and a custom stainless-steel muffler exhaust system enhance its performance, while power is efficiently routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle.  A defining model for BMW, the 700 Sport played a crucial role in shaping the company's future, marking its transition into a brand renowned for performance and driving pleasure. This example, now proudly displayed at the DFW Car & Toy Museum, offers visitors the rare opportunity to see this beautifully preserved classic up close.
