# Gut Microcosm: Creative Biolabs Harnesses Bacteroides to Explore New Frontiers in Probiotics

SHIRLEY, NY, April 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As microbiome research continues to gain momentum, the genus Bacteroides is drawing increasing attention for its potent polysaccharide degradation capabilities and intimate interaction with the host immune system—traits that make it a promising candidate for interventions in metabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, and even neurological conditions.  "Research has revealed that an increasing number of clients are choosing Bacteroides species as a functional strain candidate in the early stages of the probiotic's immune modulation, metabolic regulation, and antimicrobial alternatives development," said the Microbiome Project Director at Creative Biolabs. "That is why we had to broaden our Bacteroides platform to include everything from strain capture through to the delivery of the lyophilized sample."  Currently, Creative Biolabs has established a mature workflow for isolating and identifying Bacteroides strains. Through optimized anaerobic cultivation techniques, target strains can be selectively enriched from diverse sample sources, followed by genus- and species-level identification using 16S rRNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and mass spectrometry.  Building on this, Creative Biolabs provides multi-dimensional in vitro and in vivo functional assessment services, including evaluations of SCFA (short-chain fatty acid) production, polysaccharide degradation activity, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, pathogen exclusion, and immune modulation potential.  To verify the real-world biological effects of these strains, the platform is equipped with various animal models to assess impacts on gut microbiota composition, inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier integrity, and metabolic biomarkers. It also enables testing in pathogen suppression and infection models.  "Beyond the abundant challenges in development, biosafety is another one that must be taken into consideration. To screen for virulence factors and resistance genes, we do whole-genome analysis. Comprehensive safety checks like hemolytic activity, toxin production, metabolic byproduct toxicity, and cytotoxicity also ensure strain safety," the director added.   Notably, to meet researchers' growing demand for downstream Bacteroides probiotic development, Creative Biolabs also offers laboratory-scale production services for Bacteroides strains. These include anaerobic fermentation process optimization, biomass harvesting and lyophilization, as well as full-scale quality control and activity validation. The resulting products can be used for functional validation, mechanism research, or early-stage formulation development.  The upgraded platform has already integrated and optimized several key Bacteroides species, such as B. fragilis, B. ovatus, and B. thetaiotaomicron. Some of these strains have undergone preliminary functional validation and are available as high-activity reference strains suitable for co-culture and animal model studies.  "Our goal is to provide globally accessible, translational strain resources and technical support through a blend of standardized and customized services."

Company Overview With this platform upgrade, Creative Biolabs aims to be an enabler in the current wave of translational microbiome therapeutics, advancing the science together with global research partners.
