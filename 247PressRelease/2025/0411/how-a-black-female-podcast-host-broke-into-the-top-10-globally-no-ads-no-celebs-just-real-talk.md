# How a Black Female Podcast Host Broke Into the Top 10% Globally—No Ads, No Celebs, Just Real Talk

ATLANTA, GA, April 11, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Digital likes may have replaced deep conversations, but that doesn't mean we've stopped needing them. Tamika Carlton, host of The Real Connect, launched her podcast on January 25, 2025, and in just weeks, it surged into the top 10% of global podcasts without paid ads, big-name guests, or celebrity shoutouts, demonstrating that we don't need more content; we need connection.   "People don't realize how lonely they are until they hear something real," says Tamika Carlton. "That moment when someone says what you've been feeling but couldn't name. That's what The Real Connect is built for. In my world, being real is resistance."   The Loneliness Epidemic Has a New Challenger  According to the U.S. Surgeon General, loneliness poses the same health risks as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. We're more "connected" than ever, yet fewer people report having close friends, deep conversations, or safe emotional spaces.  Tamika created the show after losing her father young and nearly losing her husband, experiences that pushed her to help others value real connection. The Real Connect podcast is a cultural wake-up call.  A Seattle native who came of age in Chicago and now based in Atlanta, Tamika's cross-city journey mirrors the heart of her podcast, bridging life's transitions. Each city helped shape her voice, community, and commitment to keeping it real.  Every episode offers honest conversations about love, friendship, conflict, and healing. From tackling conversations others avoid to challenging how we define connection, Tamika brings a grounded, vulnerable, and unforgettable voice to the mic.   "I watched the power of black women supporting each other. I'm actually going to play it at work for one of my meetings." — Sheena Gilbert, Spotify listener  "I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually excited to try networking again after watching this. Thank you for making this feel doable!" @catrinakiyef6845, YouTube viewer  What's Next for The Real Connect?  With momentum building, Tamika is just getting started. Upcoming episodes recorded in Atlanta, New York, and Miami signal a growing movement and a commitment to amplifying voices and stories that need to be heard.   Listen to The Real Connect on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iHeartRadio, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts.  About Tamika Carlton  Tamika Carlton is a communications expert and passionate advocate for quality relationships and meaningful connections. After experiencing profound personal loss and near-loss, she realized the power of human connection in healing, growing, and thriving. Through The Real Connect podcast, Tamika is building a movement around the idea that connection isn't optional, it's a human requirement.
