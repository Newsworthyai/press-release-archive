# Books for School Libraries: Bestselling Nature Book With Fun Fantasy Stories, Big Ears Jack And Friends, Brings The Magic Of The Sonoran Desert To Life

WILMINGTON, NC, October 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Books that present stories about animals hold significant value in education. These types of books engage children in myriad ways and can foster deep emotional connections. When kids read about a brave dog or a loyal feline, they can engage with themes of bravery, loyalty, and friendship without the emotional complexities that come with human characters. This emotional detachment makes it easier for them to explore and understand challenging topics like friendship, loss, and identity.  Animal books stimulate creativity and imaginative thinking and have always been important in the lives of kids and favorite books for children of any age, from newborns to teens (even adults!). 'Big Ears Jack and Friends', by award-winning author Earl Vincent de Berge is a best-selling collection of charming tales featuring animals and plants from the Sonoran desert of Baja California. Coyotes, foxes, boojum trees and bobcats are among the main characters in these enchanting fables, creating a rare book that is both entertaining and educational, and would make a valuable addition to school libraries.  This new young reader fantasy book is an enchanting collection of 15 imaginative short stories celebrating the wild animals and plants that live in the hottest desert in the Americas, on the narrowest peninsula in the world, Baja California, Mexico.  The main character in these delightful stories is Big Ears Jack: a very big jackrabbit with huge ears -- and magical powers to use for good! Jack is the king of desert kindness, a good friend to all desert critters.  Among Jack's friends readers will meet Nosey and Wag, mischievous coyote brothers; Blue Dasher, a racing dragonfly; the Kangaroo Rat Chorus; tree-lizard Boris; Giro the dust devil; Hawk Conchita and the red ants; Lady Treble Clef, a watchful cactus; Paulina, the puma poet; Diana the musical tarantula; Lady Chrona, a sea lion who dreams of flying; a scheming sea gull named Swindler; the beautiful bobcat Miss Mucha Purrs; Mr. Shellie, the chatterbox tortoise; and Young Red Fox and his sweet love, the lovely rabbit Adorna -- along with many others.  In a review of 'Big Ears Jack,' an AWA reviewer said, "One of the book's greatest strengths is its world-building. De Berge weaves the flora and fauna of Baja California into the narrative, making the setting feel like a character itself. Talking cacti, dust devils playing tag, and wise desert tortoises enrich the stories, placing readers in an enchanting ecosystem where the line between reality and fantasy blurs.  "The themes of community, creativity, and environmental respect run throughout the collection. Young readers will enjoy the magical adventures and witty dialogue, while adults will appreciate the underlying messages about cooperation, individuality, and harmony with nature."  In his review on Amazon Mark Winheld stated, "If you're up for more fantasy fun, you'll be tempted by chapter titles like 'Sheriff Diamondback and the Egg-Thieving Coyotes,' or 'Dianna the Musical Tarantula,' or 'Swindler (a thieving seagull) and Big Umpo the Sea Lion,' or 'Lady Treble Clef and Dust Devils Rescue a Javelina Family,' and many more."  Reviewer Essien Asian said, "The author presents educational information in detail while using the dialogue between the characters to stimulate young readers' imaginations. The mix of strategically placed pictures, an engaging narrative style, and thought-provoking subplots regarding these animals ensures that young readers will learn vital lessons in diplomacy and survival from 'Big Ears Jack and Friends' while enjoying a captivating adventure.  'Big Ears Jack and Friends' is available in print and ebook form on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Earl-Vincent-de-Berge/author/B09R6M1G4Y?.  De Berge is also the author of a dramatic and exciting travel memoir, 'A Finger Of Land On An Old Man's Hand'. In this book, readers are immersed with four explorers in a transformative journey through Baja California in 1962 and 1964, inspired by 'The Forgotten Peninsula' by Joseph Wood Krutch. The book received a 5-star review from ReaderViews, and another reviewer called the book, ". . . a beautifully written, fabulous tale of an incredibly brave and daring journey."  Earl has published three collections of his poems, "Allegro to Life," "Swans to Carry Me," and "Wind in the Elephant Tree," which touch on nature, human nature, love, desert silence, and life in Guatemala.  All of de Berge's books are available at Amazon and other online book retailers.
