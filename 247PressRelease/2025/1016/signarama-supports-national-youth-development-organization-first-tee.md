Signarama will provide up to $75,000 in grants for signage at First Tee Chapters. Grantees will be notified by December 2025.  The grants through this partnership can be used for signage needs that may include: • Event Signage – Generate more attention at your events with products like banners and feather flags. Highlight donors with removable yard signs on and off the course.  • Branding Signage – Showcase First Tee's mission and values with facility signage like wall murals, donor recognition plaques, and interior signage.  • Vehicle Graphics - Your vehicles can be an excellent way to advertise your mission.
