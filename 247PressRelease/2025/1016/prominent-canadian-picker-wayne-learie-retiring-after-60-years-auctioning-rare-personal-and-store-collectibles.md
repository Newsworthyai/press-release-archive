# Prominent Canadian Picker, Wayne Learie Retiring after 60 Years Auctioning Rare Personal and Store Collectibles

VANCOUVER, BC, October 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- After more than 60 years of picking, Wayne Learie has become a trusted name among collectors and antique enthusiasts across Canada and around the world. Building large collections for investors over the years, Wayne has bought and sold everything from Led Zeppelin's robe to rare gas pumps and vintage signs. Uncovering hidden gems in basements, backyard sheds, and estates, Wayne has built a remarkable reputation for his sharp eye for the rare, unusual, and extraordinary.  "I've been fortunate to do what I love for many years," says Learie, "Finding unique pieces and bringing joy to buyers and collectors."  Wayne, also known to many as The Mad Picker, recently sold his business to DirectAuctions.Com. While he continues to collaborate with Jeff Schwarz of DirectAuctions.Com, Wayne has made the decision to auction his personal and store collection as he begins his well-earned retirement.  Among the standout pieces in this extraordinary sale is a 1938 historically significant local carving depicting Chief August Jack Khatsahlano (X̱ats'alanexw) of the Squamish Nation. An experienced medicine man and revered leader instrumental in preserving the Squamish Nation's oral history and collaborating with Vancouver's first settlers in documenting the West Coast. He's featured in the book Conversations with Khahtsahlano 1932-1952 by J.S Matthews, an early Vancouver City Archivist.  Other remarkable notable pieces include highly collectible early Canadian Addison radios from the 1950s, an original "Girl on the Beach" Coca-Cola sign in mint, framed condition, a fully restored Austin children's pedal car, and a signed Tiffany table lamp and candle holder.  Collectors will also find a selection of Hardy fishing reels and rods from the 1920s and '30s, rare Canadiana furniture, a large collection of carved Chinese jade, fine jewelry, sterling silver and Indigenous art.  Additional treasures include vintage display showcases, military swords and badges sourced from estates worldwide, and beautifully restored Seeburg and Wurlitzer jukeboxes.  Simply put, this is expected to be the most significant auction event held in the Fraser Valley in the past 25 years. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for collectors, dealers, and enthusiasts alike.  Jeff Schwarz, best known as the lively TV reality star "The Liquidator" and owner of DirectAuctions.Com, shared his excitement about the upcoming event.  "It's been an honor and a privilege to work with Wayne over the years," says Schwarz, "We're thrilled to present such a unique collection that rarely, if ever, comes up for auction. Acquiring The Mad Picker and collaborating with Wayne allows us to further expand into the estate and collectibles market, which is an exciting new chapter for our teams."
