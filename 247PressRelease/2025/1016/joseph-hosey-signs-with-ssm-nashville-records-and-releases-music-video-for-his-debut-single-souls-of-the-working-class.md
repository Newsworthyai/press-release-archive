His debut single to country radio, "Souls of the Working Class," and its music video are out now.  Hailing from the shores of the great Lake Erie, Joseph Hosey is a singer/songwriter steeped in seventies rock and 90's grunge, but his southern roots and early country music influences were what were always boiling just beneath the surface.

His debut single, "Souls of the Working Class," is an anthem for those who give their all every day, often without recognition. With its raw emotion and timeless message, Hosey proves that real country music still comes from real life.
