# Blakeley Law Announces Community Impact Through Animal Service Scholarship

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, October 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Students at trade schools, colleges, universities, and graduate schools have a new opportunity to apply for financial aid through Blakeley Law Firm. The firm is proud to debut its Community Impact Through Animal Service Scholarship, valued at $2,000.  Students have until March 15, 2026, to complete a 500 to 700-word essay going into detail about their experiences volunteering with shelter dogs, foster dogs, and/or therapy dogs. Students should specifically:  - Discuss the logistics of their volunteer experiences. - Reflect on how their volunteer experiences may have changed their future goals. - Highlight how their services positively impacted the lives of the people around them, as well as the dogs they served.  Students may optionally include a record of their volunteer service alongside their essay and application form.   The scholarship selection committee wants students to create entirely original essays discussing their volunteer experiences. As such, the inappropriate use of AI to generate an essay will see a student's application removed from the applicant pool.   Blakeley Law Firm's scholarship selection committee reserves up to three months to select its scholarship winner after the March 15, 2026, deadline passes. The team asks that students and their families refrain from reaching out with questions about the status of a student's application during this timeframe.  The firm will announce its winner through a press release and blog post shared on the Blakeley Law Firm website. A representative will work with the winning student to deliver their scholarship funds to the institution of that student's choosing.  Unfortunately, the team cannot communicate with non-winning applicants at this time. Students should keep an eye on the Blakeley Law Firm website for updates on the scholarship selection process.  Blakeley Law Firm and its representatives are passionate believers in the influence pets, including dogs, can have on a person's everyday life. The scholarship selection committee looks forward to learning more about how today's students have dedicated themselves to making life easier for their four-legged friends.
