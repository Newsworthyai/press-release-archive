# Baltimore Children &amp; Youth Fund Hosts Boardlight Event to Strengthen Community Engagement and Support Professional Growth for Youth-Serving Organizations

BALTIMORE, MD, October 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Baltimore Children & Youth Fund (BCYF) will host its upcoming Boardlight event on Thursday, October 16, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. ET at Baltimore Unity Hall, inviting Baltimore's grantees, partners, and community members to learn more about BCYF's mission, available resources, and the city's ongoing investment in youth-serving organizations.  Designed as a learning and connection opportunity, the Boardlight event will help organizations, particularly those operating with budgets under $750,000, better understand BCYF's dual investment model. Later in the event, BCYF will also host a Pre-Application Technical Assistance (PATA) session—professional development sessions preparing grantee applicants for BCYF's upcoming $2 million summer funding round. BCYF's PATA program has proven results: participants are five times more likely to receive a grant than those who do not engage in the training.  "This event is a great opportunity for Baltimore residents to see how public funding is transforming the lives of young people across our city," said Alysia Lee, President of BCYF. "Along with professional development and grant application support, it's a hands-on way to experience how BCYF empowers and uplifts grassroots organizations."  Boardlight emphasizes community learning, skill-building, and connection, showing how BCYF's support extends beyond funding to build lasting organizational strength. Together with the PATA sessions, it reflects BCYF's comprehensive approach to community investment, combining financial resources with technical assistance to expand equity and sustainability across Baltimore's youth ecosystem.
