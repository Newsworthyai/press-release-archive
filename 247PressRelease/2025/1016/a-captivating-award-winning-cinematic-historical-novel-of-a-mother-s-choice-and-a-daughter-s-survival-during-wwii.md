# A CAPTIVATING AWARD-WINNING CINEMATIC HISTORICAL NOVEL OF A MOTHER'S CHOICE AND A DAUGHTER'S SURVIVAL DURING WWII

NEW YORK, NY, October 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When desperate choices mean the difference between life and death.  Inspired by true events, Bright One tells the story of Jetti Finkelthal, Lisajoy Sachs' great-grandmother. In Czernowitz, Romania, this young Jewish mother is forced to face impossible choices as the world begins to collapse around her. As antisemitism tightens its grip and war edges ever closer, Jetti holds fast to her daughter, Berta, with the fragile belief that love and courage might still carve a way through the darkness.  Heartened by her grandmother Berta's letters, photographs, and family oral histories, Sachs revives a story both intimate and universal-stitched with the fabric of daily life, the pull of memory, and the quiet heroism of women who refused to yield to despair. Told with vivid, sensory detail, the novel unfolds as if you are walking beside the characters, witnessing what they see and sharing what they feel.  Through Jetti's resilience and sacrifices, Bright One reveals the enduring strength of family ties and the shadow of trauma that lingers across generations. It is a story of survival, of loss, and of the unbreakable connection between mother and child.  For readers captivated by historical fiction that lingers long after the final page, Bright One offers a profoundly human portrait of love tested by history's darkest hours.
