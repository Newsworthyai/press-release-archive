Fu's involvement is expected to add depth and authenticity to the adaptation of Angelou's powerful words.  The film's production is set to begin on April 1, 2025, with pre-production lasting until June 30, 2025. Principal photography will take place from July 1 to July 20, 2025, followed by post-production until September 17, 2025.

The film's editing process will be crucial in conveying the sense of time and loneliness experienced by the elderly protagonists.  UniCvisions, LLC is committed to bringing this important story to audiences, highlighting the need for compassion and understanding towards our senior citizens.
