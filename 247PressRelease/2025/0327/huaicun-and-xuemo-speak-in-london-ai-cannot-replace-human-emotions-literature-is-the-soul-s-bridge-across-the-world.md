# Huaicun and Xuemo Speak in London: AI Cannot Replace Human Emotions. Literature Is the Soul's Bridge Across the World

NEW YORK, NY, March 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As artificial intelligence advances at breakneck speed, what role can literature play?Recently, at Piccadilly in London, British-Chinese children's author Huaicun—an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA)—gave a firm answer during a dialogue with Chinese writer Xuemo: "AI can never replace human emotions. Literature is, and will remain, the warmest bond between human hearts."  During the conversation, Huaicun shared her writing inspirations, the origins of creativity, and her views on future trends. She emphasized that her inspiration came from memory, familial warmth, and the emotional richness of childhood experiences in nature—real-life moments that AI cannot simulate. "Only those who have truly experienced joy and sorrow can write words that move the heart," she said.  Huaicun pointed out that in the face of technological challenges, a writer's strength lies not in power but in emotion, love, and sincerity. She believes that literature will continue to serve as a bridge in our globalized world, fostering mutual understanding and shared growth among people of diverse backgrounds. When speaking of children's literature, she called for stories that awaken kindness, curiosity, and creativity in young minds—qualities that form the foundation of human civilization.  The event, supported by the Chinese Embassy in the UK, attracted nearly a hundred attendees from both Chinese and British cultural communities, including Guy Portelli, Vice President of the RBA and a renowned sculptor, as well as other notable figures from the UK's cultural scene.  As a key moment in Sino-British cultural exchange, the dialogue not only explored the role of literature in the AI era but also instilled renewed hope and confidence in preserving humanistic values amid the global wave of technological change.  "Everyone's childhood is similar; our dreams are shared," Huaicun concluded gently yet resolutely. Her voice, carried on the spring air of London, echoed like a soft yet stirring poem—lingering in the hearts of many.  Xuemo (literally Snow over Desert) is the pen name of Chen Kaihong, a renowned Chinese writer and cultural scholar from Liangzhou, Gansu, China. As of 2024, Xuemo has published over 70 works in more than 100 editions. His major works have been translated into over 20 languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, and Swedish, with more than 60 multilingual editions available worldwide.   Notably, the newly published English edition of Love Letters From the Goddess by Xuemo has garnered media attention since its release.
