# From Entrepreneur to Investor: Taelor Salmon's Impact on Building Financial Freedom for Minority Women Entrepreneurs

WASHINGTON, DC, March 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Taelor Salmon, President and CEO of TJS Group, is helping minority and women entrepreneurs achieve financial freedom and generational wealth by sharing her journey and expertise. A passionate advocate for financial empowerment, Taelor is transforming how underrepresented business owners approach entrepreneurship and investment, particularly in real estate and federal contracting.  "Many women, across all backgrounds and ages, aspire to financial freedom and wealth-building, but the path can feel daunting and unattainable. It all starts with knowledge," says Taelor. "Financial freedom begins with identifying a need—one that creates short-term revenue and fuels long-term investments, ultimately building lasting wealth. I feel a responsibility to share my journey, shaped by the wisdom passed down from generations before me. Financial freedom comes from not only doing the work but focusing on the need, the impact, and the value we create. Beyond that, oral tradition and shared knowledge are the keys to sustaining financial freedom and generational wealth. Knowledge is power, and I'm excited to share the insights, strategies, and lessons that have shaped my success."  Taelor's leadership and expertise have led her to create opportunities for minority and women entrepreneurs to thrive in industries like federal contracting, real estate investing, development, and IT security. As the founder of TJS Group, she empowers entrepreneurs to scale their businesses by leveraging government contracts and real estate as tools for wealth-building. Through mentorship, Taelor equips her clients with the skills needed to navigate these sectors, overcome barriers, and create sustainable financial growth.  A passionate advocate for increasing access to real estate opportunities for minority entrepreneurs, Taelor's work extends to promoting affordable housing and financial education as well. She is dedicated to advocating for National Fair Housing in Washington, D.C., which is nationally recognized in April, helping individuals build wealth through strategic investments in real estate. In addition, speaking more on financial freedom as April is also the national month for Financial Litteracy.  "Entrepreneurship is about more than just business growth—it's about creating a lasting legacy and empowering others to do the same," stated Taelor. "My goal is to inspire and support the next generation of minority women entrepreneurs in building businesses that contribute to their communities and their families for generations to come."
