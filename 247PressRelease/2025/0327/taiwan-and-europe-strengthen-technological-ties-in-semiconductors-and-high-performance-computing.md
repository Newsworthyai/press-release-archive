# Taiwan and Europe Strengthen Technological Ties in Semiconductors and High-Performance Computing

LONDON, ENGLAND, March 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- According to a recent report published by The Icons, Taiwan and Europe are forging deeper ties in the semiconductor and high-performance computing (HPC) industries, driven by a shared commitment to technological innovation and talent development.  On December 9, 2024, a delegation from Taiwan's National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs), led by Dr. Mei-Yu Chang, Director of the Office of International Affairs, attended the Semi Impact Forum 2024 – Catalonia Chapter in Barcelona, Spain. The delegation included key leaders from Taiwan's semiconductor industry, highlighting the growing collaboration between Taiwan and Europe in the face of global technological transformation.  Professor Konrad Young, Director of Arculus Lab and former Director of Research and Development at TSMC, addressed the forum, offering insights into Taiwan's semiconductor success and emphasizing the complementary strengths between Taiwan and Europe. "Taiwan excels in semiconductor manufacturing and design, while Europe has strong capabilities in equipment and fundamental research. This partnership presents a strategic opportunity for both regions to strengthen their positions in the global market," Young stated.  Professor Rui Carlos Oliveira, Director of INESC TEC (Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science) in Portugal, also underscored the importance of distributed architectures and cross-border cooperation in AI and HPC. "Taiwan's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and Portugal's growing strength in AI and HPC create a natural synergy that can drive technological advancement," Oliveira remarked.  The collaboration between NARLabs and INESC TEC dates back to 2017 and has expanded from high-performance computing and marine technology to artificial intelligence. Both Young and Oliveira highlighted the importance of fostering talent with a global outlook, stressing that interdisciplinary education and industry-academia collaboration are key to maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving technological landscape.  "Technological competition today is no longer about rivalry between individual nations—it's about global cooperation," Young and Oliveira concluded. Their dialogue underscores a shared vision of advancing semiconductor and HPC capabilities through strategic Taiwan-Europe partnerships.  This strengthening of Taiwan-Europe cooperation signals a new era of technological innovation and global collaboration, positioning both regions at the forefront of the next wave of semiconductor and AI development.  The National Institutes of Applied Research is a research institution in Taiwan resulted from the combination of national laboratories into an independent nonprofit institute.
