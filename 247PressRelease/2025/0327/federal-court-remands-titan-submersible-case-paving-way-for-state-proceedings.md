# Federal Court Remands Titan Submersible Case, Paving Way for State Proceedings

HOUSTON, TX, March 27, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Schechter, Shaffer & Harris, LLP, in collaboration with co-counsel Tony Buzbee, has secured a key legal development in the case concerning Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a crew member who perished in the Titan submersible implosion during a deep-sea expedition to the Titanic wreck.  The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington has ruled to remand the case to state court, dismissing pending motions to terminate the lawsuit. This decision in Case No. 2:24-cv-01223-LK, Ortoli v. OceanGate Inc. et al, ensures the case will proceed under state jurisdiction, a significant development in the legal pursuit of accountability.  "This ruling is a crucial step in our efforts to secure justice for the Nargeolet family and others impacted by this tragedy," said Matthew D. Shaffer, partner at Schechter, Shaffer & Harris, LLP.  The Titan disaster, which claimed five lives and drew international attention, raised concerns about safety protocols, corporate accountability, and the risks of deep-sea exploration. Schechter, Shaffer & Harris, LLP continues to advocate for transparency and legal responsibility in the maritime sector.  Context of the case  In August 2024, Schechter, Shaffer & Harris, LLP filed the first lawsuit related to the Titan submersible implosion, targeting OceanGate, the Washington-based operator. The case highlights issues around the submersible's unconventional design and lack of independent safety checks.  This legal action complements the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation's ongoing inquiry, which examines regulatory compliance, mechanical systems, and industry standards. A public hearing is scheduled for September.
