# Grungo Law Holds Second Annual Mini Golf Invitational

ATLANTIC CITY, NJ, September 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Grungo Law hosted the Second Annual Mini Golf Invitational on Friday, August 22, 2025, at North Beach Mini Golf in Atlantic City, bringing together families, friends, and creators from the local community. Through partnerships with the Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Flyers, alumni players Chris Therien and Riley Cote joined the celebration with the Grungo Law team and connected with fans.  Launched last summer, the Grungo Law Mini Golf Invitational has quickly become a tradition to celebrate the end of the shore season, showcasing friendly rivalry while highlighting local businesses and creators. This year's raffles featured prizes from community favorites, including Lakes Coffee, Mike's Seafood, Son of a Sailor, Louie G's, Hershey's Shake Shop Creamery, HomeGrown215, Kid Rip's Tap & Tavern, and Back Bay Seafood.  Grungo Law's partnerships with the Phillies and Flyers also brought exclusive prizes to the event. First-place winners took home tickets to both a Phillies and Flyers game, second-place winners received a Lumi Max, and third-place winners received a coffee machine paired with Grungo Law's Cherry Hill and Hammonton blend coffee grounds. But the most talked-about prize of the day was the trophy declaring victory over Mike and PJ (@the.traveling.tastebuds) in the highly anticipated mini golf challenge, a true badge of bragging rights until next year's tournament.  No Grungo Law event would be complete without great local food, and the mini-golf outing was no exception. Mike and PJ ended the day off with one of their famous food reviews, highlighting Cuzzie's Steaks, a newly opened Atlantic City business serving up freshly made cheesesteaks.   They also featured Taylor Made Treats, a family-owned business from Egg Harbor City, which treated attendees to their signature ice cream sandwiches. Both quickly became crowd favorites.  Adding to the excitement, local content creators and media professionals Tyrone Johnson (@tyjohnsonnews), Toni Marmo (@toniimarmo), Juliana Gainsburg (@thelifeofjulsg), Rob Cella (@bardownmediaofficial), and Brittany DiMatteo (@bdimatteo.photography) joined the event, capturing highlights and helping share them with the community.  "One of the best parts of hosting the Mini Golf Invitational at North Beach Mini Golf is seeing our community come together - and having Flyers alumni Chris Therien and Riley Cote join the fun really elevated the day," said Richard Grungo, Esq., founder of Grungo Law. "Events like this support local businesses, celebrate local talent, and give everyone a chance to create memories.
