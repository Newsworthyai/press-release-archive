# Striking 2023 Maserati MC20 in Yellow Showcased at the DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum's Private Collection

FORT WORTH, TX, September 05, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase the 2023 Maserati MC20 coupe — a breathtaking fusion of Italian craftsmanship and motorsport innovation — now available for viewing as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. Finished in a bold yellow exterior, this state-of-the-art supercar offers visitors a rare opportunity to experience Maserati's newest flagship model up close.  Developed in collaboration with renowned motorsport engineering firm Dallara, the Maserati MC20 was designed by Centro Stile Maserati in Turin, Italy, and is hand-assembled at Maserati's historic Viale Ciro Menotti plant in Modena. The model made its global debut for the 2022 model year and represents a new era of performance and design for the Maserati brand.  At the heart of the MC20 is the revolutionary 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged Nettuno V6 engine, delivering a staggering 621 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque. Paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, the MC20 offers blistering acceleration, enhanced by launch control and a sophisticated double-wishbone suspension with active dampers for optimal handling.  Braking power is equally impressive, with red-painted calipers over ventilated and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The MC20's dynamic performance is matched by its luxurious and high-tech interior. The cabin features carbon-fiber trim, a digital rearview mirror, wireless charging, a Sonus Faber premium sound system, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Maserati Intelligent Assistant with a 10.25″ touchscreen display offering navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. The carbon-fiber steering wheel and column-mounted shift paddles complete the immersive driving experience.  "This is not just a car — it's a technological marvel wrapped in Italian style," said Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "We are excited to share this exceptional Maserati MC20 with our visitors. It perfectly embodies the spirit of performance, innovation, and design that defines great automotive art."
