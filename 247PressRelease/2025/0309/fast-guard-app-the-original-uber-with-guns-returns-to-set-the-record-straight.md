# Fast Guard App: The Original "Uber with Guns" Returns to Set the Record Straight

MIAMI, FL, March 09, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fast Guard Service, a national leader in security services since 2013, is set to relaunch its revolutionary Fast Guard App in April 2025. Originally developed by company owner Roderick Payne in 2017, the app was the first of its kind—dubbed the "Uber with guns"—offering on-demand security guard services similar to ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft. The app's relaunch promises to set a new benchmark for safety, professionalism, and reliability in the security guard industry.  The original app, inspired by Fast Guard Service's ability to deploy security guards nationwide within four hours, quickly proved to be more than just a convenience tool. "We weren't just filling a gap in the market; we were redefining it," said Payne. "There was so much potential to expand on this idea that we decided to go back to the drawing board, enhancing the app's capabilities to ensure it met the real-world demands of security services."  Since its inception, Fast Guard Service has generated over $85 million in revenue, a testament to the success of its business model and the app's foundational concept. In 2021, the company launched the website https://fastguardapp.com during the app's beta testing phase. Drawing on his decades of experience in law enforcement and security services, Payne carefully developed the app to address the industry's unique liabilities and challenges—something that competing apps have failed to do.  "The Fast Guard App isn't just about connecting clients with guards. It's about ensuring accountability, supervision, and safety at every step. That's where many competitors have missed the mark," Payne added. "Apps like the 'Protector App' might look good on paper, but without the practical experience and understanding of security operations, they're essentially a car accident looking for a place to happen."  Unlike other "Uber-like" security apps, the Fast Guard App offers a robust management framework, ensuring armed security guards are never left unsupervised and that all services maintain the highest standards of safety and compliance. The app will also feature automated systems that match clients with vetted security professionals while maintaining real-time oversight by experienced security managers.  Roderick Payne's foresight and expertise have helped Fast Guard Service maintain its industry leadership since 2013. "We're not just an app; we're a service-driven company with over a decade of proven success in the security industry. Many new players think technology alone can solve the problem, but without understanding the liabilities, they're setting themselves and their clients up for failure," he stated.  The Fast Guard App's 2025 relaunch aims to reestablish Payne as the pioneer of on-demand security services while educating consumers to look beyond flashy marketing and focus on real-world expertise and proven results.
