# New Memoir "Woody" Chronicles

MONTEREY, CA, October 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In Woody: My Journey through Joy, Grief, and Healing with a Dog, author Richard Newman shares a deeply personal and emotionally powerful memoir that explores the profound impact one Great Dane had on his life. With honesty, vulnerability, and moments of spiritual insight, Newman opens the door to the emotional aftermath of losing a beloved pet and the path toward healing.  This moving book is more than a story about a dog. It is an intimate reflection on love, grief, and the human-animal bond that transcends words. Newman recounts the unexpected transformation he experienced through Woody's presence and the crushing sorrow that followed his loss. Readers witness a man grappling with overwhelming grief, physical recovery, and emotional reckoning, as well as the small miracles and messages that slowly guide him back to life.  "Woody changed everything for me," Newman writes. "I didn't know how much until he was gone. This book is my way of honoring him, and hopefully helping others navigate their own grief with grace."  In collaboration with his wife, Wendi Newman, a certified dog behavior consultant, and spiritual guide Ophilia Mandara, the author documents a rare, multidimensional healing process. The book includes real-time journal entries, dreamwork sessions, and a blend of therapeutic, emotional, and spiritual insights. It speaks not only to pet lovers but to anyone struggling with loss and searching for meaning.  Woody is a testament to how animals shape our lives and our hearts. It is a reminder that grief, when faced fully, can be a gateway to deep personal growth. Woody: My Journey through Joy, Grief, and Healing with a Dog is now available in paperback and digital formats.
