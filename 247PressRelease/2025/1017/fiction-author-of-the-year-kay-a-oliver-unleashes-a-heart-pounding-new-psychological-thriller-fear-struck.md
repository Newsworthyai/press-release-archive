# FICTION AUTHOR OF THE YEAR, KAY A. OLIVER, UNLEASHES A HEART-POUNDING NEW PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER "FEAR-STRUCK"

LOS ANGELES, CA, October 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Award-winning novelist and Hollywood veteran Kay A. Oliver, recently named Fiction Author of the Year by the International Association of Top Professionals (IAOTP), is set to electrify readers once again with the release of her most chilling and emotionally charged thriller to date "FEAR-STRUCK."  Prepare to question everything you believe about fear, control, and survival.  In FEAR-STRUCK, Oliver plunges readers into the darkest corners of the human psyche where fear does not just haunt you... it hunts you. This haunting thriller plunges Orson Kutter into a nightmare beyond imagination when he is accused of brutal murders ripped straight from the pages of a novel he wrote years ago, and fiction suddenly becomes his deadliest reality. The story reveals how far we will go when the mind becomes the battlefield. Every page pulses with tension and deceit, echoing a chilling truth that the greatest danger may not lurk in the shadows, but within ourselves, teaching us it can be our worst enemy.   "Fear is the most powerful emotion we have," says Oliver. "It can save us, destroy us, or twist our perception of reality. Fear-Struck explores that razor-thin line and what happens when we step over it."  With her trademark cinematic storytelling and her background in Hollywood production, Oliver masterfully crafts a psychological maze that blurs the line between truth and delusion. Each twist feels like a cinematic reveal; each revelation forces readers to confront their own hidden fears.  Following her award-winning novels Road to Elysium and Disturbed Tombs, Oliver once again proves why she is a powerhouse in modern fiction, fearlessly tackling complex emotions, moral dilemmas, and the fragile limits of the human mind.
