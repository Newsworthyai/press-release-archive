# 1967 Mercedes-Benz 250SE Coupe: Understated Elegance, Engineered to Endure

FORT WORTH, TX, October 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is proud to present a pristine piece of German engineering and postwar sophistication: a 1967 Mercedes-Benz 250SE Coupe, now on display as part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection. With only 31,000 kilometers (~19,000 miles) on the clock, this white-on-white beauty is a shining example of the restrained elegance and robust build quality that define Mercedes-Benz's golden era.  Under the hood, the 250SE is powered by a 2.5-liter M129 inline-six, equipped with Bosch mechanical fuel injection and mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Known for its smooth delivery and engineering precision, this powertrain helped establish the "S" (Sonderklasse) lineage as the gold standard for European touring coupes. During its refurbishment, the fuel pump was professionally rebuilt, and an electric windshield washer pump was added for reliability.  The classic white exterior is accented with subtle details including twin side mirrors, dual exhaust outlets, and a power-operated antenna, complemented by an aftermarket switch. Inside the cabin, period-correct charm meets functional upgrades, with a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, locking glove compartment, and an analog clock. An aftermarket temperature gauge has been discreetly installed beneath the dash to compensate for inoperable original temp and oil pressure gauges.  The interior features a graceful white two-spoke steering wheel, which frames a 220-km/h speedometer, 7k-rpm tachometer, and supporting gauges—all set into a clean and classic instrument cluster that mirrors the brand's commitment to clarity and quality.  "The 250SE coupe is a masterclass in understated luxury," says Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It wasn't built to turn heads—it was built to outlast them. This example, with such low mileage and well-preserved condition, is a rare and welcome addition to the collection."  One of the last of the hand-built, steel-bodied Mercedes coupes of the 1960s, the 250SE combines timeless styling with the mechanical excellence that continues to make these models highly sought after by collectors today.
