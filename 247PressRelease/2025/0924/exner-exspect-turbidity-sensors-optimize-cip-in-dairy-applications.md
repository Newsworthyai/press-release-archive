# Exner EXspect Turbidity Sensors Optimize CIP in Dairy Applications

AUBURN, CA, September 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- South Fork Instruments, a distributor of process measurement and control equipment serving the Americas, today announced the availability of Exner's EXspect turbidity sensors, engineered to improve cleaning-in-place (CIP) operations in dairy plants. Designed to withstand hygienic process conditions, EXspect sensors provide reproducible turbidity measurement that reduces product loss, lowers water and chemical consumption, and ensures compliance with 3A and EHEDG standards.  "Timers and sight glasses leave dairies guessing when milk has been flushed out or when rinse water is clean enough," said John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments. "With EXspect sensors, processors can make those transitions based on accurate, real-time turbidity values. That translates into measurable savings in product recovery and effluent charges, often paying back the investment in well under a year."  Exner EXspect turbidity sensors are constructed from 316L stainless steel with sapphire optics, enabling long service life under repeated CIP/SIP cycles. They are available with Tri-Clamp and other connections for hygienic installation and are fully certified to 3A Sanitary Standards and EHEDG guidelines.  Key specifications: -Measurement range: up to 300,000 NTU (≈75,000 EBC), covering rinse water through cream -Response time: sub-second detection of product-to-water and water-to-detergent transitions -Reproducibility: better than 1% of full scale -Sterilization resistance: up to 140 °C for 120 minutes during SIP cycles  South Fork Instruments distributes Exner EXspect turbidity sensors in the Americas, supporting dairy processors with application expertise and integration services.
