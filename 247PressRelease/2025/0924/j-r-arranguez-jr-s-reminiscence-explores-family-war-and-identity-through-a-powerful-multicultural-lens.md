# J.R. Arranguez Jr.'s Reminiscence Explores Family, War, and Identity Through a Powerful Multicultural Lens

LONG BEACH, CA, September 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Filipino-American author J.R. Arranguez Jr. offers readers a timeless, emotionally resonant story in his novel Reminiscence: Memories are Beyond Forgetting No Matter How Bitter They Are — a historical and multicultural narrative inspired by real events. The novel continues to strike a chord with readers who seek stories rooted in family, resilience, and cultural identity.  Inspired by the true story of a Filipina nurse who lost her father in the Vietnam War before she was born, Reminiscence follows the journey of a young woman who dares to dream — first of meeting her father, then of becoming a nurse and building a new life in America. As she grows up, she lets go of the hope of ever finding her father. But fate has other plans. After moving to North Carolina to work at a nursing home, she falls in love with the grandson of a resident — a romance that leads her to a shocking and emotional discovery: her father is alive, living nearby, with a new family.  At once heart-wrenching and uplifting, Reminiscence offers a compelling exploration of lost and found family, the generational effects of war, and the quiet strength of immigrant women pursuing their dreams in unfamiliar places.
