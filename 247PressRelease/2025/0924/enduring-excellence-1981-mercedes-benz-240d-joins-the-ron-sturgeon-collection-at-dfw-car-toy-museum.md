# Enduring Excellence: 1981 Mercedes-Benz 240D Joins the Ron Sturgeon Collection at DFW Car &amp; Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, September 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly welcomes a true icon of automotive reliability to the Ron Sturgeon Collection: the 1981 Mercedes-Benz 240D. As part of the renowned W123 chassis series, the 240D built its reputation on unmatched longevity, engineering precision, and timeless Mercedes-Benz styling—earning its place as a global favorite among diesel sedans.  This well-preserved example is powered by a 2.4-liter OM616 diesel inline-four, factory rated at 67 horsepower and 97 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, the 240D may not have been a speedster, but it became famous for outlasting just about everything else on the road. Stopping power comes from disc brakes on all four corners, rounding out a mechanical package engineered for endurance.  Inside, the cabin is appointed with durable Sienna MB-Tex upholstery, featuring front bucket seats, a rear bench, and minimalist 1980s comforts. Classic analog gauges include a 100-mph speedometer, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level indicators—alongside an analog clock and aftermarket stereo. True to its utilitarian luxury ethos, the model includes hand-crank windows, a heater, and a locking glove box.  According to documentation, the car's speedometer was replaced in 1996 at around 50,000 miles. The replacement odometer currently reads 61,000 miles, offering a glimpse into this vehicle's long, well-documented journey.  "The 240D may not scream luxury, but it defines it in terms of quality, dependability, and understated confidence," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's the kind of car you grow to admire not just for what it is—but for how long it lasts."  The 1981 Mercedes-Benz 240D is now on display as part of the museum's ever-growing collection of over 200 classic vehicles and 3,000 vintage toys and collectibles.
