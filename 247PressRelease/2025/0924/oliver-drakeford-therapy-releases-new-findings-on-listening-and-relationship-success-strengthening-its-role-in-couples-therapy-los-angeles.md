LOS ANGELES, CA, September 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The analysis reveals that individuals who report their partner has strong listening skills are 43 times more likely to be in a "thriving relationship" category compared to couples who struggle with listening — a shift from just 1 in 70 couples to nearly 2 in 3.  "The data from our couples intimacy quiz confirms what my team of couples therapists and I have seen and known for years," said Oliver Drakeford, Clinical Director of Oliver Drakeford Therapy. "Lasting intimacy is built on patterns of connection, and communication is at the heart of those patterns. When couples learn to truly listen, they create the foundation for growth, trust, and deeper emotional closeness."
