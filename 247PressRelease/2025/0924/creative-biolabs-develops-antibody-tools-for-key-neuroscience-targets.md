# Creative Biolabs Develops Antibody Tools for Key Neuroscience Targets

SHIRLEY, NY, September 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The nervous system is so intricate that research must combine molecular biology, structural biology, and clinical medicine. As the worldwide burden of neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, and psychiatric disorders continues to grow, researchers are working rapidly in search of new molecular mechanisms and treatment options.  Synaptic Function and the GRID2 Gene Research has demonstrated that mutations of the GRID2 gene can lead to cerebellar ataxia and learning deficits and show that GRID2 plays a dominant role in motor coordination and synaptic transmission. In neurological disease models, abnormal GRID2 expression reflects not only molecular mechanisms of neural circuit imbalance but also provides a rationale for the potential of targeted interventions.  Creative Biolabs has produced a range of anti-GRID2 antibody products, including Rabbit Anti-GRID2 Recombinant Antibody and Mouse Anti-GRID2 Recombinant Antibody, available to the scientific community. These products are applicable in ELISA, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, these highly specific products allow researchers to accurately study spatial characteristics and dynamic regulation of synaptic proteins.  A neuroscientist at Creative Biolabs remarked, "In the field of investigating synaptic function, GRID2 has emerged as a key point for understanding both cerebellar development and mechanism learning. Our antibody tool sets aim to assist researchers in generating clearer molecular maps within cell and animal model systems."  Tyrosine Hydroxylase: The Rate-Limiting Enzyme in Neurotransmitter Synthesis In neurotransmitter metabolism research, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) plays a pivotal role. It is the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, catalyzing the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, which subsequently produces dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.  Especially in Parkinson's disease research, changes in TH levels would reflect the functional state of dopaminergic neurons. TH is therefore an important marker for drug discovery and disease diagnosis. The scientist stated, "As a rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, TH research is critical to understanding underlying mechanisms related to Parkinson's disease but also to the development of new neuroprotective strategies."  Creative Biolabs offers the Mouse Anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase Recombinant Antibody (AV1), optimized for Western blot and immunohistochemistry applications, helping researchers sensitively capture molecular changes along neurotransmitter synthesis pathways.  ACTN3: A Core Molecule in Muscle Genetics Beyond neurotransmitters and synaptic function, genetic regulation in the motor system has attracted increasing attention. The ACTN3 gene encodes Î±-actinin-3, a critical protein for maintaining the structural integrity and explosive power of fast-twitch muscle fibers.  In research practice, Creative Biolabs provides a number of ACTN3-related products, including Mouse Anti-ACTN3 Recombinant Antibody (applications: IHC, WB) and Rabbit Anti-ACTN3 Recombinant Antibody (applications: WB, IH, IC, Flow) with high specificity and cross-species applications. These tools support studies in sports genetics, muscle disorders, and personalized training research.  About Creative Biolabs Creative Biolabs is dedicated to providing customized antibody solutions and professional technical support to researchers worldwide.
