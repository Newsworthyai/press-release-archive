# Jody Sharpe Offers Bestselling Ebook,The Dog Who Came For Christmas, At No Charge, December 15-16, 2025, Discusses The Influence Of It's A Wonderful Life

WILMINGTON, NC, December 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Award winning author Jody Sharpe has announced that her bestselling Christmas book, 'The Dog Who Came For Christmas' will be available in ebook form at no charge December 15 and 16, 2025 at Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jody-Sharpe/author/B00DPL3382?.  In this delightful Holiday book, meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force Knight, proves to be a force to be reckoned with once more. While Gayle was sleeping, an angel sent her a vision of a future event. With her intuition, Gayle wonders, will she really meet the dog in her dream and save another one? With the help of her intuitive husband, Alex Knight, and friends, Gayle sets on a course to rescue many more. But with surprising twists and turns of intrigue, both Gayle and Alex find there are always angels at the helm as they ride on their coattails.  Most of Sharpe's books feature angels and a strong anti-bullying message. In a recent post titled 'It's A Wonderful Life & My Very Own Angel', she talked about how 'It's A Wonderful Life' inspired her Mystic Bay series of books. In that post, she said in part:  The themes in my Mystic Bay Series have always been inspired by the iconic Christmas film, 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Set during World War II, the theme resonates today as bullies around the globe try to bring us down to our knees. In the film, George Bailey, a kind son, has to take over the family business when his father dies. Now he can't follow his dreams of seeing the world. The bully in town, Mr. Potter, tries to destroy George's family business and takeover the town. George becomes despondent and decides the world would be better off without him. Yet, heaven and Clarence, his guardian angel, have a lesson for him. His angel, appearing as an older gentleman, comes from heaven and shows George what life would be like in the town if he'd never been born. George saved his brother's life as a child by pulling him from an icy pond. That would have never happened if George had never been born. At the hands of Mr. Potter, George's wife would have never married and the town would be ruined by Mr. Potter's cruelty and greed.  The theme resonates with me as I write my soon to be eighth book in the Mystic Bay Series where angels live as humans guiding the townsfolk with love. In the film, George changes his attitude and handles the bully as he realizes his wonderful life. The town comes together to help him thwart the bully with their friendship.  The full post can be found at her website at https://jodysharpe.com/blog.  Other books by Jody Sharpe include:  To Catch an Angel - Jody is also the author of 'To Catch an Angel', written in memory of her late husband Steve. In 'To Catch an Angel', miracles happen in Mystic Bay, California, the town with the psychic and angel vibe. Angels are calling. Psychic Maggie Malone returns home to find she's swept up in the miracle of it all. She can't imagine why her mother left or who her father might be. But these questions pale in comparison to the wonder of the angels. Maggie meets writer, Noah Greenstreet. They realize they've met before, but where? Maggie and Noah embark on a journey to find our world is all awash with angels.  Town Of Angels - it's angel vs. Bully in the town of Mystic Bay, California, where a well-kept secret lies. Angels live as humans there. After angels appeared to three children, all was blissful in the town full of psychics, and ordinary folk. But as brute, Klaus Waxman, comes to town, angel Ken Leighton, a storeowner, must carefully guide his flock of humans not to give in to the bully's efforts.As Klaus opens a store mocking the resident angel sightings, angel Ken guides psychic Justine Greer, and her family to thwart his efforts.

Town Of Angels Christmas - The bully never wins. A secret lies in Mystic Bay California. Angels live as humans there.

Will Jordana recognize Angel Ken as the man from her past as they work together on a rescue mission to bring twenty-two horses to Mystic Bay before Christmas, will they see what lies before them, a Christmas story only the angels could write.  Special Needs Children, The Angels On My Shoulder is a memoir based on her twenty-five years teaching children with special needs. The book placed second in the National Federation Of Press Women's At-Large Communication contest. The book is as entertaining as it is illuminating. It's a love story about the special students and others who over the years graced her life with just that, their grace.  With hearts of angels and challenges to face, the children took Sharpe along their journeys and inspired her own life's journey of self-discovery. When sorrow came, their kindness helped her through. The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."  Special Needs Children followed her recently released children's book about angels, When The Angel Sent Butterflies. The new book helps children understand that love from their parents and others surrounds them. Love conquers fear, and believing that angels are near can help sweep any childhood fear away. This concept is presented in the book when Angel Ken sends Jones and Kate butterflies. The book, appropriate for ages 2 to 7, is now available at Amazon and Ingram.  One of her latest books, Summer Of Angels, is a mystery novel. Meteorologist and psychic, Gayle Force proves a force to be reckoned with as she moves back to her beloved Mystic Bay, California. While sleeping, an angel sent her a vision in a dream of a future event. Gayle realizes she must use her intuition to save an old man from drowning. But who is this old man?  With the help of intuitive attorney, Alex Knight, she finds they are caught in the middle of a future crime. But can Gayle and Alex solve the case and save the old man before it's too late? With surprising twists and turns of intrigue and love, Gayle and Alex find there are angels at the helm as they help prove the bully never wins.  In addition, on the "Tuesdays With The Angels" section of her site, Sharpe presents stories of real-life encounters with angels. The stories are available at Sharpe's website at http://www.jodysharpe.com.  Sharpe hopes to create a collection of angel stories that involve sightings of angels, interaction with angels, miraculous angel encounters, and other types of accounts or stories. Everyone is welcome to submit angel stories. All submissions will be considered, but inclusion is not guaranteed. Stories may be submitted at http://bit.ly/2FV8amd.  Sharpe's YouTube channel brings all of this together, offering segments on all of these topics. One topic of special interest is bullying, specifically as it relates to special needs children.  In addition to the National Federation of Press Women's award, Jody was chosen as a winner in the annual "50 Great Writers You Should Be Reading" Book Awards. She was chosen from a field of hundreds of authors through a public voting process.  Jody also announced recently that two new screen treatments of her books are now available: The Angel's Daughter and Town Of Angels Christmas.

The valuable lessons she learned about moving forward and loving life in the now have set her on a mission to tell the stories with love, humor and spiritual awakening.
