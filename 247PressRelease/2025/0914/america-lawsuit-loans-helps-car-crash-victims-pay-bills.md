# America Lawsuit Loans Helps Car Crash Victims Pay Bills

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, September 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Car accidents happen 16,500 times every day in America. That's 6 million crashes each year. Most people survive, but they face huge medical bills and money problems while their legal cases move slowly through the courts.  America Lawsuit Loans helps car accident victims get money fast. The company gives cash advances to people who need help paying bills while waiting for their lawsuit to end.  Car Crashes Cost America $417 Billion Each Year  Car accidents hurt millions of people every year. The total cost hits $417 billion when you add up medical bills, lost wages, and other expenses. Here are the real numbers: • 6 million car accidents happen each year • 39,345 people died in car crashes in 2024 • 2.5 million people went to emergency rooms after crashes • Each day, 116 people die and 6,500 people get hurt  Medical Bills Keep Growing  Car accident victims face bigger medical bills than ever. The average cost for car accident medical treatment is $15,000. Emergency room visits cost $3,300 on average. Hospital stays cost much more at $56,674 each.  Car insurance costs more too. Insurance rates went up 12% since 2024. Full coverage now costs $2,678 per year. Many drivers can't afford insurance anymore. About 14% of drivers have no insurance at all.  The Real Problem: Time and Money Don't Match  Medical bills come right away. Legal cases take months or years to finish. People need money now, but their compensation comes later.  Most medical costs happen in the first 18 months after a crash. But lawsuits often take longer to settle. This timing problem puts families in tough spots.  Some victims give up and take small settlements because they can't wait for fair compensation. Insurance companies know this and use it to pay less money.  "Many car accident victims are forced to accept inadequate settlement offers simply because they can't afford to wait for fair compensation," said Johnny Cavalli, Founder of America Lawsuit Loans. "Our pre-settlement funding empowers plaintiffs to pursue the full compensation they deserve without the pressure of immediate financial hardship."  Let's Support Justice Through Financial Stability  The company's mission extends beyond providing financial assistance—it aims to level the playing field between individual plaintiffs and well-funded insurance companies and corporate defendants who often use financial pressure as a litigation strategy.  "Insurance companies frequently delay settlements hoping that financial stress will force accident victims to accept lower offers," explained Johnny Cavalli. "Our funding allows plaintiffs to maintain their financial stability and pursue fair compensation without compromise."
