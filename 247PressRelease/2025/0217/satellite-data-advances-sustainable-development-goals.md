# Satellite data advances sustainable development goals

KNOXVILLE, TN, February 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the race to meet the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Earth observation (EO) satellite data is emerging as a game-changer. These satellites provide high-frequency, expansive datasets that are revolutionizing how we monitor environmental shifts, assess ecosystem health, and manage natural resources. Recent studies highlight how satellite data fosters synergies across multiple SDGs—for instance, Sentinel satellites are simultaneously driving progress in marine ecosystem monitoring (SDG 14) and climate adaptation (SDG 13).  Yet, the journey toward achieving these global goals is hindered by a critical data gap—35% of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators lack adequate data. Traditional data collection methods fall short, unable to fully capture the complexities of poverty or track sustainable progress. Earth observation (EO) satellite data is stepping in as a transformative solution, delivering granular insights into socio-economic conditions essential for sustainable development. This growing potential underscores the urgent need for deeper exploration into EO data applications to bridge this gap and accelerate SDG achievement.  A pioneering study (DOI: 10.34133/remotesensing.0403) from Tsinghua University's Department of Earth System Science, recently published in Journal of Remote Sensing, delves into this very challenge. The research dissects publication trends and utilizes the Remote Sensing Impact Factor (RSIF) to uncover a surge in EO data applications. Key satellites—Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel—stand out for their pivotal roles in driving climate action (SDG 13) and conserving biodiversity (SDG 15).  The findings reveal an impressive surge in EO satellite data usage over the past three years. Sentinel and Gaofen satellites have seen remarkable growth in demand, with Sentinel surpassing MODIS in recent years. Meanwhile, Landsat and MODIS continue to be cornerstones for environmental monitoring and historical data analysis. Big data cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine have further accelerated data processing and analysis, spotlighting the growing significance of open data policies and cross-platform collaboration.  Analyzing articles from 2020 to 2023, the study reports a leap in EO satellite-related publications—from 45,673 to 59,703. Open-source datasets, particularly Landsat and MODIS, dominate the research landscape. Sentinel data has seen a dramatic rise, with related publications soaring from 2,702 in 2020 to 7,231 in 2023—an unmistakable sign of its expanding scientific relevance. Notably, China has overtaken the United States to become the global leader in EO satellite data research output.  To ensure comprehensive insights, the research team meticulously curated literature on widely used EO satellites and sensors from the Web of Science Core Collection. By refining their search criteria, they bolstered the accuracy and depth of their analysis. Advanced bibliometric tools like CiteSpace and VOSviewer enabled the team to map emerging trends and key developments from 2020 to 2023. The RSIF metric was recalibrated to incorporate the latest data, providing a more accurate measure of research impact.  Experts involved in the study emphasize that EO satellite data is indispensable for achieving the SDGs. Beyond supporting individual goals, these datasets create powerful synergies—Sentinel satellites aid both marine ecosystem health and climate resilience, while Landsat data enhances food security and water resource management.  Looking ahead, satellites like Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, Gaofen, and ALOS are poised to remain vital in the EO data landscape over the next five years. As technological innovations and new satellite launches unfold, the value of EO data will only intensify, offering richer, more reliable insights for global environmental monitoring and sustainable development. Furthermore, advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and collaborative frameworks are set to unlock even broader applications of EO data, propelling humanity closer to the 2030 sustainability targets.
