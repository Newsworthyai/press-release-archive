# Precision in miniature: new microgripper technology for electronics and assembly

KNOXVILLE, TN, February 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have unveiled an innovative electrothermal microgripper that promises to improve microelectronics, biomedical engineering, and MEMS applications. With its remarkable deformation capabilities, excellent size compatibility and reliable catch strength, the new microgripper enables the manipulation and assembly of micro- and nano-scale objects with exceptional efficiency. This technological advancement is poised to enhance microscale engineering and pave the way for innovations across various high-tech industries.  Microgrippers are essential tools for manipulating minute objects, with applications ranging from medical biopsies to microassembly in electronics. However, traditional microgripper technologies have faced significant limitations, including reliance on complex light sources, high voltages, and bulky magnetic systems. These constraints often hinder their use in confined or specialized microenvironments. The growing need for more versatile, efficient, and user-friendly microgrippers has driven recent research efforts toward overcoming these barriers.  A team of researchers led by Professor Huikai Xie from Beijing Institute of Technology recently published (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-024-00821-2) their study in Microsystems & Nanoengineering on January 5, 2024. This study was primarily done by Prof. Xie's PhD student Hengzhang Yang who is the first author of the paper. Their novel electrothermal microgripper, based on Al-SiO2 bimorphs, combines remarkable deformation and rapid response capabilities while consuming minimal power, offering a promising solution to the challenges faced by traditional technologies.  The electrothermal microgripper developed by the team represents a significant leap forward in micro-manipulation technology. By utilizing Al-SiO2 bimorphs as the core structural component, the microgripper takes advantage of the thermal expansion mismatch between aluminum and silicon dioxide to achieve significant reversible deformation. This mechanism allows the microgripper to naturally close due to residual stresses, enabling it to hold samples without any power consumption. Capable of bending more than 100 degrees at just 5 volts, with a response time of under 10 milliseconds, the microgripper delivers impressive speed and accuracy. Furthermore, its ability to grasp and manipulate delicate micro-objects, as demonstrated in tests with PMMA microbeads, proves its robustness. In vibration tests, it successfully endured an average acceleration of 35 g, and in impact tests, it withstood forces exceeding 1600 g, demonstrating its exceptional strength and reliability. These features make the microgripper ideal for precision tasks like "pick-and-place" operations, such as handling solder beads in electronic packaging.  "Electrothermal microgrippers have long been sought after for their potential to simplify micro-manipulation tasks," said by Shuailong Zhang, a professor participating in this study. "Our design not only meets these expectations but also exceeds them by offering a level of precision and reliability that is unmatched in the field."  Looking to the future, the potential applications of this microgripper are vast. In the electronics industry, its precision makes it ideal for tasks such as solder bead placement, where accuracy is critical. In the field of biomedical engineering, the microgripper could revolutionize minimally invasive procedures, such as biopsies, by enabling the precise handling of tissue samples. As the technology continues to evolve, it is expected to spur further innovations in microscale technologies, leading to more efficient and advanced micro-manipulation systems across a variety of sectors.
