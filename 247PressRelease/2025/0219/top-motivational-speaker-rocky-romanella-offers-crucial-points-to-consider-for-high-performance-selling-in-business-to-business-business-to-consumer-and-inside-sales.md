# Top Motivational Speaker Rocky Romanella Offers Crucial Points To Consider For High Performance Selling In Business-To-Business, Business To Consumer, And Inside Sales

WILMINGTON, NC, February 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There many factors we must consider if we hope to become leaders in our industry. We must exceed customer expectations. We must position our company as a leader in the eyes of the public. Branding, technology, culture, innovation, sustainability - the list seems endless. However, all of these lead to a single point, as the bottom line for any business is revenue - sales.  In a recent newsletter titled, "High Performance Selling Through Inside Sales," top motivational speaker and best-selling author Rocky Romanella laid out the road map for developing a high performance sales strategy that can be used by any company in any field. In that article he wrote in part:  Sales Competency Profile  Here is a typical way of visualizing the sales competency profiling building process. Think of it as:  • What is the issue/opportunity that must be addressed? (Developing vision and purpose)  • How will I get my team aligned and committed? (Gaining organizational commitment)  • How do I turn intent into business results? (Achievement)  • The competency profile describes the "right stuff" the sales executive must have to get the job done.  This building process takes place in all three scenarios.  1. Business-to-Business, 2. Business to Consumer, 3. Inside Sales  In this newsletter, we will be discussing Inside Sales and its role in building and executing your sales plan.  We will start with the Inside Sales Job Description.  Inside Sales Job Description:  Inside sales associates must also be adept at identifying and capitalizing on new market opportunities, constantly evaluating the competitive landscape to ensure our brand and products remain at the forefront of the industry. By leveraging data analysis and market research, they can tailor their pitches and strategies to align with evolving client needs and preferences. Additionally, fostering a collaborative environment with the marketing and product development teams ensures that the sales messaging is consistent and reflective of the latest innovations and offerings.  The biggest differentiator between us and our competitors is the superior customer experience we provide, whether on the street or in an inside sales environment. During every customer interaction, our reputation is on the line.  Our Priority is Customer Satisfaction: Whether on the phone, in person, or via electronic communication, genuinely interact and connect with customers, ensure a positive experience, and exceed expectations.  Actively Listen to Customer Needs: Consistently demonstrate to customers that you are in tune with their needs and are operating in their best interest. This is extremely important when you are engaging via a phone conversation because you do not have the face-to-face customer interaction and either party can become distracted by their surroundings.  Customers know what they want but may not always explain it in a manner that is clear to you. Therefore, it is important that effective listening skills are utilized. If you do not understand a request, ask clear, positively articulated questions until you understand. Do not rush customers; allow them at their own pace to discuss what they need. Once customers have expressed their needs, confirm your understanding with them to ensure communication is clear.  Build Strong Relationships: Providing value and listening are key components of any relationship. The foundation of strong relationships also includes being fair to customers and following through on your word. Make sure to ask for assistance from others when necessary to ensure proper follow-through and response. Treat every customer how you would like to be treated.  Learn the Products and Services We Offer: Part of providing a superior customer service experience is being knowledgeable of the products and services we offer. Take the time to really learn your business so you can effectively communicate to your customers the services and value we provide.  Be Responsive and Effectively Resolve Problems: If a problem occurs, allow customers to fully explain the issue and convey empathy. If the fault lies with you or us as an organization, take ownership of it and apologize. Take the initiative to resolve problems in a timely and effective manner. Your ability to follow up will be a key measurement stick to the customer.  Remain Positive: Always show respect for our customers, even if you find yourself in a challenging situation. Demonstrate professionalism and keep communication positive. These phone conversations can at times be frustrating to either or both parties, but your abilities to keep it positive can change the conversation from a negative to a positive.  Express Gratitude: Expressing appreciation can go a long way. It can be as simple as thanking customers for their business and loyalty. Make sure they know we are grateful they chose to do business with us.  Sales Behaviors and Descriptors of a High Performance Inside Sales Individual:  • Enthusiastic about the business • Intuitively knows when there is a business opportunity and when there isn't • Demonstrates confidence in their advice • Has figured out how to sell value rather than compete on price • Has great energy and enthusiasm • Ask more than they tell • Straight with clients: strive to under promise and over deliver • Believing taking care of detail is important • Believes in their company's purpose • Follow up often, on time, and with something to say  These are characteristics and sales behaviors associated with strong and effective performance in the Inside Sales organizational role. They are actual, delivered behaviors. When such behaviors are delivered, they result in good organizational outcomes. They are also the behaviors that distinguish superior performance from threshold performance.
