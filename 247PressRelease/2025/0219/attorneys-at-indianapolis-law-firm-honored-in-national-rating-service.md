# Attorneys at Indianapolis Law Firm Honored in National Rating Service

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, February 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The attorneys at an Indianapolis law firm are united by one thing: they go the extra mile for their clients. They work long hours, negotiate with stubborn insurance companies, and give victims space to grieve. They remember clients' stories long after their cases have settled.   This devotion is the reason that all 10 of the personal injury lawyers at Craig, Kelley & Faultless were honored by Indiana Super Lawyers this year.   Super Lawyers recognizes Indiana's top attorneys each year. Attorneys must be nominated, independently researched, and evaluated by peers. Two lists are released: Super Lawyers, which honors only 5% of the state's attorneys, and Rising Stars. The latter, which honors 2.5% of Indiana lawyers, is awarded to attorneys who are 40 or younger or who have been in practice for 10 years or less.   David Craig, Scott Faultless, William "B.J." Kelley, Christopher Barry, and Krysten LeFavour are named in the 2025 Super Lawyers list. Alexander Craig, Jacob Kotter, Samantha Stevens, Whitney Coker and Sidney Lewellen have been named to 2025 Rising Stars. Managing partner David Craig was also named in Top 50: 2025 Indiana Super Lawyers list.
