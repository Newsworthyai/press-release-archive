# New Paul Gauguin Painting Discovered: Astonishing Double-Sided Masterpiece

ZUG, SWITZERLAND, February 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- This newly discovered double-sided work by Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) marks an art-historical sensation, featuring two distinct compositions previously unknown in catalogs and the art market.  The authenticity of the work has been confirmed by leading experts, including Dr. Yvonne Muchitsch, renowned art scholar; Dr. Elpida Vouitsis, contributor to the Gauguin Catalogue Raisonné; Dr. Erhard Jägers, specialist in scientific art analysis; and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) & Swiss Institute for Art Research (SIK) in Zurich.  The front side, created during Gauguin's Tahitian period in the 1890s, is from the same era as his "Nafea Faaipoipo (When Will You Marry?)," which sold for US$210 million in 2015. The back, unsigned and undated, has been scientifically analyzed and unequivocally attributed to Gauguin.  "These factors alone make the painting particularly valuable in terms of originality and rarity of subject matter, a true jewel within the artist's work," emphasizes Dr. Vouitsis in her provenance research.  The research conducted by Dr. Muchitsch and Dr. Vouitsis has been published in a 336-page book, available online at https://cuvillier.de/en/shop/publications/9164-paul-gauguin.  Currently held in a private collection in Zurich, discussions are underway with major museums regarding future exhibitions. Scholars and collectors have expressed significant interest in the work, recognizing its importance in expanding our understanding of Gauguin's legacy.  This discovery provides valuable insight into Gauguin's techniques, themes, and resourcefulness as an artist. With demand for his work continuing to soar, this remarkable find is generating interest worldwide.  Gauguin is considered one of the most influential artists of modern times. His distinctive style, breaking from Impressionist traditions in favor of bold color and symbolism, has left an enduring impact on the art world. His paintings continue to command some of the highest prices at auction.
