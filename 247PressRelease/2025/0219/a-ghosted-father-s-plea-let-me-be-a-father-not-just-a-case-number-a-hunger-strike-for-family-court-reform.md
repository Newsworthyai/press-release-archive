# A Ghosted Father's Plea: Let Me Be a Father, Not Just a Case Number—A Hunger Strike for Family Court Reform

ORLANDO, FL, February 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A Ghosted Father's Plea: Hunger Strike for Fairness in Family Courts  After two years of legal struggles, a father has taken a step to seek justice—a hunger strike to raise awareness about the challenges many parents face in family court. Now on Day 20 of his hunger strike, this ghosted father is using his personal story to highlight a broader issue: the need for fair legal proceedings and due process in parental rights cases.  A Call for Due Process and Fairness  Like many parents who have gone through family court disputes, this ghosted father has faced unexpected legal barriers restricting his ability to be present in his child's life. Despite having no criminal record or history of wrongdoing, he has been subjected to life-altering decisions made in his absence. His case reflects a growing concern among parents nationwide: the need for transparency, accountability, and a system that prioritizes children's best interests through fair proceedings.  "Parents deserve the right to be heard, to present evidence, and to have a fair legal process," said Joseph S., the father behind this hunger strike. "This hunger strike is not just for me—it's for every parent who has fought to be treated fairly in court. It's for those who continue to be present in their children's lives despite the overwhelming legal burdens placed upon them. Parents who, despite unjust impositions, refuse to walk away because they understand that their role is irreplaceable. Yet, these barriers—imposed without justifiable reasoning—do nothing to strengthen the parent-child bond but only strain it further."  The irony is undeniable. A once-established parent is now forced into a broken system where outdated laws determine 'who deserves the most' in asset distribution—often at the expense of the other parent. But in the end, does the child truly benefit? Or is the system merely placing a dollar amount on parenthood, under the guise of 'the best interest of the child'? The real question is: who was supporting the child in the first place? And if that parent was already fulfilling their responsibilities, how does imposing additional financial burdens serve the child's well-being?  The Bigger Picture: A National Concern  Family law cases impact and affect millions of parents and children across the country; no one is immune from this devastating issue. Studies show that financial hardships, legal complexities, and systemic barriers—such as the lack of affordable legal representation, default judgments, and procedural hurdles—often prevent parents from maintaining meaningful relationships with their children.  Organizations and advocates have been calling for more consistent and fair standards in family courts, ensuring that all parents have a real opportunity to present their case. This Ghosted Father is encouraging the public, legal professionals, and policymakers to join the conversation on creating a system that prioritizes fairness and the best interests of children.  It is time to move beyond a complacent, outdated, and failed system. It is time for equality. It is time to focus on the children—not just the disputes between parents. Too often, custody battles become about 'who wins' rather than ensuring children have the love and support they deserve in the first place. Parents are reduced to case numbers and dollar amounts, where neither they nor their children truly benefit—only a broken system that prioritizes financial calculations over the fundamental role of parenting, rather than supporting both parents equally.
