NEW ORLEANS, LA, February 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Saturday, February 8, 2025, The Leigh Steinberg Superbowl Party held their annual event for the 38th straight year the day before the big game at the historic Jazz Museum in the heart of New Orleans, LA. The event, produced by ZOē Productions, saw world-class athletes, celebrities, and government officials come out to show their support.

His foundation highlights Leigh's 30-year fight to make collision sports safer, and he is committed to making the game we all love safer one player at a time. The foundation is also dedicated to promoting research into concussion causation and cure and to help underserved communities get access to treatment.
