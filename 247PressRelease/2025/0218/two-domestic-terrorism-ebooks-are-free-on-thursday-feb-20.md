# Two Domestic Terrorism eBooks are Free on Thursday, Feb. 20

PORTLAND, OR, February 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The first two books in the The Anti-Hero Rebellions series - fiction that smacks of today's partisan politics - will be available free in eBook on Amazon Thursday, Feb. 20, author Norman Brewer announced. https://rebrand.ly/odddpev  In "Blending In," casualties mount as two ruthless terrorists attack soft targets - a press conference in D.C., an iconic mall in the Heartland. Fear grips the nation. Other right-wing extremists join the horrific crusade.   From Readers' Favorite Five-Star Review: "...Norman Brewer creates a gripping terrorist thriller with characters readers want to follow.... The action is intense and the narrative has strong psychological underpinnings.... Tightly plotted and beautifully written."  In Book 2, "Killer Politics: A Satirical Tale of Homegrown Terrorism," a Trump-like president inspires a white supremacist to attack innocents in a treasonous bid to incite civil war - and defend the "American way of life."   Razor-edged satire in "Killer Politics," aimed at a so-called President Tower, is "keen and stinging," one reviewer said. It can be read as a stand-alone book or a sequel to "Blending In."  Both books are Amazon bestsellers, as is "January 6: A Novel," where democracy comes under siege when the President's rally morphs into a mob and storms the Capitol. Right-wing extremists force a horrific standoff and unleash terrorism nationwide. The President weighs declaring martial law to restore order â€“ and justify refusing to leave office.  January 6: A Novel is an historic thriller that was a 2024 Readers' Favorite Award Finalist.   Brewer worked for The Des Moines Register and Tribune and for Gannett News Service in Washington, D.C., covering Congress, the White House, and pursuing award-winning investigations. He was also Director of Employee Communications at the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. He can be reached at bbyb1@outlook.com.
