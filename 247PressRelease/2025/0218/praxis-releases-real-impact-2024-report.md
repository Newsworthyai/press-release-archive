# Praxis releases "Real Impact 2024" Report

GOSHEN, IN, February 18, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Praxis Investment Management, Inc., a company of Everence Financial® and a leading faith-based investment manager, today released its annual impact report. Real Impact 2024 delivers data and stories of the real-world impact arising from the Praxis team's work to fulfill its stewardship investing mission.   "From screening to positive impact bonds to corporate engagement and community investing, the Praxis Real Impact Report demonstrates the power of values-driven investing," writes Praxis President Chad Horning, CFA® in the report's introduction. "In this fifth edition of our annual impact report, you will find data and evidence of real-world change drawn from across the Praxis ImpactX framework."  The report, like the team's work, is organized around the seven distinct impact strategies that make up the Praxis ImpactX framework:   •	Values + Risk Screening. Praxis screens exclude 5-23% of companies in our stock indices. •	Proxy Voting. Praxis voted on over 16,500 proposals on behalf of shareholders in 2024.  •	Sustainability Integration. Praxis doesn't just screen out; we also invest in—or invest a higher weight into—companies that better represent our core values. •	Positive Impact Bonds. 34.3% of holdings of the diversified Praxis Impact Bond Fund were invested in socially or environmentally targeted impact bonds as of Dec. 31, 2024.  •	Company Engagement. We directly engaged over 20 companies on subjects ranging from human rights and child labor to Creation care. •	Advocacy and Education. Praxis supported three initiatives addressing issues of concern to values-driven investors including tax transparency, the climate crisis and methane emissions. •	Community Development Investing. Partnering with CI and CIP, Praxis now invests more than $25.6 million in CDI as of December 2024.  "At Praxis, our goal is to provide faith-driven investment solutions for clients who are looking to align their investments with their values," said Mark Regier, Vice President of Stewardship Investing. "This year's report dives into the ways that we create the impact our clients are seeking to generate—be it through our support for community development investing that brings critical services to underrepresented communities, our screening out of companies that negatively impact the world around us or the many other ways we use the power of investing to reflect the shared values we hold."
