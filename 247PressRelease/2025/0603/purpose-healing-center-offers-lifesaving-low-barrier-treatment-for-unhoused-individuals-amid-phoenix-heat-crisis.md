PHOENIX, AZ, June 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As Phoenix faces intensifying summer heat, Purpose Healing Center is stepping up to provide critical, accessible care for the city's most vulnerable residents. The Joint Commission-accredited facility is expanding its low-barrier addiction and mental health treatment programs, specifically designed to serve those experiencing homelessness throughout Maricopa County.

Services include medical detox, residential treatment, partial hospitalization (PHP), intensive outpatient programs (IOP), and outpatient care. The center specializes in dual diagnosis treatment, addressing both substance use and co-occurring mental health disorders.   "We are committed to removing barriers to treatment," said a representative from Purpose Healing Center. "Our goal is to provide immediate, compassionate care to those who need it most, especially during dangerous heatwaves this Summer."  To further reduce obstacles to care, Purpose Healing Center offers transportation services for clients within Maricopa County, ensuring that those without reliable means can still access treatment.  The center accepts most private insurance plans and Medicaid (AHCCCS), and also provides options for individuals without insurance, reinforcing its commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.   Purpose Healing Center's facilities are designed to promote healing and comfort, featuring amenities such as an on-site pool and outdoor barbecue area. Clients receive nutritious meals and participate in various therapeutic activities, including individual and group therapy sessions, family counseling, meditation, and yoga.
