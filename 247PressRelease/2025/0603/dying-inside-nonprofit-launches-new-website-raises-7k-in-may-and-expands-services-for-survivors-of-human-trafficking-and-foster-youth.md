HOUSTON, TX, June 03, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dying Inside Nonprofit, a survivor-led organization committed to supporting survivors of human trafficking and youth aging out of foster care, proudly announces the launch of its brand-new website, the successful raise of over $7,000 during the month of May, and the upcoming expansion of vital services including safe housing and holistic healing programs.  The new website serves as a dynamic platform for survivors, donors, and supporters to learn more about the organization's mission, get involved, and access resources—including a newly launched directory of professionals who offer trauma-informed services specifically tailored to survivors and aged-out foster youth. This includes therapists, case managers, legal support, and wellness practitioners who are committed to long-term, survivor-centered care.  "Building this platform has been a labor of love, and we're beyond grateful to Sharon, founder of Lumínosa Creative, for volunteering over 30 hours to bring this vision to life," said Rose Campbell, Founder of Dying Inside Nonprofit. "Her dedication helped give our mission a digital home that reflects the heart of our work." New website is www.dyinginsidenonprofit.org  In addition to the digital growth, Dying Inside is excited to announce that it has raised $7,000 in May, thanks to generous supporters and community partners. Special thanks go to Flyga, the Walmart Spark Good Grants, and numerous small businesses for their donations and ongoing belief in the cause.  This summer, the organization will open a new safe house in Conroe, TX, and break ground on its first trauma-informed community center in Tennessee. These facilities will support survivors through the nonprofit's signature S.U.R.V.I.V.O.R. Program, which provides mental health therapy, animal-assisted healing, gardening, life skills training, and entrepreneurial opportunities.  In June, the organization is preparing to welcome 20+ new survivors into its program—offering a safe, supportive, and empowering space to heal and rebuild.  "Our goal is simple but powerful: to ensure that no survivor ever feels forgotten," said Rose Campbell. "We focus not just on rescue, but on long-term recovery and restoration."
