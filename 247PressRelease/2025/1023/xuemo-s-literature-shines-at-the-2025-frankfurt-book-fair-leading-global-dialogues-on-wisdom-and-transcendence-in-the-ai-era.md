# Xuemo's Literature Shines at the 2025 Frankfurt Book Fair, Leading Global Dialogues on "Wisdom and Transcendence in the AI Era"

FRANKFURT, October 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The 77th Frankfurt Book Fair concluded successfully, drawing more than 4,300 exhibitors from over 90 countries and regions, reaffirming its reputation as the "Olympics of Publishing." Among the many high-profile cultural events, two literary forums themed "Wisdom and Transcendence in the AI Era" stood out, with award-winning writer Xuemo and his works emerging as one of the key highlights of this year's fair.  The forum brought together writers, scholars, publishers, and filmmakers from more than ten countries to discuss how literature can bridge the world and how Xuemo's works inspire humanity to live with greater awareness and compassion.  During the forum, two of Xuemo's latest works—the English edition of Eternal Love and The Way Out: The Rise of Her Wisdom in the AI Era—were officially released, drawing significant attention from the international publishing community.  Claudia Kaiser, Vice President for Asia at the Frankfurt Book Fair, remarked that Xuemo's works reveal the struggle of human nature, the transcendence of spirit, and the collision of individual destinies,offering universal significance that transcends cultural boundaries and touches the shared emotions and reflections of humankind.  Nora Frisch,founder of Drachenhaus Verlag , noted that in an era when technology is reshaping the world, Xuemo's literary value extends beyond literature itself, serving as "a spiritual beacon that safeguards humanity and guides technology toward benevolence."  Professor Shouhui Zhao from the University of Bergen, Norway, observed that the creative spirit of Xuemo resonates with that of Jon Fosse, the 2023 Nobel Laureate in Literature. Both embody what Zhao called a "silent aesthetics" rooted in stillness, endurance, and transcendence—reflecting the profound spiritual dimensions of contemporary literature.  In his own address, Xuemo emphasized that writers must be 'those who light the lamps' in a world of constant change. He stressed that the mission of literature is not merely to narrate the world but to help people reshape their inner mindset—to replace control with compassion and to transcend computation with wisdom. His words sparked strong resonance among the audience, underscoring the irreplaceable spiritual power of literature in the age of artificial intelligence.  The success of this forum not only highlighted the growing global influence of Chinese literature but also marked a new convergence between the spirit of world literature and the evolution of technological civilization.
