# CAHEC Releases 2024 ESG Impact Report Highlighting Progress in Sustainability, Community Investment, and Employee Well-Being

RALEIGH, NC, October 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- We are pleased to announce the publication of our annual ESG (Environmental, Social, & Governance) report. Our 2024 ESG Impact Report provides content and context towards our accomplishments and goals in being a sustainable, resilient, and purposeful organization. Specifically, this year's report builds on the detailed analysis of CAHEC's voluntary ESG frameworks adapted in last year's report, our accomplishments within these frameworks (January 1, 202 – December 31, 2024), and our future initiatives.  Some report highlights include: • CAHEC's voluntary adoption and tracking of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) standards for the 2024 reporting year. • CAHEC's creation of an enhanced investment policy that clearly defines our objectives for sustainable investment and development. • CAHEC's launch of the Mental Health Employee Resource Group (MH-ERG), which was created to raise awareness, normalize conversations around mental health, and connect employees with resources that promote well-being and work-life balance.  President & CEO of CAHEC, Dana Boole, shared that "Our adoption and tracking of GRI, SASB FN-AC, and UN SDG standards is complex, and expanding them year after year to a broader range of affiliates and data points is even more challenging. That dedication, however, is what sets CAHEC apart. Our commitment to ESG is anchored by our overarching values and drive towards being the premier community investment organization in the South."
