# ADAP Advocacy Airs Commercial Calling Out Excessive Executive Compensation for 340B-Eligible Hospital CEOs

WASHINGTON, DC, October 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- ADAP Advocacy today, as part of its 340B Project, aired its latest commercial calling for reforms to the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The commercial calls out excessive executive compensation for 340B-eligible hospital CEOs, asking a critical question: "Is the 340B Drug Pricing Program the Next 'Too Big to Fail'?"  Brandon M. Macsata, CEO of ADAP Advocacy, summarized: "Hospital CEOs are being compensated 200-300% more than the nurses providing the direct patient care, and sometimes even above, largely financed by a program designed to help low-income patients access healthcare services. Anyone who suggests the 340B program isn't benefiting providers and their executives more than patients is being intellectually dishonest. Patients learn about this level of pay and compare it to the medical debt that they're carrying, and it literally makes them sick."   The new commercial is part of the '340B Too Big To Fail' national advocacy campaign, which will run through the end of the year, highlighting hospitals' declining charity, rising healthcare executive compensation, and exploding patient medical debt, among some other issues. ADAP Advocacy's interactive map has elevated these trends.  The commercial is available online at https://youtu.be/Q8zaGIZqDp4.
