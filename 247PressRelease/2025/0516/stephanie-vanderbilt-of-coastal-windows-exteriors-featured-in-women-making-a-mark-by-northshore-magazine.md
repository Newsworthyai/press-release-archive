Why Homeowners Trust Coastal: Q&A with Stephanie Vanderbilt  What advice would you give to other women today?  I remember as a child, my mom said to me, ""You have a gift—a gift of giving."" That message has stayed with me throughout my life. Find your passion, embrace it fully, and use it to serve others. When you lead with passion and empathy, you're not just building a career—you're creating impact, breaking barriers, and shaping a legacy.  What are the secrets to your success?  Our success started in a classroom. As a teacher of the deaf, my passion was helping students understand the world around them. That same mindset—educating first—became the heart of Coastal Windows & Exteriors. We founded the company to be different: to teach, not sell. We focus on transparency, long-term value, and empowering homeowners to make confident decisions about their home improvement projects.  What was your smartest mistake?  Thinking I could do it all myself. I quickly learned that a truly successful business is built on strong values, teamwork, and trust. Letting go of control and surrounding myself with the right people has helped Coastal grow into one of the top-rated remodeling contractors in Massachusetts.  Who have been your greatest mentors?  My parents. They instilled in me a strong work ethic, empathy, and integrity. They taught me that true success isn't just about what you achieve—it's about who you lift up and how you serve others.  What is your biggest priority today?  My top priority is making sure our mission to educate, empower, and serve is felt in every home and every interaction. Whether it's installing replacement energy-efficient windows, adding curb appeal with beautiful new siding, replacing an old leaky roof, installing a custom entry door—or donating roofing systems to veterans through our Roofs for Heroes initiative—we aim to deliver more than just a product. We deliver peace of mind, comfort, and energy savings.  Is there anything else you'd like to share?  This past March we celebrated Women in Construction Week, I'm proud to be part of the 14% of women in this field. Representation matters. Leadership and innovation have no gender. My hope is that by showing up, doing excellent work, and staying true to our mission, we pave the way for the next generation of women in construction and home remodeling in New England.
