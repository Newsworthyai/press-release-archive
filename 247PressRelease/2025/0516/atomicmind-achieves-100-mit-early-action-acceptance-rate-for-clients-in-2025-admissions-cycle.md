# ATOMICMIND ACHIEVES 100% MIT EARLY ACTION ACCEPTANCE RATE FOR CLIENTS IN 2025 ADMISSIONS CYCLE

NEW YORK, NY, May 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- AtomicMind, the premier boutique education consulting firm specializing in elite college admissions, is proud to announce a standout achievement: 100% of its students who applied to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Early Action round for the Class of 2029 were accepted — and all have now officially committed to attend. Among the incoming students is a first-generation AtomicMind Foundation Scholar from New Jersey who is the first in her family to attend college.  This milestone comes during one of the most competitive admissions cycles in history, with MIT's Early Action acceptance rate falling to just 3.5%. MIT was also recently ranked the #1 "dream college" in The Princeton Review's 2025 survey, underscoring the significance of this accomplishment. Amid soaring competition and intensifying applicant pools, AtomicMind's flawless track record speaks volumes about the strength of its mentors and methodology.  AtomicMind's perfect record at MIT continues a pattern of consistent success. In prior years, the firm has achieved 100% Early acceptance rates with applicants to other top-tier institutions, including Harvard, Yale and UChicago. These results reinforce AtomicMind's reputation for delivering exceptional outcomes in an increasingly selective admissions landscape.   This accomplishment is especially meaningful for AtomicMind's founders, CEO Leelila Strogov and President Ernie Liang, both proud MIT alumni. Liang also holds an MBA from Harvard Business School, reflecting the caliber of institutions that shape AtomicMind's leadership.  99% of AtomicMind students are admitted to one of their top three choice schools, a testament to its strategic, personalized approach that ensures students aim for the most competitive institutions that align with their credentials and ambitions. Each success is built on academic distinction, strategic clarity and narrative authenticity.  This sustained performance reflects AtomicMind's signature approach: deeply personalized, long-term development that begins with understanding each student's unique identity, goals, and strengths and culminates in a powerful, authentic application that resonates with admissions committees.  Strogov emphasizes that true admissions success comes from guiding students to unlock their fullest potential, rather than just checking boxes. "Our process is rooted in a deep understanding – and cultivation – of each student's unique strengths and passions," said Leelila Strogov, Founder and CEO of AtomicMind and the AtomicMind Foundation. "MIT seeks fearless thinkers, builders, and problem-solvers — students who demonstrate not just academic excellence, but also initiative, creativity and impact. We help our students bring those qualities to life in a way that appears to resonate with admissions officers."  Students at AtomicMind receive one-on-one mentorship from seasoned advisors and access to a team of over 230 specialists — including former admissions officers, research mentors, published authors, academic Olympiad medalists, and creative professionals. Whether through STEM competitions, writing contests, original research, or social impact work, AtomicMind ensures every element of a student's profile supports their story.   "Our students don't just get in; they develop in multifaceted ways through the journey towards those entry points," said AtomicMind's President, Ernie Liang. "We empower them to develop intellectually, think independently, and pursue ideas that matter. Admissions success is the result of that work, rather than the goal itself."  AtomicMind serves students and families seeking advice and assistance navigating the path towards highly selective secondary schools, colleges and universities in the U.S. and U.K. The firm provides comprehensive support, from elementary school through college and career launch. The AtomicMind Foundation provides pro-bono mentorship to high-achieving high school juniors and seniors from low-income backgrounds in the United States to help them gain admission, and acquire scholarships, to attend elite colleges and universities in the United States. Clients around the world trust AtomicMind for its strategic guidance throughout the educational journey.
