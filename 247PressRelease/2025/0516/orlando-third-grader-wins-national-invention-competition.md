# Orlando Third Grader Wins National Invention Competition

ORLANDO, FL, May 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Aleksey Godovykh, a third-grade student from Pinecrest Preparatory Academy in Orlando, has been named a national winner in the prestigious "Student Ideas for a Better America" competition. This honor celebrates young innovators from across the country whose creative ideas and inventions aim to make the world a better place.  The competition, known for highlighting original, practical, and socially meaningful student inventions, drew entries from across the United States. Aleksey's winning project—a Sustainable Tourism Game—impressed the Selection Committee with its creativity and ingenuity, earning him a certificate of recognition and a monetary award. As a winner, Aleksey is also eligible for induction into the National Gallery for America's Young Inventors, a program that showcases exceptional student contributions and inspires future generations of changemakers.  "Tourism sometimes has negative impacts, so it's important to educate travelers to be sustainable," said Alex. "I found a simple and innovative solution to develop sustainable tourism—educate kids, who will then influence their families to travel sustainably. Kids learn best through play, so games are the most effective way to engage them."  Aleksey enjoys hosting school coding and AI clubs at Pinecrest Preparatory Academy and has earned Principal's Honor Roll recognition each semester, along with many other awards. Outside the classroom, he balances gymnastics competitions, swim meets, music lessons, creative makerspace projects, and other enriching activities.
