# 1939 Fiat Topolino Trasformabile Brings Pre-War Italian Charm to DFW Car and Toy Museum

FORT WORTH, TX, May 16, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum is thrilled to showcase a rare and wonderfully restored piece of automotive heritage: the 1939 Fiat 500 A "Topolino" Transformable. A show-stopping example of pre-war Italian design, this elegant little convertible is part of the esteemed Ron Sturgeon Collection and a standout among the museum's more than 200 vehicles.  Painstakingly restored in Turin, Italy, by renowned craftsman Giorgio Castello, this Fiat Topolino is finished in a classic beige tone with a black beltline and features tan cloth-upholstered seats and matching door panels. The coveted Transformable configuration includes a retractable tan canvas soft top, allowing drivers to embrace open-air motoring in true vintage style.  Under the hood lies a 569cc water-cooled four-cylinder side-valve engine, capable of producing 13 horsepower—a modest output that once powered Italy's people through narrow city streets and winding country roads. Adding to its rarity and historical appeal, this 1939 model includes an original maintenance manual and a replacement (1956) Italian registration booklet—prized documentation for any collector.  "This little Fiat may be small in size, but it carries a massive legacy," said Ron Sturgeon, founder of the DFW Car & Toy Museum. "It's a symbol of pre-war resilience, Italian ingenuity, and timeless design. Having this Topolino in the collection is like having a piece of rolling history."  Often referred to as "Topolino," which means "little mouse" in Italian, the Fiat 500 A remains an icon of affordable, stylish transportation. Its presence at the museum offers guests a rare glimpse into the elegance and charm of 1930s Europe—right in the heart of Fort Worth.  Classic. Charming. Unforgettable.
