# Are We Teaching Our Children To Be Bullies Asks Bestselling Author Jody Sharpe

WILMINGTON, NC, February 22, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As a society, we abhor the bully. The rejection of bullying has taken center stage in our collective consciousness, in large part due to the enhanced communication we experience due to social media. But, perhaps we have to stop for a moment and look at the real cause of bullying. Is it a learned behavior?  In a recent article titled "Our Children Should Be Our #1 Priority To End Bullying," Sharpe wrote in part:  I ask the angels throughout the day what to say in my blogs and words and sentences come to me. So the messages today are about our children and grandchildren. They deserve to learn about respect and kindness. Many children have been the victims of bullying whether they've been picked on for their special needs, or differences in race, color or shy and vulnerable ways. In any situation bullying is destructive to their well being.  Here we are witnessing leaders of our country bullying folks in the news while defending their actions. How sad it is. Don't they know their children and other people's children are watching, listening and learning it's the norm to bully?  When I was young, there was civility mostly in our society. I pray to bring us back to a more respectful world for the sake of our children, grandchildren and all around the world.  Compassion is as much a part of love as kindness is. We need to teach our children to be kind, respectful of others and kind and respectful to themselves. Teaching them every life is precious is primary for them to grow up to be productive, caring adults.  The full text of the article is available at https://jodysharpe.com/blog.  Sharpe recently received an honorable mention in the 2024 National Federation of Press Women's Professional Communication contest at the national level for one of her novels, 'Summer of Angels'.

The synchronicity of events from high school to retirement changed her life for the better, turning her face toward heaven.  Midwest Book Review stated, "Sharpe's ability to see the good in circumstances and people identifies the 'special' in 'special needs' as she delineates her journey through the education system and those teaching and social encounters which changed her perspective and life."  "Teachers (especially those working with special needs kids) will find this spiritual and social reflection easily accessible. It's presented in vignettes which offer small, digestible bites of insight into a world where angels and kindness are present in more than one form."
