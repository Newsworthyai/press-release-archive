# Country Artist Dustin Devine Signs with SSM Nashville Records & Releases His Debut Single, "Half Past Never"

NASHVILLE, TN, February 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hailing from Colorado by way of Oklahoma, Dustin Devine is taking over the Rockies with his old-school country sound. From his earliest childhood memories, it was clear that Dustin was touched by the authentic emotion evoked by the sounds of traditional country music. This sparked a lifelong fascination with the power of music and its importance as an outlet for universal human feelings. Dustin has been performing at venues all over Colorado and when the opportunity arose to come to Nashville, he chomped at the bit. He began writing with established songwriters and producer Dean Scallan on Music Row, leading him to sign a record deal with SSM Nashville Records a year later.  He has been working hard gearing up for the release of his debut single, "Half Past Never" which will be out to country radio this Friday, February 14th. It will be available on all streaming platforms on March 7th. The song written by him and Dustin James is a light-hearted, high-energy number that "feels good". Devine mentions that "On a deeper level I hope that it resonates with the listener who may "be" or may "have been" tossed around a bit and came out smiling and a better person in the long run...after all, we're just human."   "Half Past Never" is a first-person narrative that opens with the early 'inflammatory' stages of lost relationships and self-pity. After this, a sense of worth emerges and then you move forward. The free feeling of liberation kicks in and we celebrate personal growth in the 'repair' stages of healing. His inspiration for the hook line came when he was packing up his guitar one night after a show and overheard a conversation from some audience members. Dustin says he heard a guy ask his date "When can I give you a call?" to which she replied "Never!". After hearing that, he filed it away in the collection of lines that he carries around in his head hoping to repurpose someday.   Forged from stone-cold country and tempered in dance halls and honky-tonks, Dustin's music is built on a solid foundation of timeless classic sounds. It has been polished by life's experiences and decades of honing his craft. Influences stemming from Hank, Haggard, and Jones to Jimmy Martin and Bill Monroe are punctuated by his love of the 90's country sounds that shape his musical identity. As a talented multi-instrumentalist and band leader, Dustin recognizes the importance of connecting with an audience. He hopes to help countless others through musicâ€¦which he believes is "powerful medicine".   To see where Dustin goes next, follow him on his socials @dustindevinemusic!
