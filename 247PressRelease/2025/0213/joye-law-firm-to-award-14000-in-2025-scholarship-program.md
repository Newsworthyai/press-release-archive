# Joye Law Firm to Award $14,000 in 2025 Scholarship Program

CHARLESTON, SC, February 13, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Joye Law Firm is excited to announce the launch of its 2025 Scholarship Program, beginning on February 1st. Since its inception in 2006, the firm has awarded over $300,000 in scholarships to outstanding South Carolina students, reinforcing its commitment to supporting higher education in the state.  This year, the firm is proud to offer seven scholarships, each valued at $2,000, to graduating seniors in South Carolina who plan to pursue higher education at a four-year institution in the fall. The scholarship selection process emphasizes various criteria, including creative endeavors, school activities, leadership roles, special honors and awards, community involvement, academic performance, and professional pursuits.  In an ongoing effort to support historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Joye Law Firm offers a dedicated scholarship for students attending these institutions. This scholarship aims to provide financial assistance to deserving students pursuing their education at an HBCU.  "We believe education is one of the most powerful tools for transforming lives, and our scholarship program is a way to invest in South Carolina's future leaders," said Ken Harrell, Managing Partner at Joye Law Firm. "We understand the financial challenges students face today, and we are proud to offer support to help them achieve their academic and career goals."  Each scholarship applicant can nominate a teacher who has made a significant impact on their academic journey for a teacher prize. Through this initiative, we hope to highlight the importance of educators in shaping the lives of students and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of teachers across South Carolina.    All winning students, their families, and their teacher nominees will be invited to a celebratory banquet in June, where they will be honored for their achievements and contributions. Applications for the Joye Law Firm Scholarships can be submitted online through the firm's website at https://www.joyelawfirm.com/joye-scholarship-program/. The application deadline is May 1st.  Joye Law Firm has been providing legal services to the people of South Carolina for more than 50 years. Founded in 1968, the law firm has offices in Charleston, North Charleston, Columbia, Clinton, Myrtle Beach, and Summerville. As part of the firm's commitment to community service, Joye Law Firm established Joye in the Community—a year‐round program that encompasses the education scholarships and other community activities that the firm supports. The initiative is designed to enrich the lives of everyone involved and raise awareness about the needs of those in the communities we serve.
