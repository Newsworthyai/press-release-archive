# Oregonian High School Seniors Launch BetAIR to Serve Underprivileged Communities

PORTLAND, OR, August 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Wildfire season is drastically in full effect and Oregon is one of the hardest-hit states - along with California, Texas, and Colorado - according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Oregon Governor has already declared a state of emergency due to the intensifying wildfire threat with the Cram fire already burning over 95 thousand acres. Recognizing how the wildfire season grows more hazardous every year, founders Sohan Govindaraju and Shriya Marla started BetAIR to help communities protect themselves from worsening air quality.  BetAIR's founders are two friends - one deeply committed to protecting the environment, the other passionate about people's health, began with the premise that clean air isn't a privilege, but a necessity. Sohan Govindaraju and Shriya Marla co-founded BetAIR, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering communities to reclaim their air. By providing DIY air filter boxes to at-risk households and advocating for cleaner air, the team bridges the gap between environmental stewardship and community health.  "The Oregon Department of Forestry's Urban & Community Forestry unit is a proud supporter of BetAIR and its coalition of community partners who are working to build awareness and address the negative health impacts of wildfire smoke in our state, especially within vulnerable populations," said Scott Altenhoff, Urban & Community Forestry Program Manager. "BetAIR's innovative use of technology and community-centered approach are set to make a positive difference in the lives of those who need it the most."  The dynamic duo has impacted numerous communities across Oregon, including East County, Downtown Portland, Bend, La Pine, Prineville, Sisters, and Warm Springs. They are currently expanding their efforts this summer to build and distribute additional clean air boxes to protect more Oregonians. The team has already visited numerous schools within their local area, reaching over 300 students to increase awareness about smoke, wildfires, air quality and their related impact on public health to the next generation. While BetAIR has been awarded a grant from the Department of Forestry's Urban & Community Forestry unit, the nonprofit is looking for further support to help low-income neighborhoods who often carry the heaviest burden due to limited resources to protect themselves.   Additionally, they have partnered with various local community organizations, government agencies, school districts, and local initiatives to increase awareness of this major public health issue and advocate for better conditions leading to a cleaner, safer Oregon. States beyond Oregon should take notice of this remarkable nonprofit, founded by exceptional high school students, not only for successfully implementing this program but also for helping to raise awareness about the health impact of wildfire smoke.  About BetAIR  BetAIR is a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in Oregon founded by high school students Sohan Govindaraju and Shriya Marla from Jesuit High School. The mission of BetAIR is to harness the power of innovative technology and community collaboration to provide accessible and affordable DIY smart air filtration using Corsi-Rosenthal boxes for vulnerable populations in smoke and wildfire-affected regions. BetAIR strives to improve respiratory health, reduce the adverse effects of wildfire smoke, and promote environmental sustainability. Through their advocacy efforts and partnerships with local and governmental organizations, the nonprofit is dedicated to achieving clean, breathable air for all Oregonians.   About the Founders  Sohan Govindaraju is a rising senior at Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon with an immense passion to use smart technology for developing solutions to address various wildfire and smoke-related issues. Growing up as an Oregonian, he witnessed firsthand the horrors that many Oregonians faced with wildfires and was inspired to do something to address the impact. After the devastating Labor Day Wildfires in 2020, he felt motivated to take strong action. Since then, he has worked on building smart filters and various mathematical models to help people during wildfire emergencies. He is a student researcher, environmental advocate, and a champion for youth-led action for societal benefits. Caring for the environment is one of his top priorities, and he hopes to make a lasting impact on his community. This commitment and mindset led him to co-found BetAIR with that goal in mind.  Shriya Marla is a rising senior at Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon. She champions the cause of affordable smart air filtration systems to protect wildfire-affected communities. Through advocacy and partnerships with local agencies and school districts, she is working to bring clean air solutions to vulnerable populations across Oregon. She has focused on spreading awareness about the importance of health safety, especially to students, during wildfire season and connecting her passion for healthcare with the BetAIR mission. Shriya Marla is a student researcher, community advocate, and performing artist whose interdisciplinary work bridges science, social impact, and the arts and hopes to utilize these avenues as a way to make meaningful change.
