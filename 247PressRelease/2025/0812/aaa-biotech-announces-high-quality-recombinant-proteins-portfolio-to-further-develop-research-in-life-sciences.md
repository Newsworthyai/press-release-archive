# AAA Biotech Announces High-Quality Recombinant Proteins Portfolio to Further Develop Research in Life Sciences

LA JOLLA, CA, August 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With a collection of over 600 recombinant antibodies, AAA Biotech is the global leader in providing the highest quality research reagents.   The company announces more additions of rProteins to expand its product line to enhance biomedical research in life sciences.   Recombinant Proteins to Meet the Needs of the Experiment  AAA Biotech is aiming to provide recombinant proteins worldwide to meet the astronomical arrays of applications and biological targets that researchers strive to achieve in their experiments.   Research in modern life sciences uses recombinant proteins as tools created by specific, controlled genetic engineering methods, where the target genes are expressed in an active system, e.g., E. coli, mammalian cells (HEK293, CHO), yeast, and insect cells for various purposes.  NOTE: The recombinant protein product delivered by the company is strictly controlled in terms of its quality, such as purities usually more than 95% by means of the validated affinity chromatography procedures, and is available in all sorts of formats (such as being multiple tagged (His, GST, FLAG, Fc fusion) to allow simple purification and detection).  Features of Recombinant Proteins Delivered by AAA Biotech  Major features of rProteins provided by AAA Biotech that stand out are:   High Purity & Activity: The Majority of proteins are guaranteed 95% pure, with bioactivity forms being specifically tested.  Various Expression Systems: Proteins can be expressed in a variety of systems, prokaryotic (E. coli), eukaryotic (HEK293, CHO, yeast, insect), to suit folding, post-translational modification, and/or functionality.  Flexible Use: Best suited to scrutinize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, assess functional biological assays, standard ELISA curves, drug discovery, including validation of biomarkers and analysis of immune signaling.  Custom Variants: Flexibility Options in custom expressions and tags are available to meet the requirements of experiments.  Tight QC & Documentation: Selected products are tested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, endotoxin, and, where available, activity assays and Certificates of Analysis on a per-batch basis.  Friendly Formats: Proteins are available in lyophilized or ready-to-use liquid form, which is friendly in storage and handling.  About AAA Biotech  AAA Biotech, Inc. is a trusted provider of high-quality research reagents worldwide. Founded by enthusiastic scientists with a mission to provide the best scientific reagents.   With specialization in providing validated antibodies, ELISA kits, PCR kits, and rProteins, the company has a strong commitment to scientific excellence by supporting researchers in academia and life sciences.
