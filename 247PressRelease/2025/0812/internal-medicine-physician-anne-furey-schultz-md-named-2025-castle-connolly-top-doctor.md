# Internal Medicine Physician Anne Furey Schultz, MD, Named 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor

WESTMONT, IL, August 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Anne Furey Schultz, MD, FACP, NCMP, has been named a 2025 Castle Connolly Top Doctor, a prestigious honor awarded to only about 7 percent of licensed physicians nationwide. This recognition is based on peer nominations and a rigorous, physician-led selection process that identifies leaders in clinical excellence.  A native of Hinsdale, Illinois, Dr. Schultz is the daughter of two physicians and has long been drawn to a profession rooted in listening, empathy, and trust. She earned her medical degree from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and completed her residency in internal medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Schultz co-founded Authentic Internal Medicine, a concierge primary care practice in Chicago's western suburbs. With easy access and longer visits, she is known for cultivating meaningful, long-term patient partnerships and providing outstanding medical care.  "Primary care is the foundation of good medicine," said Dr. Schultz. "From routine check-ups to managing chronic conditions, primary care ensures the right care, at the right time, in one place. Primary care is where you build a trusted relationship with a doctor who really knows you — someone who anticipates and catches problems early and coordinates care if you ever need a specialist."   A board-certified internal medicine physician, Dr. Schultz' clinical interests include cholesterol, high blood pressure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease management and risk reduction. She has additional expertise, training, and certification in menopause and weight management.   "At the first visit, we get to know the patient as a whole person—not just their labs and diagnoses," she said. "We talk about health goals, lifestyle, and the science that informs longevity. This approach allows us to tailor care that's highly personalized and evidence based."  Dr. Schultz is the immediate past governor of the American College of Physicians (ACP) for Northern Illinois. In 2024, she was awarded the ACP Laureate Award, honoring physicians who have demonstrated an abiding commitment to excellence in medical care, education, and community service. Dr. Schultz continues to teach and mentor medical students at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine and is on staff at both Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Central DuPage Hospital.   "Being named a Castle Connolly Top Doctor is deeply meaningful because it is a nomination by my peers, which reflects the trust and respect of those I admire most," said Dr. Schultz.  About Castle Connolly Castle Connolly publishes its Top Doctors list at castleconnolly.com and in a variety of print and online partner publications.
