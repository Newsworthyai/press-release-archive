# Cana Brooks Wins 2025 Jones &amp; Swanson Community Service Scholarship

MARIETTA, GA, August 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jones & Swanson's team of Marietta personal injury lawyers wants the firm's Community Service Scholarship to benefit a student who's made a significant effort to benefit in-need communities. This year, no student embodies that ambition better than Cana Brooks.  Brooks is a Leisure Studies major with a Sports Management concentration at Howard University in Washington, DC. She also has minors in History and Sports Administration. Her passion for athletics and the betterment of others drove her to found Cana Cares. She's committed her organization not only to community outreach but also to the work of transforming the sports industry into "a force for holistic community well-being."  Since Cana Cares' founding, Brooks has:  - Hosted a GoFundMe that raised $1,300 for youth experiencing homelessness in her community - Organized food and clothing drives - Collected school supplies on behalf of in-need families - Overseen baby blanket crafting events, donating those blankets to new families - Raised money on behalf of St. Jude - Provided gifts to foster children - Overseen monthly service projects that put young people in charge of community betterment  Brooks isn't content to rest on her laurels, either. She intends to pursue 501(c)(3) status for Cana Cares, a process that would allow her to provide outreach to in-need communities on a national level. She hopes that greater outreach will allow her to create sports-based mentorship programs and to partner with professional athletes while spearheading community initiatives.   In Brooks' own words, "A winning season isn't just about the trophies, it's about the lives we uplift along the way."  Brooks is exactly the kind of student Jones & Swanson wants to honor with its Community Service Scholarship. The team hopes that its $2,500 award will make it easier for Brooks to balance her academic responsibilities and Cana Cares' growth.
