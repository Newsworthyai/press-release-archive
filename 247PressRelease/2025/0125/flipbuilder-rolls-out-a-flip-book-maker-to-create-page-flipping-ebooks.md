# FlipBuilder Rolls out a Flip Book Maker to Create Page-Flipping Ebooks

HONG KONG, January 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Businesses are encountering the challenge of standing out and capturing the attention of the audience with impressive digital content. They continuously seek a flexible and cost-effective solution that enables them to engage more audiences. FlipBuilder solves the issue with an interactive flip book maker, Flip PDF Plus Pro.  The innovative flip book maker is developed to turn any PDF into a flipbook with realistic page-turning animations every time readers turn to the next page. It brings a dynamic touch to users' digital content, helping them easily captivate the audience and create an enjoyable reading experience.  The appearance of a flipbook is an important factor in determining the success of digital content for users. With an array of pre-designed layouts, themes, and animated scenes, users can make the flipbook align with their content and specific needs. For example, the snow-falling animation and winter-themed background create an ideal atmosphere for a Christmas-themed flipbook.  Customization and personalization are enabled by the versatile flip book maker which offers an easy-to-use multimedia editor. Users are able to add images, videos, audio, texts, and GIFs to flipbooks, spicing up their content effortlessly. This feature is particularly useful for businesses to craft informative and engaging product catalogs where each item will appear with attractive visuals and descriptions. Hence, they will have a higher chance of landing successful leads. Flip PDF Plus Pro also supports users in inserting links into multimedia elements. This means that businesses can redirect readers to product pages after they click the images, videos, and GIFs, which increases website traffic and boosts conversion.  In addition, this flip book maker takes this potential conversion one step ahead with customizable buttons. Companies can embed their photo numbers onto buttons for direct calls or set up specific windows to pop up when buttons are clicked. Hence, the book design software not only enhances the interactivity of flipbooks but also amplifies users' digital marketing efforts.  "We developed our flip book maker with multiple users in mind, one of which is business users. Flip PDF Pro Plus facilitates them to create interactive flipbooks from PDFs, helping them showcase their products with captivating images, videos, and GIFs. Users can also insert their logos to create branded flipbooks, improving brand awareness and flourishing their business easily," said Winston Zhang, CEO of FlipBuilder.
