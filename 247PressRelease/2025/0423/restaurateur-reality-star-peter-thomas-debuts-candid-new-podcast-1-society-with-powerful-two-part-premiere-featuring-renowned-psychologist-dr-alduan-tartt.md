# Restaurateur & Reality Star Peter Thomas Debuts Candid New Podcast "1 Society" with Powerful Two-Part Premiere Featuring Renowned Psychologist Dr. Alduan Tartt

ATLANTA, GA, April 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Reality TV personality, entrepreneur, and nightlife connoisseur Peter Thomas is taking the conversation deeper with the launch of his new podcast, "1 Society Podcast Live with Peter Thomas & Friends." Designed as a space for unfiltered, thought-provoking dialogue, the show explores the intersection of life, love, and everything in between, with Thomas getting real like never before.  The premiere kicks off with Part I of an emotional two-part series featuring Dr. Alduan Tartt, a nationally respected psychologist and mental health advocate. In this deeply personal episode, Thomas opens up for the first time about his private battles with trauma, isolation, and the emotional weight of past experiences. With Dr. Tartt's thoughtful guidance, Thomas begins to unpack the lingering pain that haunts him and explores what healing truly requires—vulnerability, forgiveness, and self-compassion.  "I've always worn the mask of strength, but this conversation reminded me that being strong also means knowing when to let go and be honest with yourself first," says Thomas.   Listeners will hear Thomas reflect on the small moments that offered light in the darkest times and the internal work required to build healthier relationships, especially with himself. During their dialogue, Thomas begins a powerful shift in perspective that lays the foundation for Part II, where the conversation continues with even deeper revelations and practical tools for emotional wellness.  Thomas shares, "I want to help men heal by revealing my truth while working through my traumas."   Produced by veteran storyteller Shanté Paige of She's A Movement Media Group, and directed by Darion East of Dreamwave Agency, "1 Society" is taped live on Tuesdays at 1 Society Restaurant in Norcross, GA, and premieres weekly on YouTube each Wednesday at @1societypodcast.
