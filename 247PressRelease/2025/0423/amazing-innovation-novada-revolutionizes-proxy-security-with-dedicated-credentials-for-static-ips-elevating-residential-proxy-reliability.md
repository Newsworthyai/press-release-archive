# Amazing innovation! Novada Revolutionizes Proxy Security with Dedicated Credentials for Static IPs, Elevating Residential Proxy Reliability

NEW YORK, NY, April 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Novada, a leading provider of high-performance proxy solutions, today unveiled Dedicated Credentials for Static IPs, a significant security enhancement assigning unique username and password pairs to individual static IP addresses. This upgrade offers users enhanced security, control, and risk isolation when utilizing Novada's proxy services.  Traditional static IP configurations often rely on shared credentials, creating a potential vulnerability where a single compromised login could expose multiple IP addresses. Novada's new Dedicated Credentials feature directly addresses this by ensuring each static IP operates with its own distinct login details. This one-to-one mapping effectively isolates risk, meaning that if one credential pair is compromised, the security of other assigned IPs remains unaffected.  Key benefits of the Dedicated Credentials feature include:  1. Automatic Risk Isolation: Each IP's security is independent, preventing cascading failures from a single breached credential. 2. Seamless Integration: Existing static IPs continue to function without interruption. Users can easily upgrade specific IPs to Dedicated Credentials anytime via the Novada dashboard. 3. Combined Power: Users can leverage this enhanced security alongside Novada's premium network of over 100 million ethically sourced residential IPs spanning 220 countries, benefiting from both robust access control and the advantages of authentic, human-like Browse patterns for tasks like geo-targeting and data collection.  This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce operators seeking to prevent account bans by assigning unique, secure IP-credential sets to each online store. Data teams gain more secure web scraping capabilities through isolated logins combined with reliable IP infrastructure. For users requiring different configurations, custom shared credential options remain available upon request.  "Novada's tools let us scale securelyâ€”no more choosing between speed and safety," stated Mark R., CTO of a leading ad-tech firm that experienced a 90% reduction in credential-related downtime after implementing Dedicated Credentials across 2,000 IPs.
