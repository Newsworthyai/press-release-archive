# Bizarre Coffee Brewing Up Its Third Metro Atlanta Location in Roswell, GA

ATLANTA, GA, April 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Expanding into its third location, independent coffee shop Bizarre Coffee has signed a 3,500-square-foot lease in Roswell, GA, in the heart of the North Atlanta community's thriving retail and restaurant district. Targeting a fall 2025 opening for what will become its largest location to date, Bizarre Coffee's new shop will offer an expanded menu that will include specialty cocktails in addition to its signature coffee blends and extensive food menu.  Stephany Cruz of Ackerman Retail represented Bizarre Coffee in its lease at 1090 Alpharetta Street in Roswell, and Megann Poe of Dart Retail represented the landlord. The Roswell shop will join Bizarre Coffee's two other locations in Woodstock, GA and Canton, GA.  Founded by Sabrina Kaylor, Bizarre Coffee began in 2020 as a farmer's market favorite, where she introduced the brand's "Good Mood Juice" slogan. She opened her first brick-and-mortar location in downtown Canton later that year and followed with a second storefront in downtown Woodstock in 2023.  "Bizarre has always been about more than just coffee—it's about creativity, connection, and community," said Sabrina Kaylor, who owns Bizarre Coffee with her husband, Michael. "Evolving with our community and really listening to their needs is everything to us. This new shop gives us the space to do just that—with room to gather, host events, and build a true third place. We're expanding the menu a bit, adding craft cocktails, and creating something that feels even more like home."  "I'm thrilled that we succeeded in securing this location adjacent to the bustling Roswell historic district. The charming turn-of-the-century building provides beautiful interior spaces and expansive outdoor patios that provide the perfect setting for this brand," said Stephany Cruz of Ackerman Retail, a division of Ackerman & Co. "I'm representing Bizarre Coffee in its ongoing expansion, with a focus on Northwest Atlanta communities such as Acworth, Cartersville, Kennesaw and Marietta.   Producing coffees in its own roastery, the shop offers varieties such as Freakish Dark Roast, Jammin' Toast Medium Roast and Ethiopian Light Roast. Customers can enjoy coffee and specialty drinks in-store or order packaged coffees online, with the option to become a subscriber to save 10% off each order. Bizarre Coffee also features smoothies, bowls, bagels, sandwiches, breakfast burritos, avocado toast and more. Specialty drinks include Wanderlust Latte (with honey, almond and vanilla), S'more Me Plz (toasted marshmallow and mocha latte) and a variety of "soft sips" including Blueberry Matcha Lemonade.  About Bizarre Coffee Founded in early 2020 by Sabrina Kaylor, an artist and digital marketer from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Bizarre Coffee combines a passion for coffee with a flair for art. Supported by her husband, Michael, Sabrina created a coffee brand that blends joy, creativity, and community spirit. The story began at local farmers' markets in Canton, GA, where Sabrina and her team introduced their "Good Mood Juice" and vibrant, funky branding. Just six months later, they opened the first Bizarre Coffee shop on East Marietta Street in Canton, transforming the space into a colorful, uplifting atmosphere with Sabrina's artistic touch. Bizarre Coffee's quirky and creative spirit is evident in everything it does, from whimsical drink designs to seasonal menus.
