# Kairon Pictures Welcomes Wenrui Zhao as Lead Sound Mixer &amp; Designer for Feature Film Road Test

LOS ANGELES, CA, August 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Kairon Pictures L.L.C. is proud to announce that acclaimed sound designer Wenrui Zhao has officially joined the creative team of its upcoming feature film, Road Test, as Lead Sound Mixer and Sound Designer. The production is slated to run from March 1, 2027 through November 1, 2027.  Directed by Jackie Xing (Festival favorite and award-winning filmmaker), with John Zeng as Director of Photography, Maya Peters as Production Designer, and Keith Leung as Lead Editor, Road Test brings together a distinguished team of emerging voices committed to inventive, character-driven storytelling.  A comedy-drama infused with high stakes, humor, and heart, Road Test follows a journalist who, fresh off failing her road test, agrees to drive a daredevil wingsuit flyer to his career‑defining jump—despite not holding a license. Along the way, she wrestles with disastrous driving lessons, an unforgiving examiner, and her own ambitions, chasing a story that could finally prove her worth.  As Lead Sound Mixer and Designer, Zhao will oversee all aspects of the film's audio experience, guiding it from pre‑production planning through to the final theatrical mix. His responsibilities will range from capturing dialogue during challenging car interiors and action sequences, to creating immersive ambiences and original sound motifs that bring unique identity and emotional weight to the film. Zhao will also spearhead Foley design, ADR, and soundscape integration with the film's score—treating sound not as accompaniment, but as a living part of the storytelling canvas.  "Sound is the invisible architecture of a film—it shapes tension, amplifies humor, and carries emotion where words cannot," said Zhao. "Road Test presents an extraordinary opportunity to craft a sonic journey that is as unpredictable, chaotic, and heartfelt as the story itself."  Producer Keith Leung added: "We are thrilled to have Wenrui leading sound on Road Test. His artistry and technical mastery ensure that the film's mix of comedy, intimacy, and adrenaline will resonate with audiences in profound and inventive ways. Sound is vital to this film's identity, and Wenrui's vision makes him the perfect collaborator."  Road Test is being developed and produced under Kairon Pictures L.L.C., an independent production company dedicated to bold, innovative cinema that resonates with international audiences.
