Joining them was Australian-Maori fighter Moana Watene (18) , together showcasing their skills and resilience against the world's best Muay Thai practitioners.  This journey to Thailand wasn't solely about individual victories; it was a powerful statement of cultural pride and a beacon of hope for the youth back home in South Auckland. These young athletes, training primarily out of Oliver MMA South Auckland and Victorious Muaythai Brisbane, are embodying a message that transcends the sport itself: dedication and perseverance can forge a path to a better life, even when faced with adversity and starting from a place like Manukau.

I wanna be that guide cause I had no one back then"   Battles Beyond the Ring: "They tried to screw us up, but we pulled through" The path to glory, however, was fraught with challenges. The team's candid reflection, "They tried to screw us up, but we pulled through," speaks volumes about the obstacles they overcame. These ranged from the relentless demands of elite training and the mental fortitude required to compete internationally, to the constant specter of injury inherent in combat sports. Yet, with each hurdle, they proved their mettle, showcasing resilience not just as fighters, but as individuals deeply committed to their aspirations.  A critical moment arrived during their tour when Jackie, a leader in the group, sustained another arm injury. Instead of faltering, his teammates rallied with impressive determination. Johnny and Cam, both demonstrating skill and composure beyond their years, stepped up to secure vital victories in their respective bouts. Moana Watene, the young Australian-Maori fighter whose journey intertwines her Maori heritage with her Australian upbringing, further exemplified the team's spirit by delivering a knockout win, pushing the team forward. Her performance underscored the collective strength and unity that defines this group, demonstrating that even when a team member faces personal setbacks, the shared determination can lead to triumph.  Representing Home: The Black Jersey and Beyond A central theme of their efforts is the desire to represent New Zealand. Jackie expressed pride after a win at Rajadamnern Stadium: "Proud I got to Represent New Zealand & Get that W. Hands down, hardest fight I've had yet & such a war with my Opponent. Fighting at Rajadamnern Stadium has been one of my dreams. Only Harder from here." This statement shows their pride in representing Aotearoa. Their victories are for themselves, their families, their South Auckland communities, and the nation.  Mentorship and Inspiration: A Legacy for South Auckland's Youth Jackie, Johnny, Cam, and Moana also aim to inspire young people, particularly those in South Auckland's diverse communities. They understand the challenges that can affect young lives. They offer a path through martial arts. By sharing their journey from Manukau to international rings, they hope to empower the next generation of fighters to pursue their dreams and seek better opportunities.  Their message is clear: success requires effort and belief. The path will be challenging, with setbacks and doubts. With dedication, support from gyms like Oliver MMA South Auckland and Victorious Muaythai Brisbane, and self-belief, it's possible to "pull through" and achieve greatness. Their story shows that a young person from Manukau can represent their home and inspire others.  They invite viewers to "take it from our video on Instagram". This digital view captures the passion, hard work, and determination that drives them to honor their home, New Zealand, through Muay Thai. Rewa hard. 267. - our home.
