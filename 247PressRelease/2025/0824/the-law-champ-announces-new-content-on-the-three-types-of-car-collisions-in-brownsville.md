# The Law Champ Announces New Content on the 'Three Types of Car Collisions' in Brownsville

BROWNSVILLE, TX, August 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Villarreal Law Firm, a top-rated personal injury law firm serving Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, is proud to announce new content focused on the three types of car accidents and how to avoid car crashes in general. The latest post, entitled "Do You Know What Are the Three Types of Collisions in a Car Crash?" is now available at: https://jvlawfirm.net/do-you-know-what-are-the-three-types-of-collisions-in-a-car-crash/  "As we head back to school, there is always an uptick in injury accidents," explained Javier Villarreal, lead accident attorney. "Our new post helps people understand the mechanics of a car crash. People often don't realize the forces involved and the significant damage they can cause to both individuals and property. That's why our attorneys and staff help clients not only with the legal issues, but also with what we call, "Total Recovery," that is, medical appointments, time off from work, and everything in between."  The new content explains that during a car crash, there are three types of collisions: the vehicle's impact, the body's internal impact, and the vehicle-to-person damage to muscles, bones, or organs. This simple, educational breakdown helps drivers and passengers understand the hidden dangers of even "minor" accidents. Rio Grande Valley residents are encouraged to read the new post, and if – God forbid – they are involved in an injury accident, they are invited to reach out for a free consultation. No two accidents are alike.

Whether a person is involved in a crash on the expressway in Brownsville or at an intersection in Harlingen, the message is clear: legal support is available.
