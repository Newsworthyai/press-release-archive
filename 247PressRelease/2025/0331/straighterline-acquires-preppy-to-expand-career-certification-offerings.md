# StraighterLine Acquires Preppy to Expand Career Certification Offerings

ARLINGTON, VA, March 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In-demand online education leader StraighterLine announces the acquisition of Preppy, providing learners with affordable, accessible career and certification training, catapulting professionals to new heights. Preppy offers online training courses, mentorship, job-ready certifications, and development tools designed to make an impact on career advancement for in-demand careers, including medical assistants, dental assistants, pharmacy technicians, and more.  "As a leader in helping students reduce debt, expand opportunities, and achieve goals, StraighterLine perfectly aligns with Preppy's flexible educational pathways to empower students to succeed both academically and professionally," said Matt Hulett, CEO of StraighterLine. "Expanding into certifications positions StraighterLine as the most comprehensive platform for learners at every stage, from general education to industry credentials and professional certifications."   The acquisition of Preppy comes at a critical time, as job openings for essential roles are projected to continue to surge. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment in healthcare occupations is expected to grow by 13% from 2021 to 2031, adding about two million new jobs over the next decade. Similarly, the early childhood teaching profession will face significant demand, with 106,500 annual openings expected for kindergarten and elementary school teachers replacing workers transitioning to other occupations or exiting the labor force.  "These workforce gaps highlight the need for accessible and effective training programs like those offered by Preppy, designed to help fill these roles," explained Hulett.  Preppy is now added to the rapidly growing portfolio of education brands under StraighterLine, joining notable early childhood professional development providers ChildCare Education Institute and ProSolutions Training. Over 200,000 individual learners utilize services annually across its brands to accelerate their education and career advancement. As the leading provider of high-quality online courses partnering with colleges, universities, and businesses around the world, StraighterLine's acquisition of Preppy solidifies its place as the industry leader for online education.   "Offering accessible, high-quality, and immersive services is at the heart of what we do, so partnering with a company like StraighterLine with the same core values was imperative," said Grant Aldrich, founder of Preppy.
