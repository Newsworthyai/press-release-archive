# The New BlackPast.org 3.0 Has Launched

SEATTLE, WA, March 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On March 10, 2025, BlackPast.org launched 3.0, marking the most significant transformation of the world's largest online encyclopedia on African American and Global African history in its 18-year history. This new upgrade, supported by a major grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, offers visitors a modern, user-friendly experience that makes exploring Black history easier and more engaging than ever. The website features a fresh new look with a sleek design for better readability and accessibility. We have also enhanced the site navigation and search functionality to help users locate and access content faster. While exploring our database of more than 10,000 pages of information, visitors will find added features to individual entries and article pages, including related topics for further reading. By improving our technology, BlackPast.org is committed to continuing to reach millions of people and attract new audiences around the world.   With this new launch we remain committed to researching and discovering new information that will be standard in textbooks for future generations. We firmly believe that free, reliable, and unlimited access to this constantly expanding information is central to our core mission, particularly in these times when there are concerted efforts, on both the local and federal levels, to erase Black history from the public view.  BlackPast.org is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization that relies primarily on individual donors to support our mission. We were founded on February 1, 2007, conceived to provide reference information on people of African ancestry in the United States and around the world. The website is supported by a volunteer staff and nearly 1,000 volunteer content contributors from six continents, where new features are added regularly. BlackPast.org facilitates partnerships with industry, academia, and philanthropy, which deliver education and information on notable Black individuals and events that impact humanity.
