FORT WORTH, TX, March 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The DFW Car & Toy Museum proudly announces the arrival of an automotive masterpiece— the 2002 Aston Martin V12 Vanquish—now on display as part of the Ron Sturgeon Collection. With only 2,589 examples ever built between 2001 and 2007, this high-performance grand tourer represents the pinnacle of British engineering and design.  Powered by a 5.9-liter DOHC V12, the Vanquish was factory-rated at 460 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, sending power to the rear wheels through an electro-hydraulically operated six-speed automated transmission and a limited-slip differential. Designed by the legendary Ian Callum, its striking aluminum body panels sit atop a lightweight aluminum-composite and carbon-fiber chassis, ensuring both speed and agility. Stopping power is equally impressive, with Aston Martin-branded calipers and cross-drilled, ventilated rotors at all four corners.  Inside, luxury meets performance with an array of premium features, including push-button ignition, navigation, Alcantara headliner, automatic climate control, and a premium sound system. The cockpit is adorned with leather and alloy trim, while a steering wheel with paddle shifters frames white dial instrumentation, including a 210-mph speedometer and 7k-rpm redline tachometer. A true driver's dream, this Vanquish's digital odometer reads 27,000 miles, preserving its legacy as one of the most coveted Aston Martins of its time.
