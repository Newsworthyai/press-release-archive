# Tina Brinkley Potts Launches Trailblazers Academy to Help Educated Women Turn Their Expertise into Profitable Thought Leadership Brands

PHILADELPHIA, PA, March 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Multi-award-winning business strategist, author, and executive producer Tina Brinkley Potts has announced the launch of Trailblazers Academy, a premier thought leadership incubator designed to help highly educated and experienced women monetize their intellectual property and build legacy-driven businesses.  As layoffs continue to impact professionals across industries—especially those with advanced degrees—many find themselves disillusioned by the lack of security in traditional employment. Trailblazers Academy offers a powerful solution: instead of searching for the next unstable job, leverage your expertise to build a business rooted in your knowledge, purpose, and personal brand.  "There are too many brilliant women with letters behind their names—PhDs, MBAs, JDs—being forced to settle for roles that diminish their worth," said Potts. "Trailblazers Academy teaches them how to turn their hard-earned knowledge into income, influence, and impact."  The program combines strategic coaching, business automation, visibility positioning, and systems that support rapid and sustainable growth. Built inside Potts' exclusive digital ecosystem, the YOUniverse, Trailblazers Academy guides women through the transition from overlooked professional to powerful thought leader.  To celebrate the launch, Potts is offering a 7-Day Exclusive Preview, allowing participants to walk through the experience before making a full commitment. This immersive preview gives women a chance to experience the transformation, understand the tools, and reconnect with their value.  As a Fast Action Bonus, the first 25 individuals who enroll in Trailblazers Academy after completing the preview will receive a Done-With-You Book Project—a high-impact positioning tool that helps them become published and seen as an authority in their space.  "This isn't just about building a business," Potts added. "It's about reclaiming your voice, your freedom, and your future—on your terms."
