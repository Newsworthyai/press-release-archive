# Poets&Quants™ Honors Best & Brightest Business Majors For 2025

OAKLAND, CA, March 31, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Poets&Quants For Undergrads, the leading news source for undergraduate business education, has released its 10th annual "Best & Brightest Business Majors" feature. The story honors 100 of the most accomplished seniors who majored in fields like business administration, marketing, finance, and operations.   "The best word to describe this year's Best & Brightest is entrepreneurial," says Jeff Schmitt, Poets&Quants' senior writer who launched the series in 2016. "And I don't just mean they're launching businesses. They're the ones starting clubs and events and organizing workshops and study sessions. A good word for them is proactive: They identify a need and take action. They're also unifying forces – the glue – who can adapt to anyone and bring out their best. In some ways, that's because they have the courage to start conversations and ask questions. More important, they're the ones everyone knows will follow through.   This year's 100 Best & Brightest feature includes students like David Elias Kurzmann. An ESCP Business School senior, Kurzmann's vipi.education startup provides student-led tutoring services across Europe. The list also includes Stephen Mitchell, the Men's Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year by the Big East Conference and Marquette University's Most Outstanding Senior in both Finance and Information Systems. Lehigh University's Skyler Mott is not only captain of the track and field team, but operates a realty business whose properties carry a combined a $5-million-dollar valuation. At Texas Christian University's Neeley School, Kassidy Allen devoted over 200 hours to her peers as a consultative selling coach. Along the way, she earned the business school's Junior of the Year and the Texas Business Hall of Fame's Future Texas Business Legend awards.  To compile this year's Best & Brightest students, Poets&Quants reached out to the 50 highest-ranked schools in its 2024 Undergraduate Business School Ranking, with student representatives come from programs ranging from the Wharton School to the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School.
