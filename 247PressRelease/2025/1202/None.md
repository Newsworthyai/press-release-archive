# The Dairy Alliance Fuels Student Athletes at 2025 VHSL Football Championships

ATLANTA, GA, December 02, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit funded by dairy farm families in the Southeast, will be on site to fuel student athletes and fans at the 2025 Virginia High School League (VHSL) Football Championships. The nonprofit plans to deliver nutrient-rich real dairy milk and branded swag to attendees at the Class 5 and Class 6 championship games on December 13, 2025, at James Madison University.   Milk's Got Game® anchors The Dairy Alliance's presence at the Class 5 and Class 6 championships, fueling athletes with real dairy milk that supports strength, energy, and recovery. Each serving delivers complete, high-quality protein that helps athletes in muscle building and recovery, natural electrolytes for hydration through long plays, and carbohydrates for energy that helps replenishment after intense games.   "The performance of these athletes demands strength, stamina, and fast recovery. Real dairy milk delivers all three," said Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at The Dairy Alliance. "Our team proudly supports all athletes and celebrates their hard work and dedication with the simple, powerful fuel of real dairy milk that fits into any routine, from breakfast to post-game cooldowns."   Throughout championship day, fans and families can connect with The Dairy Alliance team, enjoy real dairy milk, and learn more about real dairy's benefits for active lifestyles. By bringing this performance-focused fuel directly to championship weekend, The Dairy Alliance deepens its longstanding partnership with VHSL and supports athletes who push for endurance, power, and peak performance on game day.   "We're thankful for The Dairy Alliance's continued partnership and their commitment to our mission of supporting student-athletes," said VHSL Executive Director Ty Gafford. "Their involvement at VHSL events reflects a shared dedication to the growth, health, and success of high school sports across Virginia."   Throughout the year, The Dairy Alliance supports athletes of all ages. Through its Milk's Got Game® campaign, the organization partners with collegiate and high school athletes to promote real dairy milk's benefits.
