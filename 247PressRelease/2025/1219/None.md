# Bradley Hisle Featured in Leading Business Publication Highlighting His Impact on Healthcare and Leadership

LOS ANGELES, CA, December 19, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Bradley Hisle, founder of Pinnacle Health Group, has been profiled in a prominent feature published by a respected business and finance outlet. The article offers a detailed look at Hisle's professional journey, highlighting his structure-first leadership style and the systems-focused approach that has shaped the growth of his healthcare company across Florida and California.  The piece explores Hisle's early beginnings in Saint Paul, Minnesota, his time at Minnesota State University, and the pivotal moment when he shifted from trying to do everything himself to building a company that runs with clear roles, smart systems, and empowered teams.  "I thought being involved in everything made me a good leader," Hisle says in the interview. "In reality, I was just holding up progress."  With burnout on the rise across leadership roles globally, Hisle's model—focused on clarity, delegation, and sustainable systems—offers a timely example of how to scale responsibly without losing control or momentum.  "I can step away for a day, and nothing breaks," he adds. "That's not luck. That's structure."  The feature paints a picture of a modern founder who values consistency over chaos and long-term sustainability over constant hustle. It also positions Hisle as a standout voice in the healthcare space and an example for other entrepreneurs looking to grow without burning out.
