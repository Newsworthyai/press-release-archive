# IFPG Named No. 1 Franchise Broker Organization by Entrepreneur for the Seventh Year

PARLIN, NJ, September 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- IFPG has once again been named the No. 1 franchise broker organization on Entrepreneur's prestigious Top Franchise Suppliers list, marking its seventh consecutive year in the top spot. The ranking, which is featured in the September/October 2025 issue of Entrepreneur magazine and on Entrepreneur.com, spotlights the top service providers in 13 categories, drawing attention to the vital but often overlooked role of suppliers and vendors.   "We are thrilled," said IFPG CEO and Founder Don Daszkowski. "Even though we've been recognized multiple times, it never gets old. It's a testament to our amazing team and our commitment to continual improvement."  In addition, the IFPG Retreat — the organization's signature annual conference — was named a Top Franchise Event for the second year in a row. The Retreat is IFPG's largest gathering, drawing hundreds of leading consultants, franchisors and suppliers. The three-day event blends workshops, networking and presentations in a setting known for its energy and welcoming atmosphere.  "I always say when you have the best franchise consultants, you win. And we do! That's why the IFPG Retreat continues to be such a must-attend event," said IFPG President Red Boswell.  Entrepreneur's Top Franchise Suppliers ranking is based on an annual survey of franchisors, from emerging brands to some of the oldest in the industry. This year, more than 1,100 franchise brands participated, telling Entrepreneur which suppliers they and their franchisees work with and rating their satisfaction with those suppliers' services in the areas of quality, cost and value. Each supplier received a score based on the survey results, and the top-scoring suppliers are ranked within their respective categories.  "Behind every great franchise system is a network of exceptional suppliers who make success possible," said Entrepreneur's editor-in-chief, Jason Feifer. "This list, based on direct feedback from franchisors themselves, identifies the partners who consistently deliver the expertise and support that separate thriving franchise systems from struggling ones."
