# Central California Blood Center, Cayenne Wellness Center and B Awesum Hosts Blood Drive in Honor of Sickle Cell Awareness Month

FRESNO, CA, September 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Every two seconds, someone in the United States needs blood. For people living with sickle cell disease, the need is even more urgent—many rely on regular transfusions to manage complications and improve quality of life. Yet, less than 5% of eligible Americans donate blood each year, creating a constant shortage for patients who depend on it most. In recognition of Sickle Cell Awareness Month, the following partners are coming together to host a   Community Blood Drive: Central California Blood Center Cayenne Wellness Center  B Awesum  River Park – Art Groove Gallery Fresno Metro Black Chamber of Commerce  Event Details: Date: Thursday, September 25, 2025 Time: 4:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. Location: River Park's Art Groove Event Center 80 E. Via Del Oro, Fresno, CA 93720  This collaboration highlights a critical need: patients with sickle cell disease often require frequent transfusions, and the best matches typically come from African American donors.

"For sickle cell warriors, a single donation can mean fewer hospital visits, better health outcomes, and the priceless gift of hope."
