# Dr. Roseann Capanna-Hodge to Address Youth Mental Health Crisis at NRBS Conference in NYC

NEW YORK, NY, September 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With rates of anxiety, depression, and behavioral struggles among children and teens at historic highs, the call for fresh, science-driven solutions has never been louder. Answering that call, Dr. Roseann Capanna-Hodge, one of the nation's leading voices in children's mental health, will speak at the Northeast Region Biofeedback Society (NRBS) 2025 Annual Conference, taking place October 24–26, 2025 in New York City.  Dr. Roseann's presentation, "The Hidden Epidemic: Emotional Dysregulation in Today's Youth," will expose how nervous system dysregulation lies at the root of many mental health and learning challenges—and why conventional approaches often miss the mark. She will share practical, brain-based strategies that can be used by clinicians, educators, and parents to calm stress, improve focus, and help children thrive in an overstimulated world.  "We are facing a youth mental health crisis, but the real issue isn't just anxiety or attention—it's dysregulation of the nervous system," said Dr. Roseann. "When we calm the brain first, kids can focus, learn, and heal. That's the shift I'll be bringing to NRBS 2025."  A Conference Bringing Together the Best Minds in Mental Health  NRBS 2025 is set to feature an extraordinary lineup of thought leaders, including:  Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. — world-renowned trauma expert and author of The Body Keeps the Score  Thomas Campbell, M.D. — physician, researcher, and bestselling author on nutrition and lifestyle medicine  Erik Peper, Ph.D., BCB — authority on optimizing health and learning in a digital-stress world  Stoyan Vezenkov, Ph.D. — researcher on screen addiction and brain development  Marina Makous, M.D. — physician specializing in neuroinflammation and mental health  Lynda Thompson, Ph.D. — global leader in neurofeedback and clinical success  Together, these speakers will share groundbreaking insights and practical interventions that blend neuroscience, biofeedback, and integrative health approaches.  Why Parents and Professionals Should Pay Attention Diagnosed anxiety among adolescents increased by 61% between 2016 and 2023, while depression diagnoses rose by 45% in the same period. Today, nearly 1 in 5 teens lives with a diagnosed mental or behavioral condition—and many still struggle to access appropriate care. Emotional dysregulation alone is estimated to affect 30–50% of children in clinical settings, yet it often goes unrecognized in schools and families.  The NRBS 2025 Conference isn't just for clinicians—it's one of the few events where scientists, practitioners, educators, and parents converge around solutions for these urgent challenges:  For practitioners: Cutting-edge clinical tools in biofeedback, neurofeedback, and trauma care to expand treatment options and improve patient outcomes.  For educators: Actionable classroom strategies that directly reduce stress and improve learning in an era when dysregulation is disrupting classrooms nationwide.  For parents: A Youth Wellness Intensive offering hands-on strategies for raising regulated, resilient kids—even in a digital-stress world.  With topics spanning trauma recovery, nutrition, digital stress, and emotional regulation, NRBS 2025 offers timely, evidence-driven stories for outlets covering mental health, education, parenting, neuroscience, and wellness.
