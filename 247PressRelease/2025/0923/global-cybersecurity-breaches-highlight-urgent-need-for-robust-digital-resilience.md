# Global Cybersecurity Breaches Highlight Urgent Need for Robust Digital Resilience

BALTIMORE, MD, September 23, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In 2025 alone, billions of dollars have been lost to attacks ranging from ransomware and phishing scams to sophisticated network breaches, demonstrating the urgent need for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies.  High-profile incidents illustrate the scope of the challenge. In June, hackers infiltrated Kering, the parent company of Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen, exposing personal data of potentially millions of customers, including names, email addresses, and purchase histories. In Vietnam, a cyberattack on the National Credit Information Center compromised sensitive financial records, raising alarms about the security of credit information systems and the potential for widespread identity theft.  The cryptocurrency sector has also seen dramatic losses. In 2025, cybercriminals have already siphoned more than $2.17 billion in digital assets, including a single theft of 1.5 million ETH—worth $1.5 billion—linked to the North Korea-affiliated Bybit hack. While cryptocurrencies represent innovation in financial technology, these attacks underscore vulnerabilities that extend across the broader digital ecosystem.  Catherine W Njunge, founder and director of Sentinel Infoshield Consulting Group LLC, emphasizes the critical importance of proactive cybersecurity measures. "The security of digital systems and organizational infrastructure is not optional—it is essential," Catherine said. "As technology evolves, so does our responsibility to ensure resilience, trust, and protection in every system that underpins society and the global economy."  Catherine, a graduate with a Master of Science in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity from the University of Baltimore, brings expertise in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), incident response, vulnerability management, and regulatory frameworks including NIST RMF and FedRAMP. Through Sentinel Infoshield, she delivers enterprise-grade cybersecurity solutions designed to safeguard organizations while aligning with business objectives and regulatory mandates.  "I've always been drawn to puzzles and challenges—cybersecurity combines both," Catherine said. "Solving these challenges protects not just data, but trust, reputation, and the integrity of the digital landscape itself."  As cyber threats grow more sophisticated and pervasive, the need for robust, strategic, and forward-looking cybersecurity has never been greater. Experts agree that organizations that invest in comprehensive digital resilience are better positioned to protect assets, maintain compliance, and sustain innovation in an increasingly interconnected world.
