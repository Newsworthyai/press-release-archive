Participants will gain access to culturally relevant, expert-led financial education tailored to the realities of young adults navigating student debt, side hustles, career transitions, and a changing economy.

Jakes Foundation, "Through Life Forum 2025, we are bringing together some of the most powerful voices in financial education to show young adults that they have the tools and the talent to take control of their futures and build lasting wealth."
