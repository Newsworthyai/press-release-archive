CENTENNIAL, CO, January 30, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Colorado Rural Health Center (CRHC) has released the 2025 edition of its Snapshot of Rural Health. Each year, the publication highlights rural health data such as demographic trends, chronic disease, the rural healthcare delivery system, substance use, and the rural economy using infographic data visualization, case studies, text, and maps.   The 2025 edition of the Snapshot is the largest volume yet. The report has expanded analysis of healthcare in rural Colorado, illustrated with useful statistics, data, and maps that can all be used for education, advocacy, and grant writing.   This year, the report analyzes 29 different topics and features 55 maps, all in a digestible visual format with rigorous citations. The 2025 edition expanded coverage of chronic disease in rural Colorado and analyzes rural Emergency Medical Services (EMS) deserts while featuring unique data points for each region in Colorado.   "The Snapshot is designed from the ground up to be a useful tool for healthcare facilities, policy makers, providers, and members of the public. All of this is provided free of charge in the interest of advancing CRHC's vision of improving healthcare services available in rural communities to ensure that all rural Coloradans have access to comprehensive, affordable, high-quality healthcare," said Colorado Rural Health Center CEO, Michelle Mills.   The Snapshot of Rural Health includes data collected and analyzed by CRHC's Public Health Data Specialist. A comprehensive citations page makes sourcing each fact from the 104 page report quick and easy.   "Our team works hard to produce a resource that is not only thorough and accurate, but engaging," said Mills.   Michelle Mills, alongside other CRHC staff and board, will travel to Washington DC February 11-13, where they will meet with legislators as part of the National Rural Health Association's Rural Health Policy Institute. Michelle Mills is also honored to serve as the National Rural Health Associations Board Chair for 2025. CRHC's team is meeting with the state's senators and representatives. The National Rural Health Association's annual policy institute gives Colorado-based staff an opportunity to meet with policymakers and stakeholders to discuss legislative priorities and solutions. The Snapshot of Rural Health is a vital component of these discussions.
