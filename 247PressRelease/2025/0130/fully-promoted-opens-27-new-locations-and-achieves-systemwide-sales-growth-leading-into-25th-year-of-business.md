On the heels of a pivotal year for the company in 2023, Fully Promoted accelerated its franchise development in 2024, successfully opening 17 new locations in the U.S. in markets like Lawrence, Kans.; Lynchburg, Va.; and Cincinnati, Ohio as well as ten globally, including its first in Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory. Adding to this momentum, Fully Promoted signed 30 domestic franchise agreements in 2024, which will result in 23 new units across the country, propelling the company's national expansion.  Fully Promoted continues to experience strong performance, with year-over-year system sales increasing over 5% in the U.S. and maintains a robust development pipeline with 11 new domestic locations currently in progress.  "We are thrilled to see such tremendous growth as we celebrate 25 years of success," said Andrew Titus, President of Fully Promoted. "Our locations with dedicated sales teams are seeing the fastest growth, and we are optimistic about achieving 10% system sales growth in 2025."  2025 marks the 25th year of business for Fully Promoted.

Ray, who founded the world's leading sign franchise Signarama® in 1986, recognized the potential within the multi-billion-dollar promotional products industry. The first EmbroidMe company store opened in West Palm Beach, Fla. and quickly grew to 100 locations by 2003.

The success of Fully Promoted is a testament to the hard work of our team, the loyalty and trust of our customers, as well as the dedication and strength of our franchise network," said Ray Titus.
