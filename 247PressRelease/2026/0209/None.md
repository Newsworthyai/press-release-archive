# Faiths Unite for Interfaith Dialogue and Learning at the Church of Scientology Dallas

IRVING, TX, February 09, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Faiths of all denominations came together for an evening of open communication and learning at the Church Scientology Dallas. On the 22nd of January, 2026, around 100 leaders and parishioners of faiths from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, came together in the Chapel for an evening of presentations and discussion.   The evening was sponsored and organized by the Church of Scientology Dallas and the national group Sharing Sacred Spaces. During their visit to the Church of Scientology, guests were introduced to the church's course rooms, where Scientology's practical tools for life are studied. They also learned how one-on-one spiritual counseling is conducted and explored the humanitarian programs the church sponsors and supports. The guests also learned about Scientology Founder and humanitarian, L. Ron Hubbard.   The Church of Scientology Dallas is committed to continued involvement in interfaith activities and events to resolve the social issues that we all face. Our current building was opened in April 2009 to be a place for all denominations to come and find tools to improve their lives and the lives of those around them.   Sharing Sacred Spaces is an organization which came into being following the tragic events of 9/11 with the purpose to "overcome bias, misunderstanding and polarization through immersive education and training that makes vivid our common humanity." Coming together as an interfaith community is necessary for understanding in this day and age. The commonalities of the various faith communities are evident when working together. And the issues in our environment are felt by everyone, no matter the faith: drug abuse and addiction , crime, poor education and troubled homes.   Additionally, the Interfaith Alliance of Irving, of which the Church of Scientology Dallas is a member, held their monthly meeting at the same location and lent their support to this important evening. For many years local Scientology representatives have worked with this group to help the community with food and clothing drives, Peace Day celebrations and similar visits to member churches and places of worship.   For more information on Scientology or the tools available stop by and visit at 451 Decker Dr in Irving, Texas or watch the episode featuring Dallas on Scientology TV called "Destination Scientology: Dallas" showing now. The Church of Scientology Dallas is open Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 9:30 pm and Saturday and Sunday from 9:00am to 6:00pm.  © 2026. CSD. All Rights Reserved.
