# Ohio Strengthens Distracted Driving Laws to Address Rising Phone-Use Accidents

COLUMBUS, OH, February 09, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Ohio has implemented enhanced distracted driving laws targeting motorists who use cell phones or text while driving. The updated legislation increases penalties, introduces points on licenses for violations, and allows law enforcement to issue citations as a primary offense rather than a secondary one.  Brenner Law Offices commends this step forward in road safety, noting that distracted driving remains a major cause of accidents across the state. The firm's Ohio distracted driving accident lawyers explain that the tougher penalties not only encourage safer driving but also strengthen victims' claims in cases involving driver negligence.
