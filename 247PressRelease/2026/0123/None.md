# Families Call for HIPAA Reform to Prevent Crisis Tragedies

KANSAS CITY, KS, January 23, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- #familiesrightsmatter2, a national movement advocating for stronger family involvement during mental‑health emergencies, is urging lawmakers to update HIPAA privacy rules that restrict communication between providers and families when a loved one is in crisis. The movement cites the case of Elliot Rodger, whose long‑documented mental‑health struggles preceded the 2014 Isla Vista tragedy, as an example of how communication gaps can contribute to preventable harm.  National data shows a rapidly escalating mental‑health emergency. The CDC reports that millions of Americans seek help in emergency departments each year for mental or behavioral health concerns, with ED data updated monthly to track crisis‑level surges. These visits often occur when individuals experience sudden psychological distress or acute mental‑health symptoms that require immediate intervention.   Recent research also shows that mental‑health crises — including suicidal thoughts and acute psychological distress — are affecting a growing share of U.S. adults, with nationally representative studies confirming widespread crisis‑level symptoms across demographics. Families often recognize these warning signs first, yet HIPAA rules frequently prevent providers from sharing essential safety information, even when a patient is at risk of harming themselves or others.  "Families are not asking for full medical records," said Leon Shelmire Jr., founder of #familiesrightsmatter2. "We are asking for the ability to intervene before a crisis becomes a tragedy. When families are shut out, lives are put at risk."  The movement highlights H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, which originally included provisions to improve communication between providers and trusted family members. Although the bill passed the House with bipartisan support, key HIPAA reforms were removed in later negotiations. Advocates argue that revisiting these provisions — supported by lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren — could strengthen crisis response and prevent avoidable tragedies.  Why Reform Is Needed - Families are often the first to notice escalating symptoms.  - Providers may be legally restricted from sharing safety‑critical information.  - Communication failures have contributed to tragedies like Isla Vista.  - Limited, safety‑focused disclosures could prevent harm and save lives.  familiesrightsmatter2 emphasizes that HIPAA reform is not about reducing privacy — it is about saving lives. With millions of Americans experiencing crisis‑level symptoms and emergency departments serving as a frontline for mental‑health emergencies, even modest reforms could enable earlier intervention and prevent tragedies that devastate families and communities.   The movement's national petition calls on Congress to revisit the intent of H.R. 2646 and enact reforms that balance privacy with safety, ensuring families are not powerless when a loved one is in danger.  About #familiesrightsmatter2  familiesrightsmatter2 is a national advocacy movement founded by Leon Shelmire Jr. to strengthen families' rights during mental‑health emergencies, promote crisis‑response reform, and ensure no family is left without the ability to protect a loved one in danger.  Families Rights Matter2 advocates for HIPAA reform to improve crisis communication, protect families, and prevent avoidable tragedies through data‑driven policy change.
