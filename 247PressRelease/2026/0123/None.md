# Stop Guessing: The Wondering Helps Founder-Led B2B Startups Build Repeatable Growth

BURLINGTON, VT, January 23, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Wondering soft-launched in October 2025—not with fireworks, but with work. Because the teams it's built for aren't looking for hype. They're looking for something far rarer: clarity they can execute.  If you're a founder in the pre-seed/seed trench, you already know the feeling. Everyone's "busy." The pipeline looks active. The product keeps shipping. And yet revenue doesn't behave like it should. Churn shows up like an unpaid bill. Messaging lands one week and falls flat the next. Growth starts to feel less like a plan and more like a slot machine.  That's the moment The Wondering is designed for—and it's why Gus Byleveld is shifting from soft launch to a more targeted visibility push aimed at a very specific audience:  · North American startups at pre-seed/seed (and select early Series A if still founder-led GTM)  · B2B software and tech-enabled services, especially where systems + data + churn tell the truth  · Lean teams (2–25 FTE) where the founder is still selling and the first GTM hires are arriving  · Global startups expanding into the U.S., where go-to-market design is rarely plug-and-play  · Accelerators, incubators, venture studios, university programs, and founder communities running cohorts of pre-seed/seed startups  "Most early-stage teams don't have a motivation problem," explains Gerdus "Gus" Byleveld, Founder of The Wondering. "They have a repeatability problem. Growth feels random because the work is still held together by heroics. The shift happens when you get clear on why customers buy, why they don't, and how to run that process consistently—week after week."  What The Wondering Actually Does  The Wondering helps founders build a GTM system that holds up under pressure—especially when the motion is complex (B2B buyers, longer cycles, enterprise-ish dynamics) and retention matters as much as pipeline.  In plain terms, that means:  · Tightening the wedge (who this is truly for, and why it wins)  · Pressure-testing positioning against real buyer language—not internal assumptions  · Turning customer behavior into usable signals: what's working, what's leaking, what's misunderstood  · Treating churn like a message—not a mystery  · Building a cadence the team can run without burning out (so growth isn't dependent on the founder's stamina)  · For global teams: designing GTM for the U.S. market with fewer false starts and faster learning  "Churn isn't just a metric. It's a message," Byleveld adds. "If it's rising, something is misaligned—value, onboarding, expectations, targeting, pricing, or the way the offer is framed. The fix isn't more noise. The fix is clarity and a system."  For Accelerators and Founder Communities  The Wondering is also opening more conversations with accelerators and founder communities that want GTM support founders can apply immediately—work that reduces guesswork, speeds learning, and helps teams build traction responsibly.
