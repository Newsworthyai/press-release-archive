# Unveiling Your Hidden Power: A Weekend That Could Change the Way You Live

PACIFIC GROVE, CA, January 23, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- There's a certain kind of power you don't learn from working harder. You don't discover it by pushing through one more season of exhaustion. And you certainly don't find it by shrinking yourself to fit the expectations of a world that rarely pauses long enough to ask what your soul needs.  You find it when something in you finally decides: enough.  From Friday, January 23 through Sunday, January 25, the Center for Spiritual Awakening (CSA) in Pacific Grove, California, will host a weekend intensive led by Dr. Ruth L. Miller, based on her book Unveiling Your Hidden Power. This immersive training offers a rare and concentrated overview of the teachings of Emma Curtis Hopkins, the pioneering spiritual thinker widely credited with laying the groundwork for the New Thought movement in the United States.  Hopkins taught a simple truth that modern life has tried to drown out: your inner life shapes everything. Your health. Your peace. Your courage. Your ability to create. Your ability to endure without losing yourself.  And while her teachings are more than a century old, their relevance is startling—because the human condition hasn't changed nearly as much as our distractions have.  Over the course of the weekend, Dr. Miller will guide participants through 12 lesson-chapters in approximately 14 contact hours, offering an intensive—but accessible—journey through metaphysical principles that can be applied to daily life with clarity and intention.  "This isn't about collecting spiritual concepts," says Dr. Miller. "It's about remembering what's already within you—your strength, your clarity, your spiritual authority. The weekend is designed for people who know there's more to life than surviving it."  CSA, located at 522 Central Avenue in Pacific Grove, is a metaphysical spiritual community rooted in New Thought and the Science of Mind tradition. The Center offers classes, spiritual gatherings, and weekly services that encourage inner transformation, practical spirituality, and a deeper connection to divine truth.  As part of the weekend, Dr. Miller will also deliver the message during CSA's Sunday service at 10:00 AM, offering the broader community an opportunity to experience the teachings in a congregational setting.  "What I love about this work is that it's both mystical and practical," Dr. Miller adds. "The principles are profound, but the practices are grounded. It's for the person who's ready to stop postponing their healing, their peace, and their future."  The weekend intensive is designed for spiritual seekers, practitioners, and anyone drawn to New Thought teachings—especially those seeking a deeper understanding of metaphysical principles and how to live them with integrity. Space may be limited, and early registration is encouraged.
