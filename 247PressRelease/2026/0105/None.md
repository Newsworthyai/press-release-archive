# MetaSoul Debuts Persona-Based Voice for Cars and Motorcycles at CES 2026

LAS VEGAS, NV, January 05, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MetaSoul Inc. today announced MetaSoul, an iPhone app designed to give vehicles a distinct, emotionally aware voice. Rather than acting like another general purpose assistant, MetaSoul is built to represent the car itself, communicating with personality, context, and an evolving relationship with the driver. MetaSoul can be used on iPhone alone, with optional Apple Watch support for quick, hands free interactions.  MetaSoul connects to a vehicle using a compatible Bluetooth Low Energy OBD II adapter, enabling the experience to reflect driving context and selected vehicle signals when supported. The iPhone app provides setup and the primary experience, including a richer dashboard view, while Apple Watch support is optional for fast, eyes up voice interactions.  MetaSoul is designed to make driving feel more personal and reassuring by helping drivers share their day to day driving experience with the car, build trust over time, and even develop a sense of friendship through a consistent voice and personality. When diagnostic events occur, MetaSoul can also help the car explain, in plain language, what a diagnostic code may indicate and what steps the driver can consider next.  Persona is central to the MetaSoul approach. Users can choose from multiple personalities and "vibes" so the car can speak in a way that matches the driver's preferences, from practical to playful to visionary. MetaSoul is also designed to give users control over what the system retains, with in app controls that can erase memory.  MetaSoul is currently running an early pilot program with a global automotive manufacturer to evaluate MetaSoul as the vehicle's voice interface and persona layer for the driving experience.  MetaSoul will be in Las Vegas during CES for meetings and demos by appointment.  Quote "I built MetaSoul to make driving feel safe and fun again by helping people and their cars build trust," said Patrick Levy-Rosenthal, Founder and CEO of MetaSoul INC. "The check engine moment is a perfect example. Instead of a vague icon that creates stress, MetaSoul helps the car explain, in plain language, what a diagnostic code may indicate and what steps the driver can consider next, delivered as a natural conversation with personality and emotional intelligence, without trying to be another Siri."  Availability MetaSoul is available on the App Store for iPhone, with optional Apple Watch support. Subscription options may apply.  About MetaSoul INC.
