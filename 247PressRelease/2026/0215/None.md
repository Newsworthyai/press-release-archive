# Mr. Anubhav Kaushish Appointed Director of Photography for Feature Film M.U.J.E.R.E.S. Produced by Tzadik Penimi and Directed by José Zambrano Cassella

LOS ANGELES, CA, February 15, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- M.U.J.E.R.E.S. is produced and written by Tzadik Penimi and directed by José Zambrano Cassella.  This Film stands as a strikingly ambitious narrative that merges history, technology, and myth in a visually transcendent reimagining of post–Mexican Revolution Mexico. The film follows five women drawn from vastly different worlds, each endowed with a distinct power and moral code, who unite to confront an existential threat that blurs the boundary between human and supernatural realms. With its layered world-building, intricate production design, and hybridization of genres, M.U.J.E.R.E.S. marks one of the most visually demanding independent science-fiction projects in recent years.  Mr. Kaushish's appointment signals a decisive artistic choice at the heart of this vision. Known for his refined visual storytelling and mastery of light, texture, and atmosphere, his cinematographic approach will define the film's immersive tonal language, shaping how history and futurism coexist on screen. His work will bridge handcrafted period aesthetics with innovative technological elements, translating complex emotional and thematic ideas into striking, cinematic imagery.  Producer Tzadik Penimi, a filmmaker celebrated internationally for bold, cross-continental narratives (Times of India feature), describes Kaushish's role as "integral not just to the film's look, but to its soul, an orchestration of vision and precision that harmonizes the worlds our story inhabits."  Under the direction of José Zambrano Cassella (IMDb), M.U.J.E.R.E.S. will bring together an international creative team of artists, engineers, and designers collaborating across multiple stages, encompassing extended visual development, tailored set builds, and a meticulously staged principal photography schedule.  By combining artful composition with deep technical coordination, Mr. Kaushish embodies the film's creative spine: a cinematic translator whose imagery will give continuity and coherence to the expansive vision of M.U.J.E.R.E.S..
