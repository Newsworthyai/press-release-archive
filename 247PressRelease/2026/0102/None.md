# Oliver and the Traveling House by Amy and Corey Franks Brings a Heartwarming Rescue Adventure to Readers Everywhere!

ORLANDO, FL, January 02, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Children's author Amy and Corey Franks invite young readers on a journey of hope, love, and discovery in their debut picture book, Oliver and the Traveling House. Inspired by an incredible true story, Oliver is a resilient French Bulldog who takes a journey to find his forever family and learn that home is more than just a destination, it's where you're loved.  Narrated by Oliver, the story begins in a rescue shelter, where he dreams of belonging. When Amy and Corey adopt him, his life changes from uncertainty to joy. They give him a white crate, his "traveling house" that becomes both comfort and passport to adventure. Be it in the car, on the beach, or in a new town, Oliver's little house always comes along, reminding him that love travels too.  With gentle storytelling and the use of visualization, The Franks brings Oliver's emotions and experiences to life as he teaches children about resilience, adaptability, and gratitude through each adventure. Each adventure helps Oliver-and young readers-to find beauty in a second chance and the joy of discovering new places with the people who love you most.  "Oliver's story is about transformation," Amy Franks says. "It's about finding light after hardship, embracing change, and realizing that love and safety can move with you wherever you go."  Created for children aged 6–9, Oliver and the Traveling House uses evocative text set against warm, travel-inspired illustrations. Images reflect Oliver's journey, shifting from muted tones in his rescue days to bright, joyful colors as he embraces his new life. One image of his white crate repeats, anchoring the story with its representation of home, stability, and hope.  With the launch and success of their first book, the Franks hope to introduce additional titles into the series to expand on Oliver's adventures. Each of these would combine adventure with real lessons in compassion, courage, and curiosity. Oliver and the Traveling House is more than a children's story: it is a tribute to family, second chances, and the magic that occurs when one gets to see the world through the eyes of a small dog who found his place in it.  The book is available worldwide for purchase.
