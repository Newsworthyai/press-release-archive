# Author Mahmoud A. Wahab Releases New Book 'The Disconnected Letter 'Nun' at Surah Al-Qalam

ALBANY, NY, January 27, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Researcher and writer Mahmoud A. Wahab has released a new study, The Disconnected Letter 'Nun' at Surah Al-Qalam: In Relation to Ancient Egyptian Religion, Hebrew Bible & Qur'anic Coherence.  Overview: Mahmoud A. Wahab's book argues that the disconnected letter "Nun" (ن) opening Surah Al-Qalam (68:1) is not an undecipherable cipher but a meaningful sign that encodes the primordial waters—"Nun" in ancient Egyptian cosmology—confirmed by Qur'anic coherence (nazm) and illuminated by parallels in the Hebrew Bible. The author explicitly grounds his reading in four pillars: the letter Nun, ancient Egyptian religion, the Hebrew Bible, and Qur'anic coherence, with the Qur'an retaining interpretive primacy.   Method & Sources: Wahab adopts a coherence-first approach: each sūrah is a thematic unit and the Qur'an's arrangement is purposeful; outside materials (hadith reports, earlier scriptures, historical notes) are weighed only insofar as they corroborate Qur'anic language and structure. He then asks whether the position of Surah Al-Qalam among its neighbors sheds light on "Nun."   Core Argument: Within the Muṣḥaf, Al-Qalam (68) sits between Al-Mulk (67) and Al-Haqqah (69). Al-Mulk proclaims divine sovereignty, creation, and life as a test; Al-Haqqah portrays the Inevitable Day and final judgment. Al-Qalam, introduced by "Nun" and an oath by the Pen, forms a bridge between creation and destiny. The book links this bridge to a creation motif: early reports present the Pen as the first created thing, writing the decree—fitting the "knowledge" axis of Al-Qalam and the reading-writing pairing with Al-ʿAlaq.   Qur'anic Coherence (Nazm): Drawing on the nazm tradition (Farāhī, Iṣlāhī, others), Wahab argues that the linear and thematic ties among these three sūrahs help decode "Nun." Read this way, the initial letter functions as a hinge symbol connecting blessing/creation (Al-Mulk) to resurrection/judgment (Al-Haqqah) through decree/knowledge (Al-Qalam).   Ancient Egyptian "Nun": In Egyptian thought, Nun is not a craftsman-god but the deified backdrop: the limitless, dark primordial ocean from which the first mound and creator-gods emerge (Atum at Heliopolis; Ptah at Memphis; Amun-Ra later). All schools share this watery substrate. Ritual life continually re-enacted emergence from this Deep (sacred lakes, libations, Nile inundation), reinforcing Nun's life-giving role.   Hebrew Bible Parallels: The book canvases scholarship on Genesis 1:2 and the Hebrew tĕhôm (the Deep), noting structured parallels with Egypt's pre-creation schema: formlessness/emptiness (tōhū wābōhū) ≈ Heh, darkness ≈ Keku, watery deep ≈ Nun, divine wind/Spirit ≈ Amun's animating breath. These similarities are judged "too close to be accidental," while maintaining the biblical polemic that demythologizes the Deep. The survey concludes many specialists see substantive correspondences between Nun and tĕhôm, useful for clarifying the Qur'anic letter's symbolic reach (without granting them authority over Qur'anic meaning).   So, What Does "Nun" Mean Here? When Surah Al-Qalam is read within its immediate nazm and in light of cross-cultural water-cosmologies, "Nun" most plausibly signals the primordial waters—a symbol that coherently links origin (creation) → decree (Pen/inscription) → destiny (judgment) across the Al-Mulk/Al-Qalam/Al-Haqqah triad.   Why It Matters: Wahab's contribution is methodological as much as lexical: it shows how Qur'anic arrangement and thematic unity can unlock the muqaṭṭaʿāt, with comparative materials serving as supporting witnesses. The result is a compact, integrative reading of "Nun" that ties together creation, knowledge, and judgment inside the Qur'an's own architecture.  About the Author: Mahmoud Abdel Wahab was born in Egypt in 1975. He studied English literature at ʿAin Shams' University, pursued further studies in Egyptian culture and civilization, and worked as a tour guide in Egypt before moving to Turkey in 2020. This volume grows out of his long-standing engagement with Egyptology and scriptural studies.  Availability: Available on Amazon, The Disconnected Letter 'Nun' at Surah Al-Qalam: In Relation to Ancient Egyptian Religion, Hebrew Bible & Qur'anic Coherence foregrounds Qur'anic coherence and chronology, using earlier revelations and adjacent chapters to illuminate the muqaṭṭaʿāt (disconnected letters).
