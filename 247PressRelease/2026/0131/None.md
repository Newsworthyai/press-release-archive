# Jeanna Joyce Debuts with "The Court of Gilded Iron," a Romantasy Where Dragons Are Power and Alliances Are Prisons

ORLANDO, FL, January 31, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Romantasy readers have been craving a story that refuses to flinch. One that wraps political danger in velvet gowns and hides daggers beneath every whispered alliance. The Court of Gilded Iron is that story.  Debut author Jeanna Joyce plunges readers into a world of fae courts, ancient dragon magic, and ruthless political maneuvering with her highly anticipated series opener. Princess Adeline is human in a world that despises her for it—the magicless step-daughter of a fae king, barely tolerated by the court that raised her. When her father assigns her to charm the ambassador from the most feared court in the realm, she discovers that survival will demand more than grace and silence. It will demand becoming something they never expected her to be.  The Court of Eternal Darkness does not negotiate. It commands. And when their ambassador arrives with demands that could shatter the fragile peace between kingdoms, Adeline finds herself caught between duty to her family and a dangerous attraction to forces she barely understands. Shadows move with purpose in this world. Dragons are not mere beasts but soul bonded companions, ancient beings who choose their riders and amplify the magic that flows through them. And the legendary warrior prince said to have fallen in battle may not be as dead as the histories claim.  "They called her powerless. They were wrong."  The Court of Gilded Iron knits together the lush court intrigue readers loved in A Court of Thorns and Roses with the political sharpness of The Priory of the Orange Tree. At its heart beats a slow burn romance shaped by danger and restraint—featuring a mature heroine in her thirties fighting for autonomy in a world designed to deny it, and a morally complex hero whose loyalties remain tantalizingly unclear. These are not naive young lovers but fully realized adults navigating desire and duty with the weight of experience behind them.  Joyce has built a world that breathes. Bioluminescent forests whisper secrets older than the stars. Black lakes mirror voids that swallow light. Dragons with rune-etched scales pulse with magic so ancient it predates the courts themselves. And beneath it all, shadow magic drawn from dreams and nightmares blurs the line between illusion and reality until neither can be trusted.  This is romantasy that does not soften its edges. It explores power inherited versus power earned, and what it means to find your strength when the world insists you have none. Adeline must learn that even without magic, even without a crown, she still holds power—the kind that cannot be given or taken away. For readers hungry for a fantasy romance with teeth, with tension that coils through every chapter, and with a world rich enough to lose yourself in completely, the wait is nearly over.  The Court of Gilded Iron releases January 20th and will be available in ebook, paperback, and hardcover formats.
