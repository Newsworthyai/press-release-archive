# Bestselling, Award-Winning Author Nancy Hicks Marshall Announces New Book, Six Who Stopped The Steal

WILMINGTON, NC, January 04, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On January 6, 2021: The man who lost the elections said: "We will Stop the Steal." On January 6, 2026, Marshall will hold a press conference on the Plaza outside the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Auditorium, 205 West Jefferson Street, Phoenix, Arizona.  This will be the "launch" of her book and a call to restore respect for the integrity of elected officials who follow their conscience and the law. She and others will describe in brief how the election process works and why we should re-commit ourselves to working within and supporting the ever-improving institution of elections in our United States Constitutional democracy.  Among those invited to speak are: Adrian Fontes, current Secretary of State of Arizona and former Maricopa County Recorder; Stephen Richer, former County Recorder; and Steven Gallardo, current member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and one of the six who stopped the steal.  On November 3, 2020, of of the best-run, most heavily scrutinized elections in U.S. history delivered a victory for Presidential candidate Joe Biden against his opponent, then-President Donald J. trump. Independent audits verified the valid results.  Mr. Trump and his allies decried the process and declared Mr. Trump the winner—in spite of all evidence to the contrary. They called for action to "Stop the Steal."  Yet, on November 20, 2020, Five men certified the valid election results for the winner. It was they who stopped the steal. Others in the Arizona House and Senate prevented an illegal reversal of the results and an immoral abuse of power.  'Six Who Stopped the Steal' is the extraordinary true account of six men in Maricopa County, Arizona—the fifth largest county in the United States and a critical swing state—six men who stood up for the Constitution, the law, and their integrity.  The 2020 elections were an emotional flash point for millions of Americans. It was such a tumultuous time that we forget how chaotic the times were then. In January of 2020, COVID-19 landed on American shores. Confusion reigned as, even while thousands were dying, some denied that COVID was real. In May, 2020, the nation suffered a tidal wave of disruption after a video went viral showing the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minnesota police officer. Some cried 'racist murder' while others witnessed the racial riots that followed.  Six Arizona men disclose what moments in their youth made them men of integrity. Each one's unique story played a significant role in upholding the valid election results. And each one faced multiple threats to their lives.  The ebook version will be available for $.99 through January 6, 2026, on Amazon.com.  In the early Endorsements of 'Six Who Stopped the Steal', author Nancy Marshal emerges as a person uniquely placed to bring this critically important story to light. Marshall is a multiple award-winning author who already understood the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. In 2009, she defended one of four activists who had been unconstitutionally arrested in their auditorium. Her successful defense led to the novel, "A Dry Hate", winning first prize for fiction at both state and national levels, in which the cross-examination of the sheriff's deputy is surrounded by events exposing the harm done by abuse of power.  In 2021, shocked by the treatment of these six men (only one Democrat) by their fellow-Republicans, Marshall set out to learn the inside story. What she discovered was both the story of six courageous public servants and the more complicated story of the all the major events surrounding the 2020 Presidential election—and its aftermath.  We begin with each man describing, in his own words, sometimes with vulnerable honesty, what events caused them to seek integrity as adults, and as public servants. Marshall then invites us into contemplation of what 'monsters' in our lives may cause us to reject evidence that is undeniably true—and what 'monsters' abounded in 2020. She then conquers a 'monster' of her own—the complexity of the election process—to provide a clear, understandable description of what has become a very sophisticated system.  The rest is history—history of the election, history of what each man did to stop the steal, history of how the results were audited and certified, and some of the fallout from the lies and personal attacks upon these six men.  Readers of 'Six Who Stopped the Steal' mix praise for the author with high esteem for the men who are the true heroes of this narrative. "Six Arizona leaders who stood their ground," a testament to honesty," a "fascinating portrayal of these courageous men," and "true patriots" are among the comments. Marshall has been able to "showcase the elaborate steps of our election process that prevent fraud," has written "a riveting book based extensive research," and Six will be "a valuable resource to students, historians, and psychologists for years to come."  The author cites several books worth reading if we want to understand these times better. 'The God of Monkey Science', by a Christian evangelical science teacher, explains some of the science denial that she says is unnecessary for persons of faith. 'The Big Truth' covers much the same time period of Six from a more academic perspective. And finally, 'The Emperor's New Clothes' by Hans Christian Anderson is a reminder to us that adults may put on blinders, for many reasons, but children often see the truth more clearly.  Nancy Marshall is also the author of several award-winning books: 'The Rattler's Tale' for elementary students; 'A Dry Hate' for adults; and 'Finding Zachariah in a Community Garden'—a feral cat's tale of friendship with and second chances for a vet and his broken family. Hundreds of copies of 'Zachariah' were purchased by the Phoenix Desert Botanical Garden for free signing and distribution to all visitors as a fundraiser for the community garden that was the literal site for the story. Marshall also translated 'Rattler' into 'Un Cuento de una Serpiente de Cascabel' for Spanish readers. Marshall avoids language and scenes that are too private or violent.
