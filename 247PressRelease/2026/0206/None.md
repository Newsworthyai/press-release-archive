# Sanger Police Misconduct Lawyers at The Wagner Law Group Encourage Additional Survivors of Police Sexual Abuse to Call the Victim Hotline at (833) 200-7111

FRESNO, CA, February 06, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Sanger police misconduct lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have obtained a $5.25 million civil settlement from the City of Sanger on behalf of a survivor who was sexually abused by a former Sanger Police Department officer while he was acting under the authority of his position. The settlement resolves one of multiple civil claims arising from a pattern of abuse committed by the former officer and marks a significant step toward accountability for institutional failures that allowed the misconduct to occur.  The former Sanger Police Department officer, J.D. Torrence, was later convicted in federal court on numerous felony counts, including rape, kidnapping, and aggravated sexual assault. He is currently serving five consecutive life sentences. Sex abuse attorneys at The Wagner Law Group are here to help. "Federal prosecutors established that Torrence used his role as a law enforcement officer to gain access to victims, exert control, and carry out repeated acts of sexual violence over an extended period of time," says Butch Wagner. The criminal case revealed a troubling abuse of power and a profound violation of public trust.  While the criminal convictions addressed Torrence's individual wrongdoing, civil actions are focused on the broader systemic issues that enabled the abuse. Injury lawyers in Fresno at The Wagner Law Group acknowledge the $5.25 million settlement reflects the serious nature of the harm suffered and underscores the responsibility of public entities to protect the community and properly supervise those entrusted with authority. "Civil litigation also plays a critical role in uncovering institutional failures and driving policy changes aimed at preventing similar misconduct in the future," says Wagner.  The Wagner Law Group continues to investigate additional claims related to Torrence's conduct and believes there may be other survivors who have not yet come forward. They have established a Victim Hotline at (833) 200-7111. Survivors of sexual abuse by law enforcement officers often face unique and significant barriers to reporting, including fear of retaliation, disbelief, or further harm. Many victims remain silent for years due to trauma, shame, or uncertainty about whether their experience "counts" as abuse under the law.  Injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group emphasize that survivors may still have legal rights even if the abuse occurred years ago, and that coming forward does not require immediate public disclosure. Individuals can speak with an attorney confidentially to learn about their options and determine whether a civil claim may be available by call the Victim Hotline at (833) 200-7111. No criminal report or prior complaint is required to seek legal guidance.  In addition to representing the survivor involved in the Sanger settlement, The Wagner Law Group remains committed to advocating for individuals who were harmed by abuses of authority within law enforcement and other institutions.
