# Navigating the Aftermath: The Slocum Firm, PC Releases Essential Guide for Scranton Car Accident Victims

SCRANTON, PA, February 06, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In the chaotic moments following a vehicle collision, confusion and adrenaline often cloud judgment. Recognizing the critical nature of these initial moments, The Slocum Firm, PC has issued a public advisory detailing the vital steps individuals should take immediately after a car accident in Scranton and the surrounding Northeastern Pennsylvania region. This initiative aims to empower residents with the knowledge necessary to protect their health and legal rights.  Car accidents remain a frequent occurrence on Scranton roads, from busy intersections to highways like I-81. The aftermath can be life-altering, with victims facing mounting medical bills, lost wages, and physical pain. The Slocum Firm emphasizes that actions taken in the minutes and days following a crash can significantly impact the ability to recover fair compensation.  The firm advises that the priority must always be health and safety. Even if injuries seem minor or are not immediately apparent, seeking medical attention is crucial. Adrenaline can mask pain, and conditions such as whiplash or soft tissue injuries may not manifest symptoms until later. A medical record links the injury directly to the accident, which is a key component of any future insurance claim or personal injury lawsuit.  Following a collision, it is imperative to call the police. A police report serves as an unbiased account of the incident and is a critical piece of evidence. While waiting for law enforcement, those involved should gather as much evidence as possible if they are physically able. This includes taking photographs of the scene, vehicle damage, and visible injuries, as well as collecting contact and insurance information from other drivers.  Managing Partner Matthew Slocum emphasizes the firm's commitment to supporting victims through this difficult process.  "If you have been injured, you deserve a team that is going to fight for you every step of the way," says Matthew Slocum. "We understand that you may be worried about things like medical bills and lost wages. That is why we have streamlined the time-consuming processes to ensure that we make a recovery for you as quickly as possible. We dedicate tireless attention, experience, and resources to help the catastrophically injured and their families."  The advisory also cautions drivers when notifying their insurance companies. While reporting the accident is necessary, The Slocum Firm advises victims to be mindful of their statements, as insurance adjusters often seek to minimize payouts. Consulting with an experienced attorney before agreeing to any settlements or providing detailed recorded statements can prevent the accidental compromising of a claim.  The Slocum Firm, PC has established itself as a trusted advocate for the injured in Pennsylvania. With a philosophy centered on client-focused leadership, the firm strives to secure maximum recovery for clients, often reaching settlements in less than a year.
