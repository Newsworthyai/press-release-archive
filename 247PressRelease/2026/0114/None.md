# How Much Can Patients Save on Ozempic Cost by Ordering Online From India

VANCOUVER, BC, January 14, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As patients increasingly search for information about Ozempic cost, published pricing comparisons suggest that ordering Ozempic sourced from India may significantly reduce out-of-pocket expenses for U.S. cash-pay patients.

When compared side-by-side, these figures indicate potential savings of $700 or more per pen, with additional reductions available through multi-pen orders that lower the average unit cost.
