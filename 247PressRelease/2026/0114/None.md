# Colorado Rural Health Center Releases 2026 Snapshot of Rural Health

DENVER, CO, January 14, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Colorado Rural Health Center (CRHC) has released the 2026 edition of its Snapshot of Rural Health. Each year, the publication highlights rural health data such as demographic trends, chronic disease, the rural healthcare delivery system, substance use, and the rural economy using infographic data visualization, case studies, text, and maps.   The 2026 edition of the Snapshot is the largest volume yet, increasing by 42% over the previous year's issue. The report has industry leading analysis of healthcare in rural Colorado, illustrated with useful statistics, data, and maps that can all be used for education, advocacy, and grant writing.   This year, the report analyzes 29 different topics and features 55 maps, all in a digestible visual format with rigorous citations. The 2026 edition introduced new sections studying New Americans in Colorado, the recent federal changes impacting Medicaid, medication assisted treatment, and mental health in the agricultural community.   "At CRHC, the annual release of the Snapshot starts our year off rooted in data. We seek to provide a resource that helps decisions to be made with comprehensive data and analysis of what's working and what's not in the rural healthcare delivery system," said Colorado Rural Health Center CEO, Michelle Mills.   The Snapshot of Rural Health includes data collected and analyzed by CRHC's Public Health Data Specialist. A comprehensive citations page makes sourcing each fact from the 148 page report quick and easy.   "The Snapshot is provided free of charge in the interest of advancing CRHC's vision of improving healthcare services available in rural communities to ensure that all rural Coloradans have access to comprehensive, affordable, high-quality healthcare," said Mills.   Michelle Mills, alongside other CRHC staff and board, will travel to Washington DC February 10-12 where they will meet with legislators as part of the National Rural Health Association's Rural Health Policy Institute. CRHC's team will be meeting with the state's senators and representatives. The National Rural Health Association's annual policy institute gives Colorado-based staff an opportunity to meet with policymakers and stakeholders to discuss legislative priorities and solutions. The Snapshot of Rural Health is a vital starting point for these discussions.  As Colorado's State Office of Rural Health and member-based association for rural health facilities, CRHC is a clearinghouse for rural health information and resources, helping providers throughout Colorado enhance healthcare services available in rural communities, and helping elected officials make informed decisions about healthcare policy.  The Snapshot of Rural Health is available for download at https://coruralhealth.org/snapshot-of-rural-health - For additional resources, visit the CRHC resource center at http://coruralhealth.org/resources.  The Colorado Rural Health Center was established in 1991 as Colorado's State Office of Rural Health. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, CRHC serves dual roles as the State Office of Rural Health and the State Rural Health Association. The organization's mission is to enhance healthcare services in the state by providing information, education, linkages, tools, and energy toward addressing rural health issues. CRHC's vision is to improve healthcare services available in rural communities to ensure that all rural Coloradans have access to comprehensive, affordable, high quality healthcare.
