MANASSAS, VA February 10, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Laconiko, the award-winning producer of single-origin, high phenolic extra virgin olive oils, proudly announces the arrival of its new harvest Koroneiki Estate Olive Oils, freshly pressed from the southern coastline of Lakonia, Greece. This highly anticipated release marks the culmination of a year of careful cultivation, precise harvest timing, and uncompromising attention to detail.  "Green harvested olive fruit tells a story of our land," shares Diamantis Pierrakos, Producer and Co-Owner of Laconiko. "The weather conditions created a challenging harvest year for much of Greece, but we never compromise on quality. We pick at the exact right moment, crush immediately, and obsess over quality so what ends up on your table is something we can be truly proud of."  Produced from early-harvested green Koroneiki olives and first cold-pressed within hours of picking, this year's olive oil is vibrant, fresh, and well-balanced.   Pierrakos shares, "This year's harvest has delicious green fruit notes and is well-balanced which is a perfect complement for everyday cooking, dressings, marinades, and finishing. These are truly the best every day and finishing olive oils. This is also the olive oil Laconiko was recognized for in the prestigious Athena International olive oil competition.
