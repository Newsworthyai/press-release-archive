# NeoGenix Introduces Focused Shockwave Therapy in Charlotte, NC

CHARLOTTE, NC, January 13, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- NeoGenix Regenerative Medicine has expanded its non-surgical treatment options with the introduction of Focused Shockwave Therapy, an advanced, evidence-based technology designed to support healing in joints, tendons, and soft tissue.  Focused Shockwave Therapy uses high-energy acoustic waves delivered at a precise depth to stimulate the body's natural repair processes. Unlike traditional or radial shockwave approaches, focused shockwave technology allows providers to target deeper structures with greater accuracy, making it especially useful for chronic musculoskeletal conditions that have not responded to conservative care.  This treatment is now available at NeoGenix's Charlotte-area office as part of the clinic's integrative approach to regenerative and non-invasive care.  "Focused Shockwave Therapy allows us to address chronic musculoskeletal conditions with a high level of precision while remaining completely non-invasive," said Dr. Altizer, medical director at NeoGenix. "By delivering acoustic energy at a controlled depth, this technology supports the body's natural healing response and gives us another evidence-based option for patients who are looking to avoid surgery or injections."  What Is Focused Shockwave Therapy?  Focused Shockwave Therapy is a non-invasive medical treatment that delivers concentrated acoustic energy to specific areas of pain or dysfunction. These sound waves create controlled microtrauma in the tissue, which encourages increased blood flow, cellular activity, and tissue regeneration.  The focused nature of the technology allows clinicians to treat deeper tendons, ligaments, and joints with precision—without surgery, injections, or prolonged downtime.  How Focused Shockwave Therapy Supports Healing  Focused shockwave technology is commonly used to address chronic pain conditions by:  Stimulating circulation in damaged tissue Activating the body's natural healing response Supporting collagen production and tissue remodeling Reducing pain and stiffness over time  Treatments are performed in-office and typically take only a short amount of time. Most patients are able to return to normal daily activities shortly after their session.  Conditions Commonly Treated  Focused Shockwave Therapy may be recommended for individuals experiencing:  Chronic joint pain Tendon and ligament injuries Plantar fasciitis Knee, hip, shoulder, or elbow pain Soft tissue injuries that have been slow to heal  Each patient is evaluated individually to determine whether focused shockwave therapy is an appropriate option based on their condition, goals, and overall treatment plan.  Expanding Access to Non-Surgical Care in Charlotte  NeoGenix continues to expand access to advanced, non-surgical therapies for patients in the Charlotte area who are seeking alternatives to invasive procedures or long recovery times.  Focused Shockwave Therapy can be used as a standalone treatment or as part of a broader regenerative strategy, depending on patient needs and provider recommendations.  Patients interested in learning more about focused shockwave therapy are encouraged to explore the detailed treatment overview or schedule a consultation with the NeoGenix medical team to determine candidacy.  NeoGenix Regenerative Medicine is a medical clinic focused on non-surgical and regenerative treatment options designed to support musculoskeletal health and recovery. The clinic offers evidence-based therapies tailored to individual patient needs, with an emphasis on precision, safety, and integrative care.
