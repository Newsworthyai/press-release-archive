# Williams Hart &amp; Boundas, LLP Unites With Team of Law Firms to Obtain $7.25 Billion Monsanto Roundup Settlement Class-Action

HOUSTON, TX, February 19, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Williams Hart & Boundas, LLP has joined a team of leading plaintiffs' law firms to achieve a $7.25 billion settlement class action against Monsanto that would resolve thousands of existing and future claims involving Roundup exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  The settlement, filed on February 17, 2026, by Williams Hart & Boundas, Waters Kraus Paul & Siegel, Motley Rice, Seeger Weiss, and the Holland Law Firm, in the City of St. Louis Circuit Court will establish a structured compensation framework for individuals diagnosed with NHL following exposure to Monsanto's glyphosate-based herbicide.  Over the past several years, juries nationwide have returned significant verdicts linking Roundup to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while tens of thousands of claims remain pending in state and federal courts.  "After years of pressing cases against Monsanto and in light of the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has accepted an appeal to review the validity of these Round-Up claims, we are pleased to achieve a resolution that we believe is acceptable based on the current circumstances," said John Eddie Williams, Jr., Founding and Managing Partner of Williams Hart & Boundas, LLP.  According to the settlement, Monsanto will fund up to $7.25 billion to compensate a class that includes virtually all existing and certain future Roundup cancer claims. The agreement is designed to provide a structured and comprehensive resolution framework for individuals diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma following exposure to the herbicide.  Under the proposed settlement, eligible class members will have the right to opt out and pursue their claims individually if they choose. For more information about the settlement, please contact Williams Hart & Boundas, LLP at 713-940-6220. The case is filed in St. Louis city court.
