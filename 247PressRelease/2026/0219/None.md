DESTREHAN, LA, February 19, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In her new children's book, inspired by her son Cole, "Coley Bear's Blue-Tastic Day!," Shelley Smith Adams presents a tender and humorous look at childhood discovery. With an engaging story drawn from real life, Shelley captures the innocence of imagination and the importance of patience, love, and guidance in family life.  About the Book:  "Coley Bear's Blue-Tastic Day!" is set against the familiar backdrop of a quiet morning at home, a moment many parents will recognize. It follows the story of young Cole, who, after being inspired by a cartoon artist on television, decides to embark on his own painting project. The narrative transports readers into a child's perspective, where creativity knows no bounds and the journey is more important than the destination.  A Spark of Inspiration: The story opens with Cole sitting quietly on the sofa, watching his favorite cartoon. The character on screen is painting, which ignites a thought in Cole's mind: he wants to paint, too. This simple, relatable moment of inspiration sets the stage for the unexpected adventure that follows, highlighting how children absorb and act upon the world around them.   A Creative Plan Unfolds: With this new idea, Cole tiptoes over to the craft cabinet to see what he can find. His eyes land on the fingerpaint, a medium perfect for sensory exploration. After surveying the colors—red, yellow, green—he decisively selects his favorite: blue. Clutching the blue paint, he happily returns to the sofa, ready to begin his artistic work.  The Joy of Process: Cole manages to open the paint and begins by dipping a single finger into the pot. This quickly evolves to two fingers, then his whole hand. He giggles with delight as he pats the cool paint onto his arms and smooths it onto his legs like soap. The scene is described with sensory details as Cole turns bluer and bluer by the second, fully immersed in the experience.  A Surprising Discovery: The scene shifts when Cole's sister, Ryleigh, walks into the room. Her eyes widen at the sight of her blue brother. She calls out for their mother, announcing the surprising situation. This moment introduces a point of tension, as the reader anticipates the adult's reaction to the colorful mess.  A Mother's Loving Response: Mom runs over and, upon seeing Cole and the sofa, freezes for a minute. However, her focus quickly shifts from the mess to the beaming pride on her son's face. She immediately affirms his creative accomplishment, praising him for correctly identifying the color he had chosen. The story emphasizes her choice to celebrate his joy and achievement rather than focus on the cleanup ahead.  About the Author: Shelley Smith Adams is a dedicated mother and author from Destrehan, Louisiana. Inspired by her son Cole, who has Down Syndrome, she writes to share his wonderfully unique way of seeing the world. Her heartfelt storytelling celebrates the joys of childhood, creativity, and the power of a family's love and acceptance, turning everyday moments into uplifting lessons for children and parents alike.  Availability: Available on Amazon, "Coley Bear's Blue-Tastic Day!" is for families and educators seeking a lighthearted yet meaningful addition to children's literature.
