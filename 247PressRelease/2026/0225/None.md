# Religious Leaders Join for World Interfaith Harmony To Promote Unity in Diversity

LOS ANGELES, CA, February 25, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Religious leaders gathered last week at the Church of Scientology Los Angeles to celebrate World Interfaith Harmony Week. They shared personal perspectives on their faith—telling stories, building understanding, and promoting unity in diversity.  World Interfaith Harmony Week is an annual global observance established by the United Nations to promote peace and understanding among people of all faiths. Events are held around the world to strengthen the ideals of peace within and among all religions, nations, and peoples. In celebration of these principles, the Scientology Volunteer Ministers chapter of Los Angeles hosted an event on February 11. The evening opened with a prayer from Chief Joseph Tasunka Okuna Jr. of the Lakota Nation, who performed a ceremonial chant to offer protection to those in attendance.  Following this ceremony, representatives of diverse faiths shared the stage, speaking about their personal journeys and their desire to collaborate with one another. Those speaking represented Christianity, Islam, Falun Gong, and Scientology.  Pastor Oliver E. Buie from the Bel-Vue United Presbyterian Church highlighted, "The message and vision of unity rings loud and clear. It is essential that the spirit of oneness continue as we work together to spread peace, unity, and love for all of humanity."  In forming the Scientology Volunteer Ministers program, humanitarian and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, highlighted the vital importance of religion in society as stated in his 1976 essay Religious Influence in Society: "When a culture has fallen totally away from spiritual pursuits into materialism, one must begin by demonstrating they are each a soul, not a material animal. From this realization of their own religious nature individuals can again come to an awareness of God and become more themselves."  The Church of Scientology of Los Angeles serves as a home for the Los Angeles community and as a meeting ground of cooperative effort to uplift people of all denominations.
