# How SOMNDEEP's Millimeter-Wave Radar Tracks Breathing and Heart Rate Without Touching the Body

LOS ANGELES, CA, February 12, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Picture this: after a long day, you finally crawl into bed, the room dim and quiet, the only sound being a faint white noise to help you drift into a deep, peaceful sleep. But just as you get comfortable, you feel it—the discomfort of your sleep tracker. Whether it's a tight wristband, a cold patch on your skin, or the constant reminder of a wearable device, it's there. And now, it's disturbing the very thing it's supposed to track—your sleep.  This is a common experience for many who rely on wearable sleep trackers. These devices, while designed to give you insight into your sleep patterns, often create new problems: they disrupt your sleep comfort, can lead to incomplete data, and make you more aware of the device itself than of your rest. But what if there was a way to track your sleep without ever needing to wear or attach anything to your body? Enter SOMNDEEP.  The Problem with Traditional Sleep Trackers While wearables like wristbands, smartwatches, or patches seem like convenient solutions to track sleep, they come with their own set of challenges. Most traditional trackers require physical contact with the body, leading to several issues:  1.Discomfort and Restriction: For many, wearing a device to bed is uncomfortable. Whether it's a wristband squeezing your wrist, a patch sticking to your skin, or a sensor pressing against your body, the discomfort can interfere with your ability to fall asleep or stay asleep. These devices often remind you they're there, disrupting the very thing you're trying to improve: your sleep.  2.Data Gaps: Sleep is rarely still. You turn over, shift positions, or get out of bed. Traditional trackers often miss or distort data when you move or when the device isn't in direct contact with your body. This leads to incomplete or inaccurate data that doesn't give you a full picture of your sleep health.  3.Interfering with Natural Sleep: The ultimate goal of sleep tracking is to observe your sleep patterns in the most natural state possible. However, when you're wearing something that you can feel on your body, it can disrupt your natural rhythms. Whether it's the sensation of a device on your wrist or the warmth of a smartwatch, it can keep you from truly relaxing and falling into a deep sleep.  4.This creates a paradox: the more you care about monitoring your sleep, the more the device interferes with it.  Introducing SOMNDEEP: Contactless Radar Technology  So, how can you monitor your sleep and health without these interruptions? SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor offers the perfect solution. It uses millimeter-wave radar technology to monitor vital signs like breathing and heart rate—all without requiring physical contact. This radar-based approach ensures that the device is unobtrusive and never disturbs your sleep.  But how does it work?  How Millimeter-Wave Radar Detects Breathing and Heart Rate Radar might sound like an advanced piece of technology primarily used for airplanes or weather forecasting. But in reality, radar is simply extremely effective at detecting even the smallest movements, making it the perfect solution for non-contact sleep monitoring. Here's how SOMNDEEP's radar works:  1.Radar Waves: The device emits low-power electromagnetic waves into the surrounding environment. These waves travel through the air and bounce off objects, including your body.  2.Signal Reflection: As the radar waves hit your body, they reflect back to the sensor. These reflected signals contain information about your movements, such as your breathing and heartbeat. Breathing causes slight changes in the phase of these reflected waves, while your heartbeat creates micro-vibrations on the surface of your body, reflected as high-frequency variations in the signal.  3.Analyzing Movements: SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor continuously analyzes the reflected signals to detect the different patterns that occur during sleep. The system distinguishes between:  4.Slow, rhythmic breathing patterns—the subtle rises and falls of your chest as you breathe.  5.Heartbeats, which generate tiny vibrations that are embedded as micro-variations in the reflected signal.  6.Larger body movements like turning over or getting out of bed. By analyzing these changes in real-time, SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor is able to accurately track your sleep cycles, breathing rhythms, and heart rate, all while you sleep—without ever needing to touch your body  Why Radar Is Ideal for Sleep and Health Monitoring  1.Contactless Monitoring: One of the most significant advantages of radar over traditional sensors is that it works without physical contact. You don't need to wear a wristband or a patch, and the device never touches your skin. This means you can sleep in your most comfortable position without the device getting in the way.  2.Works in Any Environment: Unlike optical sensors, which rely on ambient light or skin exposure, radar works in any condition. Whether the room is dark, light, or you're covered up in blankets, the radar can still track your movements without being affected. It's the ultimate in environmentally independent monitoring.  3.Sensitivity to Micro-Movements: Radar's ability to detect subtle micro-movements is another major advantage. Unlike wearable devices that rely on accelerometers and may miss small changes in your body, radar can pick up tiny fluctuations from your breathing and heart rate that other technologies can't. This provides a more accurate and complete picture of your sleep and health.  4.Unobtrusive and Continuous: The radar-based system runs in the background, tracking your sleep continuously and without interruption. Whether you're tossing, turning, or shifting positions, SOMNDEEP continues to monitor without disturbing your natural rhythms. It operates passively, gathering important data without you even knowing it's there.  Radar: The Next Frontier in Health Monitoring SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor represents the future of health monitoring—non-intrusive, continuous, and accurate. The radar system does more than just track your sleep; it provides valuable insights into your breathing patterns, heart rate, and sleep interruptions—all without requiring any physical contact with your body. This allows for a truly natural sleep experience, where your body is free to move and adjust without being disturbed by external devices.  The beauty of SOMNDEEP is that it seamlessly integrates into your daily life. There's no need to wear anything, no need to adjust your habits. Simply place the radar system near your bed, and it will silently track your sleep, offering real-time health insights and helping you monitor your progress over time.  A Complete Picture of Your Sleep Health SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor provides more than just a snapshot of your nightly rest—it offers a long-term view of your sleep health. By focusing on long-term trends rather than short-term performance scores, it helps you understand the bigger picture of your health and sleep quality.  1.Breathing Patterns: Radar can detect shifts in your breathing rhythm, providing insights into potential sleep apnea or other respiratory issues.  2.Heart Rate Variations: The system also monitors your heart rate to track fluctuations that could indicate stress, irregularities, or other health conditions.  3.Sleep Interruptions: If you get up during the night, SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor tracks these movements, helping you identify disturbances that could affect your sleep quality.  By providing these insights, SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor helps you take a proactive approach to your health, allowing you to make informed decisions and improve your sleep habits over time.  Conclusion  The future of sleep and health monitoring is contactless, and SOMNDEEP is leading the way. By using millimeter-wave radar, it offers a non-intrusive, accurate, and continuous solution for tracking your sleep, breathing, and heart rate. It eliminates the discomfort of wearables while providing precise, real-time insights into your sleep patterns.  With SOMNDEEP Contactless Smart Sleep Monitor, you can experience the benefits of a sleep tracker without sacrificing comfort. You'll gain a clearer understanding of your health and sleep quality, all while enjoying a restful, uninterrupted night's sleep.  Sleep better. Live better. With SOMNDEEP, the next step in sleep monitoring is here—effortless, natural, and entirely comfortable.  (Note: SOMNDEEP for general wellness use only; not a medical device.)
