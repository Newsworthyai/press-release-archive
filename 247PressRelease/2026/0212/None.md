# SANGER POLICE SEX ABUSE VICTIM HOTLINE (833)-200-7111 — THE WAGNER LAW GROUP URGES ALL SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY FORMER SANGER POLICE OFFICER J.D. TORRENCE TO COME FORWARD NOW

FRESNO, CA, February 12, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- JD Torrence sex abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are encouraging people who were sexually abused, assaulted, manipulated, or coerced by former Sanger Police Department officer J.D. Torrence to take immediate action and contact the firm's confidential Abuse Victim Hotline at (833)-200-7111.  Sanger police department sex abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are currently representing multiple survivors and have recently help a victim receive a 5.25-million-dollar settlement. "If you were harmed by J.D. Torrence in any way, you may have significant legal rights — and delaying action could jeopardize your ability to pursue compensation," says Butch Wagner. Survivors are encouraged to call the Abuse Victim Hotline at (833)-200-7111 to speak confidentially with an experienced sex abuse attorney who understands the trauma and legal complexities surrounding sexual abuse committed by law enforcement officers.  J.D. Torrence used the authority of a police badge to exploit and victimize individuals during official interactions. His position allowed him to detain, question, intimidate, and isolate members of the public — authority that prosecutors later proved he abused for sexual purposes. Although Torrence has been criminally convicted and sentenced to life in prison, a criminal sentence does not provide financial compensation to every person harmed. The Wagner Law Group Sanger Police Department sex abuse attorneys have recently secured a 5.25 million dollar settlement for a survivor.  There may be additional survivors who have not yet come forward.  Sexual abuse committed by a police officer creates a severe imbalance of power. Many survivors remain silent due to fear of retaliation, embarrassment, community pressure, or the belief that no one will believe them. Others were threatened directly or manipulated into silence. For some, the trauma has lasted for years without accountability.  The Wagner Law Group is making it clear: survivors still have options.  Civil lawsuits allow victims to pursue financial compensation and demand accountability not only from the perpetrator but also from institutions that may have failed to prevent or address misconduct. The firm has already secured substantial recovery connected to misconduct involving Torrence, but that case represents only one survivor's claim. Other individuals may have independent rights that deserve legal review.  If Torrence used his authority as a Sanger police officer during a traffic stop, investigation, questioning, detention, or any other official encounter — and that interaction turned sexual, coercive, threatening, or abusive — you should immediately contact the Abuse Victim Hotline at (833)-200-7111.  You may have a valid civil claim if:  • Torrence engaged in unwanted sexual touching. • He pressured, coerced, or manipulated you into sexual acts. • He implied that arrest, jail, citation, or legal trouble would occur if you refused. • He used intimidation or isolation while in uniform or acting as an officer. • You reported the misconduct and it was ignored. • You never reported the abuse but are prepared to do so now.  California law has expanded legal protections for survivors of sexual abuse, including extended filing windows in certain circumstances. Even if the incident occurred years ago, you should not assume your claim is barred. Legal deadlines depend on specific facts, and every survivor's situation deserves individual evaluation.  Consultations with injury lawyers at The Wagner Law Group are free and confidential. Calling does not obligate you to file a lawsuit. Your identity can be protected to the fullest extent allowed by law. The purpose of the call is simple: to inform you of your rights and explain your legal options.  Sexual abuse carried out under color of law is not a minor violation — it is a profound abuse of power. Survivors may be entitled to compensation for emotional distress, psychological trauma, therapy expenses, medical care, lost wages, and long-term harm. Financial recovery cannot undo what happened, but it can provide accountability and resources for healing.  If you were harmed, your experience matters. If you know someone who may have been affected, encourage them to seek confidential legal advice. Justice often begins with a single phone call. For confidential assistance, contact the Abuse Victim Hotline: (833)-200-7111. Survivors of sexual abuse by former Sanger Police Officer J.D. Torrence are urged to act promptly to protect their rights.
