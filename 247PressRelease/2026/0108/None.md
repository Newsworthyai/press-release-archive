# Shawn Mayers Writes an Open Letter to Homeowners Feeling Stuck With Their Space

KINSTON, NC, January 08, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Most people do not wake up planning to deal with a problem in their home. It usually shows up slowly. A door that sticks. A floor that squeaks. A leak that keeps coming back. A space that just does not feel right anymore.  For Shawn Mayers, a new construction superintendent based in Kinston, these problems are familiar. He sees them every day, often long after the original work was done.  This press release is written as an open letter from Shawn to everyday people dealing with common challenges in their homes. It is not advice. It is a perspective from years spent on job sites, fixing issues that started small and grew expensive.  An Open Letter From Shawn Mayers  I have spent most of my life around buildings. I have seen homes brand new and homes decades old. I have seen what holds up and what fails. Here is the truth most people are not told. Most home problems do not come from one big mistake. They come from small things that were rushed, skipped, or ignored. "Construction teaches you fast. If you cut corners, the work tells on you later." That does not just apply to builders. It applies to how we take care of our spaces. According to industry data, over 70 percent of residential repair costs come from deferred maintenance or poor original installation. Water intrusion alone accounts for more than 20 percent of homeowner insurance claims each year. Those numbers are not about bad luck. They are about systems being ignored. Why Your Space Feels Like It Is Working Against You Many people think their home problems are unique. They are not. I see the same patterns over and over. Poor drainage. Rushed repairs. Quick fixes layered on top of older problems. "Fast work that needs fixing isn't fast. It just moves the problem down the line." The construction industry estimates that rework costs homeowners and builders between 5 and 15 percent more over the life of a home. That is money spent correcting things that could have been handled early. When something feels off in your space, it usually is.  The Real Cost of Ignoring Small Issues  Small issues feel easy to postpone. Life is busy. Budgets are tight. It feels easier to wait. But buildings do not wait. Water damage, for example, can double repair costs if left untreated for more than six months. Structural movement that starts as a hairline crack can turn into a major repair within a few years. "You learn more watching mistakes than watching success. Mistakes cost time. They stick with you." That lesson applies to homeowners too. Why Preparation Matters More Than Tools Most people think fixing their space starts with buying something. A product. A tool. A quick solution. That is rarely the answer. "People don't need speeches. They need clear direction and follow-through." Preparation is what changes outcomes. Understanding what is actually wrong. Knowing what can wait and what cannot. Asking better questions before acting. Homes respond well to attention. They respond poorly to guessing.  What You Can Do This Week  You do not need to overhaul your home. You need to start paying attention. Here are ten practical actions you can take this week.  -Walk your home after a heavy rain and watch where water goes  -Check under sinks for moisture or staining  -Open and close every door and window and note resistance  -Look at exterior grading and see if soil slopes away from the house  -Clean gutters and downspouts  -Listen for new sounds like pops, creaks, or drips  -Check caulking around windows and doors  -Write down three things you have been ignoring  -Ask when each issue first appeared  -Fix one small thing completely instead of patching it  "I don't measure success by titles. I measure it by whether the work holds up." That mindset works at home, too. This Is About Responsibility, Not Perfection I am not telling you to make your space perfect. Perfect does not exist. I am telling you to respect your space. It protects you. It holds your family. It carries your daily life. "Every house will have another owner someday. You still owe that person good work." Even if that future owner is you.  A Simple Challenge  Choose one action from the list above. Commit to it for seven days. Do it fully. Do it carefully. Then share this letter with someone who keeps saying they will deal with their space later. Later gets expensive.
