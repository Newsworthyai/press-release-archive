# Brothers Plumbing, Heating &amp; Electric in Denver Helps Colorado Homeowners Prepare for New NOx Law Taking Effect January 1, 2026

DENVER, CO, January 08, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Denver furnace repair and replacement pros at Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric want homeowners to know that beginning January 1, 2026, a new Colorado state regulation aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions will go into effect, changing how homeowners purchase and replace certain gas-powered appliances. Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric is encouraging homeowners in Denver and surrounding areas to understand how this new law may affect decisions around gas furnaces and gas water heaters, especially for those planning upgrades or facing unexpected equipment failures.  Denver water heater replacement, installation, and repair experts at Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric are informing homeowners that the new NOx law is part of Colorado's broader effort to improve air quality and to reduce emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory issues. While the law does not ban natural gas outright, it does place stricter limits on emissions from newly installed gas appliances, which will influence product availability, pricing, and installation timelines.  "We're already getting questions from homeowners who are confused or concerned," said Lynn Tomasek, President of Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric, serving the Denver area. "Our goal is to make sure people understand their options so they're not caught off guard when it's time to replace a furnace or water heater."  What the NOx Law Means for Colorado Homeowners  The regulation applies to new installations of certain gas appliances beginning January 1, 2026. Existing systems are not required to be replaced simply because of the law, but once a system fails or is removed, homeowners will need to comply with the updated standards.  Key points homeowners should know include:  Stricter emission limits on new gas appliances Gas furnaces and gas water heaters installed after January 1, 2026 must meet lower NOx emission thresholds than many current models. Fewer gas appliance options Some traditional gas furnaces and water heaters that are commonly installed today may no longer be legal to install after the deadline. Higher upfront costs for compliant equipment Low-NOx gas appliances and alternative technologies often come with higher purchase and installation costs compared to older models. Potential shift toward electric options Many homeowners may be encouraged—or effectively required—to consider electric heat pumps or heat pump water heaters, depending on their home's setup. Impact during emergency replacements If a furnace or water heater fails in winter after January 1, 2026, homeowners may have fewer immediate replacement options available.  How This Affects Furnace Replacements in The Denver Area For homeowners considering a new gas furnace, the NOx law introduces important planning considerations:  Standard-efficiency gas furnaces may be phased out Many older-style furnaces do not meet the new emission requirements and will no longer be installable. High-efficiency and ultra-low-NOx models may be required These systems often cost more and may have longer lead times. Heat pumps are becoming a common alternative Cold-climate heat pumps have improved significantly and can now handle Colorado winters when properly designed. Electrical system upgrades may be necessary Switching from gas to electric heating may require panel upgrades or additional electrical work.  What It Means for Gas Water Heater Repair, Replacement & Installation  Water heaters are also affected by the NOx regulation:  Traditional gas water heaters may no longer qualify These are among the most common and affordable options today, but many will not meet new standards. Condensing gas or heat pump water heaters may become the default These systems are more efficient but come with higher upfront costs. Space and ventilation requirements may change Newer systems can require different clearances, venting, or drain access. Planning ahead can prevent disruptions Waiting until a water heater fails could limit choices and extend downtime.
