# MedLegalNews.com Reports New Questions Over 2024 DIR Report on SIBTF Liability Estimates

SACRAMENTO, CA, January 09, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- MedLegalNews.com is reporting that the 2024 study of California's Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) on Recent Trends and Policy Considerations is facing renewed scrutiny following findings published by The Jacobi Journal of Insurance (link) Investigation. The Journal's independent review suggests the 2024 study may have overstated SIBTF's unfunded liability by roughly $6.75 billion, or more than six‑fold compared with the Journal's recalculated estimate.  This report had concluded that the SIBTF faced $7.9 billion in unfunded obligations, a figure cited throughout 2025 legislative discussions that led to proposals adjusting eligibility and benefits for severely disabled workers.  Background on SIBTF and the Commissioned Report's Analysis The SIBTF provides supplemental benefits to workers with significant pre‑existing disabilities who incur additional workplace injuries. The program is funded through California's workers' compensation system to help prevent long‑term reliance on general public assistance.  In 2024, the state's Department of Industrial Relations commissioned "California's Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund: Recent Trends and Policy Considerations" to evaluate the fund's fiscal outlook. This report described extensive long‑term liabilities, positioning the fund as a potential financial concern within the workers' compensation system.  Journal Review Identifies Modeling Differences According to The Jacobi Journal, the large difference in liability estimates stems from assumptions embedded in the report's model. Key variables include the proportion of open claims expected to result in payments and the method used to calculate the present value of lifetime disability awards.  Claim payout rate: The report projected that 91% of open SIBTF cases would ultimately result in benefit payments. The Journal's review, based on historical closure data, suggests a likely payout rate closer to 24–44%.  Valuation of total disability awards: The report's model implied an average present value of about $933,000 per 100% disability case. The Journal's analysis, using more typical actuarial inputs—a 7% discount rate, a 2.6% cost‑of‑living adjustment, and a shorter life expectancy assumption—produced a lower value of roughly $418,000.  The Journal notes that the combination of a low discount rate (3%) and a high COLA (3.9%) in the report's calculations substantially inflated the long‑term liability projection. When modeled with alternative parameters, the Journal's total estimate of $1.25 billion reframes the SIBTF's fiscal position as a significant but manageable obligation.  Policy Considerations and Fiscal Impact This variance in estimates could have important policy consequences. Lawmakers relied in part on the report's $7.9 billion figure when drafting legislation, including Senate Bill 1329 (2025), aimed at modifying SIBTF benefits. If the Journal's lower estimate proves more accurate, stakeholders argue the urgency for deep benefit reductions may require reassessment.  A recalibrated understanding of the fund's obligations also affects California's broader fiscal planning. Reducing SIBTF support could shift financial responsibility from a specialized, employer‑funded system toward taxpayer‑funded safety‑net programs such as Medi‑Cal and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), potentially raising general fund expenditures.  MedLegalNews.com Statement Mark Hyman of MedLegalNews.com stated: "This case illustrates how financial modeling assumptions can substantially influence policy outcomes. Accurate actuarial data is vital to ensure that reforms strike the right balance between fiscal responsibility and worker protection."  MedLegalNews.com continues to review the methodologies used in both analyses and will publish updates as further details or official responses become available.
