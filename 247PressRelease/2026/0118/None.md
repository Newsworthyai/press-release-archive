# AJ Films &amp; Entertainment Announces the Anthology Series Therapy Chronicles from Director and Executive Producer Salman Alam Khan

GLENDALE, CA, January 18, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Set across Los Angeles, Glendale, Pasadena, and Santa Monica, Therapy Chronicles unfolds over eight interconnected episodes, each centered on therapy sessions that reveal the hidden emotional lives of everyday people. Audiences follow a South Asian immigrant confronting inherited shame, a Black therapist whose unresolved grief resurfaces through a young patient, a queer South Asian couple navigating faith and acceptance, an estranged father and daughter seeking forgiveness, an undocumented worker facing systemic fear, and a high powered executive quietly battling depression. Threading through these narratives is Dr. Arjun, an Indian American therapist whose own inner fractures gradually emerge, turning his journey into the quiet spine of the series.  By the final episode, Therapy Chronicles draws its characters into subtle points of intersection through shared spaces, echoes of dialogue, and emotional parallels, revealing that healing is less about tidy resolution and more about learning to live honestly with what remains. The series closes on an image of stillness that embodies its central idea: that being witnessed with compassion can be as transformative as any clinical intervention.  A Vision Led Series from Salman Alam Khan As Director, Salman Alam Khan shapes the emotional and visual language of Therapy Chronicles, using long takes, close framing, and natural performances to create the sensation of truly inhabiting the therapy room rather than observing it from a distance. His work, recognized for exploring themes of identity, culture, and interior life, brings a finely tuned sensitivity to silence, gaze, and breath, treating each conversation as a layered emotional landscape rather than simple dialogue.  In this series, Khan guides actors through rehearsals that function as exploratory labs, spaces where performers investigate their characters' histories and emotional triggers so that every on screen moment feels lived in and honest. He collaborates closely with the cinematographer, production designer, and sound team to ensure that image, space, and sound serve a unified purpose: turning the therapy office into a reflection of each character's inner world.  As Executive Producer, Khan is responsible for the creative, structural, and strategic architecture of the project. He oversees script development, casting choices, and the integration of multilingual elements including English, Urdu, Punjabi, and Spanish to reflect the layered realities of contemporary Los Angeles. He supervises budget allocation, crew hiring, and scheduling, and remains closely involved from pre production through post production and delivery, aligning artistic ambition with a disciplined, professional workflow.  AJ Films & Entertainment: Crafting Intimate Cinema at Scale Therapy Chronicles is produced under AJ Films & Entertainment, founded by Ajay Mohamed, a Los Angeles based producer with extensive experience delivering short films, music videos, and digital content. Known for meticulous pre production, detailed breakdowns, and on set problem solving that protects the integrity of story and performance, AJ Films & Entertainment brings a robust infrastructure to the series, from script analysis and casting to location management and high caliber post production spanning multiple continents.  As Producer, Ajay Mohamed oversees day to day operations, financial tracking, contracts, union compliance, and cross departmental coordination, ensuring that the creative vision has the resources and conditions it needs to thrive. His role serves as a bridge between Khan's artistic goals and the practical realities of production, enabling the series to maintain both emotional depth and professional polish.  Visual and Technical Approach Therapy Chronicles embraces a restrained, performance driven aesthetic, using natural light, handheld intimacy, and extended uninterrupted takes to heighten the sense of presence within each session. The therapy office itself is treated as a character, with its furniture, textures, and pockets of light subtly shifting to mirror emotional states and narrative progression.  Color and sound function as emotional scaffolding. Warm palettes give way to cooler tones as deeper truths are confronted, while sound design foregrounds breathing, rustling, and ambient space over heavy musical scoring. Music is used sparingly and intentionally, entering like memory and retreating into silence, allowing viewers to experience the raw, unfiltered weight of each exchange.  Technically, the series is captured on RED Komodo and Sony FX3 systems and mastered in 4K HDR with 5.1 surround sound to support both intimate YouTube viewing and potential festival or platform presentations. The production model utilizes a 30 to 35 person crew per unit, multi camera setups for real time performance, and a post production schedule that prioritizes emotional continuity across all eight episodes.
