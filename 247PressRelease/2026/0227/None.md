# Sister Reintroduces Late Brother's Award-Winning Illustrated Fantasy for 2026

BLOOMFIELD, NY, February 27, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The new year can arrive quietly. Many families step into 2026 carrying fatigue, uncertainty, and a lingering question: How do we keep hope alive when life feels heavy?  That question is why Stephanie Glamack is stepping forward with a renewed push for Littluns and the Book of Darkness, a 411-page, fully illustrated Christian fantasy created by her late brother, Disney-trained animator and author Mark Glamack. The book is being brought to families and readers who want stories that invite meaningful conversations about courage, conviction, faith, and the steady pursuit of Light.  "This isn't just a book to me," said Stephanie Glamack. "It's my brother's life on paper, and it carries a message families need right now: the light still wins, but you have to choose it."  A cinematic fantasy with moral gravity, built for this moment  At first glance, Littluns and the Book of Darkness reads like classic fantasy. A community of gentle "littluns" leaves their mountain home for a scavenger hunt and stumbles into a widening conflict that tests the strength of their world and the resolve of their hearts.  The story unfolds as a high-stakes journey of responsibility, perseverance, and spiritual fortitude. A reluctant littlun crosses forbidden lands, survives conflict among humans and goblins, and confronts a wicked Necromancer intent on overtaking the world. Along the way, the novel explores identity under pressure, innocence challenged by the unknown, and faith strengthened through hardship.  Told in present tense from a third-person omniscient perspective, the novel includes 63 color illustrations and is printed in the U.S. on high-quality stock. Mark Glamack described the reading experience as a "motion-picture experience you can only read."  Award recognition, with the mission still in view  Littluns and the Book of Darkness has earned Mom's Choice Awards® Gold in two categories, Fiction and Fantasy, Myths, Legends, along with recognition from The Dove Foundation and an honorable mention at Book Expo in New York.  For Stephanie, the recognition matters because it signals that the story connects with readers. Her focus remains on helping the message reach the audience it was written for.  "My job now is to make sure it reaches the people it was meant to reach," she said. "Mark believed this story could help someone find light in their own darkness. I won't let it disappear."  A sister's promise, turning grief into stewardship  After Mark's passing, the book faced practical hurdles that many families never anticipate. There were rights to manage, inventory to maintain, and logistics to learn. Stephanie, who describes herself as a "country girl without deep pockets," stepped into responsibilities she never expected, with a commitment to protect the quality and care behind the original edition.  "There were easier choices," she said. "Mark cared about quality. This is how I keep his light alive."  A New Year invitation to readers who still choose the Light  As 2026 begins, Stephanie is inviting readers into a story that mirrors what many people feel right now. The book speaks to moral courage, steady conviction, and the kind of faith that holds when life grows complicated.  In one of the book's enduring lines, Mark Glamack writes: "If you surround yourself with good and righteous people, they can only raise you up. If you surround yourself with the others, they will drag you down into the doldrums of mediocrity, and they will keep you there, but only as long as you permit it."  Order the deluxe hardcover edition  Littluns and the Book of Darkness is available in its original, full-color deluxe hardcover edition for $29.95, sold directly through the family so readers can experience the book as Mark intended, and so the legacy can continue one copy at a time.
