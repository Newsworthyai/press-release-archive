# 66% of US Bankruptcies Are Medical

IRVINE, CA, February 27, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A new study published this month reveals that even insured Americans face 24% higher medical debt risk 18 months after traumatic injuries, with average marketplace deductibles reaching $5,304 for silver plans and $7,186 for bronze in 2026. Medical expenses cause 66.5% of American bankruptcies - approximately 550,000 annually - making healthcare the leading bankruptcy driver in the nation. Rather than hoping insurance will protect them, Sellvia Market is showing Americans how business ownership generates income that actually covers unexpected medical costs - creating financial buffers that employment salaries fundamentally cannot provide.  The medical bankruptcy crisis is uniquely American in scope and devastation. While other developed nations experience virtually zero healthcare-related bankruptcies, 100 million Americans carry medical debt with 32% believing they'll never pay it off completely. Business ownership provides what employment cannot - income substantial enough to absorb $5,000+ deductibles and tens of thousands in out-of-pocket costs without financial ruin.  Owleys.com demonstrates what becomes possible when Americans build genuine financial security beyond employment. This car and travel accessories business generated $1.96 million in revenue with $1.1 million in net profit annually. A family acquiring this operation doesn't fear medical emergencies bankrupting them - monthly business income of $90,000+ means a $7,186 deductible or $20,000 hospital bill becomes manageable rather than catastrophic, eliminating the terror that defines American healthcare for wage-dependent families.  "Employed Americans live one accident away from bankruptcy," notes the platform's analysis. "Business owners generate income making medical emergencies financially survivable."  The crisis affects insured Americans as dramatically as uninsured. Gectra.com, specializing in smart devices, creates income through established campaigns serving growing markets. Research shows 56% of people with medical debt actually have insurance - but coverage with $5,000+ deductibles provides illusion rather than protection. Business income provides the financial depth making high-deductible insurance functional rather than merely theoretical.  Recent data reveals the medical debt epidemic's shocking scope. Enhanced ACA subsidies expired, creating surges in uninsured Americans and higher deductibles. Private insurance patients face greater bankruptcy risk than Medicare/Medicaid recipients. Trauma hospitalizations increase medical debt in collections by 24% within 18 months. Business acquisition addresses what insurance fundamentally doesn't - generating income sufficient to meet out-of-pocket costs that destroy wage-dependent families.  Each acquisition includes infrastructure enabling medical-emergency-proof income: proven advertising campaigns generating consistent revenue regardless of health status, established supplier relationships maintaining operations during medical crises, customer databases providing recurring income that continues through hospitalizations, and documented procedures allowing business operation even when owners face health challenges. New owners receive income security that makes American healthcare financially survivable.  Platform features help medically-vulnerable Americans transition confidently. Trial opportunities allow potential buyers to experience business ownership before committing, understanding exactly how additional income transforms medical emergency outcomes. This hands-on exploration shows that bankruptcy protection doesn't require winning the insurance lottery - it requires income exceeding survival needs.  The demographic impact is profound. Asmone.com, capitalizing on TikTok success trends, generates income protecting families from the medical bankruptcy affecting 550,000 annually. Middle-aged Americans face highest medical debt rates before Medicare eligibility. Black Americans carry medical debt at nearly double white American rates. Business ownership provides protection disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations - creating income buffers that prevent medical crises from becoming financial catastrophes.  Recent buyers demonstrate successful medical-security transitions: a family with chronic illness history acquired a business generating enough monthly income to cover any deductible without hardship, a couple watching friends declare medical bankruptcy purchased an operation producing income that makes their high-deductible plan actually viable, and a single parent whose emergency appendectomy nearly caused bankruptcy now owns a business where unexpected medical costs won't destroy financial stability.  The platform serves Americans at different medical vulnerability levels. Some have chronic conditions making bankruptcy risk constant. Others fear sudden accidents overwhelming finances. Each business acquisition represents escape from the uniquely American phenomenon where healthcare access causes financial ruin - creating income making medical treatment financially survivable.  Verified financial records and performance analytics enable informed decisions about medical security alternatives. Authenticated business revenue histories show income generation that creates genuine healthcare financial protection - unlike insurance policies with $7,000 deductibles that provide coverage in name only.  This represents fundamental rejection of accepting medical bankruptcy as inevitable. When 66.5% of bankruptcies stem from healthcare costs and even insured patients face devastating financial consequences from injuries, hoping better insurance will solve the crisis becomes unrealistic. Business ownership provides what insurance cannot - income substantial enough to pay the bills insurance doesn't cover.  Industry projections show marketplace deductibles continuing to rise while out-of-pocket maximums reach $9,200 for individuals in 2026. Business acquisition enables Americans to generate income making these costs absorbable - transforming from medical-bankruptcy candidates into families with actual financial healthcare security.  For Americans, recognizing that insurance won't protect them from medical bankruptcy and employment income won't cover healthcare emergencies, established business acquisition provides concrete alternatives to hoping they'll avoid injury or illness.
