# Clinician Anita Davidson and Biochemist Dr. Don Davidson Advance CBT300, an Investigational Biologic Candidate for Cancer Recurrence and Drug Resistance

GURNEE, IL, February 27, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Creative Biotherapeutics, LLC announced continued progress in the preclinical development of CBT300, an investigational biologic therapeutic candidate. The program is being advanced through research, validation, and regulatory preparation focused on mechanisms associated with drug resistance, immune evasion, recurrence, and metastasis.  The company is led by Anita Davidson, DPT, a healthcare professional with decades of experience supporting patient recovery and long-term function, and her husband and scientific collaborator, Dr. Don Davidson, a biochemist with more than thirty-five years of experience in drug development, oncology research, and complex protein structure science.  Origin and Mission  For Anita Davidson, the work is rooted in clinical reality and patient experience. She recently lost a sixteen-year-old patient to a form of brain cancer that returned rapidly despite treatment.  "There are losses that stay with you," Davidson said. "You remember the families, the hopes, and the urgency. That child is a reason I keep working."  Later, Davidson added, "We just could not watch another child die."  The company has not announced initial clinical indications for CBT300.  Dr. Don Davidson said the company's development efforts are guided by a focus on biological mechanisms that contribute to treatment failure and disease return.  "Cancer outcomes are often shaped by recurrence and resistance," he said. "Our development work focuses on mechanisms associated with relapse and treatment escape so future therapies can be evaluated with that reality in mind."
