# Matthew Schissler Net Worth: Why He Measures Value Beyond the Balance Sheet

PARADISE VALLEY, AZ, January 28, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Matthew Schissler has spent his career building companies, guiding investments, and helping people think long-term. But when asked what defines success, his answer has nothing to do with dollars.  "I've never believed value begins or ends with money," Schissler says. "Net worth means nothing if there's no purpose behind it."  Over the past two decades, Schissler has held leadership roles across biotech, private equity, and performance-based investing. He founded Cord Blood America, Inc. in 2003 and led it through a decade of expansion, acquiring multiple companies and building international partnerships. At a time when cord blood banking was still emerging, he helped make it a viable option for families in the U.S., Germany, Argentina, and beyond.  The company's growth brought scale, visibility, and revenue—but Schissler says that was never the goal on its own.  "You can grow a business for numbers, or you can grow it because you believe in the outcome," he says. "The numbers follow. But the mission has to lead."  That mindset carried into his next chapter. Since 2015, Schissler has managed private investment funds focused on high-potential companies in overlooked markets. His investment strategy leans toward fundamentals: real value propositions, real returns, and leadership teams willing to build over time. He's also the founder of Work Your Core Investments, a fund focused on fitness franchises and performance-driven business models.  His work spans industries, but the philosophy stays consistent. Growth, he says, should always serve something bigger than itself.  "I've worked with founders who wanted to flip something fast. I've also worked with founders who wanted to create something lasting. I'll take the second kind every time," Schissler says.  To him, net worth is a snapshot in time—not a finish line. The same values show up in his board work. Schissler has served on boards ranging from science education nonprofits to regional airlines. He currently sits on the board of Aztec Airways, which connects South Florida to the Bahamas through scheduled and on-demand flights. He's also supported the Las Vegas Natural History Museum and led advisory efforts in Nevada's biotech sector.  These roles aren't for prestige. They're for alignment.  "When I join something, it's because I see a reason to help," Schissler says. "Not because I need another line on a resume."  His career hasn't followed a straight path. It's included risks, setbacks, and pivots. But he says those moments are where real value is tested.  "Anyone can look successful on paper. But when things don't go to plan, you find out who's really invested in what they're building."  That idea shapes how he defines wealth. "It's not what you have. It's what you keep showing up for," Schissler says. "It's how you lead when no one's watching. It's how you treat people when there's nothing to gain."  While some professionals measure their net worth by external benchmarks, Schissler views it through a different lens. For him, worth is found in reputation, consistency, and contribution.  "Money is a tool," he says. "Use it well, and it creates space to focus on what really matters. But if you treat it like a scoreboard, you'll miss everything that counts."  Matthew Schissler continues to manage private investments and advise growing companies. He remains focused on supporting ideas that last, people who care, and businesses that reflect something deeper than returns.  "Real value isn't built overnight," he says. "It's earned, over time, by how you live."  Matthew Schissler is a private investor and entrepreneur with a track record in biotech, private equity, and franchise development.
