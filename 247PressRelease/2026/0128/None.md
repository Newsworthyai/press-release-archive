# HITEKS Earns Epic Toolbox Designation for NoteReader CDI Integration of CAPD360 Insight

NEW YORK, NY, January 28, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- HITEKS Solutions Inc. (HITEKS) announced it has been granted Epic's Toolbox designation for NoteReader CDI, helping clinicians produce compliant medical records in real time and expanding access to its Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation (CAPD360 Insight) solution.  HITEKS says it remains the only AI solution for physicians that doesn't require them to change the way they learned to document in medical school and residency, and the only AI solution designed to work compliantly in real time without violating False Claims Act requirements related to upcoding.  While HITEKS became a part of Epic's App Orchard (and what is now Epic Showroom) in 2017, the company's latest integration with Epic represents an endorsement of its quality and its connection practices within NoteReader CDI. Each year, Epic evaluates categories, design requirements, and products within Toolbox, making this designation particularly significant.  HITEKS CAPD360 Insight is built to integrate into Epic's NoteReader CDI workflows and screens tied to the native Epic Note Editor and related functions such as Diagnosis Aware Notes (DAN). The system is proactive—evaluating notes for a given patient by multiple providers for potential integrity issues and offering suggestions to guide diagnoses that may need modification or more complete information. This reduces time spent on retrospective CDI queries by front-loading guidance while patient facts are still top of mind prior to discharge.  "Our Toolbox collaboration with Epic gives Epic hospitals an advanced capability to streamline physician and CDI and coding specialist interaction to reduce time spent and increase accuracy in notifying providers of compliant documentation integrity opportunities during note writing and review workflows, without forcing the physician to change the way they document," said HITEKS' CEO Dr. Gerasimos Petratos.  Used by hundreds of hospitals across the country, CAPD360 Insight is designed to make clinical documentation faster, easier, and more accurate by automating steps that were once manual and prompting questions that help clinicians better comply with current guidelines. The product provides real-time, configurable queries across more than 140 diagnoses to support accurate claims coding for reimbursement and quality metrics.  HITEKS continues to update CAPD360 Insight to reflect the latest guidance, including improvements that better identify relevant DRG diagnoses, POA (Present on Admission), and peri-operative events to support quality metric benchmarks as well as PSI (Patient Safety Indicators) and HAC (Hospital Acquired Conditions) requirements.  HITEKS says what sets its approach apart is its focus on analytics and being embedded within EHR workflows rather than operating outside the medical record. With the Toolbox relationship, HITEKS plans to broaden availability, enable quicker customization during implementation, and advance initiatives including Ambulatory HCC compliance, peri-operative CDI, UR/UM, denials prevention, encoder/grouper support, and pre-bill cost avoidance.
