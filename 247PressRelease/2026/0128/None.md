# SNAH Healthcare Launches Innovative Senior Transportation Partnership with City of West Haven, CT

WEST HAVEN, CT, January 28, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Today, SNAH Healthcare announced the official debut of their new partnership with the City of West Haven to provide non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) and senior center shuttle services, through an extensive, competitive municipality bidding process. Although there is a focus on transporting individuals from place to place through the use of this program, the true focus is building a new transportation model around trust, safety and efficiency of governmentally funded transportation services for the community.  This strategic partnership further solidifies SNAH Healthcare's commitment to its mission of providing reliable, dignified, and technologically advanced transportation solution for vulnerable populations. This new service will provide shuttles to the West Haven Senior Center on a daily basis, and additionally will provide shuttles to designated locations for grocery shopping, while utilizing the existing schedule for residents of West Haven.  What differentiates SNAH Healthcare from other NEMT providers is SNAH's continued commitment to upholding the tenets of safety, integrity, transparency, and fraud prevention—all critical components of any public sector partnership.  Every SNAH vehicle that provides NEMT and senior center shuttle service for West Haven will be outfitted with an extensive suite of security features beginning on day one of the program. SNAH's fleet of modern, white shuttles are all equipped with front and back-facing cameras that create an entire visual record of each trip for both passenger safety and driver safety. Even better, every vehicle will have real-time GPS tracking to ensure SNAH's transparency promise to our municipal partners, the City of West Haven, that service delivery will be able to be tracked in real time, including compliance with established routes, timeliness of service, and maximum use of resources.  One of the most significant features of this new service is its commitment to providing door-to-door assistance to the senior population of West Haven. Many seniors in the community have mobility challenged. As such, SNAH's drivers are trained professionals who will provide customers with hands-on assistance from their home to their seat on the shuttle and back. In doing so, SNAH will combine a person-centered approach to customer service with the technological foundation to make the entire process compassionate and accountable.  Government agencies and prospective vendors often rate fraud and misuse of funding for NEMT as their number one concern. As such, SNAH has built its entire operational model with the specific intention of reducing fraud. By offering our partners full and complete visibility of every step in the trip continuum, SNAH offers our partners a level of confidence that there will be no fraudulent billing or "ghost rides", resulting in both peace of mind and a tangible ROI through reduced costs.  "We acknowledge and understand that municipalities have a fiduciary obligation to their taxpayers," stated Paulina Wierzbicka, President of SNAH Healthcare. "Our technology and processes are intended to enhance municipalities' control and verification processes, and therefore, will not provide a 'black box' environment for our partners. We will provide our partners with performance reports, but will also provide them with the tools to monitor that performance on their own."  This successful launch of the SNAH service in West Haven represents the wealth of experience and expertise that SNAH executive team has in managing the administration of publicly funded transportation and home-care programs. As we continue to competitively pursue multiple other bid opportunities throughout the regions and nationwide, we invite municipalities and potential vendor partners to contact us. SNAH offers more than just vehicles and drivers; SNAH offers a secure, transparent, future-proof partnership that puts communities' needs first while protecting taxpayers' investments of public funds.
