# MSAN'S MENTAL HEALTH ALLY CERTIFICATION OFFICIALLY JOINS THE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE FOR MILITARY SPOUSE'S PROGRAM CATALOG

SAN ANTONIO, TX, January 06, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Military Spouse Advocacy Network (MSAN) experienced unprecedented growth in 2025 thanks to the launch of its Leadership Institute for Military Spouses (LIMS). This year, the nonprofit organization will officially incorporate one of its most sought-after opportunities, the Psych Hub Mental Health Ally Certification, sponsored by USAA, to the LIMS catalog.   MSAN pioneered and continuously provides a structured and personal approach through a one-of-a-kind peer-to-peer mentorship experience within our proprietary Membership HUB. In alignment with the organization's mission, we empower military spouses even further by implementing this self-paced certification on-demand through the Leadership Institute for Military Spouses.   Results from our 2025 cohort surveys indicate that:  • 83% of surveyed participants said the challenges that they've encountered as a military spouse have affected their mental health or overall wellness. • 97% of participants who completed the coursework indicated that they now have tools to assist themselves or someone else during a mental health crisis. • 92% of participants say the training taught them something new about mental health and wellness.  The Mental Health Allyship training helps to address mental health resource shortages. Participants will benefit from Psych Hub's evidence-based professional training, which supports a more compassionate and mentally fit volunteer force. Psych Hub hosts a library of over 1,000 digital assets, including short videos, shareable content, and podcasts.  All spouses of a current serving United States military member from any branch of our armed services are welcome to apply, including the Reserves and Guard OR post 9-11 Gold Star Spouse, Surviving Spouse, Caregiver, or the Spouse of a Veteran or Retiree.

From Verenice Castillo, MSAN Founder & CEO "Military spouses are often the first line of support for their families and communities, yet access to timely mental health resources remains a critical challenge. These certifications equip military spouses to serve as trained mental health allies and first emotional responders—bridging the gap between the moment support is needed and the time professional care becomes available. It is a big step for LIMS to now host the training and provide military spouses a bigger journey full of opportunities. We are grateful for USAA's partnership and shared commitment to creating lasting impact for those who serve alongside our nation's military."
