# Financial Design Group Opens Ninth Office in Independence, OH, Welcoming Veteran advisor Jim Jack and Team from Ameriprise Financial

TOLEDO, OH, February 22, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Financial Design Group (FDG), an 30 year old financial services firm headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, today announced the opening of its ninth branch office in Independence, OH, with the addition of the Jim Jack team from Ameriprise Financial. The move not only expands FDG's footprint but carries a fitting irony: the new location in "Independence" perfectly symbolizes the firm's supported independence model, which empowers financial advisors to own 100% of their practice while benefiting from institutional scale and dedicated support.   "With our supported Independence Model advisors can own their practice without having to build it alone. FDG is strategically structured to empower financial advisors to succeed as business owners by providing customized support and services that align with unique needs of each advisor and their clients" Michael Clements, President of FDG.  The Jim Jack team, led by Jim Jack and his more than 30 years with Ameriprise Financial, includes experienced wealth advisors Nicholas Bloomhuff and Ryan Montanari. The team brings decades of combined experience in personalized wealth management, retirement planning, and client-focused strategies to FDG's growing network. After a long and successful tenure at Ameriprise, Jim Jack sought a platform that combined LPL Financials' robust resources with genuine, personalized support. "I wanted to find a place with the institutional scale and resources that come from LPL combined with an environment of support," said Jim Jack. "I didn't want to have to worry about the back office and systems; I want to just focus 100% of my attention on my clients. This structure allowed my team the independence and ownership we were seeking with the personalized support of a firm like FDG."  The new office is located at 4401 Rockside Road, Suite 201, Independence, OH 44131, and operates under the same commitment to excellence that defines FDG.   Jason Strasser, Executive Vice President of Financial Design Group, emphasized the firm's ongoing investment in its platform: "We focus on building out our platform with innovative technology and experienced and dedicated support teams to allow our advisors to recapture time so they can focus on the client experience."  This addition marks FDG's latest success in the competitive war for advisor talent, contributing to seven new advisors joining in the past 12 months from firms including Ameriprise, Osaic, Croak Capital, Stifel, and WesBanco.   Since affiliating with LPL Financial in March 2023, FDG has had great growth and now supports 20 advisors across nine offices, and 5 states, by providing seamless transitions, back-office handling, AI-powered tools, streamlined workflows, and on-site onboarding for a true "soft landing."   "FDG's model delivers what advisors like Jim and his team are looking for: full ownership without the isolation of going fully independent," said Michael Clements, President and CEO of Financial Design Group. "We handle the administrative burdens, implementation, and operational details so professionals can prioritize client relationships and growth—proving FDG as the destination firm in today's evolving advisory landscape."
