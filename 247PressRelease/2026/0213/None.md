# EMPLOYERS URGED TO DOUBLE-CHECK PAYROLL DOCUMENTATION TO AVOID IRS PENALTIES THIS TAX SEASON

LOS ANGELES, CA, February 13, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- With tax deadlines approaching, employers across industries are being reminded of the importance of maintaining complete and accurate payroll documentation. Incomplete records, missed tax deposits, and filing errors continue to be among the most common causes of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) penalties during annual and quarterly reviews.  Payroll compliance specialists note that even small documentation gaps can trigger fines, interest charges, or audit scrutiny. Conducting a thorough payroll record review before filing deadlines can help organizations reduce risk and ensure federal and state tax obligations are properly met.  Employers are encouraged to verify several critical payroll records and reporting requirements before submitting tax forms to ensure accuracy.  Key Payroll Records to Confirm Before Filing  Employee Withholding Forms (W-4s) Updated withholding forms ensure that federal income tax amounts are calculated correctly throughout the year. Employers should confirm that all current employees have valid and up-to-date forms on file.  Quarterly Tax Filings (Form 941) Form 941 reports income tax withheld along with Social Security and Medicare taxes. Filing late or submitting inaccurate information can lead to escalating penalties based on unpaid tax balances.  Wage and Tax Statements (W-2s) Annual W-2 forms must accurately reflect employee earnings, benefits, and withholdings. Errors may require corrections and can delay employee tax filings.  Payroll Registers and Time Records Detailed pay registers, time sheets, and compensation reports serve as supporting documentation during audits or compliance checks and help validate wage calculations.  In addition to reviewing documentation, businesses are advised to reconcile payroll ledgers with tax filings, confirm deposit schedules, and ensure payroll systems are configured to apply correct tax rates. Maintaining organized digital or paper records for multiple years can further protect employers if questions arise.  A proactive compliance review can help businesses avoid unnecessary penalties, maintain operational efficiency, and promote trust with employees by ensuring accurate and timely compensation reporting.
