"At Fasig Brooks, we are immensely proud of helping our clients come back stronger from horrible injuries caused by someone else's carelessness," Roane said. "It is deeply fulfilling to watch the lives of our clients significantly improve when we force companies and their insurance carriers to do the right thing and justly compensate our clients for everything they have been through with their injuries, pain and suffering, and other losses."  "While our client and his family still face a lifetime of challenges as a result of his injuries, this compensation will help ease their burden going forward. This is why we do what we do and I'm so thankful that our client and his family trusted us as advocates in their time of need," Molaghan added.
