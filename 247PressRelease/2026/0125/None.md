# Declares Our Identity: One Family, One Savior, One Body in Christ

KANSAS CITY, KS, January 25, 2026  *Today's Prayer* Heavenly Father,  We are grateful that through Jesus, we are made holy and brought into Your family. We praise You for the bond that we share with our Savior, and for the unity that exists between us as believers. You have brought us near to Yourself, and we are honored to be called Your children.  In Your great love, You have sent Jesus to make us holy, and through Him, we have been adopted into Your family. No matter what our personal status is, or where we've come from, or what we've been through, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, united in our shared faith. Jesus is not ashamed to call us brothers and sisters, and we are grateful for the relationship that we have with Him. May we live in the light of this truth, and may our lives reflect the love and unity that exists within our family.  *Today's Scripture*  Hebrews 2:11 -  "For both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters."  *Overall Meaning: Hebrews 2:11* This scripture emphasizes the intimate relationship between Jesus and believers, highlighting that through His sacrifice, we are made holy and become part of God's family. This verse reminds us that we are not alone, but are united with Christ and with one another as siblings, sharing a familial bond. No matter what our personal status is or where we come from or what we've been through, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, united in our shared faith.
