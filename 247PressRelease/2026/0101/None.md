# Attorney Wayne Cohen Weighs in on Ethical AI in Legal Practice

VENTURA, CA, January 01, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Wayne Cohen, founder and lead attorney at Cohen Injury Law Group, recently delivered a talk, focusing on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal practice. This presentation, which was subsequently presented to law students at George Washington University, explored how AI is reshaping legal strategies.  In his talk, Cohen emphasized the importance of integrating AI tools responsibly within the legal profession, highlighting the necessity for lawyers to maintain their professional judgment and ethical obligations. He discussed how AI can assist in analyzing vast amounts of data, but cautioned that reliance on AI must not replace the critical thinking and oversight that lawyers provide.  Cohen's insights are particularly timely as the legal community grapples with the implications of AI integration. The State Bar of California has issued practical guidance on the use of generative AI in legal practice, emphasizing that lawyers must uphold their duties of competence, confidentiality, and communication when utilizing AI tools. The official document posted to the Bar's website also advises lawyers to disclose to clients when AI is used and to make sure that AI-generated content is thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and compliance with legal standards.  As the use of AI continues to grow, it is anticipated that further regulations will be instated in an effort to protect the integrity of the legal system.
