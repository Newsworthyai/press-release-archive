# Local Chandler Plumbing Company Launches Sewer Drain Awareness Initiative: "No Good Drain Should Ever Back Up"

CHANDLER, AZ, February 20, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Good Times Plumbing & Restoration, a local Chandler Plumber, is launching a Sewer & Drain Awareness Initiative across the East Valley, educating homeowners on a simple but critical truth: no properly functioning drain should ever back up.  From now through the end of March, the locally owned company is offering $39 professional drain opening services along with a free sewer camera inspection with every drain clearing, helping homeowners identify the root cause of recurring backups instead of just temporarily relieving symptoms, without proper inspection, this can lead to water damage Phoenix homeowners and Chandler homeowners aren't properly prepared to deal with.  "Most homeowners think a drain backup is normal or just something that happens," said Trenton McMinn, Co-Founder and CEO of Good Times Plumbing & Restoration. "The reality is, if a drain is backing up, there's an underlying issue. A healthy plumbing system flows freely. Our goal is not to put a band-aid on the problem — it's to identify what's actually going on inside the line and give homeowners real peace of mind."  Common causes of drain and sewer backups in Arizona homes include:  • Root intrusion in sewer lines • Pipe belly or improper slope • Aging cast iron or clay piping • Heavy buildup from grease and debris • Shifting soil conditions  While many companies simply clear a blockage and leave, Good Times Plumbing & Restoration is including a complimentary sewer camera inspection with every drain service to show homeowners exactly what condition their line is in.  "We believe homeowners deserve to see what we see," McMinn added. "If the line is in great shape, we'll show you that. If there's a deeper issue, we'll explain it clearly and give options. Our entire mission is to restore peace of mind, not create fear."  The company's proactive approach focuses on identifying long-term system health rather than recurring emergency calls. By pairing affordable drain service with diagnostic imaging, the team aims to prevent repeat backups, water damage, and costly structural repairs.  The Sewer & Drain Awareness Initiative is available to homeowners in Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, Mesa, Scottsdale, and surrounding communities through March 31.
