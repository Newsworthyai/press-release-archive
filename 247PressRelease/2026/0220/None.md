# Tax Preparation Should Not Be a Luxury: Paul Dean Built Everyday People Tax Return Service for Those Who Deserve Honest Help

PAWTUCKET, RI, February 20, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Every year, as tax season arrives, millions of Americans face stress. W-2s arrive in the mail. 1099s pile up on kitchen tables. Deadlines close in. For many hardworking people, the pressure is not only filing correctly. It is also the cost of getting help.  For countless households, professional tax preparation has become out of reach. Fees climb into the hundreds, even for basic returns. Large firms rush clients through impersonal systems. People who need the most support walk away feeling overlooked, overcharged, or exhausted.  That is why Paul Dean founded Everyday People Tax Return Service LLC, built for the person working two jobs to stay afloat, the single parent making ends meet, the retiree living on a fixed income, and the young worker filing for the first time.  "For the common everyday person," Dean says, "tax return preparation fees should not be in the hundreds of dollars. My goal is to provide accurate filing at an affordable price, while making sure people feel supported through the process."  His approach is simple: professional service, clear guidance, affordable fees, and a process that is easy to understand.  Everyday People Tax Return Service offers a flat rate of $95 for a federal and one state return. Each additional state return is $25.  "Everyday people deserve great care," Dean says. "They have already worked hard enough. They should not feel punished just for filing taxes."  Accuracy Matters When Every Dollar Counts  Affordability is only part of the mission. Dean is equally focused on doing the work correctly, thoroughly, and with care.  "I can save you time, money, and stress by preparing and filing your returns," Dean says, "while helping ensure you receive every deduction and credit you qualify for."  For Dean, accuracy is not just about numbers. It is about what those numbers mean in real life. It can mean groceries, rent, and breathing room. His process is designed to help clients avoid leaving money on the table because they were rushed or overlooked.  Serving the Self-Employed and Independent Workers  Everyday People Tax Return Service also supports individuals who file Schedule C returns, including independent workers, contractors, and small business owners. These clients may include delivery drivers, hairstylists, handymen, freelancers, and entrepreneurs.  Tax filing for the self-employed can be confusing, and many people pay more than they should because they are unsure what deductions are legitimate or how to stay compliant. Dean's services are designed to help clients reduce future tax liability through proper preparation and planning.  "Effective tax preparation and planning can help you minimize your future tax liability," Dean explains, offering clients not just filing, but clarity.  A Resource and a Relationship  Beyond returns, Dean has developed tools and resources to support clients outside of the appointment. The firm's online Resource Center is intended to make information easier to access and reduce confusion.  Dean believes people deserve transparency and support, and someone they can actually reach. That is why Everyday People Tax Return Service remains approachable and built around real relationships.
