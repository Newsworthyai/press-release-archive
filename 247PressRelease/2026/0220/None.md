# Donna S. Jones and DSJ &amp; Associates Bring Two Decades of Medical Expertise to the Courtroom, One Record at a Time

ATLANTA, GA, February 20, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Donna S. Jones has never forgotten where she came from, and she has never stopped using those lessons in her work.  Long before she founded DSJ & Associates, a trusted legal nurse consulting and expert witness resource for attorneys in the United States, Canada, and England, Jones was the youngest of seven children raised on a farm in West Virginia. Her father worked in the coal mines. Her mother raised the family while putting herself through school, teaching by day and studying at night until she earned her degree.  "My mother was relentless," Jones says. "She showed us what it meant to keep going, no matter what."  Jones describes her upbringing with mountain humor that does not ask for sympathy. It asks for respect.  "My husband's nephew once asked if I grew up rich," she laughs. "And I told him, we were so poor we couldn't even afford to pay attention."  It is funny, and it is also the blueprint. Those early lessons in grit, discipline, and survival shaped the woman who now helps attorneys navigate complex litigation, translating medical records into courtroom strategy, and helping ensure the right experts are in place long before trial.  A Foundation Built on Work, Discipline, and Detail   Jones remembers being woken early to pick beans from the garden, a task she admits she hated as a child. But it was part of a larger family routine: canning food to make it through the winter.  "It wasn't optional," she says. "It was just what we did. And it taught me something I still live by today. Preparation matters."  That training in discipline and attention to detail later became central to her career, first in nursing and then in legal nurse consulting, where a single note in a medical chart can change the direction of a case.  From Nursing to Legal Strategy  Jones earned a partial scholarship to attend college because that was all her family could afford. She received her nursing degree through Fairmont State University, later earning a second degree in Communication at Georgia State University.  Nursing was never just a profession for her. It became an education in human vulnerability, medical decision-making, and the consequences of care, including what happens when something gets overlooked.  "Nurses see everything," Jones explains. "We see what's said out loud, and we see what's missing. We see patterns. We see red flags."  That discernment naturally evolved into a different kind of expertise attorneys often need: the ability to interpret medical records with both clinical understanding and litigation relevance.  A Leap to Atlanta and a Career That Built a Firm   One night at dinner, Jones told her parents she was moving to Atlanta. Their reaction was immediate disbelief.  "They looked at me like I was crazy," she says. "They asked me, 'What if you don't like it?' And I replied, 'Then I'll move back home.'"  Over the next 45 years, Jones worked as a bedside and ICU nurse in many hospital settings across Atlanta. That experience sharpened her clinical instincts and became the foundation for what is now one of the most trusted legal nurse consulting firms supporting litigation across North America and beyond.  Today, Jones has retired from bedside nursing and lives in Brunswick, a small coastal town in South Georgia. She continues her work through DSJ & Associates while enjoying a well-earned change of pace.  "I guess it worked out," she says, smiling.  DSJ & Associates, Nearly 20 Years Supporting Litigation Teams   Founded nearly two decades ago, DSJ & Associates provides legal nurse consulting, medical record review, and expert witness matching for plaintiff and defense attorneys, as well as insurance companies seeking merit reviews and standard-of-care clarity.  Cases supported by DSJ & Associates have ranged from routine injury matters and medical negligence to catastrophic injury, wrongful death, and homicide.  The firm supports legal teams through:  · Medical record review and analysis  · Standard-of-care and merit assessments  · Chronologies, summaries, and issue identification  · Litigation strategy support  · Vetted expert witness recommendations  · Access to nursing and ancillary healthcare specialists  "Our job is to help attorneys see what's truly in the record," Jones says. "Not only what's written, but what it means, what it suggests, what it supports, and what may be missing."  What Makes DSJ Different: Vetted Experts and the Right Match  In a field where expert testimony can make or break a case, DSJ & Associates differentiates itself through rigorous vetting and intentional matching, ensuring each recommended expert is credible, qualified, and aligned with the facts and needs of the matter.  "We vet every practitioner before we recommend them," Jones explains. "Attorneys don't need just a name. They need the right person. Someone who holds up under scrutiny and communicates clearly."  That vetting process, paired with Jones' firsthand clinical experience and strategic perspective, has positioned DSJ & Associates as a trusted partner to legal teams seeking precision, speed, and clinical integrity.  A Mission Rooted in Truth   For Jones, this work is not simply transactional. It is principled. She believes medical records tell stories. Some are clear. Some are incomplete. Many are complicated. All carry weight, and the people behind them deserve accuracy.  "This work matters because people matter," Jones says. "Whether you're representing a patient, a family, a provider, or an institution, you want to know what happened. You want the facts. You want the truth. That's what we help uncover."  In a world where litigation can hinge on the smallest detail, Donna S. Jones has spent nearly two decades doing what she was trained to do long before she ever stepped into legal consulting: pay attention when others miss what matters.
