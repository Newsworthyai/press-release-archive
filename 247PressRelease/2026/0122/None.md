# Author, Spiritual Leader, and Counselor Swanzi Saunders Introduces the Release of Her New Book "Still Becoming: A Therapist's Sacred Journey through Depression"

MAGNOLIA, TX, January 22, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dr. Swanzi Saunders-Davis is a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor in private practice in California, with decades of experience in helping individuals navigate trauma, depression, and relational challenges. As a former church pastor and spiritual leader, Swanzi draws from a rich blend of faith and psychology to guide listeners and readers toward inner healing and spiritual renewal.   Her lived experience with depression informs her therapeutic perspectives, making this book both personal and universally resonant. She wrote "Still Becoming" to comfort others in their journeys and to reaffirm they are not alone. The path of healing may seem narrow and hidden, but it is not empty.   "Still Becoming" is a deeply personal and spiritually rooted memoir that shares Saunders' journey through clinical depression, a journey marked by silence, surrender, and finally healing. As a therapist and someone who actually walked through this valley of despair with no access to clinical help at the time, she uses her own professional insight combined with the spiritual wisdom gleaned over the years, and presents it with compassion for others on this or a similar path to wholeness.  This book is an invitation to transformation. It's not a quick fix– it's about a sacred unfolding of what it means to heal through grace, faith, hope, and the gradual return of light and life. It is remembering that connection is one of the places where God loves to dwell. God gets it—and He sees you.  As a valuable asset that has already received glowing reviews from readers across the US, Swanzi's debut book will educate, support and inspire. "Still Becoming" reminds each person that healing begins with letting go of the destination; Start from where you are, not from where you think you "should" be. True healing begins when we speak the truth!  ABOUT LUCID BOOKS Lucid Books is an independent, hybrid publisher in the Houston area.
