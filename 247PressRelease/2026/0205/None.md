# New Dietary Guidelines, Focus on Real Foods and Ways to Save Money on Groceries: Hodo Shares High-Protein Sources like Tofu Offering an Affordable Path to Healthy Clean Eating

OAKLAND, CA, February 05, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- If you've resolved to cook and eat healthier in the New Year, Hodo, loved by Michelin-star chefs, nutritionists, and home cooks alike, can help!   New Dietary Guidelines for Americans remind us that better health starts on our plates, not in the medicine cabinet. The updated nutrition guidance encourages people to build meals around real, whole, nutrient-dense food with ingredients that come straight from nature.   A recent poll by The Associated Press shows "The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries…" Savvy shoppers are now buying more tofu and legumes to cut their grocery bills and hit their protein goals.   "Whole plant proteins like beans and tofu are an easy and delicious way to eat real, whole foods while supporting long-term health and wellness," shares Hodo founder Minh Tsai. "The rise of GLP-1 medications are also driving consumer interest. People often try tofu for the health benefits and stay for the great flavor that ready-to-enjoy products offer."   Doctors and nutritionists agree that tofu offers many health benefits. "As a plant-based protein, tofu has all nine essential amino acids, plus it's loaded with calcium, magnesium, iron, and other minerals," says Dr. Linda Shiue, physician and author of the cookbook, Spicebox Kitchen. "One of the most common things I hear from patients is that they don't have the time to cook healthy meals. That's where pre-marinated and seasoned tofu can help."  New Year, Healthy You Tofu Recipes Hodo's organic, non-GMO, gluten-free tofu is packed with protein (36+ grams per package!). Just heat and eat—or toss into salads, grain bowls, stir-fries, or wraps.
