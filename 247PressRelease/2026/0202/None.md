# Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys Launches Public Awareness Initiative to Protect Massachusetts Drivers Following Roadway Collisions

BOSTON, MA, February 02, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys, a premier personal injury law firm, is taking a proactive stance to ensure that residents across the Commonwealth are fully informed of their legal protections following motor vehicle accidents. As traffic congestion continues to rise on major arteries and local roads alike, the firm aims to demystify the complexities of Massachusetts insurance laws and liability standards for the general public.  Massachusetts operates under a unique no-fault insurance system, which can often lead to confusion for those involved in a crash. Many drivers are unaware of how Personal Injury Protection, commonly known as PIP, functions or when they are eligible to pursue a claim against a negligent party for pain and suffering. Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys emphasizes that understanding these nuances is critical to securing the medical care and financial recovery necessary to move forward.  The firm highlights several common scenarios where motorists often find themselves at a disadvantage without proper legal guidance. These include rear-end collisions, accidents involving distracted driving, and T-bone crashes at intersections. In each of these situations, the immediate steps taken by the driver can significantly impact the outcome of a future legal claim.  "Our goal is to ensure that no driver feels powerless or overwhelmed after a collision," said Larry Nussbaum, Partner at Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys. "The moments following an accident are often chaotic and stressful, but knowing your rights can make the ultimate difference between a denied claim and receiving the full compensation you deserve. We are here to provide the clarity and the aggressive advocacy necessary to navigate the complex legal landscape of Massachusetts, allowing our clients to focus entirely on their recovery."  Beyond understanding insurance coverage, the firm urges the public to recognize the importance of documentation and immediate medical evaluation. Even in seemingly minor accidents, injuries can manifest days or weeks later. Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys advises all drivers to report every accident to the authorities, gather witness contact information, and avoid providing recorded statements to insurance adjusters before consulting with legal counsel.  The attorneys at the Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah are known for their trial-ready approach. While many cases resolve through settlements, the team prepares every case as if it were going to court. This dedication ensures that insurance companies take every claim seriously. By educating the public on these standards, the firm hopes to reduce the number of victims who are pressured into low-ball settlements that do not cover the long-term costs of their injuries.  Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah Trial Attorneys remains committed to serving the community through expert legal representation and educational outreach.
