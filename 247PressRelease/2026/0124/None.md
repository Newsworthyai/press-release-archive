# Author Develops Tribes of the Vampire TV Pilot Script for Streamers

LONDON, ENGLAND, January 24, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Michelle M. Pillow today announced the completion of the pilot script for her gothic urban fantasy series, Tribes of the Vampire. The screenplay development marks a significant milestone in the series' expansion, coinciding with a high-profile seven-book deal with Tor Bramble UK (Pan Macmillan) and a rapid-release audiobook schedule launching this February.  The Tribes of the Vampire series, celebrated for its rich, gothic world-building in the tradition of Anne Rice, is currently undergoing a massive global relaunch. The newly finished pilot script, developed by Pillow and her filmmaker husband, John Reyer Afamasaga, adapts the dark antiheroes and forbidden attractions of the books to the screen and streaming platforms.  "Seeing these characters transition from page to a screenplay has been an incredible creative journey," said Pillow. "With Tor Bramble introducing the series to a global audience this year, it was the perfect time to finalize a vision for a television and streaming adaptation that captures the high stakes and detailed world-building that my readers expect."  The announcement comes as Tor Bramble UK begins its ambitious 2026 rollout of the series. The relaunch kicks off in February 2026 with new audiobook editions of Redeemer of Shadows (Book 1) and The Jaded Hunter (Book 2), narrated by the award-winning Natalie Naudus as Victoria Mei. The momentum continues in March 2026 with the audio releases of Books 3 and 4.  While the pilot script is currently being shopped, the synergy between the global book relaunch and the new audio format positions Tribes of the Vampire as a premier property for the surging Romantasy and Gothic Fantasy markets.  About the Series Tribes of the Vampire is a gothic urban fantasy romance filled with forbidden attraction and detailed world-building. The series relaunch under Tor Bramble UK includes new print and audio editions, as well as worldwide translations.  About Michelle M. Pillow Michelle M.
