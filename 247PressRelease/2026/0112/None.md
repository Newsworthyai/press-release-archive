NEW YORK, NY, January 12, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- New York Airport News today announced the publication of a news report addressing competition concerns raised by a whistleblower regarding cargo operations at John F. Kennedy International Airport.  The article examines the current cargo handling landscape at JFK and includes allegations related to market concentration, facility access, and operational practices affecting airlines, trucking companies, freight forwarders, and bonded warehouses. The report references Worldwide Flight Services, a major cargo services provider at the airport, in the context of its role within JFK's cargo ecosystem.  The reporting does not assert regulatory findings or legal conclusions. It presents the claims as allegations and places them within the broader framework of how cargo handling operates at large, capacity-constrained airports.

As of publication, no responses had been received.  The article represents the first time these specific concerns have been publicly reported and adds to ongoing discussion within the aviation and logistics industries about competition, access, and transparency at major U.S. airports.
