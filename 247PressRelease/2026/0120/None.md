# We are Thrilled to Announce the Release of "My Invisible Battle with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)"

NEW YORK, NY, January 20, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Howard Publication is proud to announce the upcoming release of My Invisible Battle, a deeply moving and powerful memoir that sheds light on the realities of living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an illness often hidden behind a brave smile.  Told with unfiltered honesty and unbreakable resilience, My Invisible Battle chronicles the emotional and physical journey of a woman whose life changed overnight when her body began to fail her without warning. From wheelchair transitions to navigating an invisible war with pain, vulnerability, and social misunderstandings, this memoir reveals how strength is often found in the quietest moments.  As MS chipped away at her independence, dignity, and mobility, she refused to surrender, turning fear into faith, despair into determination, and silence into a message of empowerment. The book highlights her travels for treatment, the struggles behind closed doors, and the enduring power of family, motherhood, and self-belief.  Through this memoir, she becomes the voice for millions who suffer unseen, reminding the world that invisible does not mean imaginary, and broken does not mean defeated.  "Not all battles are visible. But every warrior deserves to be seen." — Shruti Ghate  Readers will find comfort, courage, and connection, whether they are living with a chronic illness or supporting someone who is. This book serves as a testament to human endurance and the unspoken strength it takes to keep going.
