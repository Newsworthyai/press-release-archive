# Atlanta Divorce Law Group Welcomes Seasoned Litigator Jim Powers as Senior Attorney

ATLANTA, GA, January 26, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Atlanta Divorce Law Group is pleased to announce the addition of Jim Powers as Senior Attorney, bringing more than a decade of high-stakes courtroom and litigation experience to the firm's family law practice.  Powers is a seasoned Georgia divorce and family law attorney with a background that uniquely informs his approach to sensitive domestic matters. He began his legal career as an Assistant District Attorney, prosecuting felony cases involving domestic violence and crimes against children across multiple judicial circuits. This experience has helped anchor his advocacy in family law cases involving domestic violence victims and children.  Most recently, Powers served in the Northeastern Judicial Circuit, handling complex matters from initial assignment through jury trial. He previously led a Special Victims Unit focused on sexual offenses, domestic violence, and crimes against children, and supervised younger prosecutors in the Western Judicial Circuit.  Before joining Atlanta Divorce Law Group, Powers devoted his practice to family law in private practice at respected Atlanta-area firms and through his own firm, J. Powers Law, LLC, where he represented clients in complex divorce, custody, and support matters.  "Jim's depth of trial experience, especially in domestic violence and child protection matters, gives him a unique perspective in family law," said Sara Khaki, Founding Partner of Atlanta Divorce Law Group. "He approaches every case with a clear focus on advocating for those whose voices are often unheard."  Powers credits his prosecutorial background for sharpening his trial advocacy and strategic case-building skills. This skill set makes him exceptionally well-equipped to handle contested divorces, child custody disputes, child support matters, legitimation actions, and high-asset cases.  "I've prosecuted some of the most difficult cases involving family harm, which helps me guide clients through conflict with clarity and resolve," Powers said. "The goal is always to help families reach a true Happily Ever After Divorce, one where fighting ends and everyone can move forward stronger."  Outside the courtroom, Powers and his wife have been together for 13 years, married for 7, and share their home with three beloved dogs. They enjoy hiking, playing pool, reading, writing, watching movies and television, and spoiling their five nephews and two nieces. As the second oldest of seven siblings in a large, close-knit family, Powers deeply values the relationships that endure beyond conflict.
