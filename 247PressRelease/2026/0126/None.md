# Rev. Richard Klingeisen Marks Catholic Schools Week as "A Life of Giving" Prepares for Major Year Ahead

REEDSVILLE, WI, January 26, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As Catholic Schools Week gets underway, Rev. Richard Klingeisen continues his active role in parish and community life, supporting faith-based education and the mission of Catholic schools throughout the St. Mary & St. Michael parish community.  Long respected for his leadership and service, Rev. Klingeisen remains closely engaged with students, families, and parish initiatives during one of the most meaningful weeks on the Catholic calendar. Though he officially retired several years ago, his involvement has not slowed, reflecting a continued commitment to mentorship, education, and community engagement—values central to both his ministry and his broader work.  In addition to his parish responsibilities, Rev. Klingeisen is the creator and host of the acclaimed podumentary series A Life of Giving, which explores faith, service, and modern challenges through thoughtful, real-world wisdom and commentary. Since 2018, the web series has steadily built an audience for its grounded approach and emphasis on purpose-driven living.  Looking ahead, 2026 is shaping up to be a significant year for A Life of Giving, with several new episodes currently in development and an expanded focus on timely, impactful narratives. As Catholic Schools Week highlights the importance of education and service, Rev. Klingeisen's work—both within the parish and through his media platform—continues to reflect a deep commitment to leadership, faith, and community.  "I've always enjoyed being part of this community," shares Rev. Klingeisen. "And Catholic Schools Week is a special time to see the parish, schools, and families come together. Right around the corner is Winterfest, a new season of my show, and so much more. I'm grateful to stay involved and connected."  For more information, visit www.RichardKlingeisen.com.
