# Transatlantic Relations Seriously Undermined By Trump's Deception At Davos Says Elizabeth Graham, Author Of Bestselling Ebook, From Democracy To Democrazy

WILMINGTON, NC, January 26, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Elizabeth Graham, a bestselling author, is recognized for her expertise on the Trump/Putin relationship. Her work has been published globally in more than 70 countries and is widely featured in traditional media, as well as on her very popular democracy-focused Substack blog which can be found at egraham.substack.com.  Graham had a Top-Secret Security Clearance while a senior in high school, and immediately upon graduation began working undercover with the CIA. She later joined the SAIC's Foreign Systems Research Center (FSRC) for 12 years. Eight of these years were spent studying Russia and Russian, and she managed the largest Russian-language military, technical and intelligence data base/library in the U.S. She began to travel to the Soviet Union and then became one of the very few Americans to move to the USSR. She lived under Communism in the Soviet Union, then Russia, and Central Asia long enough to become bi-cultural - she became Russian. Her first-hand knowledge and understanding of life in a communist or dictatorship country is shared with Americans in her book and in her Substack posts (egraham.substack.com). In a recent Substack post titled, 'Deception At Davos' she wrote in part:  Over the past year, European leaders have sought to engage President Donald Trump through diplomatic gestures, including commitments to purchase American goods, meetings with members of royalty, and gifts such as a custom-engraved golf club. However, President Trump's proposal regarding Greenland has significantly strained transatlantic relations, reaching a level of tension that both officials and analysts describe as unprecedented in recent history.  Trump flew to Switzerland to connect with European leaders at the World Economic Forum and join their discussions regarding his promise to "take Greenland by force if necessary."  The 'Davos' Trump speech was as incoherent as usual, but while Americans are familiar with Trump's misleading statements, Europeans have not been exposed to them as often. I was surprised by their attentiveness, and by the questions asked after Trump's speech. The statement "I will not use force to take Greenland" reassured many but breaking that promise could shock them. For Trump, words are used to con others, with no intention or understanding of honesty.  I understood this deceptive speech to be a plea for Europeans to retrieve their troops from Greenland and allow Trump to swallow up this country in the same deceptive way he did Venezuela. Trump explained that bombing boats in the Caribbean was meant to prevent illegal drugs from entering the United States, and he also said that President Maduro should be removed from power. The New York Times reported January 8, 2026, that the "primary mode of trafficking drugs to the United States from Venezuela is by air - not by boats." (NYT, Jan. 8, 2026, "According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.") Then the entire world stood by as Trump announced that he will manage the country of Venezuela and control their gas and oil industry – money in his pocket.  An analogous situation is unfolding in Greenland, yet it seems that Europeans have not grasped the deceptive statements or fraudulent behaviors involved. Greenland possesses an abundance of untapped rare minerals used in the production of magnets, which play a critical role in the manufacturing of aircraft engines, electric cars, trains, and advanced technical machinery and equipment.  "China dominates the global rare earth magnet market, controlling most processing and manufacturing, which gives it significant leverage in high-tech industries like EVs, wind turbines, plane engines, and defense." (Wikipedia). Once Trump issued a 100% increase (tariff) on certain Chinese goods, they implemented rigorous export controls on rare earth elements and magnets, now restricting products containing even minimal amounts of Chinese-origin materials." (Ibid) China also acquires a large amount of natural rare metals from African nations – these are countries which no longer do business with the United States since Trump closed USAID – which resulted in a terrifying genocide across this continent. The death toll could be as high as 14 million souls surpassing horrific fatalities by Hitler, Mussolini Putin, and other dictators except Stalin. (NPR, July 1, 2025) Take one minute to realize this enormous atrocity – and that Trump is responsible.  In response to Trump's ludicrous tariffs on China, they tightened control over magnets, turning a crucial resource for modern manufacturing into a strategic asset. Now, Trump is striving to build alternative supply chains for rare metals and magnets by owning Greenland. He avoids openly discussing this, claiming control of Greenland is necessary for U.S. security—a tactic identical to his grab of Venezuela by treachery and deception.  Furthermore, he will not stop at Venezuela and Greenland but will pursue further territorial gains through misleading promises. He behaves like a friend one moment and an enemy the next – but in the end, he is constantly searching for new ways to accumulate wealth for himself and his family. According to PBS, "Trump and his family has received $1.4 Billion dollars due to his presidency in 2025." He is a con man from New York who learned to cheat others and manipulate the U.S. judicial system.  Europe must stand firm and not permit Trump to gain ownership of Greenland. Otherwise, it's uncertain which country he might target next or will he start World War III – just like Hitler's landmass grab in the 1930's and 40's or Stalin's creation then called the USSR.

She had 4 children and has 3 grandchildren. Her oldest daughter died July 16, 2016 - three months before the U.S. 2016 election and while living/working in Japan. The Tokyo Police ruled her death a homicide by an unknown substance – possibly a poison - which is the signature lethal method used by Russians. There is more about her death in From Democracy to Democrazy.  Elizabeth was indoctrinated at a young age by her father who was a senior manager working undercover with the CIA. Her college days were in Los Angeles with the desire to become a high school teacher. However, she was destined to study Russia, Russian language, and live a life of Top-Secret clearances and undercover work. This led to senior nonprofit management positions and consulting jobs in strategic places like Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia, all the former Soviet - Central Asian countries, and Ukraine, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many other locations. In this process of living and working abroad, she became bi-cultural - American to Russian and back – only to find that her birth country was in the process of losing its democracy and becoming a dictatorship.
