# STEP UP TO FIGHT HUNGER WITH THE ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK

ATLANTA, GA, January 29, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Prepare to get in your steps and fight food insecurity with the annual Hunger Walk Run, benefiting the Atlanta Community Food Bank and five other local hunger relief organizations. In its 42nd year, the community event is scheduled for Sunday, March 15, 2026, from Noon to 4 pm at The Home Depot Backyard (1 Backyard Way, Atlanta, GA 30313). The hybrid 5K event also offers a virtual option. Registration and donation opportunities are now open.   Every registration makes a big impact. Each person who registers to walk is helping provide 90 meals, and each runner is helping provide 120 meals for their neighbors. Since its start in 1984, the Hunger Walk Run has raised more than $16 million for hunger relief, enough to provide more than 48 million meals.   Individuals of all ages and abilities are welcome to take part in the family-friendly 5K. Participants may join as an individual, family, group, or team. The Walk Run festivities include music, food vendors, warm-ups, and more! A dedicated Kids Zone offers bounce houses, slides, interactive characters, age-appropriate learning opportunities, and other fun for the youngest attendees. The event happens rain or shine.   "Hunger Walk Run is a highly anticipated event that rallies thousands from our community to take steps toward fighting hunger," said Kyle Waide, President & CEO of the Atlanta Community Food Bank. "Every person who participates, whether on-site or virtually, helps make a difference, and their support enables the Food Bank and other benefitting organizations to connect our neighbors in need with nutritious food and vital resources."   The Atlanta Community Food Bank is facing the highest demand for food assistance since the pandemic, making this year's event more critical than ever. Participants can join in person or virtually to support the cause.   Go Virtual   The virtual Hunger Walk Run allows you to participate anywhere, anytime. Every step counts on March 15 or whenever runners and walkers want to get involved. The event page features outdoor trails that participants may visit -- or walking in your neighborhood, on your treadmill, or spinning on your bike are other great ways to show support!   Participants are encouraged to keep the energy of Hunger Walk Run going by posting photos, tagging the Food Bank (@ACFB on Instagram and Twitter), using the hashtag #HWR2026, and sharing why you support this cause.   Register Now   Online registration is available through 12 pm on Friday, March 13. The rates for online registration are $30 for walkers, $40 for runners, $25 for virtual participants who pick up their shirts, and $32 for virtual participants who wish to have their shirts mailed to them.
