# Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson Calls for Inclusive Theological Leadership in Never Lost

PITTSBURGH, PA, January 30, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A best-selling author, veteran pastor, civil rights leader, and respected theological voice, Dr. Richardson directly addresses the role of women in ministry and theological leadership in a dedicated section of his new book Never Lost, titled "Womanist Theology and the Role of Women in Leadership." Drawing from lived pastoral experience and decades of institutional leadership, Richardson challenges the Church to examine how exclusionary practices weaken its witness and limit its capacity to lead faithfully in complex times.  "For the Black Church to remain a sanctuary of hope and a catalyst for justice," Richardson writes, "it must also deepen its commitment to inclusivity and diversity. This involves intentionally creating spaces where all voices are valued, and all members feel seen and heard."  What distinguishes Richardson's contribution is not only his theological argument but the consistency with which he has lived it. For more than fifty years as pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, New York, he has intentionally elevated women into positions of authority, leadership, and influence. In his earlier memoir, Witness to Grace, Richardson reflects candidly on dismantling long-standing gender barriers within church governance, including the decision to ordain women fully and restructure leadership systems that had historically limited their roles.  "Unfortunately, many Black churches perpetuate a legacy of female exclusion from ordained leadership in the church, reflective of the broader culture," Richardson wrote in Witness to Grace. In another passage, he draws a direct moral connection between racial and gender injustice, stating, "Sexism is the identical twin of racism. We must reject the many faces of the same demon."  Rather than approaching the issue as a theoretical debate, Never Lost frames women's leadership as essential to the spiritual health, moral credibility, and future viability of the Church. Richardson argues that inclusive leadership is not a concession to cultural pressure, but a faithful expression of the Gospel's call to justice, dignity, and shared responsibility.  For theological seminaries, faculty, and students engaged in the formation of future church leaders, Never Lost offers a substantive and pastoral resource that bridges academic theology and lived ministry. It offers theological education a timely opportunity to consider how leaders—women and men alike—are shaped to serve with conviction, courage, and integrity in a changing cultural landscape.  Never Lost, set for release on February 3, 2026, from Wharton Curtis Press, is currently available for preorder at NeverLostBook.com.  About the Author  Rev. Dr. W.
