# Honorary Sign Marks Site Where Dianetics Movement Began in 1950

ELIZABETH, NJ, January 30, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Community leaders, elected officials, residents, and guests gathered for the unveiling of an honorary street sign dedicated to L. Ron Hubbard, recognizing yet another way in which the history of Elizabeth, New Jersey, has influenced world history. It was on this very street, in 1950, that the global Dianetics movement began following the publication of Dianetics on May 9, 1950.  Guests traveled to Elizabeth, New Jersey, to hear remarks in honor of the occasion which were delivered by New Jersey State Senator Joseph Cryan, Elizabeth Council President Manny Grova, Jr., and Rev. Massimo Parrino, President of the L. Ron Hubbard Foundation. Elizabeth Councilman Frank Mazza and former Councilman Carlos Alma—who helped lay the foundation for this momentous dedication more than 20 years ago—were among the distinguished officials and community leaders in attendance.  "Even though it's cold, the impact of L. Ron Hubbard on the world is clearly massive, because you are all here today in the City of Elizabeth celebrating his legacy," said Elizabeth Council President Manny Grova, Jr., drawing cheers from more than one hundred guests who gathered to commemorate this historic moment.  Beginning in June 1950, public from across America—and beyond—traveled to this street to visit the home of L. Ron Hubbard, author of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, as the book began its unprecedented 28-week run on the New York Times bestseller list. Hubbard opened the first Dianetics Foundation in his home at 42 Aberdeen Road, where he delivered the first public lectures and demonstrations, sharing the principles of the subject and offering a path to personal improvement and the betterment of civilization.  "It has been remarkable how you have grown in our community and how you brought us to the point we celebrate today. It's a big deal—a wonderful job," said New Jersey State Senator Joseph Cryan. "As we unveil this sign, let us all raise our hearts to the understanding that we can, in fact, have a better world."  The unveiling of the honorary street sign on Aberdeen Road follows the completion of the restoration of 42 Aberdeen Road in April 2025, just eight months ago. The property was meticulously restored to its 1950 appearance, inside and out, exactly as it was when L. Ron Hubbard lived there.

Ron Hubbard's research into the human mind and spirit, while encouraging the application of his discoveries to address social and scientific challenges and uplift cultures of all backgrounds.
