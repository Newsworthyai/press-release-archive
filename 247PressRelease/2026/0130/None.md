FRESNO, CA, January 30, 2026 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Fresno sex abuse lawyers at The Wagner Law Group have accomplished a major step forward in victim's rights by securing a 5.25-million-dollar settlement from the city of Sanger for a case relating to rapes and sexual assaults by a police officer.

"We are representing multiple victims in this case and we strongly believe there are more victims whom have yet to come forward," says Wagner.  This case in Sanger spanned over 6 years with the last reported incident occurring in 2022. A former member of the Sanger Police Department named officer J.D. Torrence sexually assaulted women while on duty. He was convicted in Federal Court and is currently serving 5 consecutive life terms. Fresno injury attorneys at The Wagner Law Group believe there are more victims out there because officer Torrence was committing these crimes on a regular basis.

Torrence or any other police officer to call our Victim Hotline at (833) 200-7111 now to speak with an injury attorney in Fresno for no cost to learn about seeking compensation," says Wagner.
