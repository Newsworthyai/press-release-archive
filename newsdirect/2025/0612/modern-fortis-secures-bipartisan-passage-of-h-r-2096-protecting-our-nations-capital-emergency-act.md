# Modern Fortis Secures Bipartisan Passage of H.R. 2096 – Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emergency Act

Modern Fortis, a national public safety government affairs firm, applauds the bipartisan House passage of H.R. 2096, the Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emergency Act. Authored and led by Congressman Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) and managed by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), the legislation passed the United States House of Representatives with the support of thirty (30) Democrats—a powerful statement that public safety comes before politics.

“When we undermine law enforcement, we embolden the criminals. This legislation restores fairness and support for the men and women who risk their lives to keep our capital secure. If Washington, D.C. won’t fix this problem, it’s our job to,” said Congressman Garbarino.

Steered by Chairman Gregg Pemberton and the DC Police Union, H.R. 2096 restores basic rights and protections for Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officers, reversing radical anti-police, anti-public safety provisions enacted by the D.C. Council in 2022.

“Thirty Democrats joined Republicans because supporting police officers and public safety is not a partisan issue—it’s common sense,” said Joe Cameron, CEO of Modern Fortis. “We thank Congressman Garbarino for his leadership, and we look forward to reinstating key protections for our MPD officers, so they can keep us safe.”

H.R. 2096 now heads to the U.S. Senate, and Modern Fortis urges swift action so the measure can be sent to President Donald J. Trump to be signed into law.

Modern Fortis continues to chart new maps in the public safety sectorâturning advocacy into action and ensuring that the voices of Americaâs law enforcement professionals and those who support them are heard at every level of government.
