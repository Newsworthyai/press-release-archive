# HomeSphere and Overhead Door Announce New Partnership for Residential Builders

HomeSphere, the leading platform connecting building product manufacturers to mid-market homebuilders, has announced a new strategic partnership with Overhead Door, a trusted, well-known garage door brand for homebuilders, builder-developers and general contractors.

Through the collaboration, more than 2,700 builders in HomeSphere’s U.S. network can claim exclusive rebates on Overhead Door™ brand garage doors, receiving enhanced value on a brand they already know and trust.

“As a result of the partnership, more builders can access trusted garage door solutions through a single point of entry,” said Eric Herbst, Vice President of Builder Sales at Overhead Door, “saving time and simplifying operations for our builder partners.”

Since 1921, the Overhead Door™ brand has dominated the industry with superior design and quality backed by local distributors delivering on solutions and support. As a direct source of equipment, service, and solutions, Overhead Door™ exceeds expectations and simplifies the job for homebuilders.

“HomeSphere offers its builder members the highest quality products at superior prices, all through a single portal, said HomeSphere CEO Greg Schwarzer. “Like Overhead Door™, our mission is to help builders save time and money. Our platform reduces the complexity of the product evaluation and rebate collection process for builders during a time of great uncertainty.”
