# Towerstone Accountants Launches Inheritance Tax Advisory Service Amid Upcoming Pension Tax Changes

Towerstone Accountants has announced the launch of a specialized Inheritance Tax Advisory Service to help individuals navigate the significant upcoming changes to pension taxation. With new rules set to take effect in 2027, unspent pension funds will become subject to Inheritance Tax (IHT) at 40%, potentially impacting thousands of families.

Proactive Planning for Changing Tax Rules

For years, pensions have served as a tax-efficient way to pass down wealth. However, under the revised regulations, any remaining pension funds at the time of death will be included in the deceased’s estate, making them subject to IHT.

"Many individuals have structured their financial plans around the assumption that pensions are outside the IHT net," said Christina Odgers, Managing Director at Towerstone Accountants. "This change requires a proactive approach, and our new Inheritance Tax Advisory Service is designed to help clients safeguard their wealth."

Tailored Strategies for Tax Efficiency

Towerstone Accountants’ Inheritance Tax Advisory Service will provide personalized strategies, including:

Optimized Pension Withdrawals – Advising clients on the most tax-efficient ways to draw down their pension while reducing their estate’s taxable value.

Early Gifting Plans – Helping clients leverage HMRC’s tax-free gifting rules, ensuring funds reach their loved ones instead of being lost to tax.

Alternative Investment Planning – Exploring tax-efficient investment options, such as Business Relief-qualifying assets, to protect wealth from IHT.

Estate Structuring & Trusts – Assisting clients in setting up trusts and maximizing available allowances for spouses, civil partners, and charities.

Helping Clients Stay Ahead of HMRC

With the 2027 deadline fast approaching, Towerstone Accountants urges individuals to review their estate plans now.

"Waiting until the last minute could mean losing a significant portion of your inheritance to tax," said Laura Stevenson, Estate Planning Expert. "Our team is ready to help clients develop robust tax strategies tailored to their needs."
