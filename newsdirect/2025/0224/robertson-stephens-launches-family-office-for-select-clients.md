# Robertson Stephens Launches Family Office for Select Clients

Robertson Stephens today announced that it has hired Bruce Stewart to launch a family office that will serve select ultra-high-net-worth clients who have outgrown a multi-family office platform but are not ready to transition to a pure single-family office environment.

As Head of Family Office at Robertson Stephens, Stewart brings over 25 years of experience in building and advising single-family offices, as well as serving as an outsourced chief investment officer. In this role, he will develop a practice designed for families with more sophisticated needs than those typically addressed by traditional multi-family offices.

“We have always planned to have a family office service offering adjacent to our wealth management practice,” said Raj Bhattacharyya, Chief Executive Officer of Robertson Stephens. “With the launch of our family office, clients have the rare opportunity to access unique and highly valuable services beyond the standard offering seen in traditional private banks, multi-family offices and many other players in the industry without the upfront and high recurring expenses typical of a single-family office. Bruce is not only a deep expert in this space, he has also demonstrated his ability to build out successful single-family offices over the past few years.”

Before Robertson Stephens, Stewart was the founder and Managing Partner of Spartan Risk Solutions (SRS), a discreet family-office consultancy specializing in the development of family offices and outsourced chief investment officer solutions. In this role, Stewart built and managed $23 billion in wealth for four families.

Previously, Stewart was the global head of investments for Bank of New York Family Office, where he led an investment team managing nearly $15 billion in assets. His other leadership roles include having served as President of BNY Mellon Canada and co-head of investments at Toronto Dominion Bank.

“I’m grateful to Robertson Stephens for this opportunity to build out this first-of-its-kind service,” Stewart said. "In my experience, some families have outgrown the capabilities of a traditional multi-family office but prefer to avoid the financial commitment of establishing their own. These families have more complex needs that require a specialized skill set, enhanced capabilities, and a sophisticated approach. I’m excited to build this practice at Robertson Stephens and deliver a truly differentiated solution."
