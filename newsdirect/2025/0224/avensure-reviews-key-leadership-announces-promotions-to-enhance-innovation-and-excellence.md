With Recent Milestones Developments in Mind, Avensure Reviews The Last 6 Months of 2024

Over the past six months of 2024, Avensure saw fantastic growth across various teams. This includes the addition of several talented people to our business, services, marketing, and software development teams, including the creation of our "Genius Team" focused on Avensure PeopleCloud software. We’re thrilled about this progress as it enhances our ability to deliver even better solutions for UK businesses.

What Distinguishes Avensure from Industry Competitors?

Avensure prides itself on being different. What truly sets Avensure apart is our personalised approach—it's not just a buzzword for us. From the very start, we’ve been committed to delivering bespoke solutions, with designated lead advisors who bring sector-specific expertise. At Avensure, we pride ourselves on offering a level of support that goes beyond the typical call centre approach many businesses adopt—we’ve built this into our core philosophy. Don’t just take our word for it—our client reviews speak for themselves, showing that our commitment to personalised service has been there from day one.

Managing Director, Chris Garner, Said:

"Joy and Julie have both been very instrumental in Avensure’s growth and success. Their leadership has been key to our strong performance over the years.
