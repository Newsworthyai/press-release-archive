Singapore – February 21, 2025 – Nansen, a leading blockchain analytics platform, is thrilled to announce its appointment as a TRON Super Representative (SR). As a Super Representative, Nansen will play a pivotal role in ensuring the security, efficiency, and transparency of the TRON network by participating in block production and governance, further aligning with TRON’s mission to decentralize the internet.

TRON is a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain designed to deliver fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions, and has been at the forefront of the decentralized ecosystem, supporting a vast range of digital assets, decentralized applications (dApps), and smart contracts. By becoming a TRON Super Representative, Nansen will not only contribute to the technical maintenance of the network but also bring advanced analytics and on-chain insights to the TRON community, enhancing transparency across its ecosystem.

"Becoming a TRON Super Representative is a natural extension of our mission to surface the signal and create winners. We look forward to supporting TRON’s governance and contributing to the continued growth of its ecosystem with our data analytics expertise." – Alex Svanevik, CEO, Nansen

Strategic Role in Blockchain Governance and Analytics

As part of its new role as a Super Representative, Nansen will provide its cutting-edge blockchain analytics tools to offer unprecedented insights into the TRON blockchain. Nansen’s comprehensive dashboards and reports — which track smart contracts, wallet activity, and on-chain movements — will now be accessible to TRON’s developers, institutional investors, and wider community. This collaboration is expected to accelerate data-driven decision-making and deepen understanding of TRON’s network.

"Nansen’s blockchain analytics are unparalleled, and we are excited to welcome them as a Super Representative. Their data-driven approach will further strengthen the integrity and transparency of the TRON network as we push forward with our mission to decentralize the web." – Justin Sun, Founder of TRON

Supporting TRON’s Vision of a Decentralized Internet

The TRON network has seen remarkable growth since its mainnet launch in 2018, with over 277 million user accounts, $24.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), and more than 9.1 billion total transactions to date. As TRON continues to scale and provide fast, low-cost transactions for developers and users, Nansen’s analytics will play a critical role in optimizing its ecosystem for both retail and institutional participants.

Through this collaboration, Nansen and TRON aim to set a new standard for blockchain transparency and governance, driving further adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies. As a HackaTRON Data Platform Partner and past judge, Nansen offers valuable insights into on-chain data and DeFi, highlighting the importance of user experience.
