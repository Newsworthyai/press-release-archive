Cult Aussie Beauty brand and Silicone Patch Pioneer, Wrinkles Schminkles understands that aging is complicated.

An inevitable and entirely natural part of life with many upsides, it can also bring physical changes like lines and age spots, sun damage and thinner skin that can be challenging to accept. Oftentimes, women feel ashamed whether choosing to combat those unwanted signs of the times, or to lean into their laugh lines and grow into their grey hair.

Wrinkles Schminkles invited women to share their unfiltered thoughts on aging in an online survey - here’s what 1500+ women aged from 20-something to 70-something had to say…

We’re over the term ‘anti-aging’

84% of American women, 88% of Australian women, and 88% of British women said HELL YES! to cancelling the term for good.

We feel conflicted about getting older

59% of American women, 57% of British women and 64% of Aussie women don’t love the changes they’re experiencing, but also accept that it’s a natural part of life.

The term ‘anti-aging’ feels like pressure

55% of American women, 58% of Aussie women, and 45% of British women feel like they need to be constantly battling ageing to look younger.

We want more empowering ways of talking about aging

71% of American women, 71% of Aussie women, and 68% of British women want to see brands use more positive and inclusive language when talking about aging.

The consensus…

We all feel pressure, so much pressure! To start young, look young, stay young (unlike our ‘distinguished’, ‘silver fox’ male counterparts!).

We want to see more real, age appropriate women that reflect us.

We want to look as good as we feel without judgement.

So, what’s next?

We hear and see the women in our community and are committed to continuing to build a judgement-free zone, where women are embraced (at every age!) and aren’t shamed if they choose to embrace the signs of aging or shamed if they want to make it their mission to live a line-free existence.

We say: You do you!

And we’re here to support you along the way.
