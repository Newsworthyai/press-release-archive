# ASTRO America Partners with GENEDGE, Department of Defense, and Virginia Tech for Metal Additive Manufacturing Workshops

The Applied Science & Technology Research Organization (ASTRO) of America is proud to partner with GENEDGE, the Department of Defense’s Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation, and Virginia Tech on a series of workshops designed to increase the adoption of metal additive manufacturing capabilities in small and mid-size independent machine shops across Virginia.

The Reconfigure Virginia’s Manufacturers for Modernization Program (Re-VAMMP) was created to strengthen Virginia’s defense industrial base, which is facing a critical need to modernize. Independent machine shops, serving as the backbone of the defense manufacturing supply chain, are encouraged to adopt additive technologies to lower costs, boost reliability, and expand capabilities to meet this need.

“These workshops are essential for independent manufacturers in Virginia looking to expand their manufacturing business, grow their additive capabilities, and innovate their techniques,” said Neal Orringer, President of ASTRO America. "ASTRO is proud to collaborate on this critical initiative to support the Department of Defense, which depends extensively on these shops for manufacturing weapon system components."

The workshops will be held in Norfolk, Richmond, Weyers Cave, and Roanoke, and will focus on the basics of metal additive manufacturing, the vital role it plays in modern manufacturing, and how adoption by small machine shops in Virginia can enhance their businesses. The workshops will feature two guest speakers: Griffin Keller (1/28 & 1/30) and Kevin Nims (all dates), representatives from AUSTAL USA and operators of the Navy Additive Manufacturing Center of Excellence at IALR in Danville, will discuss the assistance programs they offer to additive manufacturers in order to qualify for U.S. Navy supply chain opportunities.
