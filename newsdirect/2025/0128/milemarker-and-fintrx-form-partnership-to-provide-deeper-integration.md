# Milemarker and FINTRX Form Partnership to Provide Deeper Integration

Milemarker, a leading technology platform revolutionizing how advisory firms, IBDs and RIAs operate and scale, and FINTRX, the leading data and research platform offering AI-powered intelligence on 850,000+ financial institution and advisor records, today announced the formation of a new partnership that will provide improved integration, allowing clients of both companies to drive greater adoption, improve workflow efficiency and deepen their client relationships using FINTRX’s data.

Through this partnership, advisory firms will have access to FINTRX’s extensive data sets and analytics capabilities coupled with Milemarker’s robust and innovative data integration platform.

“Advisory firms are overwhelmed by today’s complex landscape,” said Milemarker Co-Founder Jud Mackrill. “FINTRX has redefined how firms access data and analytics. Likewise, Milemarker helps advisors simplify their operations, own their data and achieve scalable growth. This partnership combines the best of the best, enabling firms to leverage the full power of FINTRX’s intelligence alongside Milemarker’s seamless integrations and workflows. We’re excited to empower our clients with new tools to achieve transformational success.”

Together, Milemarker and FINTRX are solving the advisory world’s two most common challenges: managing fragmented data and effectively scaling their operations. Advisors who use these platforms will now have access to FINTRX data within their existing workflows, which provides deeper insights and more personalized strategies. Additionally, the partnership will unify disparate data sources to create a comprehensive view of firm operations while also unlocking powerful analytics to drive growth, recruitment and client success.

“At FINTRX, our mission is to deliver world-class data and intelligence to help advisory firms and asset managers thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape,” said FINTRX CEO Russ D’Argento. “Partnering with Milemarker takes this vision to the next level, allowing our users to integrate FINTRX’s rich datasets with other tools and systems critical to their success. Together, we’re providing the advisory community with unmatched resources to scale smarter and grow faster.”
