While the meme coin market has been cooling off over the past few weeks, several outliers have emerged recording explosive gains in record time. Early bidders have locked in over 50x gains with Trump Coin (TRUMP) and Fartcoin (FART), while Cutoshi (CUTO) seems to be next in line for a memorable double-digit rally. Cutoshi in particular has been gaining traction with its multifaceted DeFi platform, prompting thousands of investors to join the viral presale of the $CUTO token.

Trump Seems To Have Bottomed Out As Chart FlatlinesOfficial Trump (TRUMP) took the market by storm on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, surging from a sub-$1 valuation all the way up to a $75 all-time high. In a single swing, Trump entered the crypto top 20, reaching a peak of $15 billion in market cap and outshining Pepe and Shiba Inu, briefly. Predictably, as investors started booking profits, Trump’s momentum was halted, sending the meme coin into a downward spiral that saw it lose over 65% in valuation in less than a week.

At the time of writing, Trump trades for $28, following a steep 18.6% intraday decline, accompanied by a 30% decrease in trading volume with about $4.16 billion worth of TRUMP changing hands.

Fartcoin Plunges After Insider Sell-OffFartcoin (FART), a Solana-based meme coin, dropped 17% after Truth Terminal's creator, Andy Ayrey, facilitated the sale of 15 million Fartcoin tokens in an over-the-counter deal worth over $22 million. Truth Terminal, an AI bot that gained unexpected popularity, became a hub for memecoins such as Fartcoin and Goatseus Maximus when users began sending tokens to its wallet last year.

Ayrey, approached by an anonymous buyer, agreed to sell under the condition that the Fartcoin tokens would be held responsible without triggering a market crash. However, market reactions still caused Fartcoin’s value to plummet from its $2.48 peak on January 19 to $1.24, recording over 30% in losses in the weekly timeframe.

Join The Cutoshi Moon Mission Cutoshi sets itself apart from run-of-the-mill meme coins with its comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that bridges the gap between meme vibes and real-world utility. The team has announced that the CUTO DEX decentralized exchange is on its way to being released ahead of schedule, along with an exclusive DeFi Wallet for optimal asset management across various blockchains.

On CUTO DEX, users will be able to perform lightning-fast transactions across all major blockchains with just 0.25% in fees. Additionally, Cutoshi is deflationary by design, meaning that the circulating supply will continuously be reduced, priming the $CUTO’s price for sustainable, long-term growth.

Furthermore, investors can maximize their profits by participating in the Cutoshi Farming initiative. Users will have the opportunity to earn tokens and win big prizes by engaging with the platform and completing special quests and missions aimed at boosting Cutoshi’s presence on socials. For their efforts, they will receive points that can later be exchanged for $CUTO post-presale.

Cutoshi is inspired by the Lucky Cats of Japanese folklore, which businesses and homes have adopted as tokens of good fortune. Cutoshi tokenizes good fortune and brings it to its rapidly growing community with its incredible growth potential. Right now, stage 4 of the presale is live with $CUTO priced at just $0.031. When taking into account all that Cutoshi has to offer, it’s not a stretch to expect it to soon dominate the meme coin landscape, and vastly outperform hype-driven plays like Trump and Fartcoin.
