# Shareholder Group, Detransitioner to Call Out Gender Ideology Harm at Visa, Inc. Annual Meeting on Tuesday

National Legal and Policy Center, an investor in Visa, Inc., will present a shareholder proposal at the payment processor’s annual meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 28. The measure asks the company to investigate risks related to its discriminatory pay and benefits policies – specifically addressing where employees affected by gender-switching advocacy have been psychologically or medically harmed, without providing remedial care – and reporting to shareholders why such compensation gaps exist in the company’s policies.

Speaking at Visa’s meeting in support of the proposal will be Claire Abernathy, a 20-year-old detransitioner whose therapy, medical and health insurance providers steered her into drastic body altering procedures when she questioned her gender starting at age 12. Ms. Abernathy will address the company’s board of directors and executive leadership, explaining her difficulties in finding medical care and insurance coverage to attempt to repair the damage done to her body.

An excerpt from Abernathy’s planned remarks:

By age 12 therapists affirmed my feelings about my body and false identity, and made my parents feel like abusive bigots for not immediately affirming me.

The therapy was covered by my parents’ health insurance.

Alleged medical professionals put me on a menstrual suppression drug, and at 14 I was put on testosterone and underwent a double mastectomy.

It took only 8 months between getting referred for therapy and getting my breasts removed.

That is an ideological agenda in search of victims, in the name of medicine, and it’s wrong.

“By failing to include detransition care, companies like Visa perpetuate the neglect of a vulnerable population,” said Abernathy. “True equity in healthcare means acknowledging the full range of outcomes in gender transitioning treatments, and ensuring that all individuals have access to the care that they need.”

In its shareholder proposal, NLPC itemizes numerous graphic, ghastly body-altering procedures that are drawn from Visa’s employee health insurance coverage through CIGNA, which also covers their minor dependents. Besides early-teen mastectomies like what Abernathy was pressured into, Visa also pays for procedures including penectomies, vaginectomies, orchiectomies, and salpingooophorectomies.

“Rather than affirming and funding radical medical experiments on workers and their children – which sound more like something out of a horror movie than legitimate health care – Visa needs to just eliminate this coverage,” said Paul Chesser, director of the Corporate Integrity Project for NLPC. “With detransitioner lawsuits spreading across the country against medical providers and health facilities, corporations that sponsor this ‘care’ won’t be far behind in finding themselves in court.”

As NLPC points out in its shareholder proposal, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission considers failure to provide equivalent pay and benefits based on categories including “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” as discriminatory. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed with NLPC that de-transitioning individuals fit under such classifications when considering unfairness in corporate compensation practices, in a decision rendered last year regarding NLPC’s shareholder proposal at Disney.

NLPC sponsored similar proposals last year at Johnson & Johnson and PepsiCo.
