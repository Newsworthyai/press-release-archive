# Vertical IQ Heads Into 2025 Fueled by Innovation and Growth

With its track record of delivering actionable, convenient, focused Industry Intelligence while providing unparalleled customer service, Raleigh-based Vertical IQ begins 2025 poised for success as it builds on the forward momentum achieved in the past year.

Delivering even more robust, useful industry and economic data

In response to customer input, Vertical IQ rolled out a number of major content and useability enhancements in 2024, driving increased product adoption and bolstering customer success — both now and in the future.

* The rollout of Localized Industry Data offers users more targeted insights into local markets such as industry density trends, number of companies, employment, wages, and more.
* A new Resource Center provides quick access to tools, user guides, training sessions, and the latest updates — all in one convenient location to help users get the most out of Vertical IQ.
* Co-branding options were expanded, allowing users to add a personal touch when sharing Vertical IQ data with customers and prospects by including their own company logo and contact information.
* The ability to download and export chart visuals for reports and presentations or download Vertical IQ data as a CSV made sharing valuable content directly with customers or prospects even easier.
* Report printing enhancements launched to make sharing industry reports with business owners quicker and more efficient.
* New Industry “Drivers” were added with details on hundreds of macroeconomic data points (e.g., consumer spending, diesel fuel prices, single-family home sales, etc.), allowing users to add additional value to customers and prospects.
* The already extensive Vertical IQ Industry Profile library expanded even further with the addition of numerous new industries — mostly requests directly from Vertical IQ customers — including Cybersecurity Services, Med Spas, Financial Transaction Services and dozens more. This brings the total number of profiles to over 920, covering more than 97% of the industries that generate the revenue of the U.S. and Canadian economies.
* Merchant Services-focused Prep Sheets debuted, packed with tailored insights, industry trends, and critical questions to help merchant services professionals prepare with confidence.

Giving back to our neighbors

Throughout 2024, the Vertical IQ team also demonstrated the power of community and service through the company’s popular Vertical IQ Cares (VIQcares) program.

VIQcares is an employee-led initiative that provides every employee paid time off to dedicate to volunteering with charitable causes they care about. The program also allows employees to submit donation requests to the VIQcares committee on behalf of organizations that are personally meaningful to them.

“VIQcares has been a tremendous success since its inception in 2023,” said Vertical IQ CEO and cofounder Bobby Martin. “Whether mentoring youth, fighting food insecurity, or aiding disaster recovery, members of our Vertical IQ team give their time, talent and heart to a wide variety of important causes across the nation, and we’re proud to continue fostering a culture of care and service as we look ahead to 2025.”

Looking to the future

As we move into the new year, Vertical IQ remains committed to helping its customers stay ahead with user-friendly tools, the latest, most accurate industry and economic data, and the valuable insights needed to succeed.

“The enhancements and gains made by Vertical IQ in 2024 are only the beginning,” noted David Buffaloe, president of Vertical IQ. “As part of our strategic vision for 2025 and beyond, Vertical IQ will focus on enhancing customer experiences, broadening our market reach, and driving product innovations that help sales and advisory professionals navigate the evolving business landscape.”.

Buffaloe continued: “I’m confident that with our product’s solid foundation and this team’s forward-thinking approach, Vertical IQ will make 2025 another year of success and transformation as we introduce even more enhancements focused on improving access to additional ‘niche’ industry content, providing top-quality data to assess risk, and offering greater financial analysis capabilities. The best is truly yet to come!”
