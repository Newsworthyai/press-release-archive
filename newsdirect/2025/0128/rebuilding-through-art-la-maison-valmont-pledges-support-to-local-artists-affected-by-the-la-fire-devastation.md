# Rebuilding Through Art: La Maison Valmont Pledges Support to Local Artists 
Affected by the LA Fire Devastation

The Guillon Family, owners of the internationally-renowned Swiss cellular skincare brand Valmont, announced today that they will be donating $110,000 through the La Maison Valmont Beverly Hills boutique to support local artists affected by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. As members of the community, co-founders Didier and Sophie Vann Guillon hope their donation will help artists rebuild, create, and thrive once again.

“Art is not only a reflection of culture but also a source of solace and inspiration—especially in times of hardship,” said Valmont Chairman and Art Director, Didier Guillon. “This commitment is a testament to our unwavering support for creativity, resilience, and the enduring power of art to heal and connect us all.”

La Maison Valmont Beverly Hills artist-in-residence Marcos Lutyens will be working with the Guillon family to identify a curated list of 11 local artists to receive the funds, which will be generated immediately from product sales and treatments at the Rodeo Drive location. Lutyens has created an original illustration symbolizing this philanthropic effort that will be displayed in store at the Beverly Hills boutique.

The brand opened La Maison Valmont Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive in July 2024. Like all La Maison Valmont boutiques worldwide, the space provides an immersive experience exhibiting the intersection of art and beauty, offering guests luxurious skincare treatments as well as the opportunity to discover the works of established and emerging artists local to the area.

Creativity is one of the core values of Valmont Group. With the mission of supporting the convergence of art and beauty beyond skincare, Valmont Group established Foundation Valmont in 2015. Through international and traveling exhibitions both at Palazzo Bonvicini in Venice, Italy and within La Maison Valmont boutiques around the world, Foundation Valmont aims to make art accessible to all.
