# New Book “Free Birds Revolution” Redefines Work, Life in the Modern Economy

Free Birds Revolution is available for purchase online and at leading bookstores nationwide. To celebrate the launch, Everson will host a series of live and virtual events, including workshops, Q&A sessions, and book signings.

Miles Everson, CEO of MBO Partners, unveils a groundbreaking guide to redefining work and life in the modern economy and the future of work in his new book, Free Birds Revolution: The Future of Work & the Independent Mind.

Independent workforce expert and futurist Miles Everson today launched his new book “Free Birds Revolution: The Future of Work & the Independent Mind.” Everson, chief executive officer of global talent solutions company MBO Partners, offers a compelling blueprint for embracing independence as the future of work. As post-pandemic return-to-work mandates are increasing, Everson offers a timely exploration of how individuals and enterprises can all thrive in a rapidly evolving workforce landscape.

“The world of work is undergoing a seismic shift,” Everson said. “This book is a manifesto for those seeking freedom, authenticity, and intentionality in their careers, and it will guide business leaders on how to embrace this shift and create a future that works for everyone. The rise of independent professionals - what I call ‘Free Birds’ - is not a trend,” Everson added. “It’s a revolution.”

Hailed as a roadmap for navigating the modern economy, Free Birds Revolution combines Everson's expertise with a wealth of data, actionable strategies, and inspiring narratives. The book delves into six transformative forces reshaping the future of work and equips readers with the mindset and tools needed to thrive as independent professionals, including:

1. The rate of change is accelerating
2. Progress is deflationary
3. The fractionalization of everything
4. From knowledge stocks to knowledge flows
5. The war for talent
6. The state of independence in America

Everson’s insights are grounded in decades of corporate leadership at PwC and as the CEO of MBO Partners. Under his guidance, MBO has partnered with nearly 4,000 companies - including more than 30 Fortune 100 firms - helping them harness the power of independent professionals to drive innovation and agility.
