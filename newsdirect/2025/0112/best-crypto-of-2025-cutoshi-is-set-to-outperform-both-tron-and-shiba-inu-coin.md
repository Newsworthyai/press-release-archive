The crypto bull market is getting traders excited to see what will be the next player to secure great gains. Among them, Tron and Shiba Inu are strong contenders, both making major moves in the crypto space. However, one token has the potential to outperform both.

MemeFi token Cutoshi is a new project with significant upside potential. Already raising over $1.47 million in investments, it stands out as one of the top picks for 2025.

Tron Continues To Grow Amid ControversyJustin Sun’s Tron (TRX) was among the tokens with standout performance last year. In early December, Tron reached its all-time high of $0.4407, before stabilizing at its current level of $0.2623. The reasons for this growth are the strength of its network, as well as key partnerships.

For one, Tron’s network also continues to grow at a rapid pace, showcasing its rapid adoption. It is currently in third place by Total Value Locked, surpassed only by Ethereum and Solana. Notably, in December, network revenue reached $329 million, amounting to an annual revenue of 2.12 billion. This was 115% higher compared to the previous year.

The likely reason for Tron’s rapid rise in December was the announcement of a partnership with Trump-linked World Liberty Financial Inc. Tron announced a $30 million investment in the group, but the move was not without controversy. Several media outlets pointed to Tron’s suspected use by criminal and terrorist groups.

Still, Tron made significant moves toward combating crime on its network. For instance, in collaboration with Tether, Tron froze more than $100 million of crypto funds originating from illicit transactions.

Cutoshi Raises $1.47 Million In Investments While Tron and Shiba Inu are doing well, memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) has the potential to outshine them. This token, which blends memes and utility, is in a great position to take advantage of the current market cycle. Notably, it already reached a major milestone of securing $1.47 million in presale investments.

The key behind the interest in Cutoshi is its innovative blend of memes and DeFi utility. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a robust DeFi project that wants to make decentralized technology more accessible than ever. Taking inspiration from Bitcoin creator Satoshi, Cutoshi wants to bring DeFi to everyone.

At its core is its upcoming DEX, which will offer low fees, self-custody, and cross-chain capabilities. Cutoshi multichain DEX will enable traders to trade without barriers, offering unparalleled security compared to centralized exchanges. With more traders concerned about custody and security, platforms like Cutoshi have a real shot at challenging centralized players like Binance.

Shiba Inu Soars Amid Major UpgradesThe “Dogecoin killer” Shiba Inu (SHIB) has cemented its position as the biggest Ethereum memecoin. Thanks to community engagement and ecosystem updates, Shiba Inu is in a strong position to grow this year.

Shiba Inu has had a remarkable year, both in the March meme coin rally and in the latest bull market. In November, Shiba Inu experienced a notable surge, rising 20.97% to its multi-month high. Moreover, over the past year, Shiba Inu’s price rose 147.46%, indicating a strong engagement.

The main reason for Shiba Inu’s growth was continued ecosystem updates and token burns. Recently, Shiba Inu saw a 515.33% increase in its burn rate, removing millions of SHIB tokens out of circulation. What is more, the Shibarium Layer-2 network is gearing up for a major upgrade, getting traders excited for what’s next.
