# The Top Crypto Coins Billionaires Are Hodling

Crypto is increasingly becoming popular among some of the richest people in the world. The world’s wealthiest are using crypto to diversify their portfolios and to drive adoption. In particular, Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are among the favourites. Each of them are championed by prominent billionaires: Michael Saylor and Elon Musk. A new Altcoin Cutoshi is also gaining traction in the market.

Michael Saylor Is All In With Bitcoin Billionaire Michael Saylor is one of Bitcoin’s (BTC) most vocal supporters. He has transformed his company, MicroStrategy, into one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. Its holdings are impressive, and by December 2024, MicroStrategy held over 423,650 BTC, valued at more than $42 billion.

For most millionaires and billionaires, Bitcoin is typically a small part of their portfolio. However, it plays an important role, as a countercyclical and deflationary asset. However, Saylor is all in on Bitcoin, with the asset accounting for the vast majority of its net worth.

Saylor believes that Bitcoin is the ultimate hedge against inflation, often comparing it to gold. What is more, Salyor believes that Bitcoin is superior to gold in several important ways. He notes that Bitcoin has a finite supply, is entirely digital and secure, and is free from government interference.

While the thesis that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge was challenged, more and more investors are treating it as such. As a result, more and more millionaires are embracing Bitcoin, and the asset is showing it can still give significant returns.

This confidence is showing up in Bitcoin’s recent performance. Currently, Bitcoin is trading above $100,000 and reached its all-time high in early December. Now, analysts are expecting it to go even higher.

Cutoshi: A Blend Of Bitcoin And DogecoinWhile prominent billionaires support Bitcoin and Doge, another token that is attracting attention is Cutoshi (CUTO). Interestingly, the token appears to be a blend of Bitcoin and Dogecoin approaches to crypto.

For one, Cutoshi is a memeFi token. This means that it blends memes, like Dogecoin, with utility, like Bitcoin. The main goal of this approach is to use memes to promote decentralization and its DeFi ecosystem.

In fact, Cutoshi also takes its inspiration and name from Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin. As Satoshi, Cutoshi is all about decentralization and is building a complete DeFi ecosystem. For instance, its multichain DEX will enable users to trade without restrictions, while also retaining custody over their wallets.

By blending Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Cutoshi hopes to attract different types of traders. This includes both those serious about decentralization, like Saylor, and those who are more in it for the memes, like Musk.

Dogecoin Is The Billionaire’s Wild CardWhile most financial types would not consider Dogecoin (DOGE) to be a billionaire’s investment, some disagree. One of them is Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and the richest man alive. His net worth recently surpassed $400 billion, thanks to a significant increase in Tesla’s share price. This hasn’t stopped him from promoting the virtues of Doge.

The original memecoin, Dogecoin, started as a joke. However, it has quickly built a strong community, with positivity and charity in focus. This community has attracted Musk to Dogecoin, who often calls Doge the “people’s crypto.”

As the people’s crypto, Dogecoin is an unlikely candidate for something that would appeal to billionaires. However, Elon Musk’s influence has propelled it significantly. Currently trading at $0.4, Dogecoin is potentially on track to reach the $1 level in 2025.
