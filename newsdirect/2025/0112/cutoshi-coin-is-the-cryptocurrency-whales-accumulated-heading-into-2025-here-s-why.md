Whales are becoming increasingly dominant in the current crypto market cycle. As prices continue to rise, whales are seeing record profits. Now, some are rolling over their gains into smaller tokens, chasing even bigger returns. One token that caught their attention is Cutoshi, with big potential gains for 2025.

Whales Dominate Over 94.5% Of Bitcoin VolumesWhales are making big moves this cycle, which started after the US presidential elections in November. Interestingly, what started it all was a major whale bet. One whale, in particular, won $85 million betting on Trump’s win on the crypto prediction platform Polymarket.

The French millionaire profited $48 million from his bet. While the bet first raised suspicion over potential market manipulation, Polymarket claimed that its investigation revealed no irregularities. The millionaire simply believed Trump would win.

Since then, Bitcoin’s price soared past the $100,000 mark, with whales profiting more than ever. Recent data suggests that whales and institutions now dominate exchange volumes. Notably, the top 10 large transactions now account for over 94.5% of all trading volumes on exchanges.

According to one analyst, these whales are expected to sell their tokens. Notably, some of these whales are rolling their profits over to smaller-cap projects, chasing even bigger returns.

Why Whales Are Buying Up CutoshiSince the start of the current bull market, memeFi Cutoshi (CUTO) started gaining traction. Most recently, the project reached a major milestone, attracting more than $1.47 million in investments. Bitcoin whales have recognized this project for its potential to bring DeFi to the masses.

Cutoshi is a token that blends memes and DeFi. Its mascot is a lucky cat, a popular symbol worldwide. At the same time, it takes its inspiration from Satoshi, the legendary creator of Bitcoin. As such, it hopes to use the viral appeal of memecoins to bring more traders than ever into the DeFi space.

Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is all about decentralization. It is building a complete DeFi ecosystem that is governed by its users. Moreover, it is building a multichain DEX to make DeFi more accessible than ever. The DEX will feature low fees, self-custody and an easy-to-use interface.

Thanks to its focus on self-custody and decentralization and honoring Satoshi, Bitcoin whales are taking note. These traders are taking positions in this small-cap token to realize potential 100x gains. While trades like this can be risky, whales understand that the potential ROI more than makes up for the risk. At the same time, many are investing just in the hopes that Cutoshi will bring more people into DeFi.

ConclusionWith more people than ever joining the crypto market, Cutoshi hopes to use the viral appeal of meme coins to bring them into the world of DeFi. This is something that Bitcoin whales are passionate about. Whether it’s for potential 100x gains or to support the project’s mission, Cutoshi’s presale success reveals it has strong backing among the biggest traders out there.
