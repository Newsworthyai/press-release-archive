Each piece in the Elizabetta collection is 100% handmade in Italy, using only the finest silk and wool sourced from ethical, family-run mills. From the drawing table to the final stitch, every product reflects the meticulous attention to detail and passion for excellence that defines Italian artisanal heritage.

“We believe in slow fashion and sustainable luxury,” says founder Francesca Dinardo. “Our mission is to create beautiful, lasting pieces that honor the traditions of Italian craftsmanship while offering something truly distinctive for our customers around the world.”

Designed in-house and inspired by Italian art, history, and culture, Elizabetta’s accessories stand apart for their originality and exclusivity. Limited production runs ensure that each item remains a rare, wearable work of art — not a mass-produced trend.
