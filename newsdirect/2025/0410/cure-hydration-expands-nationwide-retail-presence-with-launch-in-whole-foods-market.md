# Cure Hydration Expands Nationwide Retail Presence with Launch in Whole Foods Market

Cure Hydration, the leading premium, plant-based hydration brand known for its science-backed, electrolyte-rich formula, today announced its launch into Whole Foods Market locations nationwide. Cure Hydration’s Kids line has begun rolling out in 500+ Whole Foods stores, with five additional products from Cure Hydration’s core lineup rolling out over the next month. This expansion signifies a major milestone in the brand’s mission to offer better hydration solutions for health-conscious consumers across the U.S.

Cure Hydration’s unique formula, based on the World Health Organization’s Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) standards, delivers optimal replenishment with 4x the electrolytes of leading sports drinks, without any added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Made with simple, plant-based ingredients like coconut water and pink Himalayan salt, Cure delivers effective hydration powered by nature - ensuring efficient replenishment for active families and individuals. A nutritious and great-tasting alternative to sugary beverages, Cure’s products are vegan, gluten-free, and non-GMO, with natural ingredients like fruit juice powders and monk fruit. Whether you're hitting the gym, going on a hike, or simply looking to stay hydrated, Cure is made for everyone – and now even more accessible, with Cure’s launch in Whole Foods Market.

"We’re beyond excited to launch Cure Hydration in Whole Foods Market, a destination for consumers who prioritize high-quality, better-for-you products," said Lauren Picasso, CEO and Founder of Cure Hydration. "As a leader in the natural foods industry, Whole Foods has set the standard for clean, high-quality ingredients, making this partnership a perfect match. At Cure, we believe hydration should be both effective and healthy, which is why we use a science backed formula without the added sugar or artificial junk. Being on Whole Foods shelves is a huge step forward in our mission to make hydration accessible to everyone, helping people feel their best every day.”

In addition to a commitment to premium, science-backed formulas, Cure also focuses on delivering great taste and community impact initiatives (a mission that echoes Whole Foods Markets’ commitments). Cure’s products come in stick pack packaging that uses 95% less plastic than the average 12-oz bottled beverage. Through a partnership with rePurpose Global, Cure’s packaging is certified plastic-neutral and the company offsets plastic waste to ensure that hydration on-the-go doesn’t come at the expense of the environment. Cure also donates servings of its products to those in need, and supports local organizations like New York Common Pantry, City Harvest, and GrowNYC.

Andy Jackson, Principal Category Merchant at Whole Foods Market added, “At Whole Foods Market, our mission is to nourish people and the planet by offering the highest quality products made with ingredients customers can trust. Cure Hydration’s commitment to plant-based hydration aligns perfectly with our values, providing a science-backed, effective way for shoppers to stay hydrated - without added sugars or artificial ingredients. We’re thrilled to offer Cure’s solutions to our shoppers nationwide, giving our customers a convenient and effective way to stay hydrated with ingredients they can trust.”

With the initial launch of Cure Kids and additional core products rolling out later this spring, Cure Hydration is well-positioned to become a go-to solution for those seeking effective, clean hydration options. Cure Kids will be available in-stores in three kid-friendly flavors: Fruit Punch, Pink Lemonade, and Mixed Berry. Starting this spring, the brand’s core product line will offer a refreshing range of flavors, including Berry Pomegranate, Lemonade, Tropical Punch, Watermelon, and Strawberry Kiwi, catering to a variety of tastes and preferences. Whether at home or on-the-go, Cure is committed to providing consumers with the best hydration solutions to keep their bodies performing at their best.
