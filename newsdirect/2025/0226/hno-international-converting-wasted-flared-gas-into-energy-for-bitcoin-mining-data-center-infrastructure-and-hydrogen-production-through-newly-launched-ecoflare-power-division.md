# HNO International Converting Wasted Flared Gas Into Energy for Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Infrastructure, and Hydrogen Production Through Newly Launched EcoFlare Power Division

HNO International, Inc. (OTC: HNOI), a leader in hydrogen-based clean energy solutions, announces the launch of EcoFlare Power, a dedicated division focused on harnessing wasted natural gas from flaring to generate reliable power to produce hydrogen and electricity for high-performance data centers and Bitcoin mining.

Each year, billions of cubic feet of natural gas are lost through flaring, contributing to environmental degradation and the waste of a valuable energy resource. EcoFlare Power directly addresses this challenge by capturing flared gas and repurposing it into sustainable power, while also lowering the CO2 emissions of the flared gas. Thus, transforming an environmental liability into a powerful asset for the digital economy.
