# Sector Spotlight: 4 Stocks Riding the Gold Surge

Gold mining stocks are having a moment. In the early months of 2025, shares of gold miners have surged, outpacing even the price of gold itself. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF, a bellwether for the sector, is up 20% year-to-date, compared to gold’s 12% rise and the S&P 500’s modest 1.7% gain. This marks a significant shift from recent years, when miners often lagged behind the metal they produce.

What’s driving this outperformance? For starters, gold itself is on a tear, hitting all-time highs as investors seek refuge from persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and market volatility. But beyond gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset, mining stocks offer something extra: leverage. When gold prices rise, miners’ profit margins expand, often leading to even greater returns for shareholders.

Moreover, gold mining companies are no longer just about digging for gold. Many are embracing innovative technologies, sustainable practices, and strategic expansions—factors that enhance their growth potential and appeal to a broader range of investors.

In this piece, we highlight four gold mining stocks that stand out in today’s market—each offering a unique opportunity to capitalize on gold’s strength and the sector’s potential.

Sidney Resources Corporation (OTC: SDRC)

Sidney Resources Corporation is an emerging mining and exploration company focused on unlocking the potential of precious metal resources in Idaho’s Warren Mining District. With a clear vision of innovation, sustainability, and value creation, Sidney Resources has been making moves to position itself for growth. Recent developments highlight the company’s progress and its potential to capitalize on the growing demand for precious metals and rare earth elements (REEs).

In December 2024, SDRC achieved a significant milestone by securing over $8 million in funding. This capital injection is supporting the construction of a state-of-the-art milling and processing facility, set to break ground in Q2 2025. The facility is designed to increase processing capacity, improve efficiency, and uphold high environmental standards, enabling Sidney Resources to process more ore in-house and potentially boost revenue.

More recently, SDRC announced they acquired the historic Silver Monarch property, a 40-acre site in the Warren District with a documented history of high-value ore production. Historical records show that the mine yielded up to 80 ounces per ton when gold was priced at just $19 per ounce. Modern XRF testing has confirmed the presence of gold, silver, platinum, and other valuable metals like iridium and palladium. The property also includes five distinct vein structures, with geological evidence suggesting untapped potential at depths beyond 2,000 feet.

The momentum continued this month with the acquisition of Unity Gold Silver Mines Inc. assets. This transformative deal added 168 acres of private land, 1,477 acres of unpatented mineral claims, and access to high-value mine spoils and vein systems. Preliminary testing of the mine spoils indicates recoverable gold, silver, and platinum group metals (PGMs), with historical assays showing values as high as 14 ounces of gold and 35 ounces of silver per ton. The acquisition also integrates the Little Giant Mine, a contiguous vein system spanning 9,000 feet, enhancing operational synergy and exploration potential.

Recent assay results from the Warren District further underscore the company’s potential. Analyses of 25,000 tons of ore revealed impressive concentrations of gold (10.2 oz/ton), silver (42.2 oz/ton), platinum (8.1 oz/ton), and rare earth elements (REEs). These results highlight the world-class potential of Sidney Resources’ holdings and demonstrate the company’s ability to leverage modern technology to unlock value from complex ore bodies.

With a strong leadership team, a clear vision for sustainable mining practices, and a portfolio of high-potential properties, Sidney Resources Corporation (OTC: SDRC) is positioning itself to capitalize on the increasing demand for precious metals and rare earth elements. The combination of recent funding, acquisitions, and strong assay results suggests the company has the potential to grow its operations and deliver value to shareholders in the coming years.

Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD) (TSX: ABX)

Barrick Gold Corporation is a global mining powerhouse and a top-tier gold stock to watch. With a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets, including Nevada Gold Mines, Pueblo Viejo, and Kibali, Barrick has consistently demonstrated its ability to grow reserves and replace annual depletion at higher grades. In 2024, the company increased its attributable proven and probable gold reserves by 23%, adding 17.4 million ounces, largely due to the transformational Reko Diq copper-gold project. This marks the fourth consecutive year Barrick has replaced depletion at a higher grade, showcasing its operational excellence and focus on long-term value creation.

Barrick’s copper reserves also saw a remarkable 224% year-on-year increase, driven by the Lumwana Super Pit Expansion and Reko Diq feasibility studies. These projects, alongside others like Fourmile and Pueblo Viejo Expansion, underscore Barrick’s commitment to organic growth and sustainability. With a disciplined reserve replacement strategy, a strong balance sheet, and a focus on high-grade deposits, Barrick is well-positioned to deliver multi-generational benefits to shareholders and host communities alike. For investors seeking exposure to a resilient and growth-oriented gold stock, Barrick Gold Corporation is one to keep an eye on.

Perpetua Resources Corp. (Nasdaq: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA)

Perpetua Resources is advancing the Stibnite Gold Project, one of the highest-grade open-pit gold deposits in the United States, located in central Idaho. The project stands out not only for its estimated 4.8 million ounces of gold reserves but also for its critical antimony reserves—the only identified domestic source of this mineral. With China cutting off global antimony exports in late 2024, the Stibnite Gold Project is poised to supply 35% of U.S. antimony demand in its first six years, bolstering national security and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers.

The project has achieved significant milestones, including the Final Record of Decision from the U.S. Forest Service in January 2025, following an eight-year permitting process. This approval underscores Perpetua’s commitment to environmental restoration, including improving water quality, restoring fish habitats, and increasing wetland acres. The company’s ESG-focused approach, combined with its use of low-carbon energy, aligns with sustainable mining practices.

Financially, the Stibnite Gold Project boasts robust economics, with an after-tax net present value (NPV) of $3.7 billion and an internal rate of return (IRR) exceeding 27%. With an expected gold price of $2,435 per ounce in the first four years, the project is set to become one of the lowest-cost gold operations in Tier 1 jurisdictions. Perpetua has also secured a procurement contract with Idaho Power, marking a key step toward construction, which is expected to begin in 2025.

By combining gold production with critical mineral supply and environmental restoration, Perpetua Resources is uniquely positioned to deliver economic, environmental, and national security benefits, making it a standout in the gold mining sector.

Idaho Strategic Resources (NYSE American: IDR)

Idaho Strategic Resources is a unique gold producer with a rare twist: it also owns the largest rare earth elements (REE) land package in the U.S., making it a standout in the mining sector. In 2024, IDR delivered impressive results, including an 86.39% increase in revenue to $6.15 million and $376.44 million in Q3. Gold production rose by 45% to 2,892 ounces, driven by higher ore grades and operational efficiencies at its Golden Chest mine.

What sets IDR apart is its dual focus on gold and REEs, positioning it to benefit from both the stability of gold and the booming demand for critical minerals. Its Lemhi Pass REE project has shown early promise, with sampling revealing high concentrations of neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and dysprosium (Dy)—key elements for magnets used in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. These four elements alone accounted for up to 76% of total REEs in some samples, rivaling globally significant deposits like Mountain Pass (California) and Mt. Weld (Australia).

This year, IDR is executing a large-scale trenching and drilling program at Lemhi Pass, spanning over 12,000 acres, to further define its REE resources. The company is also collaborating with national laboratories to develop tailored REE processing technologies, ensuring its projects are economically viable. Additionally, IDR secured a $430,000 grant for infrastructure upgrades and partnered with Radiant Industries to explore micronuclear reactors for mining operations, showcasing its innovative approach to sustainable energy solutions.

With a disciplined growth strategy, a strong balance sheet, and a team capable of handling rapid expansion, IDR is well-positioned to capitalize on its dual gold and REE potential. For investors seeking exposure to both precious metals and the critical minerals boom, IDR is a compelling choice.
