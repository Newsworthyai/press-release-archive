# Moi Moi Fine Jewellery Redefines a Classic with the Launch of the Modern Bezel Collection

Inspired by sleek lines, clean silhouettes, and a philosophy of brilliance, framed, The Bezel Collection features a series of bezel-set rings, bands, and bracelets that balance modern simplicity with enduring elegance. Each piece is crafted to let the gemstone take centre stage, unadorned and uninterrupted.

“The design concept behind The Bezel Collection is ‘back to basics’ with a modern approach—simple solitaires set in refined, contemporary bezel settings,” says Moi Moi Jewellery Designer, Janet.

Designed for everyday wear, the collection is as practical as it is beautiful. Thanks to the secure bezel setting and the strength of SUPERNOVA Moissanite, each piece is ideal for women with active lifestyles who don’t want to compromise on sparkle or style.

“When the centre stones are already so impressive and sizeable, as they are in our Bezel Collection, you really don’t need extra embellishments,” says Lauren Sommer, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Moi Moi. “You simply need to frame the jewel and let it shine—that’s why we’re calling it Brilliance, framed.”

An Ancient Technique, Reimagined for Today

The bezel setting is one of the oldest known methods of securing gemstones, dating back to Ancient Egypt and Rome. In this collection, Moi Moi updates this heritage technique with sleek modernity, featuring fancy cuts such as emerald, marquise, pear, oval and asscher in bold, contemporary settings.

The Bezel Collection includes standout styles such as:

* Lottie: A versatile solitaire available in multiple cuts, perfect for stacking or bridal wear.
* Iliana: A unique east-west emerald cut solitaire offering a modern twist on tradition.
* Jolene: A striking marquise or pear design with a full knife-edge band, ideal as a statement piece.

Complementing the rings are matching bands and bracelets, including the chic Roxie, Jodie, Lina, and Kerry bands, and three stunning bracelets featuring fancy-cut stones designed to coordinate effortlessly with the rings.

Symbolic, Stylish, and Strong

Bezel settings not only offer superior protection but also carry symbolic meaning, often associated with eternity and safeguarding what matters most. These qualities, combined with their smooth contours and snag-free design, make bezel-set jewellery ideal for modern lifestyles.

This sleek, secure style has recently surged in popularity among celebrities like Lily Collins, Phoebe Tonkin, and Zoe Kravitz, who’ve all chosen bezel-set rings for their engagements. Now, Moi Moi brings that same modern elegance to Australian jewellery lovers.
