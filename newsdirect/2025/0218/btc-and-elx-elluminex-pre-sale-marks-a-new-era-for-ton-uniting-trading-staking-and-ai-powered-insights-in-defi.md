Although TON is one of the fastest-growing blockchains, its ecosystem currently offers limited DeFi solutions and innovative financial tools. Elluminex aims to change that by introducing a comprehensive DeFi hub built on TON’s robust network. The proof can be seen in Bitcoin (BTC) which was previously only a store of value till DeFi projects like Stacks, and Rootstock entered the scenario and changed BTC’s perspective completely.

TON, being one of the most popular blockchains in the present, is facing the same issue as BTC once did. However, to solve that problem a new project is about to enter the market. Elluminex (ELX) is already creating an air of excitement amongst the TON users.

Projects That Changed BTC’s ImpressionFor a long time, the BTC blockchain was considered nothing more than a store value where users only came to buy Bitcoin. This not only harmed the BTC blockchain’s reputation but also turned all active users into passive ones.

However, when projects like Stacks, Rootstock, and Wrapped Bitcoin were launched in the blockchain, they expanded BTC’s functionality, thus turning into a central hub for DeFi projects, smart contracts, and NFTs.

In 2017, Stacks introduced smart contracts and DeFi in the BTC blockchain had over 350 million API requests within a year, and provided over 100 BTC as rewards to more than 11,000 active users. Besides, in 2022, Stacks saw an increase of 76% in its regular active users, and 42% in active addresses.

Rootstock enhanced BTC’s capabilities by introducing Ethereum-based smart contracts into the blockchain. In 2024, Rootstock saw an increase of 73.6% in its TVL, stating growing trust of users on the platform, and their need for more DeFi services within the BTC network.

ELX Aiming To Shape TON’s FutureTON is by far one of the most popular, and fastest-growing blockchain technologies on the internet. It has over 950 Million active users with a record of over 1 Billion recorded transactions. However, the major flaws that TON still faces are a robust DeFi system, fragmented liquidity, and limited access to comprehensive DeFi education and streamlined interfaces for new users.

ELX, an upcoming project, aims to solve all the above-mentioned problems through its DeFi Hub architecture. With its presale in hindsight, ELX’s list of features turns into benefits for early users. Elluminex, ELX, provides a solid DeFi system that aims at unified trading with low slippage and high liquidity through which users will be able to enjoy multi-chain trading without any complex interfaces.

Staking, Farming, Trading: All-In-One PlatformThe platform offers staking and farming features that allow users to stake ELX and liquidity provider tokens to earn rewards, in line with its incentivized tokenomics. ELX also has an educational section to simplify the norms of DeFi systems and help both new and seasoned users understand the various concepts present in the TON blockchain.

AI-Powered Exclusive Market InsightsELX is also designing an AI-based portfolio tracker via an AI-powered portfolio tracker that provides real-time performance analysis and market insights, helping users make more informed decisions on the projects being launched on the TON network, thus giving them an upper hand. Besides, ELX plans to provide this exclusive feature to all presale participants for beta testing before making it official.

ELX’s Special Benefits For Presale ParticipantsEarly presale participants may benefit from additional features such as governance rights, participation in key decision-making processes, and access to premium platform features. Elluminex’s tokenomics include a burn mechanism whereby 50% of all fees collected in ELX are burned, contributing to a deflationary model designed to reduce circulating supply over time.

Besides, ELX already has plans on using up to 50% of presale fees for token burning which will increase scarcity and induce deflationary pressure. Since ELX has a limited supply of 350 million tokens, the burning mechanism will increase its market demand and value. Moreover, ELX is already working on launching the token on selected exchanges during the presale phase, to bring forth all the users in one place.

Presale Of The YearElluminex’s presale is now live, offering early users the opportunity to secure ELX tokens at an initial price of $0.06. The presale has already attracted notable interest, with over 5.4 million tokens sold and more than $325,429 raised to date. As the presale advances into its next phase, the token price is expected to adjust to $0.08, reflecting the project's structured tokenomics and deflationary mechanism.

Though TON already has certain DeFi projects, like STON fi, DeDust, and Tonstakers, ELX stands out by designing a DeFi hub that not only combines all DeFi features but also provides an ultimate solution for users. ELX holds the potential to expand TON’s existing capabilities and transform it into more than a store value.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
