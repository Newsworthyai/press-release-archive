As users are looking for more interesting projects, one that not only provides great rewards through gamification but also real-world usage, the meme-king DOGE is slowly starting to lose its charm. Since DOGE appears to be extremely vulnerable, depending majorly on influencer marketing, it is losing users' trust.

While DOGE is moving towards losing its charm, Elluminex (ELX) is planning to enter the market in the TON blockchain, with an all-new unified DeFi hub center. The team is already working on designing an all-in-one DeFi ecosystem that will uncover TON’s hidden capabilities.

DOGE Fluctuating With Changing Market DynamicsOne of the major reasons behind DOGE’s market fluctuations is the current geopolitical economic scenario. With Trump’s high interest rates and tariff plans introducing trade wars, the U.S. dollar maintaining a strong front, and a sudden hike in interest rates from the Bank of Japan, DOGE is seeing its users tending to move away from the meme coin and look for safer options.

Besides, DOGE's growth mainly depends on Elon Musk hyping it over social media, and without any recent statement, DOGE is going down the red line. On top of that, the Dogecoin blockchain does not have any development, nor are there any other coins present in the blockchain technology. Due to this, the Dogecoin blockchain is failing to maintain its value in the market, the result of which can be seen in DOGE’s current performance.

Moreover, users are looking for more utility-based projects or meme coins that have real-world usage, and since DOGE falls under the speculative coins category, it is losing market value.

DOGE has been moving more between the upper and lower bands, indicating that the meme coin has been experiencing fluctuations in volatility. At the time of writing, DOGE is priced at $0.25885, with values reaching the upper band, indicating an incoming pullback. Besides, the RSI is standing at 73.85 showing an overbought condition, which might force DOGE into a correction period.

Elluminex Illuminating Its Way On Upcoming PresaleWhile DOGE is experiencing fluctuations, a new DeFi hub project, Elluminex (ELX), is making rounds in the TON community. Elluminex is a groundbreaking project that will bring decentralized trading, staking, yield farming, and cross-chain bridging in a seamless manner on the TON chain to empower users with fast, secure, and user-centric financial solutions.

Since TON is one of the fastest-moving blockchains in the industry, with over 950 million active users, and 1 Billion recorded transactions, a full-fledged DeFi ecosystem will help in scaling TON to new heights. ELX is already working its way through the roadmap structure, with the simple aim of building a one-stop-solution DeFi system.

ELX’s Structured TokenomicsWith a total supply of 350 Million ELX tokens, Elluminex is already making noise with its well-distributed tokenomics. ELX has allocated 50% of its total supply for presale, 20% for ecosystem building, 10% each for marketing and liquidity & listings, and 5% each for buyback reverse and team allocation.

Ellumimex already has plans on using a total of 50% fees on $ELX burning to induce scarcity and improve the token’s market value. The properly structured tokenomics and burning mechanism make for a perfect combination of high yields, APYs, and profit. ELX has also kept trading fees, staking fees, and other platform fees to the minimum to increase user engagement and help leverage TON’s fast, scalable network to enhance the overall user experience.

Elluminex’s Simple Interface RuleWith a unified DEX ecosystem, Elluminex plans to create a simplified interface and make all platform features accessible to users in one dashboard, thus removing any complexities that users face while trading. ELX also has a community-building approach for which it plans to introduce gamification through which users will be able to earn premium rewards.

Moreover, the ELX core team (containing some of the top developers in the industry) is working on the DeFi hub’s mobile app for both Android and iOS platforms which will make asset handling easier for users.

The ELX team is already opting for smart contracts with regular security audits, thus adding multiple security layers to ensure complete safety and transparency about all interactions in the ecosystem.

With the presale in hindsight, ELX is already bringing tons of benefits for early users. The ELX holders will get governance rights, access to exclusive features like an AI-based portfolio tracker, beta testing of mobile apps, discounts on trading, staking, and much more. Besides, the sturdy architecture of ELX enhances TON’s capabilities and unlocks its potential as a robust DeFi ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)
