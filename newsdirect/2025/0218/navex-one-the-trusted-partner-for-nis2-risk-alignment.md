# NAVEX One: The Trusted Partner for NIS2 Risk Alignment

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, is pleased to offer the first GRC solution to holistically address NIS2 across training, policies and assessment – all on one platform, NAVEX One. NAVEX continues to provide risk and compliance professionals with the tools they need to align with the latest cybersecurity regulations. As organizations face increasing regulatory demands, NAVEX One integrates policy management, training and risk assessment resources to ensure seamless compliance with the European Union’s Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2).

The NIS2 Directive raises the bar for cybersecurity and reporting standards across industries, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing and energy. Organizations must not only comply with these heightened regulations but also ensure their cybersecurity frameworks are strong enough to withstand evolving threats.

“NIS2 is a critical milestone in cybersecurity regulation, and organizations need a partner that helps them do more than just check the compliance box,” said A.G. Lambert, chief product officer at NAVEX. “NAVEX One empowers compliance and risk professionals to build a sustainable and proactive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring their programs are compliant and resilient against emerging threats.”

NAVEX One serves as an essential tool in the journey toward risk and compliance maturity, helping organizations:

* Conduct proactive risk assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
* Centralize and streamline policy management to meet regulatory expectations
* Strengthen cybersecurity posture with comprehensive security awareness training
* Stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity requirements through continuous program improvement and board-ready reporting
* Extend training, policies and cyber risk practices to align third parties with its cyber risk standards

“Organizations today require more than just static risk and compliance checklists—they need dynamic, integrated solutions that evolve with regulatory changes and emerging risks,” said Kyle Martin, vice president of risk solutions at NAVEX. “NAVEX One’s content and capabilities give businesses the confidence to proactively address NIS2 requirements while reinforcing their broader risk management strategies.”

By integrating these capabilities within a single platform, NAVEX One simplifies compliance, reduces risk exposure, and supports organizations in building future-proof compliance programs.
