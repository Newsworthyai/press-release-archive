# SeneGence® Celebrates 25 Years of Legacy, Innovation, and Empowerment in Beauty

SeneGence® , the leading innovator in premium, long-lasting cosmetics and advanced skincare, is proud to continue to celebrate its 25th anniversary, highlighting a quarter-century of beauty innovation. The brand reflects on its rich history and celebrates key milestones that have shaped the future of clean beauty and empowered individuals along the way.

As the company celebrates its 'Year of Color,' SeneGence® reaffirms its belief in the transformative power of vibrant shades. Since the brand’s inception, SeneGence® has viewed color in beauty not just as a statement, but as a way to express oneself, boosting confidence and joy. This philosophy is reflected in the company’s dedication to creating innovative formulas that blend rich pigments with skin-loving ingredients, ensuring that vibrant color is paired with performance and care. From the iconic, smudge-proof LipSense® to a full range of skincare and body essentials, the brand continues to redefine clean beauty with products that deliver exceptional results.

“This anniversary is both a milestone and a reflection of our commitment to empowering women and helping them feel beautiful, no matter their lifestyle,” said Joni Rogers-Kante, Founder and CEO of SeneGence®. “The past 25 years have been an incredible journey, and as we celebrate our 'Year of Color,' we’re excited to continue bringing vibrant, innovative products that inspire confidence and self-expression.”

Over the past 25 years, SeneGence® has built a reputation for leading advancements in beauty and skincare. Notable achievements include:

* New Innovation Lab: In 2025, SeneGence® moved its corporate operations from California to Oklahoma, opening a state-of-the-art innovation lab. As the only corporate beauty brand in Oklahoma, SeneGence® is advancing cutting-edge product development and sustainability and also contributing to the local economy by creating new jobs and opportunities. This creative hub where science meets beauty allows the brand to tailor products to specific consumer needs, from formulation to rigorous qualitative testing. With full formula ownership and traceability of every ingredient, SeneGence® ensures its clean beauty philosophy is upheld at every step.
* 25th Anniversary Milestone: SeneGence® is proud to be one of only 53 direct sales companies in the U.S. to reach the remarkable milestone of 25 years in business.
* Record-Breaking Product Launches: In 2024 alone, the brand launched over 40 products, including the groundbreaking Microbiome Skincare Regimen, SmileSense™ Toothpaste (featuring patent-pending BritePop technology), LashSense FiberExtend Mascara, and Glowify Juicy Plumping Lip Gloss.
* Kiss for a Cause Campaign: With every purchase of LipSense®, SeneGence® donates a product of equal retail value to individuals in need, intending to contribute up to $25 million by March 31, 2025.
* Generosity and Giving Back: Through the Gloss that Gives campaign in partnership with the Make Sense Foundation®, SeneGence® has donated $10,000 to Women Veteran Network, a nonprofit supporting women’s education, with proceeds from the launch of the LipSense® Moisturizing Gloss in the shade Dream.
* Award-Winning Excellence: SeneGence has been recognized for its outstanding innovation and quality, earning accolades such as the SHAPE Beauty Award, HOLA! Beauty Award, and Beauty Innovation Award, among others.
* XPRIZE Healthspan Sponsorship: SeneGence® has proudly partnered with the global competition, XPRIZE Healthspan, a 7-year initiative with a $101 million global prize to advance health and longevity. The Rogers-Kante family’s contribution has helped drive awareness for the contest, which is reshaping the future of health.

Rogers-Kante founded the brand to solve a common challenge: traditional makeup that smudged, faded, or harmed the skin. Drawing from her own experience, Rogers-Kante set out to create products that support active lifestyles with advanced skincare benefits and lasting performance. Every product, from skincare to cosmetics, is infused with the brand’s proprietary SenePlex+ technology, which promotes skin renewal for a healthier, more youthful-looking complexion.

With the belief that true beauty starts with good health, SeneGence® upholds the highest clean beauty standards, adhering to rigorous EU regulations. The brand ensures that every product is safe, effective, and responsibly formulated by banning over 1,450 harmful ingredients. Innovation and entrepreneurial spirit are at the heart of the brand and SeneGence® continues to drive the future of clean beauty creating powerful formulations and providing opportunities for individuals to build their own success.
