The long battle between XRP and SEC is somewhat nearing its end, with SEC pausing the legal case for a few days. This sudden change in decision has raised speculation amongst investors on whether XRP will surge or fall below the red lines. On the other hand, Cutoshi (CUTO) is slowly gaining pace in its presale phase and attracting investors through its DEX system that focuses on bringing DeFi to the masses.

XRP Shining Through SEC’s New LeadershipXRP is experiencing new surges after recent changes in its long battle with SEC. The major turnabout came when Gary Gensler left the chair and crypto advocate Mark Uyeda took the position. This change in leadership has been in favor of Ripple, the result of which can be seen in SEC’s recent acknowledgement of Grayscale’s XRP ETF.

The acknowledgement alone gave XRP a major surge of over 15% since last week. On top of that, whale investors have already moved around $1 Billion worth XRP tokens in the past 48 hours, showing their trust on the project.

But, history has shown how whale investors can change the market scenario to their favor. The “pump and dump” trend still exists, and the chances of XRP falling under the trap are high.

Though XRP is in a positive light, its future is still unpredictable. Standing at $2.7881, XRP has shown a decline of 0.08% in the past 24 hours. As the token is currently swinging near the upper Bollinger band at $2.7899, it is clear that XRP is trying out new resistance levels. Besides, the Bollinger bands are currently contracting, indicating lower volatility and preparing the token for another possible breakout.

Moreover, the MACD line is currently flat and lacks strong momentum, indicating that the coin is in a consolidation period. To support it, the RSI is at 52.55, showing that XRP might remain in the neutral zone before deciding the upcoming trend.

Cutoshi Gaining Momentum In Its PresaleWhile retail investors are still debating on whether XRP will surge or not, Cutoshi is charging head on with its presale momentum. An upcoming project, CUTO is designed to bring back the core principles of blockchain technology: decentralization, financial freedom, and user privacy. Cutoshi is spreading the teachings of legendary Bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto through its conceptual design and features.

CUTO is currently in the fourth stage of its presale with a price of $0.031, and has already raised over $1.77 Million. Besides, Cutoshi has allocated 55% of its total supply of 440 Million tokens for presale alone, whereas the remaining are reserved for token farming, marketing, listing, team distribution, and token burn mechanism. CUTO is already planning on reducing the distribution, which would increase the value of the deflationary coin over time.

As CUTO focuses on leveraging blockchain technology, it has already designed a proper multi-chain wallet that supports over 20 blockchains, making it easier for users to swap across chains. To increase the token’s value, Cutoshi has implemented certain features in the wallet that can only be accessed by using CUTO tokens.

Since CUTO is still in its presale stage, early adopters will get the opportunity of getting access to premium features like educational DeFi platform, earning rewards through token farming, and a chance of winning limited edition NFTs. Besides, Cutoshi’s limited time period offer of 35% extra bonus is already garnering the attention of both retail and whale investors towards the project.

Final WordsRetail investors are still waiting for a solid outcome from the SEC Vs Ripple case before making any decision. Though whale investors are showing trust in XRP, nothing can be said for sure. Coming to Cutoshi, the presale phase is going at a fast pace, with chances of CUTO hitting the $0.1 soon after its launch. However, it is better to conduct in-depth analysis and understand the various projects before making an investment in crypto.
