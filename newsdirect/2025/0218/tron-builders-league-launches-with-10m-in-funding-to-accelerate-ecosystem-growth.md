Geneva, Switzerland, February 18, 2025 – TRON DAO is excited to announce the launch of the TRON Builders League (TBL), an incubator program designed to support builders with funding, guidance, and opportunities for sustained growth– ensuring that projects have a clear path beyond initial development. TBL fosters a more collaborative and sustainable approach to innovation, ensuring that high-potential projects receive the long-term support they need within the TRON ecosystem. Set to launch on February 19, 2025, the program will allocate a total funding pool of $10 million.

TBL is tailored for dedicated builders within the TRON ecosystem, particularly those with experience from HackaTRON and other community-led projects. Builders will have access to funding, hands-on mentorship, and support for integration with the TRON network. TBL will also offer direct access to investors and key ecosystem contributors. This comprehensive approach fosters sustainable innovation, builds a loyal user base, and ensures that TRON DAO's investments have a lasting, positive impact on the builders and the entire ecosystem.

TRON Builders League Tracks:

* Infrastructure & Security – Build developer tools, blockchain infrastructure, and security solutions to enhance the TRON ecosystem.
* Payments & DeFi – Develop stablecoin solutions, crypto payment services, and next-gen decentralized finance applications.
* Gaming & Interactive Media – Create blockchain-powered games, gaming SDKs, and interactive entertainment experiences.
* AI & Automation – Integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain for automation, analytics, and innovative use cases.
* Cross-Chain & Interoperability – Enable seamless multi-chain transactions, asset transfers, and decentralized data sharing.
* DePIN & Real-World Assets – Tokenize real-world assets and build decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin).
* Consumer & Social Applications – Develop blockchain-driven social networks, shopping platforms, and consumer-focused dApps.
* Memes With Utility (MWU) – Elevate memecoins beyond hype with real-world applications and community-driven utility.

Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation will be based on, but not limited to:

* Performance: Track record of the team, including prior contributions to the TRON ecosystem or HackaTRON.
* Market Usefulness: The project’s potential to solve real-world problems and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.
* Future Potential: Scalability, long-term sustainability, and alignment with TRON’s strategic goals.
