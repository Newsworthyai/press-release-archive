# FTN Network Expands StatsHub Tool Ahead of NFL Playoffs

FTN Network, a data-driven betting, fantasy, and DFS sports platform dedicated to providing insights beyond the traditional box score, announced an updated version of its comprehensive StatsHub tool with access being free during NFL Wild Card Week (January 7 to January 13). StatsHub aims to challenge or reaffirm existing team and player narratives that are typically influenced by raw statistics commonly cited by casual sports fans, bettors and DFS players alike.

Datapoint categories in the update will include base, efficiency, coverage, alignment, air yards, deep receiving, usage, run types, red zone, tendencies, deep passing and pressure. The inclusion of these metrics provides consumers with a better understanding of the true value and upside a player brings long-term in either a fantasy or betting context or in terms of general sustainability in the NFL. With all 272 regular season matchups complete, FTN is equipped to provide analytics-based context stemming from its proprietary data gathered over the last 18 weeks.

"For those wanting to try StatsHub or those looking for the most advanced sports analytics tool on the market, this week's trial is the perfect opportunity to test it out and see what FTN can offer. With StatsHub, you have the ultimate tool for football knowledge as a fan, fantasy player, bettor or member of the media,” said Frank Brank, Chief Data Officer at FTN. “StatsHub is incredibly versatile and can be used to reinforce a trend you’ve noticed, push you to make smarter waiver wire decisions, or be the driving force behind placing more strategic bets. The database StatsHub pulls from is head and shoulders better than anything it can be compared to and offered at an incredibly competitive price point.”

The update will enhance the user-friendly experience with a more organized breakdown of FTN’s advanced statistics, particularly its proprietary DVOA metric. It will offer greater distinction between datapoints such as efficiency and tendency metrics that weren’t separated in the previous version, providing users with a simpler way of making informed decisions about their DFS and fantasy lineups, or just gaining a better understanding of the league as a whole.

"The expansion of StatsHub will enable us to provide more visibility for our charted data,” said Perry Gershon, Chief Executive Officer at FTN. “This is especially evident when considering the pricing which stands out as a superior deal against comparable companies’ platform offerings.”
