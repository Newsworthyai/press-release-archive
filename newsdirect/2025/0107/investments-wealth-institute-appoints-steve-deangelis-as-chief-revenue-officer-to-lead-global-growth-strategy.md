In this role, DeAngelis is responsible for overseeing the Institute’s Global Sales operations, providing strategic and functional direction to expand the reach of Institute certifications and surpass revenue growth targets. He will lead and motivate a team dedicated to growth through both direct consultation with individuals seeking certification as well as through the development of long-term partnerships with leading investment and wealth management organizations seeking private certification classes for their respective advisor teams. DeAngelis is also expected to expand relationships with such respected organizations by offering customized, educational solutions available through the Investments & Wealth Academy – the Institute’s online continuing education platform – to both further educate advisor teams as well as drive revenue growth for the Institute.

A key member of the Executive Team, DeAngelis will collaborate with both staff and the Board of Directors to focus on strategic partnerships and innovative solutions that continue to provide unmatched value to Institute members, empowering them to excel in the rapidly evolving financial advice landscape. He is based in Philadelphia, PA, and will report directly to Sean Walters, CAE®, Chief Executive Officer of the Institute.

“Steve DeAngelis has a proven record of successfully managing client relationships, innovating and improving sales processes to generate revenue growth in both entrepreneurial environments and within larger corporations,” said Walters. “His positive energy and commitment to excellence is an asset to the Institute, in our strategic objective to elevate IWI’s role as the premier membership-based credentialing and education organization for financial advisors in the HNW ecosystem, and the firms and teams that support them.”

DeAngelis brings with him more than 30 years of experience across a wide range of financial services organizations and roles. He most recently was on the faculty at Villanova University School of Business as an Executive in Residence, where he developed curriculum and taught students how to communicate with more impact in the professional world. During this time, he also founded Auctoritas Executive Consulting, where he provided consulting services for businesses committed to strategic growth through efficient execution, accountability and executive effectiveness.

Prior to his faculty and consulting roles, Mr. DeAngelis served as Chief Revenue Officer at Orion Advisor Solutions – an industry leading financial technology firm – where he served on the firm’s Executive Committee and was responsible for all sales and revenue generation activities.

Prior to Orion, DeAngelis was Executive Vice President and Head of Distribution at FS Investments, where he served on its Executive Committee and was President of its wholly owned broker-dealer subsidiary, FS Investment Solutions. He led the firm’s evolution into a multi-product, multi-channel sales organization, including its first ever entry into various distribution channels.

Before FS Investments, Mr. DeAngelis spent nine years at Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). As Managing Director, Head of U.S. Advisor Solutions Group, he led distribution of all GSAM products and services to financial advisors, including mutual funds, ETFs, alternative investments and structured products. He was also responsible for strategic management of home office distribution relationships.

Prior to Goldman Sachs, he co-founded and served as President of ADVISORport, Inc., the industry’s first web-based platform for delivering customized managed account services to wealth management organizations. (ADVISORport was eventually sold to PFPC Worldwide, a division of PNC Financial.)

On the volunteer side, DeAngelis currently serves on the board of Philadelphia Financial Scholars – which delivers financial literacy education to the underserved high school community in Philadelphia – and serves as an Investment Committee member of the Brothers of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine. He will also continue to serve on the boards of three privately held companies when joining the Institute.

“I am honored to join the Institute at such a pivotal time and look forward to collaborating with our team to enhance our offerings and support the evolving needs of financial professionals,” DeAngelis said. “Together, we'll continue to elevate the standards of wealth management, ensuring our members deliver exceptional value to their clients.”
