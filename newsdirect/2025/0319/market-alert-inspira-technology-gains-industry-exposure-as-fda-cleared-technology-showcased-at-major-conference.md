# Market Alert: Inspira Technology Gains Industry Exposure as FDA-Cleared Technology Showcased at Major Conference

Market News Alerts Reports: Inspira Technologies (NASDAQ: IINN)* is gaining attention today as their FDA-cleared INSPIRA™ ART100 life-support system is being showcased at the prestigious AmSECT International Conference in San Diego, potentially exposing their technology to hundreds of perfusion professionals.

This high-profile exhibition comes at a strategic moment for Inspira, with recent developments showing momentum:

* The FDA-cleared INSPIRA ART100 system is being prepared for deployment in leading U.S. hospitals
* Recent clinical studies demonstrated 96% accuracy for their HYLA blood sensor technology
* The company is advancing development of their flagship INSPIRA ART500 system

With the company visionairy approach targeting approximately 20 million ICU patients with acute respiratory failure annually worldwide, Inspira aims to address significant markets: the $5.7B blood gas analyzer market and the $19B mechanical ventilation sector. The company's approach allows patients to remain awake during treatment without ventilators—addressing a need where current solutions face significant challenges.

This conference appearance raises Inspira's profile within the perfusion community, potentially supporting their commercialization strategy as they work to introduce their technology to medical institutions.
