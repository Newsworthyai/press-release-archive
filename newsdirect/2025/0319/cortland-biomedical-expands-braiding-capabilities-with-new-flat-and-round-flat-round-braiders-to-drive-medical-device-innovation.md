# Cortland Biomedical Expands Braiding Capabilities with New Flat and Round-Flat-Round Braiders to Drive Medical Device Innovation

Cortland Biomedical, a full-service biomedical textile product development partner that provides access to a full spectrum of custom engineering services, has expanded its braiding capabilities with the addition of flat braiding and round-flat-round braiding equipment. This latest investment provides Cortland Biomedical’s OEM customers with access to a full suite of braiding technologies, further strengthening the company’s position as a trusted partner enabling less invasive medical devices across a range of surgical applications.

Braids plays a critical role in the design and performance of implantable medical textiles, particularly for orthopedic and sports medicine applications such as tendon and ligament repair. Flat braiding enables precise control over width and thickness, offering enhanced customization for applications requiring flexible yet strong structures that are able to distribute and bear force effectively. Meanwhile, round-flat-round braiding allows for seamless transitions between different braid geometries, optimizing load distribution and mechanical properties essential for next-generation medical devices. This unique structure enables a needle to be attached to the round section or tip, providing additional functionality.

“With the addition of these new braiders, we are expanding the design possibilities for our customers, giving them even greater flexibility in developing high-performance biomedical textiles,” said Wesley Conger, engineering director, Cortland Biomedical. “This investment underscores our commitment to delivering custom textile solutions that meet the evolving needs of the medical device industry.”

The expanded capabilities complement Cortland Biomedical’s existing expertise in braiding – which already included low and high density braiding, and branch braiding -- as well as woven, knitted, and other advanced textile engineering solutions. By offering a comprehensive range of biomedical textile technologies, the company continues to support OEMs in accelerating innovation and improving patient outcomes.
