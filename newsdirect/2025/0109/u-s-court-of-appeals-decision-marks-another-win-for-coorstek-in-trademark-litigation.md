# U.S. Court of Appeals Decision Marks Another Win for CoorsTek in Trademark Litigation

CoorsTek Bioceramics has secured a decisive win in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirming the company’s right to market and sell its Permallon® Tru* ceramic hip components in the U.S. The recent decision confirms the 2022 U.S. PTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) cancellation of trademark registrations by Ceramtec GmbH.

“Alternative sourcing of these components is necessary to prevent supply shortages for this critical care market,” said Jonathan Coors, CEO of CoorsTek. “The U.S. Court of Appeals decision marks another victory for CoorsTek in this case, but it is ultimately patients across the globe who will benefit.”

CoorsTek Bioceramics entered the hip arthroplasty industry in 2013 with its Permallon® Tru technical ceramic material which contains a chromium oxide additive for improved performance, including increased hardness. The pink coloring of products manufactured from Permallon® Tru ceramic is a natural byproduct of the additive.

CoorsTek initiated proceedings in 2014 following attempts by Ceramtec to enforce its trademark and trade dress claims to the color pink for its ceramic hip components. In 2022 the TTAB ruled to cancel the trademark registrations, finding the pink color is functional and a natural result of following the teachings in the expired Ceramtec patent on the material. The recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision affirms the cancellation.

The 2022 TTAB decision followed a prior CoorsTek victory in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which was vacated on procedural grounds.

Lucian Strong, President, CoorsTek Bioceramics said, “Products manufactured from Permallon® Tru ceramic material demonstrate exceptional mechanical performance and durability. We are pleased to continue offering these products to leading medical device OEMs who have come to rely upon high-performance, high-quality components provided by CoorsTek.”

Hip systems incorporating Permallon® Tru hip components been registered for use by customers of CoorsTek Bioceramics in multiple locations across the globe, including the U.S., Korea, China, and the EU.
