The memecoin craze of 2024 shows no signs of slowing. With the sector’s market cap surging past $77.5 Billion (CoinGecko), tokens like PEPE have dominated headlines, blending viral appeal with speculative gains. Yet a new contender, Cutoshi ($CUTO), is emerging as a powerful force. It is a meme coin that employs DeFi utility, cultural symbolism, and a deflationary model that analysts say could redefine the meme economy.

So, let us see why a new name like Cutoshi holds the power to defeat PEPE, one of the biggest names in the industry.

PEPE has been among the top 5 meme coins in the industry for quite some time now regarding the market cap. While its community thrives on humor and nostalgia, critics argue it lacks tangible utility.

Cutoshi incorporates the story of a Chinese Lucky Cat while integrating Satoshi Nakamoto’s ideology of decentralized finance. Cutoshi is more than just a meme unlike PEPE. Cutoshi is a DeFi ecosystem that aids users through a MultiChain DEX, token farming, and an educational hub.

As reported by analysts, Cutoshi has a deflationary structure that creates value and leaves behind PEPE.

The Cutoshi ecosystem is far more advanced and holds vital utilities such as:

Multi-Chain DEX: Assets can be swapped across blockchains seamlessly and without issues. Traders understand how fragmented liquidity and elevated fees affect the ecosystem.

Token Farming & Rewards: Community quests aid in aligning the goals of long-term holders by providing passive income.

Cutoshi Learning Academy: Educating the users on topics like DeFi, Cryptocurrency, and Web3.

Using these features, Cutoshi is termed to be a pioneer in MemeFi. Unlike PEPE, Cutoshi does not rely on speculation and market manipulation to draw attention. The coin focuses on educating people on making use of tools that are becoming increasingly popular.

PEPE vs Cutoshi: Which one to buy?While PEPE remains a crypto cultural icon, Cutoshi represents a maturation of the memecoin narrative. It has figured out a sweet spot for itself where humour meets utility and luck meets strategy. Also, Lucky Cat’s ascent and cultural relevance could signal a new era for DeFi in a market craving innovation.
