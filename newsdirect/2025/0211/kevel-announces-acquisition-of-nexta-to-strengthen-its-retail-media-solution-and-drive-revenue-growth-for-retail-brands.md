# Kevel Announces Acquisition of Nexta to Strengthen Its Retail Media Solution and Drive Revenue Growth for Retail Brands

Kevel, the leading provider of API-based retail media ad serving technology, has announced the acquisition of Nexta, an automated advertising self-serve platform. The acquisition illustrates Kevel’s commitment to redefining the retail media landscape with an all-encompassing solution to arm retailers with the right tools to manage multi-channel ad investment, optimize performance and unlock revenue opportunities.

Kevel empowers retailers to build state-of-the-art retail media platforms in house, enabling them to reclaim control and compete within the competitive retail space on a more level playing field. Nexta’s AI-driven ad manager simplifies the advertising experience and enhances efficiency with booking-optimized self-service for retailers, marketplaces and publishers. By integrating Nexta’s powerful technology into The Retail Media CloudTM, Kevel now offers a full-stack solution for high-performing retail media networks, optimizing operations, improving ad personalization, and enabling seamless efficiency with unmatched customization.

“This acquisition reinforces Kevel’s commitment to transforming the retail media landscape by encouraging retailers to launch custom retail media programs that drive marketplace revenue,” said James Avery, CEO, Kevel. “Nexta is an industry leader in AI-driven omni-channel advertising who share our ethos to take back the internet, make advertising accessible for everyone, and support advertisers of all shapes and sizes on a level playing field. We’re extremely excited to bring the team into the Kevel fold, as we continue to advance the industry and keep pace with demand by offering an all-encompassing retail media solution for our customers.”

Kevel specializes in on-site and API-driven ad-serving technology, delivering robust solutions tailored for seamless integration, while Nexta excels in off-site capabilities with a user interface specifically designed to streamline workflows for operations teams. The combined solution brings on-site and off-site retail media under one roof, offering retailers the choice to either use best in breed user interfaces (UIs) for their customers or teams, or to build their own version, tailored to their needs, using APIs.

As Martin Jensen, Founder and Chairman of the Board at Nexta, says, “This merger is more than just a strategic move — it’s a match made in heaven. Kevel brings global market reach, a shared culture of innovation, and a strong, complementary product offering to the table. Together, we’re not just growing, we’re building something extraordinary. By combining forces, Nexta and Kevel are uniquely positioned to create a game-changing solution in the retail media space.”

The global retail media market is growing at unprecedented pace, with investment predicted to increase to nearly $170bn in 2025, according to WARC’s latest forecast. Retailers are increasingly transitioning to media owners and publishers, seeing the potential to unlock new revenue opportunities while also realizing the unique opportunity to leverage robust first-party data and closed-loop attribution, enabling them to engage with customers in a way that hasn’t traditionally been possible.

“At Nexta, our focus has been solely on simplifying and improving the ad experience for retailers, marketplaces and publishers through intelligent self-serve automation and AI-driven insights,” said Jesper Urban, CEO at Nexta. “Our unwavering commitment to making advertising accessible, measurable, and scalable to all advertisers is synonymous with Kevel’s vision and we’re extremely excited to marry our tech with Kevel’s market-leading retail media solution to transform and drive the retail media space forward.”

Puja Rios, COO at Kevel commented, "We work with global retailers and therefore know how important it is for them to have an API-led solution that puts them in full control, with dedicated UIs for their own teams as well as their advertisers, and the ability to execute on-site, off-site and even in-store ad formats all within a single platform. We're looking forward to extending this to our current customers, as well as retailers considering upgrading their technology."

Under the terms of the agreement, Kevel will integrate all Nexta product offerings into its existing retail media solution to create a unified, fully customizable, data-driven, automated platform, ensuring retailers can continue to meet the growing demand for high-performing retail media networks.
