# Checkpoint from Better Trucks Fixes Bad Addresses Before a Truck Rolls

What’s New: Better Trucks introduces Checkpoint, a proprietary customer address validation tool designed to ensure last-mile delivery accuracy. Checkpoint was announced at Manifest Vegas, the largest supply chain and logistics tech event in the world.

Why: One of the biggest challenges in last-mile delivery is misdelivered packages. With approximately 60 million parcels delivered daily in the U.S., even small address errors result in as many as 3 million misdeliveries each day. These errors create delays, increase costs, and frustrate customers.

Ecommerce retailers are competing for shoppers’ attention and conversion. To eliminate as much friction as possible, often addresses are not verified or corrected at the time of purchase. It falls to carriers to ensure a successful delivery.

Useful Quote: Mike Koleno, Better Trucks Chief Technology Officer: “The battle against bad addresses is a never-ending war, and we’ve built a proactive tool in Checkpoint to increase our percentage of success, but the list of bad addresses is always lurking. Checkpoint creates a partnership with shippers to ensure accuracy after the purchase process through AI, human intelligence, and positive customer interaction — all to delight customers, reduce rates and reduce costs.”

The Stats: Bad addresses are a significant issue, especially at volume.

* On average, bad addresses submitted by consumers account for approximately 0.5-1.5% of all packages shipped through Better Trucks.
* The cost of a package returned to the shipper is approximately 30% more than the cost of a delivered package

Checkpoint is significantly improving a successful delivery rate for initial bad addresses while reducing time and costs to both Better Trucks and its shippers, while improving the end customer experience.

How It Works: CheckPoint is a multilayered process to identify, correct and verify improper addresses.

1. Better Trucks applies artificial intelligence to verify every address created by its shipping clients through at least three data sources led by Google Address Validation.
2. The data sources provide corrected address information when available.
3. When the address cannot be corrected automatically, the Better Trucks Checkpoint team researches the address to correct it.
4. If the addresses cannot be corrected through the previous steps, for shippers who opt-in, an SMS message is sent to the recipient notifying them that a package is set for delivery but that the address requires verification.
5. The recipient can correct the text of the address and also drop a pin on a Google Map to further confirm the location.
6. At delivery, the Better Trucks Drive app layers geofencing into the delivery dropoff scan of the package, only allowing delivery to be scanned within a small radius of the location to ensure proper placement of the package.
7. Finally, once an address is corrected, Checkpoint has the ability to recognize it for future successful deliveries.

Better Trucks Technology: Checkpoint is available to all shippers using Better Trucks in its footprint that reaches more than 4 in 10 U.S. households. Clients have the option to white-label the technology to brand communications with their customers.

Checkpoint is the latest technology built by Better Trucks, following the introduction of Vesitgo, the no-code parcel tracking platform connecting shippers, carriers, and third-party platforms.
