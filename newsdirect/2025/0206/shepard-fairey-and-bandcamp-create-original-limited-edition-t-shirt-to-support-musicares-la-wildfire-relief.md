Bandcamp, the artist-first platform supporting independent music, is proud to announce the next phase of its Bandcamp <3 LA Fundraiser, featuring an exclusive, limited-edition T-shirt designed by acclaimed artist Shepard Fairey. Available throughout February, 100% of proceeds from T-shirt sales will be donated to MusiCares, which offers preventive, emergency, and recovery programs for the music community.

Shepard Fairey, known for his powerful, thought-provoking art, has created a one-of-a-kind T-shirt design that embodies the resilience and creativity of independent artists. His design references vintage vinyl LP packaging design, a nod to Bandcamp's commitment to uplifting the world through the power of music.

Fairey’s “Lotus Woman” design has evolved over time, originating as a screen print in 2015, symbolizing strength and resilience through bold graphic imagery. The lotus flower itself is often associated with spiritual awakening and the journey of rising above adversity. The collaboration with Bandcamp and MusiCares reworks the design into a new version incorporating the Seal of The City of Los Angeles - to raise funds for the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires, with proceeds going to relief efforts. This lineage highlights Fairey’s continued commitment to using his art to support social causes and engage with communities in need.

"Bandcamp gives artists a platform to share their art and make a living from it. The wildfires in LA endangered the livelihoods of so many musicians, and we're grateful to Shepard Fairey for helping us raise money for MusiCares and the LA music community,” said Dan Melnick, General Manager of Bandcamp.

“Music, art, and activism have long been intertwined, shaping culture and inspiring action. This collaboration with Shepard Fairey and MusiCares is about more than just fundraising—it’s about building a future where independent artists have the support they need to thrive. We’re honored to stand alongside partners who share our commitment to strengthening the creative ecosystem,” said Bryan Biniak, President of Songtradr, the parent company of Bandcamp.

“I was heartbroken by the immense loss our community in Los Angeles suffered due to the wildfires. The city is enduring such a difficult time, and many artists, musicians, and dedicated individuals are working tirelessly to rebuild their lives. Drawing inspiration from the incredible strength and resilience of the people here, I created this T-shirt for Bandcamp's Love LA Fundraiser, with all proceeds going directly to MusiCares. Now, more than ever, it’s essential that we come together and support one another as we help our fellow Angelenos heal and rebuild,” said Shepard Fairey, founder of OBEY Clothing and creative agency Studio Number One.

This initiative builds on Bandcamp’s wildfire relief fundraiser on February 7. From midnight to midnight, 100% of Bandcamp’s proceeds will be donated to MusiCare, a safety net supporting the health and welfare of the music community. Bandcamp is proud to partner with A2IM, Harman, Lagunitas, Roland, Shure, Victrola, and WIN, to amplify support for independent musicians affected by the Southern California wildfires.
