# Skin by Brownlee & Co Debuts The Toned Collection and Sustainable Brand Refresh

Skin by Brownlee & Co, the Black-owned, esthetician-formulated skincare brand, unveils its latest innovation: The Toned Collection. Following the debut of a refreshed brand identity, this transformative line introduces four powerhouse products designed to help everyone achieve their ultimate skin goals, delivering hydration, brightness, and a healthy glow with every application.

The Toned Collection combines the power of gentle yet highly effective ingredients, including niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and kojic acid, to fortify the skin barrier, reduce redness, diminish dark spots, and deeply hydrate for a radiant glow. This transformative lineup includes three meticulously crafted products and an innovative skincare tool:

* Toned Brightening Serum ($62): Evens skin tone, fades dark spots, and hydrates with niacinamide, kojic acid, and dual-weight hyaluronic acid for a dewy, radiant complexion.
* Toned Eye Cream ($37): Reduces puffiness, brightens dark circles, and smooths fine lines with niacinamide, caffeine, and antioxidant-rich glutathione.
* Toned Brightening Cream ($52): A rich, overnight treatment that fades dark spots, smooths texture, and hydrates deeply using glycolic acid, niacinamide, and licorice root extract.
* Eye Cryoball ($15): This innovative under-eye tool combines soothing ice therapy with a stainless-steel roller, reducing inflammation and rejuvenating the delicate eye area.

“The Toned Collection represents our dedication to delivering effective, accessible solutions for all skin types,” said Sylvia Brownlee, founder of Skin by Brownlee & Co and a seasoned esthetician with nearly 30 years of expertise. “We’ve designed these products to simplify skincare routines while addressing common concerns like hyperpigmentation, dullness, and uneven skin tones.”

This launch builds on a pivotal moment for the brand, following a recent refresh of its identity and packaging that reflects its growth and commitment to excellence. Celebrating seven years of empowering its community, Skin by Brownlee & Co proudly introduces:

* Sustainable Packaging: Recyclable amber glass jars and bottles that exude elegance and protect product integrity by shielding formulations from light degradation.
* Integrated QR Codes: Each product container now includes a QR code for easy access to usage instructions, tips, and educational resources, underscoring the brand’s commitment to informed and empowered customers.
* Reimagined Visual Identity: A sleek new logo, revamped product names, and an updated aesthetic align with the brand’s elevated focus on quality and inclusivity.
