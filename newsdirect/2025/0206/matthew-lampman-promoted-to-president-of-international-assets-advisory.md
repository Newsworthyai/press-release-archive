# Matthew Lampman Promoted to President of International Assets Advisory

International Assets Advisory (IAA), a comprehensive financial services platform that brings international exposure to retail investors, has announced the promotion of Matthew Lampman to President.

Lampman, who also will retain the role of Chief Operating Officer in the near term, will oversee a staff of 30 managing $4.8 billion in assets under management. Ed Cofrancesco, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and formerly President of IAA, will continue as CEO.

IAA provides a global suite of products and services to more than 200 Independent Registered Representatives in all 50 states.

Lampman hails from a blue-collar family in Michigan, where he was working in the HVAC industry. In 2010, he left for the University of Central Florida in Orlando to pursue a degree in finance. He worked his way through college with a campus job repairing air conditioners during the day and taking classes at night. When he was completing his senior year in the summer of 2012, he took an unpaid internship with IAA. Cofrancesco felt an affinity for Lampman from his first days as an intern.

“I noticed right away that Matt was proud of his work, but he was never too proud to do whatever work needed to be done,” Cofrancesco said. “I grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn, so Matt and I have similar roots, similar values and the same work ethic.”

Lampman said he intended to leverage his internship at IAA, where the founders held all the senior roles, into a job at a larger company where he reasoned, ironically, he would find more opportunity to advance. Instead, the small size of the IAA headquarters team was the launching pad for his career.

“When I was an intern, Ed would call me into the office to educate me about IAA and our industry,” Matt recalls. “About six weeks into my internship, I was hired as a temporary employee, and a few months later I was hired full-time. Since then, Ed has been a constant mentor, guiding and championing my growth. My biggest goal is to emulate him as a mentor and leader.”
