# This Presale Star Has Made More Gain Than LTC and DOT Have in the Past Year; Savvy Investors Shifts Focus

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/185189912/OLzpKXbA.jpeg)

Despite a noticeable rally in the crypto market in the past year, top cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT) haven’t shown much promises for token holders. While Polkadot hasn’t recorded any gain in the past year, Litecoin has held on to roughly 46% price gain following a noticeable retracement from its yearly peak of $137.

Considering the rather sluggish momentum of these top DeFi coins, savvy traders are not hesitating to explore other promising alternatives. Meanwhile, on the receiving end of this attention is a fast-rising presale star– Cutoshi (CUTO). Having delivered over 100% gains a few weeks after launching its ICO, Cutoshi’s hybrid protocol is attracting massive attention.

Best Cryptos to Buy Now? Cutoshi’s Hybrid Concept to Deliver Exponential Gains Beyond its potential to deliver enormous gains, especially for early backers, Cutoshi (CUTO) has been gaining popularity mainly because of its hybrid meme-backed protocol. The new Ethereum-based altcoin essentially combines the communal attribute of memecoins with the lucrativeness of decentralized finance. Moreso, Cutoshi was inspired by both the popular Chinese lucky cat associated with good fortune as well as Satoshi’s core blockchain principles of decentralization, privacy and monetary freedom.

While these core principles serve as the basis on which the Cutoshi unified ecosystem was built, it also presents diverse opportunities for users. More specifically, users can explore lucrative DeFi tools like the Cutoshi DEX protocol which facilitates crypto swapping and transactions across various chain networks. Likewise, the Cutoshi token farming model allows users to earn extra tokens and complementary NFTs and merch by completing different quests.

Meanwhile, serving as the bloodlife of the entire ecosystem is the native $CUTO token which doubles as both utility token and memecoin. As an utility token, the $CUTO token facilitates transactions within the learning academy, as well as Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. This self-sustaining model, coupled with a rapidly-progressing presale places CUTO token among the best cryptos to buy now. While it currently sells at a modest price of $0.031 in its fourth presale stage, Cutoshi has already delivered over 100% ROI.

Litecoin Price Dip Below Monthly Resistance, Struggles to Hold Above $100 MarkAfter hitting a monthly peak of $140 about three weeks ago, Litecoin (LTC) price trajectory has been subjected to a progressive decline. Now trading within a week-to-date price range of $114 and $100, LTC price reflects roughly 12% decline in the past week, further compounding its monthly price decline to nearly 10%.

This progressive decline has pushed LTC price below the monthly resistance level around $110 with a noticeable risk of trading below $100 price mark if no major correction takes place anytime soon. Meanwhile, a closer look at Litecoin’s technical analysis points at a bearish trajectory considering both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages including 30, 100, and 200 day EMAs and SMAs reflect a strong sell.

Further corroborating this bearish outlook, popular crypto analyst Natalie Dormer, in a recent X post, claimed that the LTC price chart has formed a rising wedge and is likely to continue falling. While cautioning traders to tread with caution, Natalie expects further downtrend with potential targets around $93 and $85 price ranges.

Polkadot Token At Risk of Major Downtrend As Price Nears Significant SupportThe price trajectory of Polkadot (DOT) in the past year has been very bearish, resulting in over 30% price decline during the duration. This progressive decline has hampered DOT token growth trajectory as a top DeFi coin. For context, DOT price surpassed the $10 twice in the last year but failed to maintain this level despite considerable community support.

Now trading within a weekly price range of $5.9 and $4.7, DOT price reflects over 20% price decline, and roughly 38% in the past month. This considerable downturn has sparked various speculations on the native DOT token’s potential to deliver any significant return for holders.

Meanwhile, DOT price is currently approaching its most significant support zone around $3.6; failure to hold this position may, however, result in an extended consolidation or even a major downtrend. Sadly, DOT token’s technical analysis including its short and long-term Moving Averages points at a strong sell, which suggests that the current trend may still persist.

Can Cutoshi Outperform Top DeFi Coins Like Litecoin and Polkadot in 2025?Unlike Polkadot, Litecoin has managed to hold on to some profits in the past year; albeit, not as much as Cutoshi as registered in a few weeks of launching its ICO. This, however, isn’t surprising considering the presale status of Cutoshi.

More interestingly, Cutoshi operates as a hybrid utility token, which boosts its appeal across diverse markets. This attribute is particularly lacking in top DeFi coins like DOT and LTC, thereby positioning CUTO token as one of the best crypto coins to buy for immense ROI during and post-ICO.
