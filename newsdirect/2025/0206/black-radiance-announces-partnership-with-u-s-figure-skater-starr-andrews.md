# Black Radiance Announces Partnership with U.S. Figure Skater Starr Andrews

Black Radiance, the leading beauty brand for women of color, is proud to announce its partnership with U.S. figure skater Starr Andrews. Just in time for Black History Month, this collaboration celebrates Black excellence and uplifts women by supporting one of the most inspiring athletes in the sport today.

In 2022, Starr Andrews made history as the first African American woman to medal in singles in the Grand Prix era and the first African American woman to stand on the U.S. Championship podium in 35 years. Her resilience, competitive spirit, and dedication to excellence align perfectly with Black Radiance’s mission to empower women of color to express themselves through beauty and confidence.

“At Black Radiance, we celebrate and support Black women who break barriers and redefine what’s possible," said K. MacDonald Parris, Vice President of Marketing at Black Radiance. “Starr Andrews’ journey in figure skating embodies perseverance and the power of representation. We are honored to stand by her and support her Olympic pursuit as she continues to inspire and make history on the ice.”

"Figure skating, like makeup, is an art form rooted in creativity, confidence, and self-expression,” said Starr Andrews. “My partnership with Black Radiance is so meaningful because they celebrate the same values that have helped shape my journey as a figure skater. Together, we’re uplifting and inspiring the next generation to show up confidently in their beauty and their dreams."

Like many Black Radiance users who are introduced to the brand by their mothers, Starr’s journey in figure skating began with her mom taking her to the rink at just three years old, creating a shared tradition of inspiration. In figure skating, presentation is key, where everything from outfits to makeup plays a role in the ritual. For Starr, putting on makeup before a big competition is as important as the hours spent practicing on the ice. It’s a powerful act of self-expression and confidence.

This collaboration showcases Black Radiance’s dedication to celebrating diverse beauty, amplifying Black voices, and providing high-quality products that inspire individuals to embrace their beauty with pride. It also honors the brand’s long-standing trust and influence among women of color worldwide.

Looking ahead, Black Radiance envisions this partnership evolving into a long-term collaboration, with Starr Andrews serving as a spokesperson and brand ambassador. As she continues to inspire audiences worldwide, Black Radiance is excited to support her journey while showcasing its commitment to providing accessible, high-quality beauty products tailored for women of color.

Be sure to catch Starr’s makeup looks on and off the ice on Black Radiance’s Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Starr Andrews’s Instagram. High res images and interviews are available upon request.
