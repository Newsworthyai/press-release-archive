America’s seniors are embracing a vibrant new chapter of life. Today, they are breaking away from traditional expectations, enjoying greater independence, engaging in diverse activities and redefining what it means to age gracefully and actively.

More than ever, seniors are embracing devices that empower their pursuit of an independent and fulfilling lifestyle, whether they prefer to stay home or explore. Many aging Americans already use digital devices to set their thermostats, see who’s at their door and alert them when it’s time to take their medication. All of these devices are Internet-connected and can talk to each other, sharing data and information with doctors and loved ones - that’s the beauty of the Internet of Things (IoT).

But IoT goes beyond managing the home and monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. Thanks to companies like LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK), these IoT devices are protecting older adults in and out of the home. This added layer of protection is essential, as independence can come with risks – unintentional falls remain the leading cause of injury and death among people aged 65 and older.

LogicMark specializes in personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communication devices and IoT technologies, all designed to create a seamless connected care platform for seniors – providing support and safety both at home and on the go. Instead of relying on in-person monitoring, the company uses advanced technology to offer a comprehensive suite of products aimed at protecting users from falls wherever they occur.

Help Is A Push Of A Button Away LogicMark’s Freedom Alert Max, is more than just a portable safety device—it’s also a fully functional cellular phone, making it a groundbreaking innovation in medical alert technology. The device includes features such as fall detection, geofencing location boundaries, and unlimited non-emergency calls. It also offers 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, ensuring help is always available when needed. Powered by mobile 4G LTE technology, the device provides reliable, two-way communication and advanced GPS location services for precise tracking. LogicMark’s Care Village companion app enables fall detection alerts, device pairing, GPS location monitoring and the ability for a caregiver to monitor the user and device status

Meanwhile Freedom Alert Mini is an on-the go, lightweight device, designed to enhance safety inside and outside of the home. The compact 4G LTE device allows users to call for help at the push of a button, ensuring assistance is available anywhere with cellular coverage. It also includes fall detection technology which senses when someone has fallen and sends an alert to an emergency monitoring center, a loved one or 911. The device can be life-saving in situations where a user falls and is unable to call an emergency contact due to injury, unconsciousness, or disorientation. Complementing the fall detection feature are the Freedom Alert Mini’s GPS location services, which can accurately pinpoint the user’s location and notify authorities for a swift response.. The Freedom Alert Mini connects to a 24/7 monitoring service that promptly contacts first responders, loved ones or caregivers when necessary.

In addition to these two devices LogicMark has a suite of in-home and on-the-go devices that do everything from detecting falls to automatically alerting 911 and loved ones. LogicMark reports that these devices are gaining strong traction in the marketplace. The company recently announced third-quarter revenue of $2.7 million, reflecting a 14% year-over-year increase. A significant contributor to this growth was the rising sales of the Freedom Alert Mini.

Aging In Place With An Assist With the number of 65 and older Americans projected to reach 82 million by 2050, a 47% increase from the 58 million today, the market for remote monitoring devices like the ones made by LogicMark looks set to take off. Between now and 2028 the market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 11.2%.

Older adults are embracing independence and staying active as they age in place, and they are seeking devices that support their dynamic lifestyles. LogicMark is meeting this demand by offering a comprehensive suite of personal remote monitoring devices designed to ensure safety and peace of mind both at home and on the go.
