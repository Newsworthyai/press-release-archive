# NEW YORK’S 30 HUDSON YARDS IS A TOWERING TESTAMENT TO KRYTON INTERNATIONAL’S INNOVATIVE CONCRETE WATERPROOFING SOLUTIONS

NEW YORK – February 4, 2025 – The now iconic 30 Hudson Yards—the crown jewel of New York’s $25-billion Hudson Yards megaproject—is widely recognized for its futuristic architecture that famously reshaped Manhattan’s skyline. Six years after the 103-story office tower opened, Kryton International points out that one of the project’s most enduring feats exists in an unseen location.

Kryton, a global leader in developing cutting-edge advancements in protecting concrete from water’s corrosive effects, assisted architects and engineers in solving a critical underground challenge long before the skyscraper began its vertical ascent to eventually pass the Empire State Building as the 8th tallest U.S. building.

The building is in a 100-year flood plain above a working rail yard, which would be active throughout construction and revealed visual evidence of the water infiltration’s corrosive effect on concrete. The structure’s below-grade foundation, which was already a significant engineering challenge, would have to be 100% watertight for the life of the building.

All architectural triumphs, noted Kryton Vice President for Product Development Kevin Yuers, require three things: great design, quality materials and workmanship. That formula is how Hudson Yards’ subterranean infrastructure, for which Kryton’s materials were critical, maintains stability, resilience and sustainability to the inhospitable building site.

“Most opinions of 30 Hudson Yards’ architecture are formed by looking up, but design excellence also lies beneath our feet,” Yuers said. “The innovation that occurred below the surface was a masterful combination of design, materials, and skilled workmanship that was as much a window to the future as the tower’s striking presence in the New York skyline. Though Kryton has been part of major developments in 50 countries, this project spotlighted the critical role of waterproofing technology in the future of construction.”

Indeed, Kryton’s concrete waterproofing solutions are part of many globally-recognized developments – including construction of the new World Trade Center – but nothing has attracted the public spotlight quite like 30 Hudson Yards’ underground challenges.

The 2012 groundbreaking ceremony was just three months after Hurricane Sandy devastated New York City with catastrophic flooding. The storm underscored the critical importance of protecting foundations from saltwater intrusion.

“Hurricane Sandy was a glaring worst-case scenario of the devastating potential of saltwater flooding, which has a destructive impact on the stability and durability of exposed concrete structures,” said Yuers, noting that concrete is the world’s second most-used substance after water. “This very real threat reinforced the importance and availability of materials that can keep foundations 100% watertight for a building’s entire service life.”

In anticipation of 30 Hudson Yards eventual status as Manhattan’s premier office property for Fortune 500 tenants, flawless structural integrity, durability and long-term sustainability of the foundation was among many non-negotiable expectations.

To meet the rigorous demands of this project, architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and building envelope consultant Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. selected Kryton’s Krystol Internal Membrane™ (KIM®) as the waterproofing solution for the below-grade foundation. The KIM system was applied to key areas including the base slab, elevator pits, flood retention tank, and Amtrak’s underground wheel truer facility.

Kryton’s Krystol T1® was applied to both new and preexisting foundation walls, retail podium slab, and the machine room. Krytonite Swelling Waterstop and Krystol Waterstop Treatment formed watertight construction joints. This was critical where old and new concrete meet, which can be particularly leak prone.

The Krystol technology enables concrete to self-seal cracks and block water indefinitely, while Krytonite Waterstop’s compression sealing power is four times greater than conventional methods to ensure long-lasting prevention against water intrusion.

After six years, 30 Hudson Yards’ foundation remains completely watertight—a testament to the reliable performance that Kryton products consistently deliver. As a result, they have become essential to a growing number of architects, engineers, and builders.

“30 Hudson Yards has literally become a towering testimonial to our concrete technology’s ability to extend the service life, safety and sustainability of concrete structures in even the most difficult conditions. The last six years have proven Kryton’s value to a bigger audience,” emphasized Alain Lok, Kryton Senior Business Manager, Northeast USA, who worked closely with the company’s regional distributor, Dry Concrete CEO Greg Maugeri, to ensure project success. “Together with our partners at Dry Concrete, we supported 30 Hudson Yards as both manufacturer and distributor to provide a superior product, expertise and countless hours of support to make this project a success.”

Since its opening, the ambitious development has remained Manhattan’s premier mixed-use property—attracting a tenant base of Fortune 500 companies and some of the most notable retailers—while commanding the city’s highest office lease rates.

The skyscraper achieved LEED Gold certification and earned the H. Bruce Russell Global Innovator’s Award for its transformative workplace design and smart building environment.

Its foundation is expected to remain watertight and corrosion free for generations.
