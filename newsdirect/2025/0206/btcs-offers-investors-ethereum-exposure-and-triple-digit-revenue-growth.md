Bitcoin is by far the largest cryptocurrency, with Ethereum following as a strong competitor. While Ethereum may not be surpassing $100,000 like Bitcoin did in late January, it is experiencing its own growth moment as big-name investors like BlackRock, Fidelity, and President Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, acquire coins. It doesn’t hurt that Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is more than just a digital token, it’s a decentralized network that is the backbone of DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With improvements to the Ethereum blockchain underway, the network is expected by many analysts to attract more users, potentially driving the price of Ethereum even higher.

All of that is good news for BTCS Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCS), a blockchain infrastructure company that pioneered Bitcoin mining as the first U.S. public company in the space in 2014. Over the past few years, BTCS has shifted its focus to Ethereum to leverage its expertise to drive growth in validator node operations and block building.

Ethereum Shift Is Paying Off All of these strategies are delivering strong results, the company says. In 2024, BTCS posted more than $3.7 million in unaudited revenue, marking 177% year-over-year growth, driven by its Ethereum infrastructure operations. The growth, says BTCS, underscores how it is able to scale its core business. Since shifting to Ethereum, BTCS has become a key participant in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem, operating 522 validator nodes.

In a proof-of-stake blockchain network, a validator node is a computer that verifies and confirms the legitimacy of transactions before they can be added to the blockchain. Validator nodes are responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of the network by making sure the transaction adheres to the protocol rules. BTCS’s operations aim to enhance network security and decentralization while also generating staking rewards and revenue from block-building activities.

“I firmly believe that Ethereum infrastructure—focused on block-building and validation— presents the most compelling growth opportunity I’ve ever witnessed in the crypto space, surpassing even the early days of Bitcoin mining in 2017,” wrote Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS in a recent letter to shareholders. “Ethereum block-building and validation offers exceptional revenue growth potential without high capital constraints. Going forward we aim to be the leading Ethereum blockchain infrastructure company and are currently the only pure-play, publicly traded company focused on this strategy.”

Publicly Traded, Ethereum Pure-Play BTCS says it gives investors cryptocurrency exposure similar to MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which is the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s stock price tends to move in lockstep with Bitcoin, while BTCS’s performance is driven by the broader sentiment of the crypto market. In addition, by staking Ethereum and running validator nodes, BTCS unlocks revenue potential similar to Bitcoin mining – without the need to invest in rapidly depreciating hardware.

BTCS is currently the only publicly traded pure-play Ethereum infrastructure company and says it’s aligning its business with sustainability through energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocols. Proof-of-stake protocols are substantially more energy efficient than proof-of-work protocols, which Bitcoin is based on, because it eliminates the need for energy-hogging computers in the mining process. With proof-of-stake, validators are chosen based on their stake, not by solving complex mathematical puzzles that require a lot of energy.

Bitcoin may get a lot of attention, but Ethereum is also growing. BTCS says it is focusing its attention on innovation, scalability and regulatory compliance, and that that direction will position it well, it hopes, to capitalize on the expanding blockchain ecosystem.
