# CURE ALZHEIMER’S FUND APPOINTS THREE NEW MEMBERS TO 
ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing research with the highest potential to prevent, slow or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, announced today that Mary Greenhill Cagliero, Mark Faggiano and Kumar Mahadeva have been appointed to its Board of Directors.

“As our organization continues to grow and evolve, it’s essential to bring new expertise and perspectives to the Board,” said Henry McCance, Board Chair and Co-Founder of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “Mary, Mark and Kumar each bring proven leadership expertise and success in business and share a personal desire to eliminate Alzheimer’s disease.”

“I am delighted to welcome such a strong group of new Board members,” said Meg Smith, CEO of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “CureAlz will benefit tremendously from their direction and passion for our mission. I look forward to working with each of them as we continue our efforts to find a cure.”

Mary Greenhill Cagliero worked for several years at Goldman Sachs in the real estate investment banking division and in Equity Capital Markets. She later founded Serafina LLC, a bridesmaid dress business based in New York and London. Ms. Cagliero is a graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard College and a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard Business School. Ms. Cagliero is the daughter of Robert F. Greenhill, a CureAlz Director and Board Member Emeritus. Her connection to Alzheimer’s disease is a personal one. Her mother, Gayle, was affected by the disease and passed away in 2017.

Mark Faggiano is a career entrepreneur with a passion for creating software companies that solve complex problems and enable businesses to reach their goals. He is best known for being the Co-Founder and CEO of TaxJar, a sales tax automation platform for ecommerce businesses. He led the company from its inception in 2013 through to its acquisition by Stripe in 2021—Stripe’s largest acquisition ever at the time. In 2019, Mr. Faggiano had the honor of being ranked as the No. 1 CEO in America for small- to mid-sized businesses among a survey of employees for more than 50,000 companies. The CureAlz mission holds special significance for Mr. Faggiano; his father, Frank, passed away from the disease in 2021.

Kumar Mahadeva is the Founder and former Chairman and CEO of Cognizant Technology Solutions, a $35 billion Nasdaq 100 company he started in 1993. Mr. Mahadeva also held senior executive positions at McKinsey and Co., AT&T, and Dun and Bradstreet, and founded private equity company Kubera Partners. Mr. Mahadeva now runs his family office and foundation and serves on the boards of private venture-funded technology companies, nonprofit foundations and the Harvard Business School international advisory board. He earned a master’s degree in electrical engineering from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom and an MBA from the Harvard Business School. The mission of CureAlz is especially meaningful to Mr. Mahadeva, as his father succumbed to the disease in 2013.
