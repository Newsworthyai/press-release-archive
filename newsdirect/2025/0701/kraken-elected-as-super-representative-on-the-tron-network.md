Geneva, Switzerland, July 1, 2025 – TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), today announced that Kraken, one of the world’s longest-standing and most secure crypto platforms, has been elected as a Super Representative (SR) on the TRON blockchain network. Kraken’s institutional-grade protocol staking infrastructure will bring security and reliability to TRON's decentralized governance by validating transactions and producing blocks. As a Super Representative, Kraken will help enhance the network's security and efficiency while enabling broader institutional participation in TRON’s incentive model.

Kraken operates secure, performant, and cost-effective block production nodes for decentralized PoS protocols on behalf of institutional investors. Their multi-tier signing and listening node architecture delivers stakeholders the ideal combination of security, scalability and decentralization. Kraken’s non-custodial staking infrastructure enables institutions to compound crypto assets through staking, offering automated payouts, detailed reporting, and a service-level agreement (SLA) designed to meet enterprise-grade reliability standards.

“Kraken being elected as a Super Representative is a strong signal of growing institutional confidence in TRON’s network and governance model,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO. “Their participation helps strengthen the decentralized foundation of the TRON blockchain while also expanding access to secure, reliable staking infrastructure. As adoption of TRON continues to grow, institutional stakeholders are playing an increasingly important role in supporting a network designed for real-world utility, scale, and sustainable incentives.”

“We’re proud to have been elected as a Super Representative on the TRON network,” said Jonathan Marcus, Head of Staked at Kraken. “As institutions continue to explore secure and efficient ways to participate in blockchain ecosystems, TRON stands out for its scale, reliability, and growing global adoption. We look forward to supporting TRON’s decentralized governance and providing the infrastructure that helps institutional stakeholders access meaningful rewards for contributing to the long-term strength of the network.”

The TRON network is secured and governed by a decentralized group of SRs, including globally recognized institutions such as Google Cloud, Binance, OKX, P2P.org, Nansen, Luganodes, Kiln, and Abra. Their active participation reflects increasing institutional confidence in TRON’s infrastructure and its role in supporting scalable, secure, and transparent blockchain systems.

Kraken’s election as a Super Representative highlights the growing institutional utility of the TRON network. With deep expertise in secure and reliable onchain staking, Kraken brings added confidence to institutions seeking to engage with decentralized systems. Their involvement reinforces TRON’s ability to support secure, scalable, and incentive-aligned blockchain activity across global markets. As institutional engagement with blockchain continues to evolve, TRON remains focused on building the infrastructure needed to support long-term adoption and real-world financial use cases.
