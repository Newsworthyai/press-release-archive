# New research from Employee Benefit News explores the state of healthcare from the perspectives of both employees and employers

Employee Benefit News, a leading resource for the HR and benefits community, releases its State of Healthcare Survey 2025. Sponsored by Quantum Health, the new research offers a rare side-by-side look at how employers and employees make decisions about healthcare benefits — and who they trust to guide those decisions.

The report reveals a potential disconnect in the employer-employee perspective when it comes to health and wellness offerings. As the cost of benefits continues to climb, employers are under pressure to deliver value, but many are questioning whether employees know how to use what’s offered, or even want the benefits in the first place.

Among the findings:

* Employers are scaling back on benefits in response to rising costs and shifting employee expectations
* Data and trust gaps are complicating efforts to fine-tune benefits strategies
* Longstanding assumptions about who employers and employees trust in the decision-making process are being challenged
* Satisfaction with healthcare benefits isn't always tied to how well those benefits are used
* Communication remains a critical (and often overlooked) factor in employee engagement with healthcare options

“In a market where cost pressures and expectations are both high, trust is emerging as a make-or-break factor,” says Janet King, SVP, Content Strategy at Arizent, parent company of Employee Benefit News. “Employers who want to improve satisfaction and outcomes must take a harder look at how they communicate benefits — and who employees trust to help them make smart choices.”

The data makes two things clear: Healthcare benefits remain an important factor for employees as they consider their current or future position, and employee satisfaction remains a key part of the value these offerings provide for employers.

This report is designed to help employers tailor their support for employees in ways that optimize the value of benefits. For other key insights — including where employers and employees diverge on trust, how to better align benefits communication with employee preferences and why cutting back on offerings could backfire — download the full report here.
