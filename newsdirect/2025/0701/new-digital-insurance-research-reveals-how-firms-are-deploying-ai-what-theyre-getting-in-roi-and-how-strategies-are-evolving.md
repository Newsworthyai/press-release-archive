# New Digital Insurance research reveals how firms are deploying AI, what they’re getting in ROI and how strategies are evolving

Digital Insurance, a leading information resource for executives and innovators in the insurance sector, releases its latest research report, The Cost of AI: The AI Revolution Gathers Steam. Sponsored by Salesforce, the findings reveal adoption of artificial intelligence is rising in the insurance industry, with more than half expecting to implement it within 12 to 18 months — and many already seeing returns.

AI is moving from pilot project to enterprise strategy for some organizations, with a growing number of companies already seeing returns on their investments. But as AI deployments scale, so do the price tags — and industry professionals may face tough choices about how to modernize, budget and prioritize.

The research offers fresh insight into how industry organizations are implementing AI, what they’re prioritizing and what’s standing in the way of broader success. Based on proprietary research with professionals across the insurance industry, the report reveals how different types of organizations are navigating this next phase of transformation.

Key takeaways include:

* Where companies are finding the most value from their AI investments — and where results are falling short
* What’s driving organizations to move faster and what’s holding others back
* How generative AI is reshaping the conversation around customer experience
* What companies are spending now and how that’s expected to shift in the year ahead

“AI investments are already paying off, particularly for firms that have implemented them aggressively to improve efficiency,” says Janet King, SVP, Content Strategy, Research at Arizent, parent company of Digital Insurance. “At this point in the adoption curve, the most advanced companies appear to see more opportunities to reap positive returns, suggesting those at the leading edge could remain in that position for some time.”

The data indicates nearly all organizations expect their AI spending to increase to some extent over the next 12 months. Only a few companies expect their spending to remain level or decrease. Organizations that trail their peers will need to accelerate their strategies as much as possible or risk falling further behind as early adopters continue to expand their capabilities.
