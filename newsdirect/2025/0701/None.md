# Esteemed Public Relations Professional Cindy Schutt Announces Retirement After a Storied Career

After a distinguished career spanning nearly four decades in public relations, Cindy Schutt is retiring, leaving behind a legacy of impactful storytelling, strategic communications, and dedicated community leadership.

For nearly a decade, Schutt has been the driving force behind the public relations and media strategy for Van Horn Law Group, P.A., in addition to her nonprofit work for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County and Lighthouse of Broward.

During her tenure as public relations consultant for Van Horn Law Group, her expertise has been instrumental in elevating the profile of both Van Horn Law Group and its founder, Chad Van Horn. Her unwavering support and mentorship have been foundational to the firm’s growth, public visibility, and national recognition.

“None of this happens without Cindy,” said Van Horn. “She has been more than a PR consultant – she’s been a trusted advisor, a mentor, and the architect of our firm’s public voice. Every story told about me, every award, even my appearance as Player 286 on Squid Game: The Challenge – Cindy played a role. She believed in me before the rest of the world noticed.”

Cindy said it was easy to believe in Chad.

"Chad is one of the most innovative people I’ve ever met,” she said. “Not only does his mind bubble with ideas, but he goes out on a limb to put them into action. Squid Game is a perfect example, as well as his run for Fort Lauderdale City Commission and his upcoming appointment as adjunct professor at University of Florida’s Levin College of Law. He does all this with heart, commitment and dedication, which is exactly how he serves his clients. It has been an honor to work with Chad and Van Horn Law Group.”

Van Horn noted that Schutt’s strategic guidance helped secure him numerous professional honors and awards, while also shaping the Van Horn Law Group’s brand as a compassionate and effective legal resource. Her behind-the-scenes work not only built media relationships but also helped position Chad as a national legal thought leader and advocate for consumer debt relief.

Throughout her career, Schutt has made an indelible mark in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors, generating hundreds of news stories in top-tier media outlets and establishing herself as a go-to resource for journalists. Cindy, who owned and operated her own firm for the last 20+ years, started in the public relations industry at Bitner Laurenti & Pierson, under the tutelage of Gary Bitner, Lynn Laurenti and Maria Pierson. Both Bitner and Pierson continue to run successful South Florida public relations firms.

A proud University of Florida Gator with a bachelor’s degree in journalism, Cindy has long been a pillar of the South Florida civic community. Her extensive service with the Leadership Broward Foundation, including a term as Board Chair, exemplifies her passion for community development, mentorship, and public service.

As she begins her well-deserved retirement, Cindy’s presence will be deeply missed by colleagues, clients, and journalists who have relied on her insight and professionalism.

“Cindy’s legacy isn’t just written in headlines – it’s felt in the lives she’s touched,” said Van Horn. “She made us better communicators, better professionals, and better people. Working with her has been one of the great privileges of my career.”

Ranked among the top bankruptcy firms in the country by number of cases filed, Van Horn Law Group is led by founding partner Chad Van Horn, a recognized authority on bankruptcy and the author of Everything You Need to Know About Bankruptcy and The Debt Life.
