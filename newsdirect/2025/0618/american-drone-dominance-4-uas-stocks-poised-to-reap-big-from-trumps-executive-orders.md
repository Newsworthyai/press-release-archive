# American Drone Dominance: 4 UAS Stocks Poised To Reap Big From Trump’s Executive Orders

On June 6, President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at bolstering the nation’s drone defense capabilities and aviation innovation, fueling unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or drone stocks' momentum.

Highlights of the executive orders included the expanded use of drones beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) by removing key regulatory hurdles that had restricted the use of drones beyond the operator’s line of sight. For a long time, that restriction had been a barrier to drone deployments in commercial and security operations.

The executive orders further mandated a reduction in the country’s reliance on Chinese drone technology by requiring a gradual phase-out of Chinese drones and components across all US government agencies following national security concerns. Going forward, federal agencies would be expected to shift procurement toward domestically produced drone systems as the country secures its supply chains and seeks to grow the US drone economy.

Furthermore, the orders tackled the growing challenge of unauthorized and potentially dangerous drones, aiming to protect critical infrastructure, public events, and sensitive government sites. A new task force will be created to oversee and improve counter-UAS strategies, ensuring coordinated efforts across federal, state, and local agencies.

With these new executive orders in place, America’s race to become the dominant player in the drone industry just got a major boost, which bodes well for a number of domestic UAS developers.

For instance, ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) announced that its subsidiary ZenaDrone was going to file a patent and accelerate the deployment of Counter-UAS technology to be mounted on the company’s flagship ZenaDrone 1000 drone platform.

By leveraging AI and machine learning, ZenaTech aims to establish itself as a key domestic player that offers continuous, autonomous verification of drones, both on-premise and in global airspace, to mitigate drone threats.

For context, Counter-UAS technology is used to detect drones in specific airspaces and possesses the capability to track their path as well as the location of the pilot, providing airspace situational awareness to the operator. When the Counter-UAS system identifies a drone signature, it will allow the operator to designate it either as friendly or enemy while leaving authorized drones to continue functioning without interruption.

The addressable market for this technology is substantial. According to research from Precedence Research, the global Counter-UAS market size is estimated at $2.97 billion in 2025 and is expected to be worth around $26.26 billion by 2034, accelerating at a CAGR of 27.52% over the period.

Zena Drone's counter-UAS technology was originally designed last year but was placed on hold as the company prioritized other commercial and defense applications. However, the recent policy directive on Counter-UAS contained in the White House Executive Order has clarified the urgency and importance of bringing effective drone defense solutions to market. In response, ZenaDrone is accelerating development and commercialization efforts to meet growing domestic and international demand.

“We developed our Counter-UAS system with future threats in mind, and the executive order has made it clear that the time to act is now,” said Dr. Shaun Passley, CEO of ZenaTech. “Integrating this technology into the ZenaDrone 1000 positions us to meet urgent security needs with a smart, autonomous aerial defense platform and be considered a provider of safe, trusted, and mission-ready solutions.”

ZENA’s path to commercializing Counter-UAS technology could be much smoother compared to other players based on its existing relationship with the DoD. Previously, the company completed paid trials with both the US Airforce and US Naval Research using its drones for carrying critical cargo.

Furthermore, ZenaTech signed Blue Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) compliant partner agreements for its supply chain to sell its ZenaDrone 1000 AI drone solutions to US Defense branches and to NATO forces.

Draganfly Inc. (NASDAQ:DPRO) develops quality, cutting-edge drone solutions, software, and AI systems that revolutionize how organizations can do business. The company has emerged as one of the key beneficiaries of Trump’s executive orders following its recent selection by the Cochise County Sheriff’s Department to support a new drone pilot program aimed at enhancing surveillance and operations along the southern border.

The Cochise County Sheriff’s Department is recognized nationally for its innovative use of technology in law enforcement, previously garnering commendations and visits from President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Under this new pilot program, the department will deploy the Draganfly family of drones for extended border surveillance, quick-response missions, and nighttime operations

The southern border is one of America’s most critical national security frontiers, and the department believes that the partnership with Draganfly will usher in the next phase of smart border enforcement.

That partnership follows an earlier announcement of the first deliveries of Draganfly’s revolutionary Flex FPV (First Person View) systems under an order from a major U.S. military prime contractor supporting land systems operations for allied forces.

Draganfly continues to experience growing demand across defense and public safety sectors as organizations seek trusted, North American-developed UAS platforms capable of adapting to the evolving realities of modern warfare.

The company recently closed its previously announced $13.75 million public offering, further reaffirming investor confidence in the stock. Draganfly currently intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund its capabilities to meet demand for its new products, including potential acquisitions and research and development.

Unusual Machines, Inc. (NYSE:UMAC), a US manufacturer of drones and NDAA-compliant components, also appears well positioned to capitalize on America’s quest to become a leader in the development, commercialization, and export of unmanned aerial systems.

Earlier this month, the company announced it had signed a lease for a 17,000-square-foot drone motor production facility in Orlando, Florida, with the intention of significantly expanding the company's domestic manufacturing capabilities. This factory marks a major milestone in UMAC’s strategy to rapidly onshore drone component manufacturing and solve one of the major pain points in the American drone supply chain.

The facility is designed to support the production of high-performance brushless motors for first-person view (FPV) and commercial drones. According to its design, it will eventually scale to monthly production volumes exceeding 50,000 motors.

Unusual Machines is pursuing a dual-sourcing strategy for critical components such as magnets, bearings, and stators to insulate against supply chain disruptions. The company will offer both made-in-USA and globally sourced motor variants to meet different regulatory and customer needs.

On June 12, the company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rotor Lab, an Australian developer and manufacturer of electric motors and propulsion systems for unmanned aerial systems, in an all-stock deal valued at $7 million. These motors will be among the first to enter production at Unusual Machines’ new U.S.-based motor factory in Orlando, Florida, which is expected to begin operations in September.

Red Cat (NASDAQ:RCAT) issued a statement in support of the executive orders from the White House seeking to advance U.S. leadership in UAS and reinforce the resilience of America’s domestic industrial base.

Red Cat reiterated that it remains ready to meet this moment with its proven, electric vertical takeoff and landing systems that utilize advanced AI and computer vision solutions from partners including Palantir, Palladyne AI, Athena AI, and Primordial Labs.

The company’s Black Widow drone, a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) designed for short-range reconnaissance (SRR) missions, has already made significant inroads with the DoD. The DoD cleared Red Cat's military-grade sUAS in 2023, designating it as a Blue UAS.

The system, which was selected for the U.S. Army’s SRR Program of Record contract, provides military operators with improved situational awareness, autonomous capabilities, and rugged performance in contested environments.

Earlier this year, the company announced it had secured new orders totaling $518,000 for its Edge 130 drone system for the U.S. Army National Guard and another government agency. The drone is part of Red Cat's family of low-cost, portable, unmanned reconnaissance and precision lethal strike systems, and the orders further validate the performance and unique capabilities of the system.
