# American Battery Materials Announces Expansion of Strategic Focus to Include Magnesium Recovery at Utah’s Paradox Basin

American Battery Materials, Inc. (OTC PINK: BLTH) ("ABM"), a U.S.-based company dedicated to advancing critical mineral resource development, today announced that it is expanding its strategic extraction efforts beyond lithium to include magnesium recovery at its flagship project in Utah’s Paradox Basin.

The Paradox Basin resource—already recognized for its lithium concentrations—also contains high levels of Magnesium. ABM’s mineral rights cover 743 claims across 14,260 acres, offering a unique opportunity to co-extract lithium and magnesium using advanced Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) techniques.

“Expanding our efforts to recover magnesium is a natural progression of our mission to support the U.S. energy transition,” said David E. Graber, CEO of American Battery Materials. “With demand for lightweight metals growing across the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries, developing a domestic magnesium supply chain is vital for national competitiveness and sustainability.”

Magnesium, recently identified as a critical material by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, is essential in a variety of high-growth sectors, including electric vehicles, electronics, biodegradable medical implants, and lightweight structural components.

ABM’s DLE-based approach is designed to efficiently recover both lithium and magnesium with minimal environmental impact. The company’s closed-loop extraction system returns the majority of extracted brine to its source, significantly reducing land usage and eliminating the need for open-pit mining or evaporation ponds.
