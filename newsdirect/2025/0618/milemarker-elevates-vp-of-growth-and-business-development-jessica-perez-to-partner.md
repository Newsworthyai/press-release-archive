# Milemarker Elevates VP of Growth and Business Development Jessica Perez to Partner

Milemarker, the technology platform revolutionizing how RIAs, Broker-Dealers, Family Offices, and Private Equity firms scale with confidence, today announced the promotion of Jessica Perez to Partner. Since joining in June, Perez has been a driving force behind the company’s growth—sharpening the go-to-market strategy, strengthening national business development, and positioning Milemarker as the definitive operating system for advisory firms.

A 20-year financial services veteran, Perez has expanded Milemarker’s reach through bold sales leadership and innovative top-of-funnel execution—from conferences and webinars to digital strategy and brand positioning. Her strategic lens and executional discipline have further cemented Milemarker’s role as the go-to solution for firms seeking clarity, control, and scale in their data and operations.

“Jessica is a force in our industry,” said Jud Mackrill, Co-Founder & CEO of Milemarker. “She has the rare ability to lead as a strategist and deliver like an operator. Elevating her to Partner was not only well-earned—it positions us to scale even faster, with deeper conviction and impact.”

Prior to Milemarker, Perez held senior leadership roles at Carson Group, where she helped raise over $6 billion in assets and onboarded more than 50 advisors and RIA offices. She also founded a successful consulting practice, advising firms on sales enablement, advisor recruiting, and leadership development.

“Milemarker is reimagining what it means to operate a modern wealth management firm,” said Perez. “I’m honored to step into this new role alongside a team that’s committed to pushing the industry forward. What we’re building isn’t just tech—it’s the future infrastructure for wealth management.”
