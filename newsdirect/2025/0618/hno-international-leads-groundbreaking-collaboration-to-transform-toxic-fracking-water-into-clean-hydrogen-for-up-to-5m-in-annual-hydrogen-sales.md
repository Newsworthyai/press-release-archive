# HNO International Leads Groundbreaking Collaboration to Transform Toxic Fracking Water Into Clean Hydrogen for up to $5M in Annual Hydrogen Sales

HNO International, Inc. (OTC: HNOI), a leader in clean hydrogen innovation, is proud to announce a strategic collaboration with three pioneering companies to achieve a world-first: converting toxic fracking wastewater—one of the most environmentally damaging byproducts of oil and gas production—into clean, usable hydrogen.

The initiative brings together:

* An oil and gas operator in Texas providing the supply of toxic fracking water.
* Q3 Power, whose proprietary thermal technology transforms the wastewater into clean, distilled water by vaporizing and condensing it.
* Enapter, a German-based technology leader in modular AEM electrolyzers that convert distilled water into hydrogen using electricity. Clean H2, Enapter’s exclusive US distributor, is supporting the deployment of this advanced technology.
* HNO International, the architect of the collaboration, integrating the technologies into a single clean energy value chain, managing hydrogen production and dispensing infrastructure.

Fracking water—used in hydraulic fracturing to extract oil—becomes irreversibly toxic due to chemical additives and subsurface contaminants. Traditionally, this wastewater is disposed of in deep injection wells, a method that is fraught with environmental risks and concerns about long-term groundwater contamination.

The initial site is designed to produce up to 1,500 kg of hydrogen per day, which translates into potential annual hydrogen sales of up to $5 million.

The partnership’s vision is transformative: convert one of the most toxic substances on Earth into a clean energy carrier that can help power the planet.

“From pollution to power—that’s the story we’re telling,” said Don Owens, Chairman and CEO of HNO International. “We’re taking water that traditionally can’t be reused, recycled, or safely disposed of, and turning it into hydrogen, a clean, zero-emission fuel. It’s the kind of environmental turnaround the world needs more of.”

The process begins with Q3 Power’s steam-based system, which isolates and condenses fracking water into distilled form, leaving behind a concentrated, potentially recoverable residue. This clean water is then passed to Enapter’s cutting-edge electrolyzers to produce high-purity green hydrogen. HNOI orchestrates the integration of these systems, managing the infrastructure and logistics necessary for full-scale hydrogen production and delivery.

This landmark collaboration represents a convergence of environmental responsibility, advanced engineering, and visionary leadership—proving that even the most problematic industrial waste can become part of the clean energy solution.

“Every gallon of toxic wastewater we treat is a gallon of clean hydrogen potential,” Owens added. “This partnership exemplifies the circular economy in action and sets the stage for global replication.”
