The Surety & Fidelity Association of America (SFAA), a nonprofit, nonpartisan trade association representing all segments of the surety and fidelity industry, held its 117th Annual Meeting this past week, an event focused on advancing the industry’s future.

SFAA Chair Mike Keimig, President & CEO of Markel Surety, and SFAA President & CEO Ryan Work highlighted the critical role of collaboration, innovation, and sustained engagement in capitalizing on opportunities within today’s dynamic marketplace. They also outlined a forward-looking vision for the association, aimed at increasing impact by leveraging new staff expertise, enhanced data analytics, research capabilities, and emerging technologies.

SFAA members were also on hand to recognize the achievements and leadership of several individuals and organizations:
