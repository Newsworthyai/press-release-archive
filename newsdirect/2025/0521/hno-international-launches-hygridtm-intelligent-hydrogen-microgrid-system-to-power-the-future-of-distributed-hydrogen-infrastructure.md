# HNO International Launches HyGrid™: Intelligent Hydrogen Microgrid System to Power the Future of Distributed Hydrogen Infrastructure

HNO International, Inc. (OTC: HNOI), a leading innovator in hydrogen-based clean energy solutions, proudly announces the launch of HyGrid™, its next-generation, intelligent hydrogen microgrid system. Purpose-built to deliver clean, uninterrupted, off-grid electricity, HyGrid will also serve as the foundational platform for a globally distributed hydrogen infrastructure — enabling hydrogen production, storage, and refueling virtually anywhere.

HyGrid combines solar energy, hydrogen storage, advanced electrolyzers, AI-driven controls, and fuel cell backup into one seamless, modular system. With capacities ranging from 10kW micro-units to multi-megawatt deployments, HyGrid™ provides 24/7, zero-emission power even in the most remote or energy-challenged regions.

“HyGrid isn’t just a power system — it’s the cornerstone of a decentralized hydrogen future,” said Don Owens, Chairman and CEO of HNO International. “By embedding hydrogen generation and storage into the energy fabric of communities, industries, and nations, HyGrid enables a cleaner, more resilient energy ecosystem — site by site, region by region.”

Key Features of HyGrid™* Anywhere & Everywhere Power – Delivers reliable energy independent of the grid, with solar-hydrogen hybrid architecture for 24/7 operation.
* Foundation for Distributed Hydrogen Infrastructure – Each HyGrid deployment becomes a local node for hydrogen generation, storage, and future refueling.
* AI-Driven Energy Management System (EMS) – Enables predictive maintenance, load balancing, real-time analytics, and optimized energy flow.
* Fuel Cell Backup & Optional Battery Storage – Provides uninterrupted power during demand surges or low sunlight periods.
* Customizable & Scalable – Supports applications from rural electrification and critical infrastructure to military bases and smart cities.

Building the Hydrogen Economy from the Ground UpWith HyGrid, HNOI envisions a new hydrogen economy built from the ground up — distributed, modular, and resilient. Each system serves as a self-contained hydrogen production and power unit, reducing dependency on centralized grids and fossil fuels. As more HyGrid units are deployed across regions, they collectively form a networked infrastructure capable of fueling transport fleets, industrial facilities, emergency services, and even hydrogen-based commerce.

“HyGrid enables a future where hydrogen isn’t just produced at a few massive plants — it’s generated locally, cleanly, and economically, everywhere people need power,” Owens added. “This is the blueprint for energy independence.”

HNO International (OTC: HNOI) develops scalable, intelligent hydrogen energy systems that power the future of clean, distributed infrastructure. With over 15 years of hydrogen R&D and 19 U.S. patents, HNOI delivers pioneering technologies including the Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform (SHEP™), Compact Hydrogen Refueling Station (CHRS™), and the newly launched HyGrid™ system — all designed to accelerate the global shift to sustainable energy.
