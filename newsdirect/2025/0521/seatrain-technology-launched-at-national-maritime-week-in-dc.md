# SeaTrain Technology Launched at National Maritime Week in DC

SeaTrainTM Technology, LLC, a pioneer in sustainable maritime solutions, announced the launch of its patented technology to revitalize the US maritime industry. The design, construction, and application of the SeaTrainTM approach solves shipbuilding challenges, mariner shortages, weather impacts and more. The announcement was made at the “Revitalizing the US Maritime Industry” event during National Maritime Week in Washington, DC.

SeaTrainTM's gliders are innovative, modular submersible cargo vessels powered by a patented variable buoyancy propulsion technology for commercial, energy and defense applications. This unique system allows gliders to move quietly underwater without engines, fuel, or emissions. Their autonomous, unmanned operation eliminates crew costs and enhances safety. The modular nature enables automotive-style mass production in shipyards, allowing rapid scaling to fulfill national strategic objectives.

This innovative technology, currently under review at the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for its New Technology Qualification (NTQ), aims to transform ocean freight transportation by offering unparalleled efficiency, profitability, reliability, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, it has extensive applications in the energy and defense industries.

Randy M. Durst, Founder and Chairman of SeaTrain Technology, commented, “As we embark on this journey to redefine maritime shipbuilding and cargo transportation, we are encouraged by the attention and interest we have received from commercial interests as well as our defense colleagues. This technology is a game-changer for maritime interests”.

“The political and strategic implications of this technology cannot be overstated,” claimed SeaTrain Technology CEO Carleen Lyden Walker. “The maritime agenda is critical to our nation’s future prosperity. SeaTrain gliders are the solution for shipyard modernization, global innovation, mariner shortages and reallocation, and economic security. This is how we are going to restore America’s maritime dominance.”

SeaTrain Technology, established in 2023 and headquartered in Boynton Beach, Florida, is on a mission to revolutionize the shipping, energy, and defense sectors through its patented submersible glider technology. The company’s core values—innovation, sustainability, efficiency, and safety—are at the forefront of its operations, aiming to set new standards in performance and streamline shipbuilding and operations.
