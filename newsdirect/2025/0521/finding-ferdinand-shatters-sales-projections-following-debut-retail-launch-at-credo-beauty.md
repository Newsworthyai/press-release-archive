# Finding Ferdinand Shatters Sales Projections Following Debut Retail Launch at Credo Beauty

Finding Ferdinand, the sister-run brand on a mission to elevate your everyday routine with vegan, skin-loving formulas, is shattering sales projections just two months into the brand’s retail debut with Credo Beauty. In March 2025, the clean beauty brand launched online on credobeauty.com and rolled out to 14 Credo Beauty stores nationwide.

Finding Ferdinand has far exceeded expectations since launching at Credo Beauty. Within just two months of the retail launch, the brand surpassed sales forecasts by an impressive triple digits. Additionally, Finding Ferdinand’s viral black lip balm was one of the top selling products during the Friends of Credo sale.

Credo Beauty’s Senior Color Merchant, Meghan Lim, praised the brand as “Best in Class” for its exceptional launch performance at the retailer.“It’s been incredibly exciting to see Finding Ferdinand on shelves at Credo Beauty — a huge milestone for us. We’re absolutely ecstatic about the success so far, and this is just the beginning. Credo Beauty has been such a thoughtful and supportive partner, truly aligned with our values. Together, we’re keeping the momentum going by creating thoughtful in-store events and developing products and colors we know our customers will use and love,” said Nhu Le, Founder of Finding Ferdinand.

Founded in 2015 by Nhu Le and now run alongside her sister, My Le, Finding Ferdinand celebrates its 10-year anniversary this year, marking a decade of innovation in color cosmetics. Nhu and My’s inspiration for the brand came from the incredible women in their family, especially their mother, a two-time cancer survivor whose strength continues to inspire the brand’s deep commitment to clean formulas.

Finding Ferdinand products are 100% vegan and cruelty-free, offering proprietary cosmetic formulations that are clean and non-toxic. Finding Ferdinand takes to heart being a part of creating a better future for the world, and is committed to keeping the brand’s production sustainable - from working in small batches to prioritizing recyclable, recycled, or refillable components.
