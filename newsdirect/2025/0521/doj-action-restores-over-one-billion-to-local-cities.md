# DOJ ACTION RESTORES OVER ONE BILLION TO LOCAL CITIES

Modern Fortis applauds President Donald J. Trump’s Department of Justice for today’s decision to dismiss unfounded lawsuits in Kentucky and Minnesota along with action to dismiss six other pre-consent-decree investigations.

“Law enforcement has watched the Federal Consent Decree program devolve into a billion-dollar taxpayer funded for profit enterprise,” stated Joe Cameron, President of Modern Fortis. “Today the DOJ facilitated the largest re-investment of local tax dollars in local control and local public safety policing programs, ever. With an estimated lifetime cost of $100-300 million per jurisdiction, the math in these eight cities speaks for itself.”

Modern Fortis proudly represents the United Coalition of Public Safety (UCOPS) and tens of thousands of dedicated law enforcement professionals nationwide. Together with our trusted partners and allies, we are leading a national effort to engage the Department of Justice in reshaping the Federal Consent Decree process—ensuring it delivers fairness, efficiency, and accountability.

Our mission is clear: to end systemic imbalances, correct inefficiencies, and return local resources from the hands of a few to the communities they are meant to serve. These are not temporary adjustments—we are driving changes built to stand the test of time.

Law enforcement groups, agencies, and associations are encouraged to contact the Modern Fortis team to join the fight for public safety and accountability.
