# NeuroSense Therapeutics is on Verge of Potential Blockbuster Pharma Deal as ALS Drug Shows 58% Survival Improvement

NeuroSense Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NRSN)* is in active discussions with a global pharmaceutical giant for what CEO Alon Ben-Noon calls a potentially "transformative" partnership that could catapult the company's groundbreaking ALS therapy toward commercialization, according to a shareholder letter released today.

The binding term sheet announced in December has progressed to advanced discussions for a "multinational partnership" that could deliver significant upfront capital and fully fund the upcoming Phase 3 trial. While initially expected to close in Q1, the complex deal's extended timeline suggests substantial terms are being negotiated, with Ben-Noon expressing optimism about an agreement that would mark "a true inflection point" for the company.

Previous neurodegenerative disease partnerships have generated substantial value for biotech companies. GSK's 2021 deal with Alector included $700 million upfront and up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments, while Biogen's 2020 Denali partnership involved $560 million upfront with $1.125 billion in potential milestones. In 2024, Eli Lilly licensed QurAlis's preclinical ALS therapy for $45 million upfront plus up to $577 million in milestones—highlighting the pharmaceutical industry's willingness to invest heavily in promising neurological treatments.

Investors have compelling reasons to watch NeuroSense closely as multiple catalysts approach. PrimeC, the company's novel ALS treatment, delivered remarkable Phase 2b results showing a 33% slowing of disease progression (p=0.007) and an impressive 58% improvement in survival rates compared to placebo. These potentially game-changing outcomes position PrimeC as one of the most promising ALS therapies in development.

The company's dual-track commercialization strategy adds near-term revenue potential to its long-term pipeline value. While advancing toward a global Phase 3 trial set to begin in H2 2025, NeuroSense is simultaneously pursuing fast-track approval in Canada through a special regulatory pathway designed for life-threatening conditions with limited treatment options. Commercial forecasts project potential Canadian sales of $100-150 million annually—potentially providing significant revenue while the larger global program advances.

Recent scientific validation came this month at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where distinguished neurologists presented biomarker data confirming PrimeC's mechanism of action in targeting multiple disease pathways simultaneously.

PrimeC's approach combines two FDA-approved drugs (ciprofloxacin and celecoxib) in a novel formulation designed to attack ALS through multiple pathways—inflammation, iron accumulation, and RNA regulation—giving it potential advantages over single-target therapies. The drug has received coveted Orphan Drug Designation from both US and European regulators.

The ALS treatment landscape represents a significant commercial opportunity, with over 30,000 patients in the US and Europe and approximately 5,000 new diagnoses annually in the US alone. With limited effective treatments currently available, successful therapies command premium pricing and substantial market share.

Upcoming catalysts include Canadian regulatory progress, potential partnership announcement, and Phase 3 initiation in the second half of 2025—each representing potential value-driving events for shareholders.

For investors seeking exposure to late-stage neurodegenerative disease treatments with multiple near-term catalysts, NeuroSense's progress on both the pharmaceutical partnership and regulatory fronts presents a compelling opportunity to watch closely in the coming months.
