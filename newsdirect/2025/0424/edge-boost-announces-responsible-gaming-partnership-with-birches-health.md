# EDGE Boost Announces Responsible Gaming Partnership with Birches Health

EDGE Boost by EDGE Markets, one of the first debit card products designed specifically to support responsible gaming., today announced its partnership with Birches Health, a behavioral healthcare organization specializing in gambling disorder prevention and treatment. This partnership signifies yet another layer of protection for those gambling using EDGE Boost, a debit card built for more responsible gaming activities.

Through the partnership, Birches Health will provide Responsible Gambling content on the EDGE Boost app and website, prompting all users to make safe and responsible decisions while gambling. Additionally, direct links to the Birches Health website and immediate access to clinicians will be just a few clicks away from the EDGE Boost app. Birches Health will use idPair technology to anonymize EDGE Boost user data for analysis and input for responsible gambling research and technology.

"Our mission has always been to provide a safer and more responsible environment for users to engage with gambling,” said Seni Thomas, Founder and CEO of EDGE Boost. “Partnering with Birches Health allows us to take that commitment further, and provide immediate access to expert resources and education at the moments our users need them.”

EDGE Boost redefines responsible gaming with a dedicated debit card and bank account, allowing bettors to separate their gaming transactions from everyday finances. By providing a clear, consolidated view of their betting bankroll, EDGE Boost empowers users to make more informed financial decisions.

“At Birches Health, we share the same vision as the EDGE Boost team: make the gaming experience all around safer for those who partake,” said Elliott Rapaport, Founder of Birches Health. “Treatment options and educational content are now easily accessible to anyone using EDGE Boost. We are taking steps to build a more sustainable and responsible gaming industry in the U.S.”

EDGE Boost announced its official launch in March of this year, after operating in stealth mode for three months. To date, EDGE Boost has raised over $17.2 million and processed over $450 million in transactions.
