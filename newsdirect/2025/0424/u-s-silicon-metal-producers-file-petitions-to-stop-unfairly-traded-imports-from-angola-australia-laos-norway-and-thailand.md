# U.S. Silicon Metal Producers File Petitions to Stop Unfairly Traded Imports from Angola, Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand

Ferroglobe USA, Inc. (“Ferroglobe”) and Mississippi Silicon LLC (“Mississippi Silicon”), representing all American silicon metal production, today filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) and U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) asking both agencies to investigate unfairly priced and subsidized silicon metal imports from Angola, Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand that are causing material injury to U.S. industry.

Silicon metal is a highly refined raw material composed almost entirely of elemental silicon. Silicon metal is critical to the production of multiple products related to national security, including aluminum, silicones, and polysilicon, which is then used in semiconductor, solar, and electronics applications.

The antidumping and countervailing duty petitions detail unfair trade practices to sell silicon metal at less than fair value and allege dumping margins of up to 337.84%, as well as numerous subsidies. The petitions detail the extensive injury suffered by the U.S. industry and its workers, and request relief in the form of special duties on all associated imports.

“Dumped and subsidized imports from these countries have undercut the U.S. industry, its workers, and the marketplace, resulting in lower volumes and prices for domestic producers,” said Marco Levi, Chief Executive Officer of Ferroglobe PLC. “A successful outcome in these cases is key to the continued viability for domestic production of this critical material.”

“American silicon metal producers can compete with anyone in the world, but these imports are not playing by the rules and are devastating the domestic industry and its workers as a result,” said Eddie Boardwine, Chief Executive Office of Mississippi Silicon. “However, our country’s trade laws are there to defend American manufacturing when faced with unfair trade. On behalf of our employees, customers, and community, we look forward to seeing those laws enforced and a return to fair competition in the U.S. market.”

The cases filed today cover all forms and sizes of silicon metal, which contains at least 85.00 percent but less than 99.99 percent silicon, and less than 4.00 percent iron, by actual weight.

The next steps in these investigations will be the initiation of Commerce’s antidumping and countervailing duty investigations by May 14, 2025. A preliminary ITC determination is expected by June 9, 2025.
