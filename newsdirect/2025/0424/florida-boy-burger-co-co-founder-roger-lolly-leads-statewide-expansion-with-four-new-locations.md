# Florida Boy Burger Co. Co-Founder Roger Lolly Leads Statewide Expansion with Four New Locations

Florida Boy Burger Co., the Old-Florida–themed fast-casual concept that has become a local sensation on the Gulf Coast, today announced an ambitious growth plan spearheaded by co-founder and hospitality veteran Roger Lolly. Building on breakout success in Fort Myers and Cape Coral, the company is aiming to open four additional restaurants this year in Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, and North Port, bringing its signature blend of Florida nostalgia, farm-fresh ingredients, and community-driven hospitality to diners across the state.

“Florida Boy Burger was born from our love for the Sunshine State—its history, its wildlife, and, of course, its incredible local produce,” said Roger Lolly, co-founder and head of concept development. “With every new restaurant we open, we get to tell a slice of Florida’s story through design, flavor, and genuine southern hospitality. Expanding north and east lets us share that story with millions more Floridians and visitors alike.”

The upcoming locations will mirror the brand’s immersive atmosphere, complete with reclaimed cypress bars, antique postcards, and taxidermy displays that celebrate the Everglades and the Gulf. Each restaurant will feature a 2,800-square-foot dining room, an outdoor patio, and the company’s trademark 500-gallon freshwater tank housing live baby alligators—an educational partnership with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission that teaches conservation while delighting guests.

Florida Boy Burger’s scratch menu centers on 100 percent chuck-and-brisket patties, hand-pressed daily and topped with region-inspired flavors such as Key lime aioli, fried plantains, and citrus-maple bacon. A new supply agreement with a cooperative of Panhandle cattle ranchers will enable the chain to introduce fully Florida-raised beef in every market by Q4 2025. Complementing the burger lineup are locally sourced specialties like gator bites, frog legs, and the ever-popular swamp fries smothered in house-made datil-pepper cheese sauce.

Co-founder and CFO Louis Cioffi highlighted the economic impact of the rollout: “Each restaurant represents roughly a $1.6 million investment and will create 35 to 40 jobs ranging from line cooks to general managers. We’re also building a centralized training hub in Fort Myers to keep quality high as we scale.”

Florida Boy Burger’s momentum has attracted interest from regional developers and franchise investors. While the company remains privately held, Lolly confirmed management is exploring strategic partnerships to accelerate expansion beyond state lines in 2026. “Our near-term focus is Florida,” he said, “but we see a clear runway into neighboring Southeastern markets that appreciate bold flavors and strong storytelling.”

Community engagement remains core to the brand’s identity. Through its “Burgers for the Bay” initiative, the company donates a portion of sales each Earth Day to Everglades restoration nonprofits and hosts monthly clean-ups of local waterways. “If we’re celebrating Florida’s beauty, we have to help preserve it,” Lolly added.
