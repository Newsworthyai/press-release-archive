# Exhibition Dedicated to the Lord of Sipán Showcases Peru’s Extraordinary Cultural Legacy at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai

The Commission for the Promotion of Peru (PROMPERÚ) has announced that the Peru Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai is captivating international audiences with its temporary exhibition titled “The Mochicas, Sovereigns of the Desert.” Visitors have the opportunity to view replicas of the Lord of Sipán's and the Old Lord of Sipán’s jewelry, meticulously crafted by artisans from the Lambayeque region. The exhibit also features a life-sized representation of the Mochica ruler, along with valuable historical information.

This exhibition is the result of a collaborative effort between PROMPERÚ and the Sipán Board of Trustees, a non-profit organization committed to the research, preservation, and promotion of northern Peru’s archaeological heritage. It aims to highlight the extraordinary treasures discovered in the tomb of the Lord of Sipán—considered one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century.

To convey the spirit and impressive development of the Mochica culture, the exhibit includes two mannequins created by renowned artist Edilberto Mérida Pilares, based on the facial features of the Mochica people's modern-day descendants.

Notably, it is the descendants of this cultural heritage who have faithfully recreated the royal court’s ornaments and ceremonial objects. Lambayeque artisans Armando Gil, Segundo Gonzales, and Johnny Aldana have carefully crafted stunning replicas of Mochica jewelry, allowing the exhibition to present historical figures of the elite richly adorned to reflect their power and status.

Peru’s past is represented through the remarkable Mochica civilization and its masterful goldsmithing, while the present is embodied by the people who continue to keep this heritage alive through art and memory. By showcasing this glorious legacy at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai—the world’s premier cultural event—Peru not only honors its past but also strengthens its national identity and looks toward the future.

Under the theme “Infinite Possibilities,” the Peru Pavilion shares with the world the country’s cultural, historical, and natural richness through a presentation that blends tradition, innovation, and sustainability. The renowned travel, culture, and tourism publication Time Out visited Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai and selected its top five international pavilions. Peru was among the top five, along with Canada, the United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, and the Netherlands.
