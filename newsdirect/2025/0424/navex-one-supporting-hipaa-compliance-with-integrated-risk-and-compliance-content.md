# NAVEX One: Supporting HIPAA Compliance with Integrated Risk and Compliance Content

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management solutions, offers healthcare organizations the tools they need to meet rigorous data privacy and security requirements. As the regulatory environment grows increasingly complex, NAVEX announces that NAVEX One now delivers centralized policy management, employee training, and risk assessment solutions aligned with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) enabling simplified compliance.

HIPAA establishes national standards to safeguard sensitive patient health information. To avoid costly penalties and protect patient trust, covered entities must adopt comprehensive administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. NAVEX One has long supported these efforts, offering content and capabilities that streamline compliance and strengthen privacy and security programs.

“HIPAA compliance is a cornerstone of trust in healthcare. Organizations need a partner that not only helps them check the boxes but also actively supports their broader privacy and risk mitigation goals,” said A.G. Lambert, Chief Product Officer at NAVEX. “NAVEX One equips healthcare compliance professionals with the tools to develop sustainable, defensible programs that protect patient data and reduce regulatory risk.”

NAVEX One empowers healthcare organizations to:

* Centralize and maintain privacy and security policies aligned to HIPAA.
* Train employees on HIPAA fundamentals and emerging risks.
* Assess risk and implement appropriate safeguards.
* Prepare for audits and investigations with robust documentation.
* Demonstrate ongoing compliance with automated tracking and reporting.

By delivering these capabilities in a unified platform, NAVEX One streamlines HIPAA compliance, reduces administrative burden, and supports a proactive, organization-wide approach to privacy and risk management.

“HIPAA requirements touch every part of an organization—from workforce training to incident reporting,” said Kyle Martin, Vice President of Risk Governance at NAVEX. “NAVEX One brings it all together in one auditable platform, giving healthcare leaders confidence they’re meeting requirements while building a strong company culture.”
