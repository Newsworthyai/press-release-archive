# Robertson Stephens Named Amongst USA Today’s Best Financial Advisory Firms for Third Consecutive Year

Robertson Stephens Wealth Management, LLC (“Robertson Stephens”), a national boutique wealth management firm that manages more than $7 billion in client assets, has been named as one of USA Today’s Best Financial Advisory Firms in 2025. This is the third year in a row Robertson Stephens has been selected as a leading financial advisory firm.

“We’re honored yet again to be recognized by USA Today as one of the Best Financial Advisory Firms,” said Raj Bhattacharyya, Chief Executive Officer of Robertson Stephens. “This acknowledgment speaks to our unwavering focus on delivering thoughtful, customized wealth strategies with consistency and personalized care. In an environment marked by uncertainty, partnering with a trusted registered investment advisor has never been more important. The team at Robertson Stephens remains deeply committed to helping our clients gain clarity and confidence in their financial futures by delivering strategies tailored to their goals and priorities.”

While all U.S. firms were eligible, only 500 scored high enough to earn a spot in the final ranking. Robertson Stephens is excited to be ranked in the top 20 firms nationwide and in the top 5 in its assets under management subcategory.

USA Today and Statista’s Best Financial Advisory Firms 2025 list recognizes the top registered investment advisory (RIA) firms in the U.S. based on two key criteria: recommendations from clients, financial advisors, and industry experts, and growth in assets under management (AUM) over both the short term (12 months) and long term (5 years). More than 30,000 individuals participated in an independent survey to identify exceptional firms. The ranking was developed in collaboration with Statista, a leading provider of market and consumer data.

Earlier this year, Robertson Stephens launched a family office designed to serve select ultra-high-net-worth clients who have outgrown a multi-family office platform but are not yet ready for a single-family office environment. This move further demonstrates the firm’s commitment to adapting to the evolving needs of its clients. In 2024, Robertson Stephens ended the year with $7.1 billion in advisory assets under management, reflecting 45% growth over the previous 12 months and over 40% growth over the previous 5 years.
