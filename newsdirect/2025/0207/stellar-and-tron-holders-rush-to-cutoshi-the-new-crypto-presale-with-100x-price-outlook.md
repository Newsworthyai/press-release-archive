![](https://public.newsdirect.com/992170323/am99EQd8.jpeg)

Top altcoins, Tron (TRX) and Stellar (XLM) are currently navigating a noticeable downtrend, with their price movements offering insights into broader market trends. While the top DeFi coins continue to trade below their monthly resistance, buyers are now looking in another direction with hopes of finding the next breakthrough token.

Meanwhile, one such project is Cutoshi (CUTO). This new DeFi coin is generating considerable excitement largely because of how it blends the communal attributes of memes with the lucrativeness of decentralized finance. This combination is proving attractive to many in the crypto space and is particularly capturing the interest of Tron and Stellar holders during the ongoing market correction.

Cutoshi’s Hybrid Ecosystem Attracts Large FollowingCutoshi (CUTO) isn't just another memecoin solely driven by hype or some sort of sensationalism. Unlike most of its predecessors, this new hybrid memecoin is a gateway to a vibrant and rewarding DeFI experience. Notably, the Cutoshi ecosystem was inspired by the popular Chinese lucky cat associated with good fortune while embodying Satoshi Nakamoto’s core blockchain principles of decentralization, privacy and monetary freedom.

As such, the Cutoshi ecosystem offers real-world benefits, housing various lucrative DeFi tools including a multi-chain DEX protocol that enables users to seamlessly swap and transact crypto assets. Likewise, there are token farming opportunities that enable users to earn passive income as well as complimentary items. These, combined with a dedicated Cutoshi Academy that aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the crypto space, positions Cutoshi for exponential growth.

Meanwhile, the native $CUTO token powers up the entire operation, facilitating transactions within the ecosystem as well as Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. Having already seen over 100% increase from an initial price of $0.015, the CUTO token is set for even more growth as it progresses through the rest of the presale stages. This further explains why early backers are rushing to purchase the native coin at a modest price of $0.031.

Tron Coin Navigates Market Volatility, Dips Below Weekly ResistanceThe price of Tron (TRX) coin has been hit with a noticeable downtrend following a broader market correction. In the past week, TRX coin has been trading within a weekly price range of $0.24 and $0.22, which reflects about over 8% decline in the past week and over 14% in the past month. This progressive decline has pushed TRX price below the previously-held monthly resistance around $0.26.

Meanwhile, a broader look at the year-to-date chart suggests that Tron coin is currently trading within a solid support zone that it last held in mid-january. However, failure to hold strong above the current price range could result in further downtrend, possibly pushing TRX price to lower regions below $0.20 where its next major support zone lies.

Despite the current challenges, Tron Network's underlying technology and active community provide a strong foundation. Besides, the future performance of the top DeFi coin will depend on various factors including overall market sentiment, adoption rates, and development within the Tron ecosystem.

Stellar price is Navigating Bearish Pressure Within Support ZoneStellar (XLM) coin is another established cryptocurrency. However, like Tron, Stellar price trajectory also reflects a noticeable downtrend. Currently trading within a weekly price range of $0.415 and $0.350, Stellar price reflects about 15% decline in the past week and roughly 20% in the past month. Although these price drops reflect the overall bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market, it has also pushed XLM price far below its monthly resistance level around $0.44.

While competition from other similar projects is also impacting Stellar's performance, the future performance of XLM price will largely depend on its ability to innovate and attract new users. Regardless, token holders and market analysts still maintain great optimism for a bullish reversal.

Notably, crypto analyst CW in a recent X post claimed that Stellar price trajectory has formed a bull flag pattern. According to his bias, the top DeFi coin has achieved its goal of liquidating long positions, and is now recovering quickly. However, Stellar’s technical analysis including short and long term Moving Averages suggests that XLM price will continue to fluctuate considering their bearish outlook.

Can Cutoshi Achieve Top DeFi Coin Status Like Tron and Stellar? Cutoshi has captured attention with its unique blend of meme appeal and DeFi utility. Its presale success and futuristic prospect are undeniable, especially considering its appeal to a diverse audience. These attributes not only ranks it highly alongside top DeFi coins like Stellar and Tron, but also positions it among the best cryptos to buy.
