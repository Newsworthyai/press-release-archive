The broader crypto market is currently undergoing a downtrend, which has prompted many to ask if the Q1 bull run is still feasible. Notably, top altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have had their fair share of the turmoil with both cryptocurrencies registering approximately 38% and 14% decline in the past month respectively.

Meanwhile, as many savvy investors look towards the presale market in hopes to find the next gem, a new presale star– Cutoshi (CUTO) has caught a lot of attention. Asides delivering over 100% ROI to early backers in just a few weeks, Cutoshi also stands out because of its unified hybrid ecosystem which aims to bring DeFi to everyday people.

Cutoshi Aims to Boost DeFi Adoption Using Hybrid ApproachBased on the Ethereum network, Cutoshi (CUTO) is set to change the existing memecoin narrative by adopting a hybrid approach. Notably, Cutoshi combines the appeal of a fun memecoin with the utility and functionality of a serious DeFi ecosystem. This is spelled out in its unified DeFi ecosystem inspired by two main phenomena– the cultural heritage of the popular Chinese lucky cat associated with good fortune as well as Satoshi’s core blockchain principles of decentralization, privacy and monetary freedom.

By establishing a unified ecosystem that thrives on these core principles, Cutoshi not only provides its users with lucrative opportunities, but is equally set to liberate them from the whims of the existing centralized financial (CeFi) system that’s designed to profit only a selected few. As such, the Cutoshi ecosystem houses features such as a DEX protocol that facilitates cross-chain crypto swapping and transactions.

Coupled with this is the Cutoshi farming mechanism that rewards active users with extra tokens and complimentary items including unique NFTs and merch. Meanwhile, the native $CUTO token powers up the entire operation, facilitating transactions within the learning academy as well as Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. This not only ensures that the project is self-sustainable, but also positions the CUTO token as one of the best crypto coins to buy now at a modest price of $0.031.

Avalanche Price Trajectory Loses Steam Amidst Weekly and Monthly DeclineThe price of Avalanche (AVAX) token has continued on a downtrend, registering over 27% decline in the past year. Meanwhile, now that it's back to trading below its resistance level of $33, AVAX price is now at risk of an extended downtrend.

Notably, AVAX token is currently trading within a weekly price range of $35 and $25, which reflects roughly 24% decline in the past week and nearly 38% in the past month. At the current price, AVAX token is only a couple of dollars aways from its next significant support zone around $22. As such, failure to hold strongly above this level could send AVAX price to lower regions below $20 where its next support lies.

Meanwhile, AVAX token’s technical analysis points at a bearish trajectory considering both Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages including 20, 100, and 200 day EMAs and SMAs reflects a strong sell. This further suggests that the current trend may persist for some time.

Chainlink Price Dips Below Monthly Resistance Amidst Weekly DeclineThe past week has been quite challenging for Chainlink (LINK) following a notable downtrend that sent the LINK price to lower ranges below $20, down from a weekly high around $25. With roughly 15% decline in the past week and over 12% in the past month, LINK price has been further pushed below the resistance level around $23.

Although it has made significant recovery in the past few days, with the LINK price surging from below $17 to currently trade within a weekly price range of $24 and $20. Regardless, LINK token’s inability to hold strong above the support zone around $18 could result in further downtrend.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bit Amberly in a recent X post claimed that Chainlink has broken and retested a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly time frame. According to his chart analysis, if after consolidating above this triangle, LINK price could rise towards targets at $31, $53, and $100.

Can Cutoshi Achieve More Growth in the Short Term Compared to DOT and LINK?While Polkadot and Chainlink operate on a different scale, they both function as an integral part of many dApps. This alone ensures that they are self-sustainable; albeit determining how much growth they can achieve individually largely relies on mainstream adoption.

On the other hand, Cutoshi sits at the intersection of meme coin and DeFi market, offering a unified hybrid ecosystem that caters to a diverse audience. This coupled with its presale status boosts its mainstream adoption, ultimately positioning the native CUTO token among the best cryptos to buy for exponential gain both in the short and long term.

Cutoshi is a revolutionary meme coin inspired by the Chinese Lucky Cat and Satoshi Nakamoto’s teachings. It’s based on decentralization, privacy, and monetary freedom, embodying the blockchain's original purpose and ethos.

Cutoshi has a vision - to introduce more people to cryptocurrencies and bring financial freedom to all who want it.
