# ZenaTech’s (Nasdaq: ZENA) Latest Acquisition Bolsters Drone-as-a-Service Network, Eyes $8 Billion Border Security Market

From agriculture to disaster response, industries are increasingly turning to drones to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and tackle challenges in ways traditional methods cannot. However, the high upfront costs, regulatory hurdles, and technical expertise required have made drone adoption inaccessible for many businesses. ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is changing the game with its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) model, offering AI-powered drones on a flexible, subscription-based platform. By removing barriers to entry, ZENA is empowering sectors like farming, logistics, and emergency management to harness the power of drone technology.

ZenaTech’s Drone-as-a-Service: Flexibility Meets Innovation

When it comes to disruptive technologies, drones are no longer just a futuristic concept—they’re here, and they’re transforming industries. ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA), a technology company specializing in AI-driven drone solutions, is positioning itself as a key player in this space with its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model. By offering flexible, subscription-based drone solutions, ZenaTech is addressing the needs of businesses in various sectors while positioning itself as a potential contender in the growing drone market.

ZenaTech’s DaaS model is designed to eliminate the barriers that have traditionally kept businesses from adopting drone technology. Instead of purchasing expensive hardware, training pilots, and navigating regulatory hurdles, companies can now access ZenaDrone’s multifunctional drones on a subscription basis. This approach is particularly appealing to industries like agriculture, defense, logistics, and environmental monitoring, where the cost and complexity of drone ownership could be been as significant deterrents.

“Our DaaS business model is similar to how Uber transformed the taxi industry,” says CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. “We’re providing businesses with affordable access to cutting-edge drone technology without the need for large upfront investments.”

The company’s flagship drone, the ZenaDrone 1000, is a versatile tool capable of performing tasks ranging from crop monitoring and building inspections to security surveillance and disaster response. For indoor applications, the IQ Nano drone offers compact, autonomous solutions for inventory management and logistics. By leveraging these drones, businesses can achieve significant operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve safety.

Expanding Reach Through Strategic Acquisitions

ZenaTech’s aggressive acquisition strategy is another key driver of its DaaS growth. On February 4, 2025, the company announced the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire a fifth land survey engineering company in Southeast Florida. This marks ZenaTech’s second acquisition in the region and underscores its commitment to building a national DaaS network. The acquisition is particularly significant as it aligns with ZenaTech’s broader strategy to leverage its drone technology for border security and coastal surveillance—a pressing issue for Florida, where illegal immigration cost taxpayers over $8 billion in 2023, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

“Our vision with DaaS is to enable drones to dramatically improve the speed and precision of traditional inspection, safety, and monitoring tasks,” says Passley. “The surge in illegal immigration by sea to states like Florida is tremendously expensive for taxpayers. Drones can help with coastal surveillance, search and rescue operations, and improve efficiency and manpower expenditures for coast guard and law enforcement organizations.”

The ZenaDrone 1000, equipped with advanced sensors, LiDAR, and AI-powered tracking, is poised to revolutionize border security. These drones can provide real-time aerial surveillance over vast coastal areas, detecting illegal migrant boats long before they reach shore. With capabilities like thermal imaging and night vision, they can operate 24/7 in difficult-to-monitor areas, reducing reliance on costly and slower manned patrols. Additionally, drones can relay live data to law enforcement, enabling quicker interception of migrant vessels and improving search and rescue operations for those in distress.

By integrating drones with radar systems and AI analytics, authorities can identify patterns in illegal crossings, anticipate threats, and allocate resources more efficiently. This not only strengthens Florida’s maritime border security but also highlights the versatility of ZenaTech’s DaaS model in addressing complex, large-scale challenges.

Targeting High-Impact Applications

One of the most promising aspects of ZenaTech’s DaaS model is its focus on high-impact applications. For example, the company is developing drone swarms to address natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. In hurricane-prone regions like Florida, ZenaTech plans to deploy hundreds of ZenaDrone 1000 units for search-and-rescue operations, damage assessment, and cleanup efforts. Similarly, in the Pacific Northwest, the company is exploring the use of drone swarms for wildfire management, leveraging AI and quantum computing to process vast amounts of real-time data.

“AI-powered drone swarms can dynamically adapt to changing conditions, providing critical support in inaccessible or heavily damaged areas,” explains Passley. “This technology has the potential to save lives and reduce the economic impact of natural disasters.”

The average cost of a landfalling hurricane is estimated at $22.8 billion, while wildfires in the U.S. could cost between $394 billion and $893 billion annually. By offering cost-effective drone solutions for disaster response, ZenaTech is tapping into a massive and growing market.

Agriculture

Agriculture is another sector where ZenaTech’s drones are making waves. The company’s multispectral imaging technology allows farmers to monitor crop health, detect pests, and optimize irrigation with unprecedented precision. This capability is particularly valuable in precision agriculture, where the ability to make data-driven decisions can significantly improve yields and sustainability.

ZenaTech is also pursuing FAA certification for its ZenaDrone 1000 to be used as a crop sprayer. This dual-use capability—applicable to both agriculture and wildfire management—could open up new revenue streams for the company. The U.S. agricultural drone market, valued at $2.74 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to $10.45 billion by 2030. ZenaTech is well-positioned to capture a share of this booming market.

The Road Ahead

ZenaTech’s DaaS model is more than just a business strategy—it’s a vision for the future of drone technology. As Passley puts it, “We’re bringing the speed and precision of AI drones to legacy industries, transforming the way businesses operate.” For investors, ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) represents a unique opportunity to invest in a company that’s not only innovating within the drone space but also addressing critical challenges across industries like agriculture, disaster response, and border security. With its scalable DaaS model, strategic acquisitions, and focus on high-impact applications, ZenaTech is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for drone technology—making it a stock worth watching as it continues to execute its growth strategy.
