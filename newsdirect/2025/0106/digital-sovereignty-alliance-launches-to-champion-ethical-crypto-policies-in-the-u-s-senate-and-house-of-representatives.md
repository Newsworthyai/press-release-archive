Washington, D.C., January 6, 2025 – Today marks the official launch of the Digital Sovereignty Alliance (DSA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing clear and ethical public policy, research, and education surrounding emerging technologies, including decentralized technologies, blockchain, cryptocurrency, Web3 innovations, and artificial intelligence.

DSA is focused on elevating the quality of public policy and public understanding of blockchain technology. Through in-depth research and dynamic educational events, DSA will work to foster an informed approach to technology governance, placing a strong emphasis on ethics, transparency, and digital sovereignty.

“DSA was founded to lead critical, bi-partisan conversations and to advocate for policies that ensure emerging technologies benefit society as a whole,” said Adrian Wall, DSA’s Director. “With rapid advancements in fields like blockchain and artificial intelligence that are offering tremendous benefits to society, it’s essential that public policy keeps pace to address the ethical and societal impacts. We’re committed to bringing together experts, policymakers, and the public to champion thoughtful, forward-looking policies.”

DSA’s work will center around:

* Research: Conducting and publishing studies to deepen understanding of decentralized and digital technologies.
* Educational Events: Hosting conferences, workshops, and forums to engage stakeholders and foster dialogue on responsible technology adoption.
* Policy Advocacy: Promoting and supporting legislation and regulations that encourage innovation while prioritizing ethical considerations and public welfare.

As part of its mission, DSA will also partner with key stakeholders across sectors to support a framework that encourages innovation, transparency, and regulatory compliance. DSA is proudly supported by a coalition of pioneers from the crypto and blockchain industry, led by TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, and which brings significant expertise and resources to further DSA’s mission.

TRON founder Justin Sun emphasized such support for the DSA, stating, “TRON is proud to support the Digital Sovereignty Alliance (DSA) to champion the industry effort on advancing crypto policies in the United States. We are excited to see the DSA working closely with lawmakers, industry experts, and community leaders on crypto legislation that will lead to the healthy growth of the entire digital assets industry. This type of groundbreaking work on key legislation, such as FIT21 and DCPPA is crucial for advancing digital sovereignty and fostering innovation. As one of the largest decentralized blockchain networks in the world, the TRON community is committed to sharing all knowledge and experience that can help shape this next phase of growth.”
