The direct deposit capability inside Payroll Mate payroll software, by Real Business Solutions, is useful to both businesses and accountants alike. This feature allows users to generate ACH (also known as NACHA) files to be used in direct deposit payments. This easy-to-use feature saves time and reduces the probability of errors, as there is no need to create checks and then distribute them. It also simplifies the processing of payroll by accountants for their clients; it allows the accounting or CPA firm to process numerous client payrolls and deliver timely and accurate direct deposit payments.

Real Business Solutions Payroll Mate (https://payroll.realtaxtools.com) is made for companies of all sizes, from those with one employee to those with hundreds. The primary Payroll Mate software is all that is required for accountants and businesses that handle payroll for ten or fewer businesses (up to 75 employees per firm). To process payroll for an additional 100 businesses, users can upgrade to Payroll Mate Option #3 (for an additional fee). Accountants can get extra Payroll Mate Option #3 capabilities, which enable them to add 100 more firms for each purchase, if they wish to process payroll for more than 100 businesses.

Payroll Mate is a comprehensive payroll system for processing employee and contractor payroll. Because payroll management can be complicated, with a wide array of legislation and regulations to consider every day, Payroll Mate is designed to be easy to use and operate. Payroll Mate provides a wealth of features, including the ability to automatically calculate net pay, federal withholding, social security, Medicare, state, and local payroll taxes. Payroll Mate by Real Business Solutions also supports different types of payroll pay periods, prints checks, prepares payroll forms 941, 940, 943, 944, W-2, W-3, California DE-6 , California DE-7 , Texas C-3 , Texas C-4, New York NYS-45, Illinois 941 and Illinois UI-3/40. The payroll software allows unlimited tax categories, pre-tax and post-tax deductions, and unlimited pay rates per employee, making it very flexible and powerful.

The QuickBooks and Peachtree (Sage 50) payroll export wizard that ships with Payroll Mate makes exporting check data as journal entries to accounting software applications easy and intuitive.
