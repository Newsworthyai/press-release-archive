# XVesuvius Named Men's Health "Best Acne Product"

XVolcano's flagship product, XVesuvius, has been named the Men's Health 2025 Grooming Award Winner for "Best Acne Product," recognizing its innovative approach to treating acne with a proprietary combination of clinical-strength active ingredients. “Out of all the acne products our testers tried, they said this one was most effective at attacking active breakouts. One application in the morning and one at night was all it took to erase zits in as little as a day,” said Men’s Health.

This prestigious honor acknowledges XVesuvius's effectiveness, particularly for athletes and active individuals dealing with stubborn acne. "We're thrilled to receive this recognition from Men's Health," said Steve Dworman, Founder of XVolcano. "XVesuvius was developed to address multiple aspects of skin health with clinical-strength ingredients. Our formula was created to not only clear acne but to improve overall skin health through clinically-validated ingredients that target multiple pathways simultaneously."

XVesuvius represents a breakthrough in skincare through its innovative combination of clinically-validated ingredients at full clinical strength. Based on research shared by board-certified dermatologists, XVesuvius delivers comprehensive skin transformation through seven key mechanisms:

- Advanced Antimicrobial Activity Without Antibiotics

- Superior Hydration Technology

- Powerful Anti-Inflammatory Properties

- Sebum Regulation

- Advanced Anti-Scarring Technology

- Hyperpigmentation Reduction

- Comprehensive Anti-Aging Effects

"What makes XVesuvius truly revolutionary is its comprehensive approach to skin health," noted Dr. Serena Mraz, a board-certified, Stanford-trained dermatologist who has evaluated the product. "The formula contains a rich combination of potent ingredients that address multiple components of acne, acne sequelae, and aging changes with skin health-boosting effects. Most skincare regimens require 4-5 different products to achieve what XVesuvius accomplishes in one formula."
