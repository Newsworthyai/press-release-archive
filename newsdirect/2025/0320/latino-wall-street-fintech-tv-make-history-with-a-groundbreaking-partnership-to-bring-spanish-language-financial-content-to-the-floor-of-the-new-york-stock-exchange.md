# Latino Wall Street & FINTECH.TV Make History with a Groundbreaking Partnership to Bring Spanish-Language Financial Content to the Floor of the New York Stock Exchange

Latino Wall Street, the leading financial education platform for the Latino community, is making history by partnering with FINTECH.TV, the global media powerhouse covering finance, blockchain, and impact investing. This strategic collaboration will, for the first time, bring bilingual (Spanish & English) financial education directly from the iconic trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), bridging the financial knowledge gap for millions of Spanish-speaking investors worldwide.

A Game-Changer for the Latino Community

Latinos are a rapidly growing economic force in the U.S., yet financial media has historically overlooked them. This partnership changes that by delivering expert analysis, market trends, cryptocurrency insights, and investment strategies in both Spanish and English, ensuring Latino investors are no longer left out of the conversation.

“Latinos have been left out of the financial conversation for far too long,” said Tony Delgado, Co-Founder of Latino Wall Street. “This partnership with FINTECH.TV is more than a historic milestone—it’s a game-changer. We are putting Latino voices at the epicenter of the financial world, on the floor of the NYSE.”

“Our mission is to democratize financial education for the Latino community, which has historically been excluded from the investment world,” added Gabriela Berrospi, Co-Founder of Latino Wall Street. “Teaming up with FINTECH.TV allows us to empower even more Latinos worldwide, ensuring they have access to key financial insights to build wealth and fully participate in global markets.”

High-Quality Bilingual Financial Content

Through this collaboration, Latino Wall Street and FINTECH.TV will produce exclusive content in both English and Spanish, covering stock market insights and investment strategies, private equity and venture capital opportunities, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3 trends, sustainable and impact investing (SDGs and ESG principles), and exclusive interviews with top financial leaders and entrepreneurs.

This content will be simultaneously broadcast on FINTECH.TV, Latino Wall Street streaming platforms, and international airports, bringing Wall Street directly to the Latino community worldwide.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Latino Wall Street,” said Vince Molinari, Founder and CEO of FINTECH.TV. “Our mission has always been to provide forward-thinking financial insights, and with this collaboration, we’re opening doors for a dynamic, fast-growing Spanish-speaking audience eager to participate in the global economy.”

More Than Media: A Movement for Latino Empowerment

This initiative goes beyond broadcasting—it’s about equipping Latinos with the tools to take control of their financial future. As part of this mission, the partnership will also support the Wall Street Kids Initiative, which introduces Latino youth to investing, financial literacy, and wealth-building strategies while giving them access to the NYSE and financial industry leaders.

A New Era for Latino Investors Starts Now

With this partnership, Latinos will have an unprecedented presence on Wall Street. This collaboration is more than just media—it’s about empowerment, education, and economic growth for an entire community.
