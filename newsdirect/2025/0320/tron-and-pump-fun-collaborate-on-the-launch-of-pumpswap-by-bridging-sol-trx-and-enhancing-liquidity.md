Geneva, Switzerland, March 20 2025 – TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), is thrilled to collaborate with pump.fun, the world’s leading crypto token launchpad where anyone can create their own token for free, to power the launch of PumpSwap. PumpSwap is the new native decentralized exchange (DEX) from pump.fun and is built to redefine liquidity access and cross-chain interoperability while serving as a seamless onramp for the broader Web3 ecosystem.

Unlike traditional DEXs, PumpSwap is directly integrated with pump.fun, creating unmatched efficiencies by eliminating the need for token migration and significantly enhancing the user experience. This direct connection streamlines liquidity provisioning, allowing token creators to instantly trade and manage liquidity without delays.

pump.fun will also soon introduce a token revenue-sharing model, where creators earn a share of the fees generated on their tokens, aligning long-term incentives between token creators and token holders and fostering a more sustainable ecosystem for memecoins and beyond. The platform also serves as a bridge between ecosystems, leveraging LayerZero and Wormhole to facilitate cross-chain liquidity between other blockchain networks.

This collaboration marks a major step forward in expanding pump.fun beyond memes, transforming it into a hub for crypto adoption. With PumpSwap acting as an entry point for users to explore multiple blockchain ecosystems, it bypasses traditional fiat onramps, making it easier than ever for users to buy and trade tokens across different networks.

"TRON remains dedicated to driving blockchain innovation and expanding accessibility across the Web3 ecosystem,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The collaboration with pump.fun on PumpSwap enhances liquidity access and cross-chain interoperability, reinforcing the broader goal of making decentralized finance more seamless and inclusive for users worldwide."

“pump.fun democratized token creation, standardized token contracts, and brought crypto to the people,” said Alon Cohen, CoFounder pump.fun. “pump.fun is building crypto’s largest social network, and bridging communities across crypto through partnerships like this with TRON to provide crosschain liquidity on PumpSwap is how that foundation is built.”

TRON’s involvement in this initiative further strengthens its commitment to cross-chain innovation and expanding access to decentralized finance (DeFi). As PumpSwap grows, it aims to become a key liquidity hub, supporting on and off-ramps across multiple blockchains and driving broader adoption of Web3 technologies.
