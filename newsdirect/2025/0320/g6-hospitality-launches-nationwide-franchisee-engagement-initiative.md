# G6 Hospitality Launches Nationwide Franchisee Engagement Initiative

G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and Studio 6, today announced an extensive franchisee partner engagement initiative with plans to host more than 15 franchisee owner meetings across the country. The company aims to conduct 1 meeting in every region before the end of the year.

The initiative, which began earlier this year, has already facilitated meaningful conversations with numerous franchisee owners. G6 leadership has already conducted meetings in San Antonio, Dallas, Portland, Sacramento, LA, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Reno, Baltimore, Dallas, Atlanta and Tampa plans to conduct more by the end of the year. G6 Hospitality is committed to meeting with all franchisee partners before the end of 2025, underscoring the company's dedication to collaborative growth and operational excellence.

This strategic effort aims to strengthen relationships with franchisee partners and gather valuable firsthand insights to drive the company's continued growth.

"Direct engagement with our franchise owners is absolutely essential to our success as we continue to expand across the country," said Sonal Sinha, CEO - G6 Hospitality. "These meetings allow us to connect and understand our owners' ideas and thoughts firsthand, which is invaluable as we shape the future of our brands together. We're committed to listening, learning, and implementing insights that will strengthen our partnership and drive mutual success."

The meetings provide a platform for franchisee owners to share their experiences, challenges, and suggestions directly with G6 Hospitality leadership. This grassroots approach reinforces the company's commitment to fostering a collaborative franchisee community while ensuring that strategic decisions reflect the perspectives of those on the front lines of guest service.

This initiative follows G6 Hospitality's recent announcement of a $10 million marketing investment aimed at accelerating customer adoption and enhancing brand engagement. The company continues to focus on technological advancements, including expanding its website and My6 app capabilities, with plans to quadruple app installations before the summer season.

Global travel tech company OYO, which acquired G6 Hospitality from Blackstone Real Estate, plans to accelerate growth with the addition of over 150 hotels in 2025 under the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands. This expansion will strengthen the brands' presence in key markets such as Texas, California, Georgia, and Arizona while preserving their core values and distinct identity.
