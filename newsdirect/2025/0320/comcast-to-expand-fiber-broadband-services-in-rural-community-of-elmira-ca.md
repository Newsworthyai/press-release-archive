# Comcast to Expand Fiber Broadband Services in Rural Community of Elmira, CA

Today, Comcast hosted a groundbreaking ceremony in Elmira, CA, a rural community in Solano County, to kick off its new rural network expansion project. The project will bring Comcast’s smart, fast, reliable, fiber-rich Xfinity and Comcast Business broadband network to previously unserved homes and businesses.

The planned expansion adds to Comcast’s more than $4 billion in technology and infrastructure investments across California in the past three years. The expansion is made possible by a grant from Solano County, through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) and private funding by Comcast.

Prior to the groundbreaking event, members of the internal Comcast Veteran’s Employee Resource Group (Vet ERG) participated in an event titled, “Operation Old Glory”, where they replaced a tattered flag hanging outside of the Vacaville Fire District Station 65 in Elmira. Additionally, Comcast announced a $5,000 contribution to “Play 4 All” park in Vacaville, CA. Vacaville’s Rotary Club created the park to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities, which includes wheelchair-friendly playground equipment, light and sound minimizing structures for those with sensory sensitivities, along with many other features and structures. Today’s contribution to “Play 4 All” park is in addition to a previous $25,000 commitment Comcast made when the park was first established.

“Expanding broadband access to rural communities like Elmira, CA, is a vital infrastructure investment that will bridge the digital divide and create new opportunities for residents,” said CA State Senator Christopher Cabaldon. “Reliable high-speed internet is no longer a luxury. With Comcast bringing this critical expansion, more Elmira residents will have the tools to thrive in today’s digital world—participating in the modern economy, accessing online learning, and utilizing telehealth services. This investment ensures our community remains connected, competitive, and prepared for the future.”

"The digital divide continues to leave rural areas behind, limiting economic growth, educational advancement, and access to essential services,” added Supervisor Mitch Mashburn, Solano County Board of Supervisors. “I commend Comcast for working diligently to bring their broadband services to the community of Elmira, which will only help continue to break down barriers. By ensuring that high-speed internet reaches these communities, we are not just improving lives — we are creating sustainable futures.”

“The power of the Internet is the bridge that connects dreams to reality,” said, David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President, Comcast California. “By bringing Comcast’s high-speed, reliable and fast broadband connectivity to Elmira, we’re strengthening families, empowering businesses, and providing seniors with the tools and resources they need to stay engaged.”
