# Toncoin and Solana Investors Eye New Opportunities as Elluminex Emerges

As Toncoin battles a 33.3% price drop in February 2025 and Solana faces a 16.5% weekly decline, investors seek fresh prospects. Enter Elluminex, a DeFi hub launching on TON, Telegram’s blockchain. With Toncoin at $3.29 and Solana at $143, analysts highlight Elluminex’s presale as a potential pivot point.

Toncoin’s recent slump contrasts sharply with TON’s growth—950 million users and 1 billion transactions. Yet, Toncoin’s DeFi ecosystem remains underdeveloped, mirroring Ethereum pre-Uniswap. Elluminex aims to fill this gap by introducing tools like cross-chain swaps and staking, which are key for retaining TON’s user base.

The peak price for Toncoin (TON) hit $8.25 on June 15, 2024. Right now, it's sitting at $3.29, which is over 54% lower than its all-time high. It dropped just 9% over the past week.

While Toncoin’s price fluctuates between $3.29 and $3.66, Elluminex’s presale has raised $328,640 at $0.06 per $ELX, offering early access to TON’s DeFi future. For Toncoin holders, diversification into $ELX could hedge against volatility while tapping into TON’s huge potential.

Solana’s 80,000 TPS capability and BungeeExchange’s integration showcase its technical edge, yet Solana’s 10% dip reveals fragility. Trading at $143.80, Solana remains a top-six crypto, but its reliance on volatile meme coins like Bonk and Dogwifhat raises risks. Elluminex’s blueprint—modeled after Solana’s Raydium—offers a parallel: a unified DeFi platform with AI analytics and pre-market token access.

In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) saw trading volumes hit $1.85 billion, down 41.5% from a day earlier, showing a drop in market activity. The highest price for SOL was $293.31 on January 19, 2025, but right now, it’s sitting 42.63% lower than its ATH.

As Solana investors eye safer yields, Elluminex’s audit-backed tokenomics (50% fee burns, 350M supply) present a structured alternative. The shift reflects a broader trend: liquidity migrating to platforms blending utility with scarcity.

Elluminex distinguishes itself with phased growth and deflationary mechanics incentivizing early participation. The platform’s cross-chain bridge and TON project's pre-market feature, addresses fragmentation—a pain point for Solana and Toncoin users. By burning 50% of fees, $ELX reduces supply pressure, a tactic echoing Binance’s BNB success.

For Solana loyalists, Elluminex offers exposure to TON’s low-fee environment; for Toncoin holders, it unlocks DeFi’s full potential. Solidproof’s audit adds credibility and is mandatory in a market wary of unchecked innovation.

Additionally, in contrast to Toncoin or Solana, the core Elluminex team includes a developer from Google, an ex-member of Fantom, and many others from top blockchain projects, all contributing valuable experience in blockchain systems, DeFi ledgers, and cross-chain connections.

Toncoin or Solana: Or Elluminex—the DeFi Aggregator?Projects bridging ecosystems often outperform single-chain tokens. For investors, Elluminex isn’t just a new token; it’s a gateway to the next evolution of decentralized finance.

As Toncoin and Solana navigate time-tested market volatility, Elluminex emerges as a strategic hedge. Its TON-centric DeFi suite—combining liquidity pools, governance, and AI tools—could replicate Uniswap’s impact on Ethereum. With Solana’s ecosystem bursting at the seams and Toncoin craving utility, $ELX’s staged presale and tokenomics offer a calculated entry.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
