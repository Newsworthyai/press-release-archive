# K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties Providing Immediate Housing for Families Displaced by California Wildfires

K3 Holdings, a privately held real estate investment firm with extensive holdings throughout the United States and Alpine LA Properties, a leasing company providing newly remodeled apartments at affordable rates are actively working to support families displaced by the catastrophic California wildfires. By designating units specifically for those who have lost their homes, both companies are demonstrating a deep commitment to immediate relief and long-term recovery. Families are already in the process of relocating into buildings owned and operated by the property management company.

With 11 lives tragically lost already, more than 10,000 structures destroyed (5,300 in Palisades and 7,000 in Eaton), damages at more than $100 billion, and residents still under evacuation orders, the scale of this disaster demands unified action.

K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties have stepped up by offering vacant units to provide temporary housing for affected individuals and families.

K3 and Alpine property managers are coordinating with local relief organizations to match available units with those in need, ensuring that victims of the wildfires have a secure place to stay as they begin to rebuild their lives. Families are already moving into K3 and Alpine buildings.

"These wildfires don’t just burn landscapes—they disrupt lives and tear through the fabric of our communities," said Michael Kadisha, a Principal of K3 Holdings. "The families forced to evacuate and the first responders fighting these fires are our neighbors, friends, and colleagues. Now more than ever, we must come together to support, rebuild, and heal."

The efforts to provide temporary housing in K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties units are designed to ease the transition for those displaced residents by the wildfires. The property managers are dedicated to ensuring that those impacted can begin rebuilding their lives with dignity and comfort in safe and secure homes.

The devastating loss of homes highlights the critical need for safe and affordable housing. Losing a home means losing safety, comfort, and stability—elements vital to personal and community resilience. K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties remain dedicated to advancing resilient, affordable housing initiatives that safeguard communities against future challenges.

"When disaster strikes, the need for secure and sustainable housing becomes painfully clear," said Nathan Kadisha, a K3 Holdings Principal. "Our companies are committed to supporting solutions that prioritize community well-being and long-term recovery."

Grassroots organizations are mobilizing relief efforts across California, and we can all make a meaningful impact. Relief efforts depend heavily on volunteer support. Assistance at evacuation centers, distribution of supplies, and meal preparation are just a few ways to help. Nonprofits are actively providing aid to displaced families. Monetary donations and in-kind support are vital to sustaining these efforts.

In response to the ongoing wildfire crisis, K3 Holdings has also made a corporate gift on behalf of its K3 Tenants and Alpine residents to support the heroic efforts of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD). Recognizing the critical need for additional resources to combat these devastating fires, the company is calling on the community to join in by supporting the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation.

The LAFD Foundation plays a vital role in equipping firefighters with life-saving tools and resources that are not funded by the city budget. The foundation is currently seeking monetary donations to provide essential gear, including emergency fire shelters, hydration backpacks, and wildland brush tools—all crucial items that help protect both firefighters and the communities they serve.

The entire K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties families express their deepest gratitude to the firefighters, volunteers, and everyone lending a hand in this critical time.

"The California wildfires are a reminder of life’s fragility and the strength of human connection," Michael Kadisha continued "Let’s stand together, support one another, and work toward a future where safe, affordable housing is a reality for all."
