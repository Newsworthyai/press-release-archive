# IntusCare Increases Total Funding to Over $27M through Strategic Follow-On Financing

IntusCare, a leading provider of predictive analytics solutions for geriatric care, today announced it has raised $11.5 million in a strategic follow-on financing round. This latest investment brings the company's total funding to over $27 million, underscoring the strong market positioning of IntusCare's innovative approach to improving care outcomes for complex senior populations.

The investment round was led by Deerfield Management, with participation from Citi Impact Fund, Jumpstart Nova, and other existing IntusCare investors. This infusion of capital will fuel the launch of CareHub, a comprehensive care management platform, and support the expansion of IntusCare's existing suite of Revenue Integrity, Population Health, and Utilization Management solutions. Additionally, the company plans to accelerate its artificial intelligence research, aiming to enhance user experiences for healthcare providers and staff.

Revolutionizing Care Management with CareHub CareHub is designed to accelerate the growth and success of Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) and other value-based care models. The platform addresses critical needs in the PACE community and beyond, including:

1. Reducing documentation and administrative burden
2. Integrating or replacing disparate, non-interoperable data systems
3. Driving actionable insights for interdisciplinary care teams to improve medical utilization

"With CareHub, we're taking a significant step forward in our mission to create the platform that organizations use to deliver the right care, at the right time, every day for older adults with complex needs," said Robbie Felton, CEO and co-founder of IntusCare. "This product is the result of our deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by PACE programs and other value-based care systems with technology, interoperability, and managing complex Medicare and Medicaid populations."

Expanding Beyond PACE While initially focused on PACE programs, IntusCare is strategically positioned to expand its product suite to serve Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). The company's solutions are particularly valuable for organizations taking on risk in complex Medicare and Medicaid populations.

"The support from Deerfield Management and our other investors validates our customer-centric approach and enables us to accelerate our growth within the PACE space and into new markets," said Evan Jackson, COO and co-founder of IntusCare. "We're excited to bring our expertise in data interoperability, workflow optimization, and patient-focused care to a wider range of value-based care providers."

Driving Innovation in Value-Based Care IntusCare's latest funding round will also support the expansion of its marketing function and the continued development of its core products. The company remains committed to driving innovation in the value-based care space, with a particular focus on improving outcomes for vulnerable senior populations.

Ryan Alam, Senior Vice President of the Citi Impact Fund, emphasized the transformative potential of IntusCare’s work: “The PACE ecosystem has shown strong potential for improving outcomes for seniors with complex needs while allowing them to age in place. Currently, providers within these systems lack innovative technology to empower their workflows. IntusCare is working to address these technological shortcomings through a next-generation administrative, financial, and clinical software to support these models and the incredible care they offer to our most vulnerable population. We are thrilled to support IntusCare and deeply believe in their mission of expanding the reach of high-quality care.”

Dr. Julian Harris, Operating Partner at Deerfield Management, added, "IntusCare continues to impress us with their innovative approach to solving critical technology and service problems in the PACE market and beyond. We believe their disruptive, AI-forward technology will play a vital role in revolutionizing the performance of interdisciplinary teams in the PACE, ACO, and Medicare SNP markets."
