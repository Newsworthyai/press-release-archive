# JohnWallStreet’s “Private Equity x College Sports” Event Brings Together the Top Decision Makers in Sports and Finance

JohnWallStreet, a sports intelligence business, will hold its JohnWallStreet Live: Private Equity x College Sports event on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, at the W Hotel in Atlanta, hours before the final game of the College Football Playoff between Notre Dame and Ohio State.

The exclusive event will bring together top leaders and decision-makers from across collegiate athletics and the private capital markets for several hours of smart conversation and high-level networking. The programming lineup will feature a series of sports investment and college sports luminaries, including Mark Dowley (chief operating officer of RedBird Capital), Kevin Mayer (co-founder of Smash Capital), Brett Yormark (commissioner of the Big 12 Conference), Tim Pernetti (commissioner of the American Athletic Conference), Gloria Nevarez (commissioner of the Mountain West Conference) and Craig Sloan (CEO of Playfly Sports).

“The college sports landscape is shifting rapidly. New rules around NIL and player revenue sharing are creating a demand for capital and new revenue creation,” said Corey Leff, founder of JohnWallStreet. “Our upcoming event will gather a collective of commissioners, ADs and investors specifically for the purpose of discussing the changing economics and where PE or private capital can fit into the equation. The insights shared at this event would make headlines—except no one is reporting on it. The only way to hear where the industry is moving is to be in the room.”

The financial and operational pressures brought on in the new NIL era are exposing cracks in the traditional structures of athletic departments. The lack of investment in multiple areas, including human capital, real estate development and rights commercialization are limiting how schools extract value from their IP. Attendees at this gathering will learn how strategic capital is –and can be- used effectively, and the risks associated with taking it on at a university or conference level, from those driving the industry forward.
