Engineered for unparalleled performance, precision, and sustainability, this new model is set to change large-scale landscaping across diverse industries.

Reimagined for Market Leadership

Graze’s next-generation mower has been rebuilt from the ground up to address high-demand use cases, including golf course greenkeeping, solar farm maintenance, and commercial airfield vegetation management. With advanced features such as GPS-based route creation, LiDAR odometry for complex terrains, and a teach-and-repeat mapping mode for precision navigation, this mower offers unmatched functionality in autonomous landscaping.

Phil Duffy, Chief Operating and Product Officer at Graze Robotics, stated, “Our robotic mower sets a new standard for durability, functionality, and environmental responsibility. It represents the future of commercial landscaping, delivering exceptional value and performance for professionals who demand the best.”

Key Product Innovations

The new model incorporates cutting-edge technology and features, including:

* Advanced Navigation: GPS-based routing, LiDAR odometry, and multiple map-creation modes ensure precision mowing, even in the most challenging environments.
* Eco-Friendly Operations: Quiet, all-electric performance meets local noise ordinances while reducing carbon emissions, aligning with the growing demand for sustainable solutions.
* Remote Management: Real-time fleet tracking, remote diagnostics, and over-the-air updates simplify maintenance and optimize performance.
* ​​Streamlined User Experience: A redesigned interface simplifies setup, mapping, and route optimization, making operation intuitive even for complex tasks.
* Enhanced Safety and Efficiency: Dust-resistant vision sensors, optimized ground clearance, and a safety-compliant battery system enable reliable operation across varied terrains.
* Scalable Technology: Powered by the ROS 2.0 operating system and a robust compute module, the mower is designed for seamless scalability and cost-effective operation.
* Self-Charging and Auto-Deploy (Coming Mid-2025): Automatically docks and recharges between tasks, ensuring continuous and hassle-free performance.

Production and Scaling Plans

Graze Robotics will begin production in Q1 2025, with initial deliveries of 15 units to key customers scheduled for Q1 and Q2. This phased rollout will provide valuable feedback as the Company refines its processes in preparation for mass production. A second Design for Manufacture (DFM) phase will commence in mid-2025, focusing on cost reduction and optimization ahead of a full-scale production launch in 2026.

Positioned for Growth in a $70 Billion Market

With the global commercial landscaping industry valued at $70 billion¹, Graze’s autonomous mower addresses critical challenges, such as rising labor costs and sustainability demands. By offering a Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, the Company ensures consistent ROI for customers through predictable subscription fees. Graze projects significant growth as it ramps up production, with plans to scale manufacturing efficiency and expand its market footprint.

Graze is also exploring new industrial design directions to elevate the mower’s aesthetic appeal and ergonomic performance. These initiatives aim to solidify the Company’s position as the leading provider of innovative, high-performance solutions for autonomous commercial landscaping.
