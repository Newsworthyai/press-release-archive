# America First News Expands Global Coverage with New Bureau in Greenland

America First News (AFN), the premier voice for U.S. economic freedom and global opportunity, proudly announces it will be opening its newest international bureau in Greenland. This expansion reinforces AFN’s commitment to on-the-ground reporting and global economic storytelling through an American lens.

The Greenland bureau will be staffed by a dedicated correspondent producing monthly feature stories focused on the region’s natural resources, economic potential, and strategic importance. Coverage will explore how increased U.S.-Greenland cooperation—and potential future acquisition of the territory—could benefit the people of Greenland through investment, infrastructure, and long-term economic partnership.

“Greenland holds immense untapped potential, and the world deserves deeper coverage of how its future could align with American economic leadership,” said Heather Mullins, News Director of America First News. “Our new bureau will shine a light on opportunities for prosperity and self-determination that a closer alliance with the United States could bring to the Greenlandic people.”

AFN’s reporting will spotlight Greenland’s rare earth minerals, renewable energy assets, and emerging role in Arctic geopolitics. It will also examine how a closer relationship with the United States could enhance prosperity, autonomy, and opportunity for the Greenlandic people.

The first feature from the Greenland bureau will debut in September 2025.
