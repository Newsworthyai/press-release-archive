The Sui (Crypto: SUI) token has remained in the spotlight for several weeks now due to its impressive price movement. However, following the recent market downturn, SUI price suffered a notable decline that sent it below the monthly resistance level of around $4.20. While it continues to trade below $4, recent price movement hints at an imminent rebound.

Meanwhile, Sui token isn’t the only altcoin with a bullish tendency. Fast-rising presale star, Elluminex (ELX) also shares the same sentiment considering the growing interest in the presale market. More specifically, Elluminex aims to redefine DeFi on the TON blockchain; and, as a pioneering cross-bridge protocol, interest in its native $ELX token has been steadily increasing.

Elluminex’s Appeal As A Modern Cross-Chain Bridge Solution Draws Massive InterestElluminex (ELX) is not only gaining popularity because of its plans to revolutionize DeFi on the TON blockchain. Instead, its main allure lies in its DeFi hub which also includes a cross-chain bridge solution for existing and prospective TON projects. Similar to what Uniswap did for Ethereum, and PancakeSwap for Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Elluminex is set to herald the next multi-billion dollar projects on the TON blockchain.

To achieve this, Elluminex combines the tokenomics of its native $ELX token, AI-driven insights, proprietary premarket features, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. While it also doubles as a DeFi powerhouse, the new platform also features various lucrative tools including a comprehensive DEX protocol, an AI-powered portfolio tracker, and an advanced staking and farming mechanism.

These, coupled with its cross-chain liquidity solutions for TON-based projects and proprietary premarket features set it apart from its traditional counterparts. Specifically, Elluminex’s premarket feature offers users early access to TON projects before they go public, thereby offering them an unfair advantage in becoming profitable. Currently priced at $0.06, the native $ELX token holds a massive potential to debut as the next bullish token.

Sui Price Trajectory Exhibits Signs Of Recovery Amid Market DownturnThe past month has been a rollercoaster of emotions for Sui (SUI) token holders. The top altcoin registered multiple all-time highs (ATH) with the latest recorded on the 6th of January at $5.35. However, this historic high was subsequently followed by a severe fluctuation that led to a series of highs and lows in SUI prices.

Since it hit an ATH, SUI price have dipped below the $5 mark and reclaimed it on multiple attempts, until the recent price retracement that sent it below $4. Currently trading within a week-to-date price range of $4.17 and $3.82, SUI price reflects a little decline in the past week, and a bit more in the past month.

Despite the obvious decline in price, the SUI token has made a significant recovery from its monthly lowest price point of around $3.53, which shows a sign of resilience amidst the current market reality. Notably, popular crypto analyst Alpha Crypto Signal claimed that the Sui price has returned to its support zone, where the price action remains promising. He added that holding above this level is a positive sign, and a bounce from this zone appears likely.

Elluminex vs. Sui: What Do They Have In Common?Unlike Sui Network which is mainly a layer-1 designed to optimize the performance of decentralized applications in terms of scalability and speed, Elluminex operates solely as a DeFi hub with cross-chain capabilities.

While they are both fundamentally different, both crypto projects are exceptional in terms of their innovation. Elluminex in particular is expanding DeFi capabilities on the TON blockchain while ensuring easy accessibility for all users of TON projects, just as SUI is doing for dApps.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
