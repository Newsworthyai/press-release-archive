Newsweek named Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a leading provider of post-acute brain injury and stroke rehabilitation services, one of America’s Greatest Midsize Workplaces for 2025. CNS is the only neurorehabilitation provider listed in the healthcare category, achieving a 5-star rating.

“We are incredibly honored to receive this recognition from Newsweek,” said David Harrington, president and CEO of CNS. “At Centre for Neuro Skills, we believe a great workplace not only is built on trust, respect and a shared commitment to growth but also fosters an environment where every employee can thrive, contribute and feel valued. This recognition is a testament to the power of our collective team’s dedication, collaboration and passion.”

To determine award recipients, Newsweek partnered with Plant-A Insights to analyze more than 3.5 million online employee reviews and public data for 9,000 companies employing 500-1,000 individuals. A third-party data provider, Aniline, then leveraged its database of more than 120 key performance indicators, including leadership, integrity, compensation, career development, culture and belonging and work-life balance, to gain a comprehensive view of workplace performance and satisfaction for U.S.-based companies.

CNS, with seven locations across California and Texas, recently announced a new location – its fifth in Texas – opening in late 2025 in Plano. The new clinic at 1640 Dallas Parkway Suite 3000 will include the full set of CNS services, including programs for vision, neurobehavior, cognitive retraining, speech, physical and occupational therapy with certified, highly trained clinical therapy staff. It will also feature advanced care technology, such as the ZeroG® Gait and Balance System and a Bioness Integrated Therapy System to aid in vision, motor and balance training.

Focused on patient-tailored care and maximizing patient outcomes, CNS offers residential inpatient, day treatment, telerehabilitation and continued care programs to help patients regain independence through community reintegration and life skills building. Learn more about CNS’ programs here.
