# Financial Gravity Welcomes New Family Office Director Will Sparks

Financial Gravity Companies, Inc. (OTC: FGCO) (“Financial Gravity”) welcomes Will Sparks aboard as a new Family Office Director.

A native of Midland, Texas, Will returns home after spending several years in Austin, bringing with him a heart for service and a passion for financial planning.

“Finance can be overwhelming,” Will says, “but my goal is to help families feel confident about retirement, legacy planning, and their financial future.”

Will brings a fresh perspective to the industry, blending a long-term mindset with a client-centered approach. Rather than pushing a one-size-fits-all plan, he works alongside clients to tailor strategies that align with their goals and relationships.

Now living full-time in Midland, Will is committed to building relationships across West Texas. “In a time where we can Zoom and call, a handshake and being in person has only gotten more valuable,” he shares. Will Sparks is ready to bring thoughtful financial guidance—and a genuine West Texas handshake—to families and communities throughout the region.

As a Family Office Director, Will is responsible for prescribing advanced tax solutions and ensuring his network of partners fill those solutions with fidelity to his plans. Hereliesy on the experts at Financial Gravity, Inc., a true partner- not just a vendor- who helps him deliver lower costs, higher tax efficiency, more comprehensive diversification, and more transparent risk management.

Will shared, “My favorite part of the job is serving folks and giving them the best service I possibly can. I wanted to be in a spot where I could give the same level of care and service and have the same level of support to back me up, no matter where the client’s current situation sits. Everyone wants to have a team to fully back them up, and I believe Financial Gravity brings the support that I need.”

A Texas A&M graduate with a background in general business and minors in history and agricultural economics, Will has always been driven by a desire to serve others. His involvement in the Young Life ministry during college helped shape his mission: to meet people where they are and walk with them through important life planning decisions

Financial Gravity CEO Scott Winters shared, "We are excited to welcome Will to the Financial Gravity team. His vision of helping and serving others perfectly aligns with ours. Together, we will help ensure more families can benefit from our conflict-free plans."
