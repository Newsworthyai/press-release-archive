# TheLinkU and NIL Sports Attorney Mit Winter Partner to Launch First-Of-Its-Kind Revenue Share Execution Model for College Athletes

TheLinkU, the premier NIL platform focused on simplifying and enhancing opportunities for college athletes and institutions, announced today its fully integrated revenue-sharing model and third-party program through strategic collaboration with renowned sports attorney Mit Winter. With almost two decades of experience focusing on sports law, Winter is one of the foremost experts and sought-after voices on the legal and regulatory issues in the ever-evolving NIL and college athletics landscape. The partnership is set to redefine collegiate athletics as it equips universities with the tools, legal frameworks, and cutting-edge technology necessary to implement effective revenue-sharing models. This will ensure that athletes are fairly compensated for their contributions to their colleges while maintaining integrity and compliance with a constantly shifting regulatory environment.

The new offering comes at a pivotal moment in collegiate athletics, coinciding with the anticipated approval of the House settlement and the start of revenue sharing with student-athletes.

“College athletics is on the brink of major transformation. This change brings new regulatory and compliance challenges, but it also presents an opportunity for universities to differentiate themselves in their support of athletes’ NIL efforts, in operational practices, and in revenue-sharing program structure,” said Winter. “I’m happy to help TheLinkU provide universities with solutions that streamline implementation, reduce costs, and drive operational efficiencies, allowing institutions to provide unmatched support for their athletes and navigate the changing landscape of college athletics with confidence and success.”

TheLinkU's comprehensive and innovative SaaS revenue-sharing and General Manager (GM) platform models allow colleges to streamline and optimize opportunities for their athletes, making them easier to manage while ensuring the sustainability of their NIL programs. Focusing on compliance and athlete support, TheLinkU also fosters sustainable revenue generation for universities through more than 30 strategic business partnerships. By leveraging these partnerships, TheLinkU decreases the need for donor contributions and creates long-term financial opportunities, enabling athletic departments to achieve NIL success while maintaining financial stability.

"College administrators and athletic directors are increasingly facing uphill challenges involving financial, legal, regulatory, and commercial unknowns as they try to put together competitive teams on the field or court,” said Austin Elrod, founder and president of TheLinkU. “As the entire market seemingly shifts weekly, the administrators that progressively look to technology to integrate opportunities and remain compliant will create a strategic advantage against the administrators trying to operate as they did in a pre-NIL world. Mit is an institution and a true pioneer in the NIL marketplace. By combining his legal and regulatory expertise and TheLinkU’s market-leading technology, we’ve created the most comprehensive solution that prioritizes compliance, fairness, and financial empowerment for athletes nationwide."
