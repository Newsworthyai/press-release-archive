Kraken, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges renowned for its rigorous compliance standards, has officially listed JUST (JST), the native governance token of the JUST ecosystem. JUST is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on the TRON network, which consists of multiple products, including stablecoin and multi-asset lending platforms, JustStable and JustLend. The listing introduces JST/USD and JST/EUR trading pairs. In addition to the listing on Kraken, a Reef Program airdrop campaign of $90,000 worth of JST tokens has been launched.

JUST Ecosystem: Powering TRON's DeFi Infrastructure

JUST, launched in 2020 by the JUST Foundation, is the first comprehensive DeFi ecosystem on the TRON network. Centered around the JST token, the JUST ecosystem includes various DeFi solutions like JustStable, JustLend DAO, Staked TRX (sTRX), Energy Rental, and JustCrypto. As of March 2025, with over $310 million in market cap and a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $8 billion, JUST (JST) exemplifies its strong performance within the TRON ecosystem. Since its launch, JUST has reached several significant milestones.

2020: Initial Launch of JUST

* Pioneered JustLend DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform built on TRON. Holding a TVL of $5.7 billion standing as one of the largest lending platforms.
* Launched USDJ, a decentralized stablecoin fully backed on the TRON blockchain.
* JUST (JST) was listed on major exchanges such as Binance and Upbit, marking JUST's initial market entry.

2024: JUST’s Global Expansion

The listing on Kraken also signals growing confidence in JST’s underlying protocol and its long-term utility within decentralized finance. As part of the broader JUST ecosystem, JST serves as a foundational asset supporting stablecoin issuance, lending, and governance. This development reinforces JUST’s position as a key contributor to the TRON network’s expanding DeFi infrastructure.
