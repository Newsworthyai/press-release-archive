Between 2023 and 2024 Pepe (PEPE) took the spotlight with a legendary rally that minted more than a few millionaires along the way, finding its place in the top 20 of the crypto leaderboard. However, as investors’ attention is shifting toward utility-driven projects, Pepe is quickly falling to the wayside as its price action continues to stall. Newcomer Cutoshi (CUTO) could soon mimic Pepe’s memorable run as it leverages its complex DeFi ecosystem to thrive in times of heightened turbulence. Let’s dive deeper and discover why Cutoshi could be this year’s big success story.

Meme Onslaught Continues, Pepe Experiences Steep DeclineOver the last 24 hours Pepe (PEPE) has continued to lose ground as most altcoins have started to recover. Currently, Pepe sells for $0.000012, a level unseen since November of last year. Pepe’s monthly losses now stand at over 30%, with a total decline of nearly 60% since it peaked at $0.000028 in December.

However, while Pepe holders are panicking, trader and analyst CryptoPepe brings some reassurance. He points out that these drops in the Pepe price have been occurring every time Pepe rose to a new peak, meaning that not only the bottom should be in, but a reversal could take place soon.

While some technical indicators are flashing buy signals, such as the daily RSI entering oversold territory at 31 points, many Pepe investors are opting to cut their losses and diversify. Some of them are rotating funds into Cutoshi’s presale which is gaining viral status on social media, also thanks to the efforts of community members as part of the Cutoshi Farming initiative.

What Makes Cutoshi Is Different Than Other Meme CoinsMost memes fail in the long run for a very simple reason, they lack a real use case and once the hype fades away they quickly become irrelevant and plummet in value. This is why Cutoshi emerges as a promising outlier that could redefine the meme coin narrative.

At the heart of Cutoshi is CUTO DEX, this is a decentralized exchange that allows for seamless swaps across all major blockchains, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. With privacy and decentralization being a crucial part of Cutoshi’s values, users will not be required to compromise sensitive data or rely on middlemen when it comes to the management of their assets.

Users who engage with the ecosystem will have the opportunity to earn significant monetary rewards via the Cutoshi Farming model. During and after the presale, they will be tasked to complete various missions aimed at expanding Cutoshi’s presence in the crypto space. In exchange, they will receive CUTO points that can later be traded in for $CUTO tokens. Moreover, once the option is available, holders will also have the opportunity to stake their $CUTO and earn passive income with market-beating APYs.

One of Cutoshi’s most interesting features is the Cutoshi Academy, a learning hub that seeks to lend a helping hand to beginners. In the academy, users will find a ton of free resources that demystify key concepts such as DeFi, and teach the basics of trading and portfolio management. This system is already garnering significant praise, as it champions crypto adoption while fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment.

The fourth stage of the $CUTO presale is now live and the token sells for just $0.031. Once Cutoshi hits the markets and the token is listed on major exchanges, early adopters could soon see a repeat of Pepe’s memorable performance and lock in life-changing returns.
