Veteran traders know that in a bull run, dips are for buying, and those who buy the blood are positioning themselves for massive gains once the most euphoric phase of the cycle kicks in.

This article will explore what opportunities lie ahead for Binance Coin (BNB) and Pepe (PEPE) as they both seem to have bottomed out and buy signals are now flashing.

A new entry, Cutoshi (CUTO) is also gaining traction with its unique premise that brings together the best aspects of BNB and Pepe. Namely, DeFi capabilities and meme energy. Discover why Cutoshi could become one of the most explosive plays of 2025 and why it could mimic Pepe’s memorable run.

BNB Reenters Range Highs, What’s Next?Binance Coin (BNB) has demonstrated incredible resilience throughout 2024 as its price remained relatively stable during the most bearish summer months. Even amid the recent corrections, the BNB price recorded minor fluctuations, as it rebounded quickly from the $641 bottom with a V-shaped recovery. Today, BNB trades at $673 following a 1.7% intraday increase, which allowed it to offset its recent losses which amount to just 2.7% for the week.

Crypto analyst Batman has shared a BNB chart reading on X detailing how the token’s price continues to bounce off an ascending trendline, offering a visual interpretation of its bullish momentum on a larger time frame. While the current market climate is one of pervading uncertainty with a tint of pessimism, it appears undeniable that BNB is poised to see a massive upward expansion that could see it soar above the prophesied $1,000 milestone. However, for this thesis to be confirmed bulls need to reclaim the $700 resistance, with the next target being BNB’s $793 all-time high.

Pepe Is Selling At A Discount, Is Now The Time To Buy?Pepe faced considerable disruption over the past few weeks as the seemingly rock-solid support at $0.000020 gave in, which led to Pepe entering a steep descending channel. At the time of writing, Pepe is trading for $0.000012 with a 1.2% intraday increase, and while the price seems to be consolidating around this mark, its total monthly losses now amount to over 30%.

While some investors are panicking, CoinMarketCap’s sentiment gauge shows that 88% of Pepe holders are bullish as selling pressure has started easing off. Analyst CryptoPepe has recently shared some bullish insights regarding Pepe’s price action, as he points out that every time Pepe soars to a new all-time high, its short-term price structure breaks down, resulting in a sharp drop. However, on a macro level, Pepe is still respecting the uptrend and once the dust settles, a reversal could be in the cards.

Cutoshi: The Best Of Both WorldsWith its focus on utility, Cutoshi seeks to break the curse of meme coins that are purely fueled by hype and tend to break down after the first major sell-off. Cutoshi’s comprehensive DeFi ecosystem is designed to ensure longevity not just in this current cycle, but for years to come. Just like Shiba Inu did, thanks to features like Shibarium and Shibaswap that placed it ahead of the curve and funneled significant revenue back into the network..

Cutoshi’s main goal is to foster a sense of community, and belonging. For this reason, the Cutoshi Farm initiative was envisioned, offering users the chance to reap substantial monetary rewards while helping spread awareness about the project. During and after the presale, they will be tasked to complete various missions aimed at solidifying Cutoshi’s presence in the crypto space. For their efforts, they will receive CUTO points that can later be exchanged for $CUTO tokens. More than 3,000 participants have farmed over 2.1 million $CUTO and hundreds more are joining every day. Readers are invited to head over to the official website if they want to learn more and start farming!

Another intriguing feature that sets Cutoshi apart from competitors is the Cutoshi Academy. This is an educational platform that will help beginners navigate the intricacies of crypto while teaching them the basics of trading, investing, and the ins and outs of DeFi.

At the center of the Cutoshi ecosystem is CUTO DEX, a cutting-edge, non-custodial exchange that will allow for seamless swaps across all major blockchains. Not only will users be able to perform lightning-fast cross-chain transactions, but they will also have another way of earning money by either staking their $CUTO or providing liquidity.

Once Cutoshi hits the markets, a repeat of the memorable Pepe run could be on the cards, powered by Cutoshi’s unique MemeFi formula that is set to take the market by storm. Take action before the next price increase and lock in generational returns!
