The crypto market has been a rollercoaster of emotions with the recent market downturn forcing savvy traders to reconsider their existing positions. Notably, top altcoins Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX) have been faced with severe fluctuation in recent times, resulting in a significant price drop.

While many crypto enthusiasts explore new profit avenues, this new presale gem– Cutoshi (CUTO) has been on the receiving end of the attention. As a result, the new DeFi-backed memecoin has attracted a large following in its presale.

Cutoshi’s DeFi Capabilities Sparks Optimism Among Early BackersAsides its potential for a 100X rally with at least 100% ROI for early backers, Cutoshi (CUTO)’s main allure lies within its unified DeFi ecosystem inspired by the popular Chinese Lucky Cat associated with good fortune as well as Satoshi Nakamoto’s teachings. As such, it embodies the values of decentralization, privacy, and monetary freedom, all of which aims to bring DeFi to everyday people while taking autonomy of the same from the government.

While it is based on the Ethereum network, the Cutoshi ecosystem’s integration of DeFi distinguishes it from most meme-based platforms. Notably, the ecosystem consists of a multi chain DEX protocol, a farming mechanism, and a dedicated Cutoshi Academy that aims to bring DeFi to the masses. Additionally, users are rewarded with complimentary gift items such as NFTs and Cutoshi Merch whenever they engage and complete specific quests.

Meanwhile, Cutoshi’s native currency– $CUTO token powers the entire operation within the ecosystem, from facilitating transactions within the learning academy, to powering Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. Currently, the native $CUTO token sells for $0.031 in its fourth presale stage, representing an over 100% price increase from its launch price of $0.015. This development, coupled with its presence on CoinMarketCap, sets Cutoshi up for further growth throughout its ICO journey and after.

Avalanche Token Risks Extended Consolidation Phase Following a recent price decline in the past week, Avalanche (AVAX) price is now at risk of further retracement if the current support becomes invalidated. Currently trading within a weekly price range of $37.55 and $33.33, Avalanche price reflects nearly 12% decline in the past week.

This price retracement has led to a break of structure below the monthly support level around $33.50, which poses a great risk of an extended consolidation should AVAX token fails to break out of the current resistance.

However, the probability for a breakout appears unlikely in the short term considering that AVAX token’s technical analysis such as the 20, 100 and 200 day EMAs and SMAs points at a strong sell. Regardless, a neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals a potential reversal, especially if the current support zone holds.

Chainlink Price Fluctuates Amid Struggle To Hold Above Support Level The price of Chainlink (LINK) has been fluctuating severely in the past week, resulting in a 10% decline and a shrinkened 11% monthly gain. While the recent volatility in LINK price can be attributed to the broader market downturn, a closer look at the monthly chart reveals a noticeable constraint to break out of the support zone.

However, despite recent retracement, Chainlink price still maintains a generally bullish outlook. Aside from retaining over 60% price gain in the past year, Chainlink price trajectory has attracted a lot of positive predictions.

Notably, popular crypto analysis account on X, Trading Lounge highlights a potential breakout for LINK price using Elliott Wave Analysis. The account added that a breakout above $26.40 would confirm the beginning of a bullish trend. Meanwhile, Chainlink’s technical analysis including mid-term and long-term EMAs and SMAs signals a strong buy, ultimately positioning it as a top crypto coin to buy now.

Can Cutoshi Deliver More Gains Than Avalanche and Chainlink This Bull Cycle?Not only is Cutoshi capable of delivering enormous gains due to its hybrid approach, its DeFi capabilities also position it as equally valuable cryptocurrency as top altcoins like Avalanche and Chainlink. Besides, Cutoshi’s presale status offers a more stable trajectory compared to AVAX and LINK tokens with higher volatility.
