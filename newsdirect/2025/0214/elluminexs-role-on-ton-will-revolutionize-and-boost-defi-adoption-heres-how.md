# Elluminex’s Role On TON Will Revolutionize And Boost DeFi Adoption, Here’s How

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/729464635/fsS2Vx7P.jpg)

Elluminex (ELX) is set to spearhead the DeFi revolution on the TON blockchain just in the same manner that Uniswap did for Ethereum and PancakeSwap for Finance Smart Chain (BSC). This development marks the latest attempt at the transition to a fully decentralized financial global economy.

According to Forbes, the DeFi market will be worth well over $450B in 2030, representing an estimated triple growth from the current market size. While this presents a lot of economic opportunity, Elluminex is set to drive this growth by exploring an untapped market on the TON blockchain.

Like other blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and so on, the TON chain also requires cross-chain networks to thrive. And that’s exactly what Elluminex is set to provide for the rapidly growing network, especially now that it is still at the foundational stage.

Elluminex To Leverage TON’s Massive User Base While Elluminex seeks to drive massive adoption for the TON chain, it is also not left out in the value chain. One of the most notable advantages for Elluminex in this case is its exposure to TON Network's massive user base.

Although TON Network currently accounts for over 10 million active users, its association with Telegram which boasts more than 1 billion active users presents far more growth potential. Besides, Elluminex’s role on the TON chain includes converting the majority of these Telegram users into active on-chain participants by providing seamless access to lucrative DeFi tools and opportunities.

How Exactly Does Elluminex Want To Boost DeFi Activities On The TON Chain?Elluminex combines its native $ELX token, AI-driven insights, and proprietary premarket features as a perfect recipe to revolutionize DeFi on the TON chain, while championing security, speed, and scalability. This way, Elluminex not only improves asset management and trading as a whole but also ensures that both new and experienced users have equal shots at becoming profitable.

Meanwhile, doubling as a cross-chain bridge, Elluminex also provides TON-based projects with cross-chain solutions including enormous liquidity required to thrive therein. This simply implies that beyond offering cross-chain interoperability, Elluminex also aims to expand access to DeFi among developers and retail users. Notably, Elluminex houses various features including an AI-powered portfolio tracker that streamlines the overall DeFi experience for both new and experienced users.

The platform also offers other key solutions such as a comprehensive DEX protocol, advanced staking and farming mechanism, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. With Elluminex in place, more projects can launch on the TON chain; they can leverage the platform’s cross-chain and bridging solutions as well as the vast liquidity required to thrive on the TON Network.

Can Elluminex Deliver Exponential Return This Bull Cycle?Considering its lucrative features, as well as the untapped potential on the TON chain, Elluminex, and its native $ELX token hold great potential to debut as the next bullish token. However, determining whether that will happen during this bull cycle may be far-fetched.

While Elluminex is projected to scale rapidly alongside the TON network, early backers stand a chance to make significant gains as soon as the token goes public on CEX and DEX platforms. Currently priced at $0.06, the native $ELX token holds great potential to debut as the next bullish token.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
