Dogecoin (DOGE) is making headlines once again as large-scale holders, or “whales,” have begun hoarding huge quantities of the token. In the last 48 hours, these whales have accumulated roughly 110 million DOGE worth approximately $27.5 million. DOGE is gaining traction as a long-term product, especially in the context of redirects to its institutional adaptation.

This influx speaks of increasing confidence in the long-term potential of Dogecoin and other memecoins like the recently popular Cutoshi (CUTO) which is expected to be the next memefi coin set for 100x growth.

Reasons Behind Dogecoin’s Upward TrendAside from the whale activity, Dogecoin also has seen a significant network activity increase, reports TheCoinRepublic. On-chain data shows that active addresses have increased by 34% to 6.57 million users in the last month.

Another major factor that is making Dogecoin appealing is Institutional interest. Grayscale Investments own Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which is part of a new series of Digital Commodities, in which DOGE now takes a seat, marking the newest stage in its growth from a meme token to a tangible digital asset class.

Meanwhile, the Dogecoin Foundation has partnered with U.S. investors to incorporate Dogecoin payments into the mainstream businesses and sporting events. These initiatives suggest a step towards real-world application, a shift that could improve Dogecoin’s position in the market beyond its meme coin status.

As of Feb 23. 2025 DOGE is sitting at $0.241, down 1.6% from what it was yesterday. The token hit an intraday high of $0.2475, with resistance limiting additional advances.

Meme Coins Are Evolving—Cutoshi Heralds New EraWhile Dogecoin’s popularity is soaring once more, the meme coin space is seeing the rise of other innovative projects that combine meme culture with real-use cases. One such project, Cutoshi, is a meme coin built on Satoshi Nakamoto's principles and represents the Chinese Lucky Cat.

Built with full-fledged decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, Cutoshi sets itself apart from other memecoins due to the CUTO token’s in-built scarcity, and its planned roadmap with CEX listings after presale.

All of these factors are expected to increase demand amongst traders and drive upward pressure on the CUTO price, with some analysts even predicting it may outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in growth in 2025.

At the heart of Cutoshi's offering is its multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows users to swap assets across different blockchains in a private and secure way. This functionality provides solutions to interoperability issues, enabling users to control a plethora of digital assets on the same platform seamlessly.

With every transaction, a 0.25% fee goes to the DEX, which distributes 80% to the associated liquidity providers and 20% to fulfill token buybacks and burns that also support the token value.

Alongside the DEX, Cutoshi presents "Cutoshi Quests and Farming," a gamified yield farming venture. Through missions, achievements and rewards, this program drives community engagement and creates cohesion in addition to creating revenue streams for passive income. Participants receive “Cutopoints” that can be redeemed for a number of benefits inside the ecosystem.

The 8,000 NFTs, limited series designed to reward early adopters and active community members, will also be launched by Cutoshi. These NFTs provide DeFi utility and are not just simple collectibles, and their rarities and use cases would add more value to the ecosystem.

At present, Cutoshi is in Stage 5 of its presale, with each $CUTO token going for $0.0487. The project has already amassed over $2 million, demonstrating considerable trader appetite. Notably, 55% of the total 440 million token supply is designated for the presale, providing significant community ownership from day one and making Cutoshi stand out as a strong long-term investment option.
