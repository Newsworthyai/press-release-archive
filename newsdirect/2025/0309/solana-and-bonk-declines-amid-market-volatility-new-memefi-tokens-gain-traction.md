# Solana and BONK Declines Amid Market Volatility; New MemeFi Tokens Gain Traction

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/127321215/Hb9XhIlS.jpeg)

Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK) face turbulence as market volatility shakes trader confidence. Solana dropped 15% in three days, trading at $159.54, while BONK plummeted to $0.000017, erasing 2024 gains.

Amid this uncertainty, Cutoshi ($CUTO), a meme coin blending DeFi utilities with cultural lore, surges in presale momentum. Its Stage 5/6 has raised over $2,017,145.008, backed by a Solidproof audit and deflationary tokenomics.

Solana’s Rollercoaster and BONK’s Fall from GraceSolana’s recent 414% transaction volume spike to $13.07 billion contrasts sharply with its price struggles. Despite bullish indicators like trading above key EMAs, Solana faces resistance at $270. Analysts attribute the dip to profit-taking and $15 million in liquidations.

If Solana can hold above 160.95, it might push up to around 183.50 or even hit the 201.25 to 209.10 range. However, a drop below 160.95 could decline Solana further, targeting lower levels. For now, Solana prices should stay between 160.95 and 183.50 for a bit.

At the 160.95 level, there could be a possible bounce, which could be a good buying opportunity, especially with targets near 183.50 or higher. A Twitter expert mentions being careful around the 201.25 to 209.10 Solana price range, as some selling pressure might be there.

Meanwhile, BONK, once a Solana ecosystem star, collapsed to pre-rally levels. As of Feb 2-25, BONK has demonstrated the volatility typical of memecoins.

Unlike Solana, BONK hit a peak price of $0.00005825 three months ago on Nov 20th. Right now, BONK is down 74.30% from that all-time high. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume for BONK was $63,151,910, showing a 7.00% drop from yesterday. This drop suggests people aren't trading as much. Also, over the past week, BONK's price fell by 13.00%, indicating it's not doing too well.

Traders increasingly pivot toward tokens offering stability through utility—a shift Cutoshi leverages with its multi-chain DEX and token burns.

Cutoshi’s Meme + DeFi Substance vs. Solana and BONKCutoshi draws from the Maneki-neko legend, where a beckoning cat saved a 17th-century samurai from lightning, later enriching his temple. Another tale tells of a penniless Tokyo widow whose clay cat figurines reversed her fortune. These stories anchor Cutoshi’s ethos: blending luck with empowerment.

As the Maneki-neko became a global prosperity symbol, Cutoshi merges meme charm with DeFi tools. Its NFTs, limited to 8,000 pieces, honor early adopters, echoing the Lucky Cat’s role in community fortune.

Cutoshi’s tokenomics sidestep memecoin pitfalls. Unlike Solana, with 440 million $CUTO and a 7% burn, Cutoshi’s scarcity mimics Bitcoin’s early days. The presale allocates 55% of Cutoshi tokens, fostering community ownership.

Unlike BONK’s infinite supply, Cutoshi has a capped model, which helps prevent inflation. Cutoshi’s ecosystem has yield farming opportunities, and an academy, making it attractive to both casual and serious traders. For instance, the DEX’s 0.25% fee funds liquidity providers and burns, rewarding participation while tightening supply.

This balance of fun and function positions $CUTO as a “MemeFi” hybrid, resonating amid Solana’s technical woes.

Solana vs. BONK vs. Cutoshi: Which is The Right Hedge for 2025?While Solana and BONK reel, Cutoshi’s presale success signals a shift toward tokens with tangible utility. Its token burns, educational platform, and cross-chain DEX address gaps left by speculative memecoins. Unlike Solana and BONK, Cutoshi’s Lucky Cat lore adds cultural depth, transforming $CUTO from a joke into a movement. As SOL eyes $280 and BONK seeks footing, analysts liken Cutoshi’s trajectory to Shiba Inu’s 2021 rise—but with audits and scarcity as safeguards. In a volatile market, Cutoshi isn’t just chasing trends; it’s building a bridge between memes and meaningful DeFi adoption.
