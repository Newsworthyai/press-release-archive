# Vertical IQ Sets The Bar With New Canada-Specific Industry Financial Benchmark Data

Industry Intelligence leader Vertical IQ has once again upped the ante on their value-added industry and economic content by incorporating new industry financial benchmark data specific to Canadian businesses. This enhancement complements the company’s existing Canada-focused industry content found in each of its comprehensive Industry Profile reports.

For Vertical IQ customers using the Canadian version of the organization’s comprehensive Industry Intelligence platform, this Canada-specific industry financial benchmark data enables accountants, bankers, insurance brokers, business consultants and more to assess how a business is performing relative to its domestic peers. Content from these insightful chapters can be easily printed and shared with business owners.

Reliable third-party sourcing

To ensure its veracity, Vertical IQ’s industry financial benchmark data is collected from reliable, unbiased third-party providers.

The content for the new Canadian Financial Benchmark chapter of Vertical IQ’s Industry Profiles is sourced from the Government of Canada's annual Financial Performance Data, which is based on industry averages for the nation.

The Canadian data is split into two revenue bands: $30,000 to $5 million and $5 million to $20 million. The financial benchmark content is then broken out into:

* Financial ratios, which include current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, debt ratio and return on assets
* An income statement
* A balance sheet, which includes an assets section, liabilities section and total equity metric

Vertical IQ’s Canada-specific industry financial benchmark data will be updated annually as new data is available.

Taking Industry Intelligence to the next level

This expansion of Vertical IQ’s Canadian platform to include a Canadian Financial Benchmark chapter and data as part of each Industry Profile report underscores Vertical IQ’s commitment to its customers’ needs and further sets the organization apart from its competitors.

“We know that accurate financial benchmark data provides business owners with a standard for improvement and goal-setting, helping them better understand how they stack up against their competitors,” explains Drake Branson, Director of Product at Vertical IQ. “Financial benchmarks also highlight key differences in resource management, which can improve efficiency, reduce costs and identify potential savings opportunities.”

But while the economies of the U.S. and Canada are similar in many ways, they are not identical. “An aluminum production business in Edmonton may have markedly different industry benchmarks than a similar business in Miami,” Branson continues. “That’s why, when our Canadian customers asked us to expand our industry financial benchmarks to include Canada-specific data, we knew it was important to make it happen.”
