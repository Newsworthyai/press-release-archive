# Westbound & Down Announces Reg CF Investment Opportunity to Support Expansion

Westbound & Down is a Colorado-based craft brewery known for its award-winning beer, hospitality-driven brewpubs, and strong retail presence. By combining direct-to-consumer brewpubs with a growing distribution footprint, the company has built a scalable model that reinforces customer loyalty and brand recognition while driving retail demand.

Since its founding, Westbound & Down has expanded to multiple locations across Colorado and built a retail presence in 298 bars/restaurants and 329 retail locations, including Whole Foods. The brewery has received 20+ industry awards from competitions like the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup. Its leadership team includes individuals with Michelin-star restaurant experience, bringing a high-level approach to food and service that differentiates its brewpubs.

Westbound & Down has also recently invested in substantial infrastructure and automation improvements, allowing for large scaling without substantial additional investment. Recent renovations and expansions allow the brewery to double production in as little as four months, positioning it to meet increasing demand.

To support future scaling efforts, Westbound & Down is launching a Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) investment opportunity, allowing supporters and investors to participate in the company’s next stage of growth. Funds raised will go toward:

* Increasing brewing capacity from 5,000 barrels in 2024 to 19,000 barrels by 2028
* Expanding distribution into six additional states, including California, Texas, and New York
* Growing its brewpub operations to strengthen its retail brand and customer loyalty

“We are excited to raise capital to meet demand through our recent expansion at our brewing facility while maintaining our sky-high quality expectations and choosing our own path by remaining independent,” CEO and director of brewing operations Jake Gardner said. “Beer is a drink of the people, and what better way to raise capital than through Reg CF that allows the community who drinks our beer and eats in our pubs to grow with us.”

While new breweries would require a $4-5 million investment to complete, Westbound & Down’s current infrastructure allows for quick scaling at a fraction of that cost. This insulates the company from new competition and puts it in a position to scale efficiently while maintaining high margins.

Westbound & Down’s Reg CF investment opportunity is now open. More information can be found at invest.westboundanddown.com
