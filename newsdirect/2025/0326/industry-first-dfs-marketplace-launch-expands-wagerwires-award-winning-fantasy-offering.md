# Industry-First DFS Marketplace launch expands WagerWire’s Award-Winning Fantasy Offering

Wire Industries, Inc., an award-winning technology and media company that owns and operates the revolutionary sports betting marketplace WagerWire, announced today the groundbreaking expansion of its FantasyWire subdivision. FantasyWire recently garnered recognition by winning awards from the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association (FSGA) for “Best Product Experience” and “Best Innovation”. The award for Product Experience was attributed to the FantasyWire Pickem trading marketplace which launched in partnership with RealTime Fantasy Sports in 2024 and broke new ground as the first-ever secondary marketplace for users to buy and sell DFS (daily fantasy sports) Pickem entries. Their Best Innovation win acknowledged FantasyWire’s robust pricing engine which powers the dynamic marketplace by allowing players to evaluate a live suggested sales price and deal score on any lineup they wish to sell or buy.

The overwhelming success of the Pickem entries marketplace laid the foundation to expand the offering to an even wider fantasy sports audience. And now, this latest release introduces DFS Pools to the secondary marketplace for the first time ever, further solidifying WagerWire’s position as a leader in the daily fantasy and sports betting industries. The DFS Pool marketplace will operate similarly to the Pickem marketplace. After a player builds a lineup and joins a particular pool, they will be able to sell a portion, or the entirety of the entry within the marketplace directly embedded into the RealTime Sports platform.

“Our users fell in love with the Pickem marketplace and took to it right away. The results were astounding, so creating a new user experience to increase the action and engagement for our users was a no-brainer,” said Tim Jensen, COO of RT Sports. “There is no other fantasy platform on the planet that allows you to turn your unique entries, both Pickem and pool based, into an asset by leveraging the real time value of that entry. RealTime Sports has been leading the way in terms of fantasy sports innovation since 1995, and our ultra-successful partnership with WagerWire solidifies that we're still the market leader in game-play, winnings, and innovation.”

The FantasyWire experience is powered by the same award-winning pricing engine from Pickem, but now enhanced to accommodate the complexities of a DFS Pool. The platform’s dynamic suggested pricing and deal scores empower users with unparalleled insights, ensuring players can maximize returns on their assets. The models are built on thousands of real-time simulations – which are constantly run both before the games and during the games as scores are changing – to calculate where entries will finish against their competitors within a specific pool. Based on these simulations, WagerWire’s data science team models the calculated probability, as well as a live and real-time dollar value for an entry, to help buyers and sellers' price and set the market accordingly.

Wire Media serves as the growth engine behind FantasyWire’s expanding product suite by inverting the traditional media model. Instead of relying on paid ads or celebrity endorsements, Wire Media tells the story of the fantasy entries and the people playing them, elevating users into influencers to organically drive engagement.

The expansion of the partnership and product has begun to make noise in the fantasy sports and gaming industry. With the news of this latest launch in partnership with RealTime Sports as well as the two 2025 FSGA awards, the industry acknowledged Wire Industries even further by electing cofounder and CEO Zach Doctor to the FSGA Board of Directors.

“One of the main missions behind the creation and founding of WagerWire is to provide liquidity and value to every form of gaming asset, from betting tickets, to Pickems, to contests. And DFS pools were the next asset class to be utilized,” said Zach Doctor, CEO of WagerWire. “Our industry recognition is proof that our products and offerings are truly cutting edge, reshaping the fantasy user experience and changing the expectations around the fantasy market forever.”
