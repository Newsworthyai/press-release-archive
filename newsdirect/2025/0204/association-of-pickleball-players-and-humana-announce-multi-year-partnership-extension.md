# ASSOCIATION OF PICKLEBALL PLAYERS AND HUMANA ANNOUNCE MULTI-YEAR PARTNERSHIP EXTENSION

The Association of Pickleball Players (APP) has announced a multi-year extension of its partnership with leading health and well-being company Humana Inc. as the official healthcare partner of the APP Tour. Humana has joined forces with the world’s first pickleball tour on a variety of initiatives, including the return of the season-long Humana Cup pro player competition and title sponsorship of the season-opening 2025 Humana APP Fort Lauderdale Open.

“We are proud to see our partnership continue to grow with Humana, who are steadfast supporters of pickleball and the sport’s role in a healthy lifestyle,” said APP Chief Revenue Officer Ryan McSpadden. “Together, we’ll continue to share the benefits of pickleball for staying active and maintaining good health, both on and off the court.”

"This exciting opportunity not only builds upon our already successful partnership with APP but also our strong commitment to putting health first for our members and the communities we serve," said Humana Chief Marketing Officer Jennifer Ilecki. “Supporting the APP – along with its groundbreaking initiatives and competitions – showcases the importance of staying active for both physical and mental fitness. Whether you are a professional player, new to the sport, or prefer to come out and watch or volunteer at a tournament, pickleball offers something for everyone.”

First introduced in 2024, the Humana Cup is the first-of-its-kind season-long team competition format exclusively for professional pickleball players in two divisions – Champions (50 and older) and Masters (60 and older). The 2025 Humana Cup will take place over seven APP Tour events throughout the country, with season-long prize money, and the title of Humana Cup champions up for grabs. Ten total Humana Cup teams competed in 2024, with full results available at theapp.global.

“The Humana Cup showcases some of the best pickleball players in the world and is a truly unique part of the APP Tour,” added APP Founder Ken Herrmann. “The competition brings intensity, camaraderie, and a level excitement you won’t find anywhere else at this level and with such an important group of players. May the best team win!”

1. APP Vlasic Classic – Daytona Beach | Feb. 4-9

The 2025 Humana Cup competition will feature six Champions pro teams of 14 players—seven men and seven women—and six Masters pro teams of 10 players—five men and five women—totaling 84 Champions players and 60 Masters players. Players will be drafted by team captains to their respective teams in the coming weeks.

The teams will go head-to-head in men’s doubles, women’s doubles and mixed doubles in a round-robin format for the majority of its 2025 events leading up to a semifinal weekend. The 2025 Humana Cup season will then conclude with a final weekend held at the APP’s global headquarters at The Fort in Fort Lauderdale to determine the overall Humana Cup team champions.
