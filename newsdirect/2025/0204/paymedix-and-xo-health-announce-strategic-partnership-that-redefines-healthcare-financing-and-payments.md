# PayMedix and XO Health Announce Strategic Partnership that Redefines Healthcare Financing and Payments

PayMedix, a leading healthcare financing and payments solutions provider, and XO Health, a pioneering value-based care and benefits platform dedicated to transforming healthcare for self-insured employers, today announced a strategic partnership that expands access to PayMedix’s healthcare financing solution to XO Health’s extensive network of self-insured employers, TPAs, and value-based providers.

XO Health members nationally will benefit from PayMedix’s interest-free payment plans that work for their unique financial situations and cover all in-network medical bills, up to their out-of-pocket maximum. All participating providers will benefit from prompt payment for both member and plan-pay portions of their claims. The partnership will help reduce costs and administrative inefficiencies.

“Our mission has always been to improve people’s ability to access and afford healthcare when they need it, while simultaneously removing the complexity and administrative burden of bill collection and processing from providers, and simplifying billing for patients,” said Tom Policelli, CEO of PayMedix. “Our partnership with XO Health aligns with this mission. We’re disrupting the way people access and pay for healthcare together.”

PayMedix creates a holistic healthcare payment experience and simplifies the process of billing for all parties involved – patients, providers, employers, and TPAs. Patients receive the benefit of flexible repayment plans that remove financial barriers to care. Providers benefit from prompt payment and a reduction in administrative costs. Employers benefit by improving their employees’ well-being, reinvigorating their benefits, and enhancing their employees’ medical experience through simplified statements. The result is employees across the credit spectrum access care earlier and more often, improving health equity and reducing overall cost.

XO Health is redefining how healthcare is delivered and paid for by dramatically expanding access to value-based care with new advanced payment models and a modern tech platform that completely rewires health plan operations, delivering a better healthcare experience to self-insured employers, level-funded plans and TPAs.

Key features of XO Health’s health plans include: provider networks built on trust and autonomy; secure, real-time data, and analytics powered by a cloud-native data and generative AI; a proprietary pricing and payments engine that enables the creation, pricing, and tracking of “smart care packages” in real time with full transparency into claims, pricing, and payments; and integrated member and provider tools that provide high-touch frictionless transactions and interactions for both plan members and providers.

“At XO Health, we believe that bringing trust, transparency, and common sense to healthcare requires foundational changes to how we pay for care,” said Swati Mathai, Co-founder and CEO, XO Health. “Our partnership with PayMedix enables us to deliver on this vision by offering a more straightforward approach to billing that prioritizes simplicity and fairness for both members and providers. By eliminating meaningless complexities of healthcare payments, it allows providers and members to focus on what’s truly important, better care and better health.”
