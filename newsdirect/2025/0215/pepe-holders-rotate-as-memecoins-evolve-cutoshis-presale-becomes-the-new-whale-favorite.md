2025 is still seeing the meme coin narrative going strong, with Trump and the family launching their meme tokens. However, what’s missing is the novelty factor.

PEPE, the second-largest meme coin on Ethereum, fell to key support earlier this month, as did the other meme coins. The silver lining is tokens like Cutoshi, which is still in its presale and is bringing fun meme culture and sound financial incentives together for its community.

PEPE loses Key Support Levels Though PEPE has bounced back from its monthly lows, the meme coin has yet to chart a victory run. The $1 target for 2025 is far from achievable, given that PEPE’s price still stands at $0.00001035.

However, PEPE’s futures open interest has risen for the past four days, and daily volumes remain considerably higher. The signs of a rebound appear weak, as PEPE has fallen by 65% from its 2024 high. Exchanges have seen a drop of 1.43% in PEPE token supply in the last seven days.

Cutoshi is the Rising Star Everyone Is Talking About The Cutoshi meme coin is inspired by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and the Chinese Golden Cat, which brings good luck. Custoshi’s isn’t your usual meme coin. It combines fun and entertaining elements with useful financial activities like quests, yield farming, learning centers, etc.

Cutoshi will have multi-chain DEX, where users can swap tokens for fees as low as 0.25%. These fees will go to the liquidity providers who contribute to the DEX’s liquidity pools. Another advantage users can avail of is the 7% token allocation set aside for yield farming rewards.

Cutoshi is building its ecosystem capabilities, starting with presale and audits, yield farming, a DEX launch, a buyback program, and an online store replete with extensive partnerships by 2031. Quite a grand roadmap!

What’s So Striking About Cutoshi’s PresaleMost token launches today have high FDV and low float, which makes the token price susceptible to volatility and selling pressure. The token is launched at an inflated price, and later, supply is pumped to make things worse.

But if you check out Cutoshi’s presale, 55% of the supply allocation goes to presale alone. The token is available for purchase at a fair price of $0.031–a steal deal for anyone who understands the economics of token launches. Moreover, early investors in Cutoshi presale also get access to 8,000 unique NFTs and yield farming initiatives for some quick passive income.
