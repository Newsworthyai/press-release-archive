# Comcast to Bring Reliable, Symmetrical Internet to Prior Lake, Savage, Victoria, and Waconia

Comcast plans to connect more than 30,000 new homes and businesses in four new Minnesota communities to reliable, high-speed, symmetrical Internet by expanding its next-generation network in the region. This expansion will enhance digital infrastructure, promote economic growth, and position residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The network expansion in Prior Lake, Savage, Victoria, and Waconia will bring Internet, mobile, entertainment, and security services from Xfinity and Comcast Business to residents and businesses for the first time.

The multi-million dollar-project boosts the company’s total investment in Minnesota’s technology and infrastructure to more than $525 million over the past three years.

"Comcast is excited to bring our next-generation network to these four communities—ultimately delivering for residents and businesses the best converged network experience in the industry,” said Kalyn Hove, regional senior vice president for Comcast’s Midwest Region. “As the need for connectivity continues to grow, Comcast remains focused on delivering the best WiFi experience across its entire Twin Cities network, with continuous upgrades made to enhance how our customers stay connected—whether on a laptop, iPad, or mobile phone, whether at home or on the go, Comcast will be at the forefront, delivering an unparalleled experience with lightning-fast, symmetrical speeds on a reliable and seamless network.”

A Network You Can Trust to be Reliable, Fast and Secure

Comcast’s state-of-the-art network is built to enable residents and businesses to thrive in today’s constantly connected world. These four cities join the 64 million homes and businesses across the country to have access to a network that is trusted by essential community organizations like hospitals, schools, transportation systems and first responders, and federal agencies like the Department of Defense and FEMA. It delivers multi-gigabit Internet speeds, 99.9 percent reliability and security built in from the ground up to keep customers safe from cyber threats.

Introducing Xfinity for Consumers

Comcast’s residential services are marketed under the Xfinity brand, and consumers in these cities will be able to take advantage of Xfinity’s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and home security. With multi-gigabit Internet speeds, powerful WiFi that reaches every corner of the home, and super-responsive connections with low lag available with its plan, customers have a great experience using their connected devices to stream their favorite sports and entertainment content, video chat with coworkers and friends, learn from home or simply surf the web.
