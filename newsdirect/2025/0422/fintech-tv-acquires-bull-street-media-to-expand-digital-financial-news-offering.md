FINTECH.TV, a global media platform focused on finance and innovation, today announced the acquisition of Bull Street Media, a fast-growing digital financial news company known for its popular newsletters targeting young professionals and investors. The acquisition was finalized at FINTECH.TV's headquarters at the New York Stock Exchange.

This strategic acquisition combines FINTECH.TV's global distribution network and multimedia expertise with Bull Street Media's highly engaged audience of over 160,000 subscribers across its financial newsletters. Bull Street's flagship products include the daily Bull Street newsletter, the twice-weekly Coin Street cryptocurrency-focused newsletter, and the personal finance focused AM Wealth newsletter.

"Bull Street Media has built an impressive audience of young, financially-savvy professionals who represent the next generation of investors," said Vince Molinari, Founder and CEO of FINTECH.TV. "By bringing their exceptional newsletter content and engaged community into our ecosystem, we're strengthening our ability to deliver cutting-edge financial news across multiple formats and channels."

Bull Street Media, co-founded by Evelio Silvera, Joshua Feuerstein and David Stryzewski, has distinguished itself in the competitive financial media landscape through its focus on actionable financial insights for young professionals, engaging conversational tone that demystifies complex financial concepts, and impressive engagement metrics that significantly outperform industry averages, with open rates above 63% compared to the industry average of 27%.

The acquisition accelerates Bull Street Media's expansion plans, which include launching podcast versions of the Bull Street and Coin Street newsletters and developing premium membership offerings. These initiatives align with FINTECH.TV's mission to deliver comprehensive financial content across platforms.

"Joining forces with FINTECH.TV gives our newsletters and content the global platform they deserve," said Joshua Feuerstein, Co-founder of Bull Street Media.

"This partnership allows us to accelerate our growth plans while maintaining our unique voice and continuing to serve our community of independent investors, aspiring wealth builders, entrepreneurs, and financial professionals," explained Evelio Silvera, Co-Founder of Bull Street Media.

The Bull Street Media team will join FINTECH.TV but continue to operate its newsletters under their established brands. The acquisition includes Bull Street's premium domains along with their additional web properties.

This acquisition represents FINTECH.TV's commitment to expanding its reach among younger audiences and diversifying its content delivery methods beyond traditional broadcast.
