May 19, 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland - TRON DAO announced today that the total circulating supply of Tether (USDT) on the TRON blockchain has surpassed $75 billion, once again making TRON the leading network for USDT. As the most widely adopted stablecoin, Tether represents more than 63 percent of the global market share with over $150 billion in circulation. Over 50 percent of that supply is issued on TRON - the #1 network among all blockchain networks for USDT total issuance, total transaction volume, and daily active users.

As of May 2025, TRON supports over 8.3 million daily transactions and has surpassed 306 million user accounts on the blockchain. The network processes an average of $20 billion in daily USDT transfers. TRON leads in total transfer volume, facilitating nearly 29 percent of all stablecoin transaction value globally, reflecting its growing role as the preferred settlement network. TRON also leads in active user engagement with over 1 million unique accounts transacting USDT daily, accounting for 28 percent of all active stablecoin wallet addresses across blockchains.

Accounting for over 55% of all USDT transaction volume, USDT on TRON continues to experience sustained and accelerating growth, reflecting rising global demand for efficient, low-cost, and reliable digital dollar infrastructure. This milestone reflects TRON's role in enabling a wide range of real-world financial use cases, from high-volume retail payments to institutional-scale transactions.

As global demand for stablecoins grows, particularly for cross border settlement and financial access, TRON has become a trusted and widely adopted blockchain network, offering the scale, speed, and efficiency required to support stablecoin transactions at a global level.

“TRON’s growth is driven by a strong alignment with the core values of the crypto industry, including financial freedom and individual empowerment,” said Justin Sun, founder of TRON. “USDT on TRON has become the preferred choice for millions of users around the world because it is fast, stable, and accessible. The focus remains on delivering real world utility and building strong network effects that make TRON the leading platform for stablecoin transactions.”

The circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately 7 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2025, alongside an increase of 46 million user wallets. This growth reflects rising trust in Tether’s transparency and its role as a reliable representation of the U.S. dollar. It also reinforces USDT as a stable, efficient, and accessible on-ramp to the global economy.

As TRON continues as the leading network for USDT, its ecosystem is evolving to meet the growing institutional demand for secure, scalable, and secure digital asset infrastructure. In April 2025, World Liberty Financial selected TRON to integrate their stablecoin, USD1. TRON and Tether have also deepened their commitment to financial integrity through the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a joint initiative with TRM Labs. Since its launch, the T3 FCU has collaborated with global law enforcement agencies to freeze over $160 million in illicit funds.
