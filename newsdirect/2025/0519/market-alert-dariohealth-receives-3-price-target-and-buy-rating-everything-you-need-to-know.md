# Market Alert: DarioHealth Receives $3 Price Target and Buy Rating: Everything You Need to Know

Litchfield Hills Research has initiated coverage of DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO)* with a Buy rating and a $3 price target, representing potential upside of over 350% from current trading levels of around $0.66 per share. This bullish outlook comes as the digital health company continues to transform its business model and expand its comprehensive chronic care platform.

DarioHealth has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) approach since 2020. This strategic shift has allowed the company to leverage its consumer platform strengths while expanding sales to health plans and employers. The company's B2B2C recurring revenue grew by an impressive 398% year-over-year in Q4 2024, demonstrating strong market adoption.

The analyst highlights Dario's proven track record of both organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including the recent Twill acquisition which has strengthened its multi-condition platform. This expansion has positioned Dario to address five of the most common, expensive chronic conditions through a single, integrated solution.

The $3 price target is based on a discounted future earnings model with a 9% discount rate. The analysis assumes Dario will reach GAAP breakeven in the second half of 2026, continue strong revenue growth to reach $66.1 million in 2026, achieve non-GAAP operating income of $17.4 million in 2026, and show improving gross margins, exceeding 80% in its core B2B2C business.

Importantly, the report demonstrates that even at the $3 target price, Dario would trade at approximately 2.2x projected 2026 sales, which is still below the peer average of 2.28x. The analyst suggests Dario should command a premium multiple given its high growth profile and comprehensive platform.

The report highlights Dario's unique competitive advantages relative to peers in the digital health space. Unlike competitors who focus on single conditions, Dario offers a comprehensive platform addressing diabetes, hypertension, weight management, musculoskeletal pain, and behavioral health.

When comparing current market cap to sales and enterprise value to sales multiples, Dario trades at substantial discounts â€“ 81% below peers on market cap to sales ratio and 54% below peers on enterprise value to sales ratio. This valuation gap, combined with Dario's proven clinical outcomes and expanding market presence, forms the core of the analyst's bull case.

A significant growth driver highlighted in the report is Dario's expansion into the GLP-1 weight management space. The company's research has shown that members using GLP-1 experienced significant reductions in blood glucose levels in the first five months with changes sustained throughout the year. With the GLP-1 market projected to reach $100 billion by 2030, Dario's comprehensive solution combining medication management with behavioral support positions it to capture market share in this rapidly growing segment.

Strategic partnerships, including its recent collaboration with Rula Health, further strengthen Dario's offering by providing access to over 15,000 behavioral health providers nationwide. The company is also leveraging AI technology to reduce operating expenses, with projections suggesting a 20% reduction in expenses between Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 through AI-driven process optimization.

Litchfield Hills projects Dario's revenue will grow to $35.9 million in 2025 and $66.1 million in 2026, with gross margins improving to nearly 70% by 2026. The company is expected to achieve operational cash flow breakeven by late 2025, with full profitability in the second half of 2026.

The recent $25.6 million private placement has strengthened Dario's balance sheet, providing sufficient runway to execute its strategic plan. With a blue-chip client list that includes major employers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as well as top insurers and pharmaceutical companies, Dario appears well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for integrated digital health solutions that deliver measurable clinical outcomes and positive ROI.
