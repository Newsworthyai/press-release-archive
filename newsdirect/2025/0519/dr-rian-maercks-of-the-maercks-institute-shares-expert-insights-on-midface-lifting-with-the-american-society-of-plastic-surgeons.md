# Dr. Rian Maercks of The Maercks Institute Shares Expert Insights on Midface Lifting with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons

The recent surge in popularity of the "midface-lift" has ignited widespread interest among patients seeking the elusive secret behind the subtly refreshed, lifted appearance often seen on celebrities—without the telltale signs of surgery. As facial rejuvenation trends evolve, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons turned to Dr. Rian Maercks, founder and medical director of The Maercks Institute in Miami, for his unique insights on this highly discussed topic in the article: "The Mid-Facelift Is Taking Facial Aesthetics by Storm".

Dr. Maercks, a board-certified plastic surgeon and internationally recognized innovator in aesthetic medicine, is known for challenging conventional surgical paradigms. His eponymous MAERCKS Lift—a signature deep-plane technique—delivers profound facial support with a remarkably natural aesthetic and minimal downtime, aligning perfectly with the desires of today’s sophisticated patients. At the core of Dr. Maercks’ philosophy is an unwavering commitment to harmony and nuance, prioritizing individualized, non-cookie-cutter outcomes that defy the “operated” look so common with more aggressive procedures.

In the recent ASPS article, Dr. Maercks cautions against superficial and overly simplistic approaches to midface rejuvenation. “True midface support is not about pulling skin tight—it’s about restoring the underlying architecture in a way that respects natural human anatomy,” he explains. The MAERCKS Lift accomplishes this by engaging deep structures of the face to restore youthful volume and positioning, without the conspicuous markers of surgery.

However, Dr. Maercks emphasizes that focusing solely on the midface can result in aesthetic imbalance. “Facial features must work together cohesively. Neglecting adjacent areas—such as the neck—can create visual dissonance that undermines the overall result,” he notes. To address this, he frequently incorporates minimally invasive techniques such as MicroLyft™ or lateral platysmaplasty, enhancing jawline and neck definition without significantly extending recovery time.

A Thoughtful Alternative to Traditional Facelifts

Midface lifting has traditionally been one of the more complex aspects of facial rejuvenation, requiring surgical precision and an artistic eye. The Maercks Institute has become a trusted destination for discerning patients seeking advanced facial aesthetic care with a preference for refined, understated outcomes. Unlike standard procedures that often rely on skin tightening alone, Dr. Maercks' methodology restores facial harmony by lifting and re-supporting deeper facial layers in a natural vector of aging reversal.
