# Sea Tow Foundation™ Releases Third Video in the "Sober Skipper™: Why It Matters" Series Featuring Professional Wakeboarder, Thomas Herman

The Sea Tow Foundation™, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting boating safety, has launched the last video in its "Sober Skipper™: Why It Matters" series, featuring professional wakeboarder, Thomas Herman. Released in conjunction with National Safe Boating Week, the new video highlights the critical role of a Sober Skipper in ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience on the water.

The video series is part of the Foundation’s ongoing campaign to eliminate accidents and fatalities due to Boating Under the Influence (BUI). The campaign targets men ages 24-50, the group identified by U.S. Coast Guard statistics as most at risk for BUI-related incidents. As a professional athlete, Herman shares why staying sober on the water is essential – for safety and for peak performance. He emphasizes the importance of having a Sober Skipper behind the wheel, ensuring that wakeboarders, water sports enthusiasts and recreational boaters alike can focus on their time on the water without worrying about unnecessary risks.

National Safe Boating Week is held the week prior to Memorial Day weekend (May 17-23, 2025) to reach and educate boaters at the start of the summer boating season. This year, the Sea Tow Foundation is amplifying the Sober Skipper message with the launch of the video.

"Wakeboarding, like all water sports, requires focus, control and quick decision-making," said Gail R. Kulp, Executive Director of the Sea Tow Foundation. "National Safe Boating Week is the perfect time to remind all boaters and water sports enthusiasts that responsible choices—like designating a Sober Skipper—can prevent tragedies and make every boating experience safer and more enjoyable. Thomas Herman’s message reinforces the importance of making safety a priority on the water."
