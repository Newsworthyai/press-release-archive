# Cowper Law LLP Defeats Medtronic's Motion for Summary Judgment in MiniMed Insulin Pump Litigation

BOSTON, MA / ThriveNewsWire/ April 25, 2025/ Cowper Law LLP has successfully defeated Medtronic Inc's Motion for Summary Judgment based on statute of limitations in the case Davis et al. v. Medtronic MiniMed Inc. et al. The case is before Judge Elihu Berle in Los Angeles Superior Court' s Complex Division. The Judge also denied Medtronic’s Motion for Summary Judgment in the Burgess et al. v Medtronic MiniMed Inc. case.

In a combined order issued on March 27, 2025, analyzing both cases, Judge Berle found: “Plaintiff has set forth evidence demonstrating a prima facie case of fraudulent concealment against Defendants. The evidence suggests that Defendants possessed actual knowledge of the defective retainer rings in its insulin pumps as early as 2016 as shown by internal documents indicating awareness in the defect, its associated risks and the potential of widespread impact.” See transcript at 30.

The Judge continued: “Based on the evidence presented by Plaintiff, it can be inferred that Defendants’ alleged concealment was motivated by a purpose to continue selling its insulin pump systems and to evade liability for user harm demonstrating a fixed purpose to conceal.” Id. The Court concluded: “Taken together, this evidence could support a finding that Defendants had actual knowledge of the defect, concealed the defect, had a fixed purpose to conceal the defect, and [the plaintiff] could have reasonably relied on concealment.” Id.

These cases are currently set for trial on July 21, 2025 in front of Judge Berle. Cowper Law LLP represents over a thousand Type-I diabetics who used the FDA Class 1 recalled Medtronic 600-series insulin pumps.
