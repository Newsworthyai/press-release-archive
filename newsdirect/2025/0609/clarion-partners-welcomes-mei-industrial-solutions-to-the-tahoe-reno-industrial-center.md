# Clarion Partners Welcomes MEI Industrial Solutions to the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center

New York, NY – May 29, 2025 – Clarion Partners, LLC, a leading real estate investment manager, welcomes MEI Industrial Solutions (“MEI”) to 500 Denmark Drive, a newly constructed 322,000-square-foot Class A building located within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (“TRIC”).

MEI Industrial Solutions (formerly MEI Rigging & Crating) is a leading provider of rigging, machinery moving, industrial storage, millwrighting, crating, export packing services, and specialized transportation services across the nation. The company has leased 161,200 sq. ft. of space, representing approximately half of the building. 500 Denmark is part of a larger development of over 1 million square feet of Class A warehouses at the TRIC, considered to be one of the largest industrial parks in the world.

“We’re pleased that MEI Industrial Solutions has chosen to include 500 Denmark Drive as part of its regional West Coast logistics expansion,” said Clarion Partners Managing Director Jason Glasser. “As a high-growth and desirable submarket conveniently located near major transportation routes, Reno continues to offer industrial users like MEI a compelling value proposition.”

The new facility significantly expands MEI’s operational footprint in Northern Nevada and enhances MEI’s service capacity with secured indoor and outdoor storage space, joining MEI’s nationwide network of 50+ facilities across 24 states. In addition, the facility is well positioned to serve the company’s data center and manufacturing customer base nearby.

Clarion Partners acquired 500 Denmark Drive on behalf of a commingled fund in July 2024. Surrounded by numerous data centers as well as national tech, big box, and e-retailer tenants, the acquisition expanded Clarion’s existing Reno-area industrial footprint of over 1.7 million sq. ft. It also marked Clarion’s first entry into Sparks, NV - one of Reno’s most active submarkets and an active Federally designated Qualified Opportunity Zone (“QOZ”).

Clarion is currently invested in 170 properties (nearly $8 billion in GRE) in areas designated as QOZs and owns an additional 560 properties (over $30 billion in GRE) in submarkets neighboring QOZs. 1
