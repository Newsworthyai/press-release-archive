# Inc. Names Davis Davis & Harmon, A Sales Tax Consultancy to its 2025 List of the Fastest-Growing Private Companies in the Southwest

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today revealed that Davis Davis & Harmon, the nation’s largest woman- and minority-owned sales tax consulting firms, ranked #76 on its fifth annual Inc. Regionals: Southwest list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in the Southwest, which includes Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. An extension of the national Inc. 5000 list, the Regionals offer a unique look at the most successful companies within the Southwest economy’s most dynamic segment–its independent small businesses.

“Making the Inc. Regional list in such a competitive region is an incredible honor and a reflection of our team, who have turned obstacles into opportunities,” said Davis Davis & Harmon CEO Chanel Christoff Davis. “In the past five years, we have opened up international markets by adding VAT tax expertise, diversified into new industry verticals, and added IT services to our portfolio. By embracing a mindset of adaptability and creativity, we’ve recognized exponential growth.”

The companies on this list show a remarkable rate of growth across all industries in the Southwest. Between 2021 and 2023, these 137 private companies had a median growth rate of 106 percent; by 2023, they’d also added 13,809 jobs and $15.9 billion to the region’s economy.

This list celebrates their achievements and tells the stories of remarkable companies that are fueling growth and adding jobs in local economies throughout the country,” said Bonny Ghosh, editorial director at Inc.

They had to be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2023.
