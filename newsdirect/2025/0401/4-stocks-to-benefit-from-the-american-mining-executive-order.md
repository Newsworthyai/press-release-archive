# 4 Stocks to Benefit from the American Mining Executive Order

On March 20, the U.S. government announced a series of executive actions aimed at significantly increasing domestic mineral production. The initiative, known as "Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production," is a direct response to the nation's growing need for critical minerals, which are essential for emerging industries such as clean energy, technology, and national defense. This executive order focuses on reducing dependence on foreign minerals, particularly those from adversarial nations, and strengthening the nation's economic security.

Key provisions include streamlining the permitting process for mineral extraction projects, updating mining regulations, and identifying new lands for potential resource development. The government also plans to encourage private investment and foster collaboration between federal agencies and the private sector to accelerate mineral production.

As these policies take effect, several mining and resource companies are positioned to benefit from this revitalization of the U.S. mineral industry. In this piece, we explore four stocks that are uniquely poised to capitalize on the opportunities created by this bold push to enhance domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign sources.

Sidney Resources Corp. (OTC PINK: SDRC) is positioning itself as a key player in the American mining industry at a time when domestic resource development is a national priority. With the recent Executive Order aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains, SDRC could benefit from growing government and private sector interest in localized mining operations.

Sidney Resources has spent years conducting extensive geological research in Idaho’s Warren Mining District, securing land and mineral rights based on scientific analysis rather than speculation. The company now controls approximately 95% of the region, a significant advantage as demand for critical minerals like gold, silver, platinum group metals (PGMs), and rare earth elements (REEs) rises.

A series of strategic acquisitions and assay confirmations have validated the district’s mineral wealth. Third-party laboratory results have confirmed multi-ounce per ton concentrations of gold, silver, and PGMs, positioning Sidney Resources among the most promising junior mining firms in the sector. The company has also recovered historical assay data that suggests prior underreporting of valuable mineral content, reinforcing the economic viability of its projects.

SDRC is not only acquiring and exploring but also investing in infrastructure to extract and process high-value metals efficiently. The installation of on-site test milling facilities and metallurgical studies have demonstrated the viability of refining platinum, palladium, gold, and silver. Recent breakthroughs in extraction methodologies further bolster the company’s ability to capitalize on these resources.

Additionally, Sidney’s focus on vertical integration—moving toward in-house refining and processing—enhances its profitability potential by reducing dependence on third-party refiners. This decision allows the company to capture more value from its mineral deposits while ensuring supply chain security, a key consideration in the U.S. government’s push for resource independence.

Unlike many traditional mining operations, SDRC has taken proactive steps to incorporate environmental stewardship into its business model. Recent partnerships with Mycleanium and Redstone Innovations underscore the company’s commitment to sustainable mining practices. These collaborations focus on bioremediation techniques that use fungi, bacteria, and aquatic plants to restore water and soil health, setting a new standard for ecological responsibility in the mining sector.

The company’s ownership of critical waterways in the Warren District further emphasizes its role as a responsible steward of natural resources. With regulatory scrutiny on mining operations increasing, Sidney’s ESG initiatives could serve as a competitive advantage, attracting institutional investors who prioritize sustainability.

Sidney Resources Corp. (OTC PINK: SDRC) has attracted attention from institutional investors and industry stakeholders, securing $8.5 million in new investment capital in late 2024 to fund expansion efforts. The company has also formalized partnerships with key geological and metallurgical experts, strengthening its leadership team as it transitions from an exploration company to a full-scale mineral producer.

With a dominant land position, proven high-value mineral deposits, and a commitment to vertical integration, Sidney Resources is well-positioned to capitalize on the U.S. government’s renewed focus on domestic mining. The combination of advanced processing capabilities, sustainable mining practices, and strategic investment places SDRC in a prime position to thrive as demand for critical minerals continues to surge.

As the mining industry shifts toward securing domestic supply chains and reducing reliance on foreign resources, Sidney Resources has the potential to emerge as a key player in shaping the future of American mineral independence. SDRC represents a compelling opportunity in the evolving landscape of critical resource development.

Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: IDR) is not only a gold producer but also a prominent player in the critical minerals sector, with a notable advantage in rare earth elements (REEs) exploration and development. This dual focus positions IDR as a compelling investment opportunity, particularly in light of recent initiatives aimed at bolstering domestic mineral production. The company is well-aligned with the goals outlined in President Trump's Executive Order, "Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production in the United States," and its ongoing advancements suggest significant potential in both gold and rare earths.

Idaho Strategic has made considerable strides in its gold production, with 2024 marking a year of strong financial and operational performance. The company increased revenue by 88.66% and net income by an impressive 663.27%. Notably, the Golden Chest Mine, which has become central to IDR’s operations, continues to yield high-grade gold, with recent drill results showing grades as high as 150.25 grams per tonne. This significant discovery highlights the substantial value IDR is tapping into within its existing gold assets.

Moreover, the company’s forward-looking strategy includes ongoing exploration aimed at expanding reserves, particularly at the Red Star zone, which has already produced exciting results. The increased cash flow from growing gold production provides Idaho Strategic with the financial flexibility to further invest in exploration and infrastructure, creating a solid foundation for continued growth.

Beyond gold, IDR’s rare earth elements holdings add a unique dimension to its portfolio. The company owns the largest REE land package in the U.S., with projects situated in the well-known REE-Th Belt in central Idaho. This strategic position gives Idaho Strategic a first-mover advantage in the rapidly growing REE market, which is critical for manufacturing high-tech products like electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and military applications.

Idaho Strategic’s rare earth exploration efforts are set to ramp up significantly in 2025, with several high-potential projects in the pipeline. These include the Lemhi Pass, Mineral Hill, and Diamond Creek properties, which are part of the U.S. National REE Inventory. The company’s exploration in Lemhi Pass has already yielded promising results, with rare earth oxide concentrations exceeding 5%, including a high proportion of magnet REEs—critical elements in the clean energy transition.

As the U.S. government focuses on reducing reliance on foreign REE supplies, Idaho Strategic is well-positioned to capitalize on these policy shifts. The company’s partnerships with government entities and other stakeholders enhance its prospects, creating opportunities for fast-tracked development. Additionally, IDR’s strategic use of advanced exploration techniques, such as drone-assisted mapping and radiometric surveys, should continue to uncover new targets and refine existing ones, accelerating the path to production.

The recent Executive Order to increase domestic mineral production further enhances Idaho Strategic’s investment case. With its large land holdings in a critical mineral-rich region and its established reputation as a reliable operator in Idaho, the company is likely to benefit from both increased funding opportunities and regulatory support. IDR's exploration activities, including plans for the 2025 field season, align well with the objectives of the Executive Order, ensuring that the company is poised to play a crucial role in reducing the U.S.'s reliance on imported minerals.

The company’s CEO, John Swallow, has emphasized that 2025 will be a transformational year, with both gold production and REE exploration entering a high-growth phase. The company’s strategic investments in infrastructure, such as the planned paste backfill plant at Golden Chest, are expected to generate significant cost savings and improve operational efficiency. These measures, coupled with IDR's strong financial position, set the stage for continued success.

Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (NYSE American: NAK) is a mineral exploration company based in Vancouver, Canada, with a significant asset in the Pebble Project, located in Southwest Alaska. The Pebble Project, which is owned by Northern Dynasty’s U.S.-based subsidiary, Pebble Limited Partnership, hosts the world’s largest undeveloped copper deposit, along with considerable resources of gold, molybdenum, silver, and rhenium—an essential mineral for military applications.

The company has long faced regulatory hurdles, notably the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) veto of the project and the subsequent permit denials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). However, in recent months, Northern Dynasty has been taking legal action to reverse these decisions. In light of the new U.S. executive order aimed at ramping up domestic mineral production, the company’s chances of moving past these regulatory obstacles have improved.

This executive order, signed by President Trump, emphasizes securing a stable, reliable supply of critical minerals such as copper and gold, both of which are abundant in the Pebble deposit. The order also directs federal agencies to expedite approvals for mining projects that contribute to the production of these essential materials. As a result, Northern Dynasty is well-positioned to benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment. With the Pebble Project being integral to the U.S.’s long-term mineral strategy, it aligns closely with the current push for greater domestic production.

Northern Dynasty’s legal team is working to put the Pebble Project back on track by challenging the EPA’s veto and the USACE’s permit denials. In February 2025, Northern Dynasty agreed to a 90-day pause in litigation, allowing the new administration time to review the case. This period of abeyance reflects a recognition that the U.S. needs to bolster its domestic mineral resources, which could lead to a more favorable resolution for the Pebble Project.

The economic impact of the Pebble Project is significant. In addition to the high-paying jobs it would create in Alaska, the project could provide substantial tax revenue for both the state and federal governments. Given the critical role that copper, gold, and rhenium play in defense, technology, and infrastructure, the project’s development is increasingly viewed as a national priority.

As of March 2025, Northern Dynasty’s stock has seen a notable surge, with shares rising 37.8% to $1.23. The increase in stock price reflects growing optimism surrounding the Pebble Project, especially with the executive order backing domestic mining initiatives. Northern Dynasty stands to gain a great deal from the U.S. government's renewed emphasis on ensuring a steady supply of vital minerals, provided the company can successfully negotiate its regulatory obstacles.

United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY) stands out as an intriguing opportunity in the mining sector, particularly in light of President Trump’s executive order aimed at boosting domestic mineral production. As the only antimony smelter in both the United States and Mexico, U.S. Antimony is strategically positioned to benefit from increased demand for critical minerals, such as antimony, used in industries like defense, manufacturing, and technology.

The company is seeing a significant transformation, with 2024 marking a turning point. UAMY reported a remarkable 72% year-over-year revenue growth for the fiscal year 2024, driven by both strong demand for its products and improvements across its operations. Notably, U.S. Antimony has made substantial strides in its antimony production, and its zeolite division has turned around after overcoming prior management challenges. This growth is expected to continue, as the company is ramping up production capacities and positioning itself as a leading supplier in the antimony sector. The company’s commitment to producing antimony domestically, particularly with plans to mine antimony from its Alaskan claims, further strengthens its potential to take advantage of the increasing focus on securing a stable domestic supply of minerals.

With antimony being a critical component in industries such as flame retardants, ammunition, and batteries, the scarcity of this commodity makes U.S. Antimony’s position even more attractive. The company’s ability to mine, float, and smelt antimony under one roof – a unique capability in North America – ensures its competitiveness and self-sufficiency. This vertical integration also shields UAMY from potential supply chain disruptions, which is a key advantage in today’s volatile global market.

In terms of financials, UAMY is well-positioned for continued growth. The company’s revenue is expected to grow by an impressive 47.2% annually, outpacing the broader U.S. market. Despite recent volatility, the stock is still trading below its fair value, suggesting significant upside potential. UAMY is also actively working to improve profitability, with plans to achieve profitability within the next three years. Furthermore, the company’s recent $100 million shelf registration could provide the necessary capital for future expansions and operational enhancements.

With a strong balance sheet, increasing production, and a well-timed focus on the strategic importance of antimony, United States Antimony Corporation is poised for significant growth. For investors looking for exposure to the U.S. mining sector and critical minerals, UAMY offers a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the rising demand for domestically sourced materials.
