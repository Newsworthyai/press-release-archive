# Thoroughbred Yacht Sales Presents a New Pinnacle of Sailing Innovation from Italia Yachts

Thoroughbred Yacht Sales is currently listing the 2023 Italia Yachts 12.98 (43ft), a sailing yacht designed to meet the needs of both racing enthusiasts and those looking for a capable cruising vessel. The model reflects Italian craftsmanship with a focus on clean lines, practical detailing, and thoughtful spatial design.

This particular hull is the first in its series and features interior input from Italian design firm Abore & Partners. The interior has been styled with a light, modern aesthetic, including mirrored film on the settee fronts to reflect natural light, and a washable linen-effect bulkhead finish with contrasting black edging, which aids visibility during evening hours.

The yachtâ€™s galley has been adapted with U.S. buyers in mind, offering both top- and front-loading refrigerators, generous countertop space, and multiple storage options. In the forward cabin, the berth narrows toward the bow but includes a mix of hanging, shelved, and under-bed storage. Aft cabins, while compact, benefit from a separating technical compartment that contributes to sound insulation and cabin privacy.

The vessel is offered in two configurations to suit different sailing priorities. The cruising version includes an en-suite head in the forward cabin with contemporary finishes. In contrast, the racing model leaves this area open to optimise weight distribution. A larger aft head, present in both versions, includes a separate shower stall.

The Italia Yachts 12.98 is positioned as a dual-purpose yacht for those seeking a balance between speed and comfort, with performance capabilities suitable for competitive sailing and interior features designed for extended time onboard.

The yacht is currently available through Thoroughbred Yacht Sales. Interested parties can view more details and specifications in the full listing: QUERENCIA ITALIA 12.98 RACER/CRUISER.
