# Aloe Semiconductor demonstrates 850-Gb/s DP-BIDI-PAM4 OSFP module at OFC 2025

Aloe Semiconductor, Inc. will demonstrate 850-Gb/s per fiber pair at the Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) Conference and Exhibition in San Francisco, CA the week of March 31, 2025. This showcases the first ever practical combination of dual polarization with bi-directional technology (DP-BiDi-PAM4) to achieve a factor of four increase in fiber capacity for short links.

DP and BiDi technology each increase optical escape and cabling density by a factor of two, for a total factor of four when used together. Optical escape and cabling density are becoming significant limitations in scale out and eventually scale up, making the combination of DP and BiDi use an important innovation. This technology also benefits optical circuit switching (OCS), which has been proven to significantly reduce cost and power.

“We are committed to making DP-PAM4 practical, and we are excited to show our progress,” said Aloe’s CEO Christopher (Chris) Doerr. “We also show how polarization multiplexing is an orthogonal dimension and can be combined with other density-improvement technologies, such as BiDi. In the future, adding 200-Gbaud technology, 1.6T per fiber pair using DP-BiDi PAM4 will be conceivable.”

The module block diagram for this demonstration is shown below. The BiDi uses 1271 nm to transmit in one direction and 1311 nm in the other. The Aloe single-chip silicon-photonic integrated circuit (PIC) contains both the transmitter and receiver. The PICs are flip-chipped together with the Broadcom Sian 2 digital-signal processor DSP and put in an Eoptolink module. The modulators are driven with the internal drivers of Sian. A transimpedance amplifier (TIA) IC is used to amplify the high-speed photo-detected signals.

"We believe DP-PAM4 is an innovative technology to further increase short reach fiber capacity without the need for new silicon to support 1.6T," said Dirk Lutz, Engineer at Eoptolink. "We are excited to collaborate with Aloe in this new exciting technology."

With this demonstration, Aloe continues to pave the way to higher speeds, opening up a path to 1.6T speeds on short-reach fiber links.

DP demonstrations will be running at the Eoptolink booth and Aloe’s room 1018 in the Corporate Village and require a reservation to attend. Please contact Chris at cdoerr@aloesemi.com for more details.
