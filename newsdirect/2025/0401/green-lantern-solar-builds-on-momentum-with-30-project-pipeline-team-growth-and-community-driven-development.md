# Green Lantern Solar Builds on Momentum with 30-Project Pipeline, Team Growth and Community-Driven Development

Green Lantern Solar is entering a new chapter of growth with renewed momentum, advancing its mission to revitalize underutilized land, empower local communities, and accelerate the nation’s transition to clean, reliable energy.

With a growing pipeline of more than 40 solar and storage projects in multiple states, the company is expanding its ability to deliver localized energy solutions that generate long-term value for landowners, businesses, utilities, and communities.

As the energy landscape continues to evolve, Green Lantern Solar remains focused on innovation, strategic partnerships, and sustainable development to drive meaningful impact in 2025 and beyond. With an unwavering commitment to its core values, Green Lantern Solar is actively expanding its portfolio and impact—positioning the company for continued growth in the face of ongoing economic and policy uncertainty.

“We’re strategically building one of our strongest pipelines to date by focusing on smart land acquisition, forging reliable affiliations with strategically aligned development partners, and continuing to build trusted relationships with landowners,” said Scott Buckley, President, Green Lantern Solar. “Every project we develop is an opportunity to generate long-term value for our project communities, for our landowners, for our partners, and for the clean energy future we’re helping to create.”

Green Lantern Solar will continue to upscale its efforts in the months ahead, reinforcing its position as a trusted leader in distributed solar and storage development.

Key Momentum Highlights Include:

Growing Land Portfolio: Green Lantern Solar has added 30 new solar and storage projects to its pipeline in the past 12 months, expanding its ability to deliver localized renewable energy solutions that benefit communities, landowners, businesses, and utilities.

Expanding Team and Leadership: The company welcomed several new team members, including a highly qualified site acquisition specialist and an experienced director of development, while also promoting current employees to senior roles—demonstrating its commitment to expertise and internal growth.

Forging Strategic Partnerships: Green Lantern Solar has solidified partnerships with leading renewable energy companies all along the development, EPC, financing and O&M timeline, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable, highly qualified development partner and project owner with bankable assets and a strong balance sheet.

Revitalizing Underutilized Lands: Two newly completed solar projects on reclaimed gravel pits exemplify Green Lantern Solar’s approach to turning undervalued and degraded spaces into clean energy assets—supporting local economies and environmental renewal.

Empowering Farmers and Ranchers: By tailoring solar installations to agricultural operations, the company continues to help farmers and ranchers preserve their land, enhance productivity, and generate reliable revenue.

Advancing Projects for Schools: Green Lantern Solar continues to support education by delivering energy savings to dozens of school districts and funding scholarships that benefit students and communities.

With this strong foundation and a clear vision for what’s next, Green Lantern Solar is poised to continue leading the way in community-centered, sustainable energy development across the United States.

Green Lantern Solar’s projects are more than energy solutions—they are forward-thinking investments in the future. For example, by revitalizing underused land, the company provides financial stability to landowners through new revenue streams while providing energy savings to ratepayers. Green Lantern Solar’s successful execution of its project pipeline development bolsters local and regional economies by creating sustainable ecosystems of high-quality consulting, construction and long-term operation and maintenance jobs. This also promotes sustainable growth by enhancing the usability and profitability of land while contributing to a cleaner environment.

“At Green Lantern Solar, we believe that solar energy is a tool for transformation—not just of land, but of lives,” Buckley added. “Our mission is to create lasting value for our partners by prioritizing people and understanding community impacts. The milestones we reached reflect our dedication to the smart and disciplined deployment of capital to revitalize land, empower communities and build a greener future, proven out over 125 projects.”
