# Introducing Saint Crewe, The New Clinically-Tested Skincare Brand For Gen Z Founded by Mom & Therapist to College-Aged Women, Erin Piper

Saint Crewe is a new dermatologist-tested, clinically backed skincare line designed specifically for Gen Z. Clinically tested on over 100 people, Saint Crewe is hypoallergenic, non-irritating, and suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. The brand’s four new products meet the clean beauty standards of Ulta, Sephora, and Credo while celebrating skincare as a fun, confidence-boosting ritual.

As a mother of two and a therapist working with college-aged women, Saint Crewe Founder Erin Piper saw firsthand Gen Z’s growing curiosity about skincare and beauty trends. She realized that they were drawn to viral TikTok-famous products with bright, fun packaging, and the joy of experimenting with self-care.

The issue? During the fun of applying face masks and creating skincare routines, the aggressive skincare ingredients were being overlooked. Many of these products contained harsh actives like retinol and glycolic acid – ingredients that weren’t suitable for their young skin.

Saint Crewe Founder, Erin Piper, says, “As a mom and therapist to college-aged women, I’ve seen firsthand how much Gen Z loves experimenting with skincare. But there are too many trending products that cause more harm than good for young skin – damaged skin barriers, breakouts, irritation, you name it. That’s why I wanted to create a brand that is clinically effective, but still safe for everyday use. As a parent who has to say ‘no’ to so much – no to social media, to phones, to harmful ingredients, it feels really great to say ‘yes’ to skincare.”

Erin sought out to create the ultimate solution to these concerns for the Gen Z community. She collaborated with leading labs, dermatologists, creatives, and beauty industry veterans – including the CEO of Saint Crewe, her long-time friend and skincare product development expert, Laura-Lucia Carothers – to develop a stunning range of vegan and cruelty-free skincare products that nurture this sense of curiosity while being expertly formulated to be gentle and safe for all skin types.

Clean Beam Balmy Dream ($32): Lush cleansing balm formula that melts onto the skin as a foamy rinse-off cleanser that can remove sunscreen, makeup, and grime while bisabolol, ginger and calming turmeric soothes the skin.

Team Gleam ($38): Daily water-gel serum that is loaded with superfruit goji berry and microalgae, helping balance the microbiome and fight against harmful blue light from screen time.

Water Whip ($42): Light gel cream that delivers deep hydration and a natural glow with a boost of marine algae extract and vitamin E while soothing skin.

Goji Go + Glow ($44): Packed with powerful aloe juice, microalgae and goji superberries to help keep breakouts at bay, this super mist balances excess oil while supporting your skin's microbiome.

The brand’s name pays tribute to both a cherished family name and Sara Crewe, the beloved protagonist of A Little Princess. Saint Crewe isn’t just skincare, it’s innovation that redefines skincare for the next generation and anyone seeking a playful new way to care for their skin.

Saint Crewe is redefining skincare for the next generation with fun, approachable, and age-appropriate formulas designed specifically for Gen Z. More than just skincare, Saint Crewe creates an experience, one that evolves with the brand’s community and becomes a playful part of their well-being. Built on the pillars of safety, individuality, integrity, well-being, and experience, Saint Crewe is committed to gentle formulations that nurture young skin with confidence and transparency. Trends fade. Skincare stays. With Saint Crewe, skincare isn’t just about looking good—it’s about feeling your best, inside and out. It will always be you.
