After spending the past month in a narrow trading range, Dogecoin (DOGE) has started hiding at a reversal as a series of bullish confluences have appeared on the chart. However, its potential gains could be vastly outshined by a new entry in the meme coin landscape — Cutoshi. Discover why veteran traders are opting to rotate funds into the viral presale of the $CUTO token and why Cutoshi is poised to disrupt both meme coins and Defi.

Dogecoin Returns To Baseline, Bitwise Files For ETFDogecoin (DOGE) has broken out of its downtrend, overcoming the critical resistance level of $0.33 with rising trading volume, signaling growing market confidence. Dogecoin’s technical indicators show bullish momentum, with the MACD in positive territory and the RSI above 50, suggesting further upside potential. Dogecoin is seeing strong support at $0.31, offering a solid foundation for sustained upward momentum. The Dogecoin price structure shows higher lows, indicating an emerging uptrend, with the next key resistance at $0.34.

Analyst Lucky asserts that Dogecoin is headed toward the prophesied $1 landmark, as he shared a compelling chart reading on X, drawing attention to a multi-month triangle formation. Dogecoin is still moving within the bounds of the triangle pattern, but once a break above the descending trendline is confirmed, a violent upward move is expected, with the first major target being the $0.42 resistance.

Meanwhile, Bitwise has filed with the SEC to launch a Dogecoin ETF, with the goal of offering investors outside of the crypto sphere direct exposure to DOGE. As cryptocurrency ETFs gain traction, with recent approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is growing optimism that a Dogecoin ETF will become a reality soon. Polymarket placed the odds of a DOGE ETF approval at 50%, a considerable increase from 27% earlier this year.

Cutoshi Could Kickstart Meme Season 2.0Cutoshi is an innovative new meme coin that looks to merge meme hype with DeFi utility, bringing forward a revolutionary MemeFi platform. Inspired by the Chinese Lucky Cat, Cutoshi boasts a cutting-edge ecosystem that integrates all major blockchains. The CUTO DEX is at the center of this ecosystem, offering a state-of-the-art decentralized exchange, and with its cross-chain framework, it enables users to perform seamless swaps across chains. This model not only ensures lower fees and reduced waiting times but also relieves investors from the need to cycle between different protocols to find the best opportunities.

In addition to this, Cutoshi Farming allows community members to reap progressively higher returns the more they engage with the platform. Rewards can come from staking the $CUTO token, providing liquidity, participating in fun events, and completing tasks aimed at boosting Cutoshi’s online presence.

One of the project's most interesting aspects is the Cutoshi Academy. This educational platform wants to demystify DeFi knowledge and assist beginners in navigating the intricacies of the crypto world while fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment.

Stage 4 of the $CUTO presale is live, and the token sells for just $0.031. Cutoshi bears all of the hallmarks of a gem in the making. Once $CUTO hits the market and listings on major exchanges are finalized, a moonshot for the ages could be in the cards, mimicking Dogecoin’s legendary 100x run.
