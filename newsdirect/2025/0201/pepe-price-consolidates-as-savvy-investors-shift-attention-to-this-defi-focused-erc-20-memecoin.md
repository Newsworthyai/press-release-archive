The recent market downturn has continued to take its toll on various top altcoins including Pepe (PEPE) and Ethereum (ETH), both of which are currently navigating price consolidation. This has prompted many savvy traders to consider other promising alternatives especially in the DeFi market.

Notably, Cutoshi (CUTO), a fast-rising presale star has been on the receiving end of this attention since it commenced its ICO journey some weeks back. Based on the Ethereum network, this new hybrid memecoin aims to bring DeFi to everyday people, offering them lucrative opportunities that can help them achieve monetary freedom.

Cutoshi to Rank Among Top DeFi Coins As Interest in Hybrid Protocol SoarsOne of Cutoshi (CUTO)’s main allure is its unified ecosystem that houses a DeFi hub that features DeFi components like a DEX protocol, a staking and farming mechanism and a dedicated Academy that aims to propagate DeFi adoption. As a hybrid protocol, Cutoshi combines memecoin’s communal approach with the lucrativeness of DeFi in an attempt to liberate everyday people from financial autonomy among centralized entities.

Essentially, the cutoshi ecosystem was inspired by both the popular Chinese lucky cat associated with good fortune and Nakamoto Satoshi’s blockchain core principles of decentralization, monetary freedom and privacy. Asides the lucrative opportunities it offers via its DeFi hub, Cutoshi also rewards users with complimentary items like NFTs and merchs whenever they participate in specific quests.

Meanwhile, the native $CUTO token serves as the lifeblood of the ecosystem. Asides facilitating transactions within the learning academy and the entire ecosystem, it also powers Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. Currently selling for $0.031 in its fourth presale stage, the CUTO token has already delivered over 100% for early backers who purchased at the launch price of $0.015, thereby positioning itself among the best crypto to buy now.

Pepe Coin Risks Further Retracement As Price Struggles to Stabilize Above Support Unlike Cutoshi and other emerging memecoins, interest in Pepe (PEPE) coin have been depreciating in the past month, with PEPE price registering over 33% decline during the period. In the past week alone, PEPE price has declined over 16%, and now trades within a consolidated price range between $0.000015 and $0.000013.

This progressive decline in PEPE price, however, hasn’t dampened community support so much as 88% over 215K CMC community members voted in favour of a bullish trajectory. One reason for this could be because of the top memecoin’s positive outlook in the past year where it still holds well over 1250% price gain. Meanwhile, looking at the yearly price chart, PEPE price is currently trading at a solid support zone.

However, failure to hold above the current price level could result in further decline to lower regions around $0.0000085 where its next major support lies. Additionally, PEPE coin’s technical analysis including 30, 100, and 200 day Moving Averages signals a strong sell, which suggests that the current trend may persist for a while.

Ethereum price Remains Trapped Below Resistance as Community Interest DeclinesThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of recovery, however, it is still trapped within a consolidation zone below the weekly resistance between $3,390 and $3,400. In the past week, ETH price reflects nearly 4% decline and about 2% in the past month.

Meanwhile, looking closely at its monthly chart, ETH price has made several failed attempts to stabilize above the $3,400 price mark. Since it last traded above this level on 24th of January, ETH price has been trapped in an extended consolidation. This has further dampened community trust in the top DeFi coin as only about 69% of over 420K CMC community members voted in favor of a bullish trajectory.

Besides, ETH token’s technical analysis including its Relative Strength Index and Moving Averages points at a strong sell, which suggest that the top altcoin’s current consolidation may persist before any major price correction to the upside.

Can Cutoshi Outperform Pepe and Rank Top Among Ethereum Memecoins? Unlike Pepe coin, Cutoshi is designed to be self-sustaining due to its DeFi integration. While this attribute is lacking in many established meme coins including those on Ethereum network, Cutoshi aims to set new standards across diverse markets while navigating its way to the top of the ranks. Moreso, its ability to thrive in both the memecoin and DeFi market positions it for exponential growth.
