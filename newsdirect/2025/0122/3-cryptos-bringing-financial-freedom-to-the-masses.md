![](https://public.newsdirect.com/577097927/mDthfi9N.jpeg)

There is widespread speculation of decreasing regulatory pressure and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in 2025, indicating a remarkable bull wave is approaching.

Let’s explore Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Cutoshi (CUTO), which are the top three tokens poised to grow tremendously in the coming months as they shape the decentralized economy and capture the DeFi market.

Bitcoin Reaches Crucial Trendline After Double-BottomAfter a multi-year cup-and-handle pattern, Bitcoin had a massive rally recently. The Bitcoin price surged over 50% during this rally, reaching the ATH at $108,268. However, it encountered a crucial resistance trendline that joined the price peaks of 2017 and 2021 in this region and lost momentum due to decreased demand.

Due to this, the price reversed, and Bitcoin has created a double-bottom pattern over the last month. It trades at $104,187.89 after a 1.02% rise in the previous 24 hours and is taking support from the vertex of the double-bottom at $102,233. Bitcoin is only 3.19% below its ATH but has faced significant bearish pressure at the $105,358 price level for three days.

The MACD oscillator is rising fast due to the increasing bullish sentiment, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also increasing, currently at 65. Bitcoin may reach a new ATH soon if the price continues to climb, and it can also break the trendline if bulls induce sufficient demand.

Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates Due To UncertaintyEthereum traded in a triangular pattern for over three months but surged by over 70% within a month when it broke past the consolidation. The rally slowed gradually, and Ethereum faced considerable resistance from the $4,091 price. Due to the slow price action, it entered a downtrend and has corrected significantly.

Ethereum trades at $3,294 at press time, taking support at $3,232. Over the last few days, the price has been trading between this support and the $3,500 resistance level, alternating between bullish and bearish candlesticks due to indecisiveness.

The price is surfing just above the 100-day SMA but is below the 50-day SMA. If Ethereum falls further from the current support, another significant support level is at $3,120, but if it rises from here, then $3,548 and $3,746 are a few solid resistance levels.

Cutoshi (CUTO): Latest Utility Meme Coin On Ethereum Cutoshi is an ERC-20 token inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s teachings and resonates with his vision for a decentralized economy where users can enjoy complete privacy, security, and monetary freedom. The project promotes this and spreads the word with the power of memes.

Moreover, it has built a fun meme coin ecosystem based on the Chinese Lucky Cat that has the power to bless its owners with good fortune. Cutoshi wants to spread good luck and prosperity worldwide and thus offers everyone the chance to harness this lucky cat’s powers using its native token, CUTO.

At the heart of its ecosystem, Cutoshi has placed its multi-chain DEX (Decentralized Exchange), which enables users to swap their digital assets peer-to-peer with other platform users. The DEX is cross-chain interoperable and offers lightning-fast asset transfers across blockchains at a tiny 0.25% fee.

Furthermore, Cutoshi offers community members the opportunity to earn CUTO through its farming mechanism. Members complete the daily fun challenges designed to help the community grow and receive CUTO points for their efforts. The collected points can be converted to CUTO tokens after the presale.

The Cutoshi presale has raised over $1,600,000 and offers CUTO at $0.031 in stage four. Early members have already made over 100% returns, with the price surging after every round, but it is not too late, as new investors can get similar gains with the presale progressing faster.
