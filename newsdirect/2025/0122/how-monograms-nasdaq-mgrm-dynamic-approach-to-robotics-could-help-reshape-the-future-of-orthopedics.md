Robots are becoming increasingly more common in the operating room, but just how automated are they? Monogram Orthopedics Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRM) would argue we have a long way to go before the full potential of robotic technology is fully tapped.

The proliferation of robotics and increasing utilization is, at this point, likely a foregone conclusion. After all, some estimates predict that 50% of all knee procedures will be robotic by 2027, up from 11% in 2019.

Yet despite the proliferation of AI and fully autonomous robotics in nearly every aspect of daily life, the surgical equipment currently in use for common orthopedic procedures is still reliant on surgeon skill. Monogram’s mBôs robotic technology aims to increase automation and reduce reliance on user skills. As a pioneer in autonomous saw-based cutting, the company has applied decades of robotics experience to amass an extensive portfolio of innovation, including some 23 patent applications in process.

The majority of procedures done today combine manual surgery with robotics. The process can still rely heavily on surgeon skill to safely execute the surgery. Monogram’s mBôs aims to minimize direct surgeon contact with the robot mounted tools and hopes to provide surgeons a more autonomous platform for precise surgical bone cuts based on preoperative planning.

Monogram’s autonomous robotics platform captured the attention of investment bank Roth Capital Partners, which recently initiated coverage of the company, noting mBôs simplifies surgery as a likely direct challenge to the dominant players in the space.

“While orthopedic surgeons remain characteristically conservative, the clinical case for robotics technology is building, and robotics are changing market dynamics,” according to an analyst report compiled by Roth Managing Director Jason Wittes. “We anticipate adoption surpassing 50% over the next five years, and thus see significant strategic value in emerging robotics platforms such as MGRM's mBôs that can challenge MAKO’s dominance.”

In addition, Monogram reports its technology pipeline is robust. It plans to introduce mVision in the future, which could enable faster registration and further optimize surgical time compared to competitors.

Combination Of Advanced Technologies To Deliver ResultsMonogram leverages AI and robotics to develop state-of-the-art robots that can assist surgeons with knee reconstruction and, in the future, other procedures like hips, shoulders, ankles and spine. Monogram’s robotic systems aim for precise virtual assessment of laxity values to determine the potential clinical impact of planned resections. Its technology enables surgeons to place implants virtually before cutting to assess the impact of various resections on knee laxity with a target to achieve submillimeter bone cuts. These tools could dramatically simplify the complexity of joint reconstruction in the future. Monogram hopes the mBôs automation could increase throughput and hopes to reduce clinical risk with a planned clinical study to validate. The goal is for the robot to be easy to use and to lower the learning curve for surgeons.

With accurate robotics, precision machine cuts can help enable the use of press-fit implants, eliminating the need for cement. Unlike traditional implants, press-fit implants rely on the patient’s bone to hold the implant in place instead of relying on cement. Natural biologic fixation could reduce the risk of the implant becoming loose for younger active patients as the cement breaks down over time.

Showing Off The Tech At HQ Monogram’s unique approach to robotics was on display during an analyst meeting and demo day held in 2024 at the company’s cadaver lab and headquarters in Austin, Texas. Monogram executives – including CEO Ben Sexson, Founder and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Douglas Unis, Chief Technology Officer Dr. Kamran Shamaei and Chief Financial Officer Noel Knape – were on hand along with other senior management team members to provide an overview of the company's progress in combining advanced machine vision, AI and next-generation robotics to improve surgeries and patient outcomes.

“We were extremely impressed with the management team, including founder Doug Unis, and the successful product Demonstration of the mBôs Precision Robotic Surgical System in a world-class cadaver lab,” said Dallas Salazar, Doctor Group investor. “The hands-free, fully active system demonstrated to us the ease of use and simplicity that was operated by the founder’s 11-year-old daughter giving more confidence of commercialization and acceptance in the orthopedic robotics community once approved. We believe there is clearly a disruptor in this space that is now bringing a product solution architecture to enable patient-optimized orthopedic implants at scale utilizing artificial intelligence and next-generation robotics.”

Market DirectionThe company believes that the future of the market for robotics is bright. With continued robotic adoption driven by patient outcomes and healthcare providers, it believes robotics are likely to become increasingly autonomous. Given the advancements made in AI and robotics, the systems in place today may still be relatively constrained by a reliance on the precision of individual surgeons. The full potential of robotics could be realized across myriad industries. With the anticipated growth in surgical procedures and critical patient and healthcare business outcomes at stake, coupled with a declining number of orthopedic surgeons, automation could be an answer to the growing demand. Monogram aims to introduce an approach to enabling true automated robotic precision that has the potential to transform the way surgeons around the world perform knee replacements and other orthopedic procedures.
