# Groundwork BioAg and Sustainable Travel International Partner to Offer Carbon Dioxide Removal Credits for Tourism

Groundwork BioAg®, the world’s largest producer of mycorrhizal inoculants, announced a new partnership with Sustainable Travel International, a global leader in sustainable tourism solutions, to offer travelers and businesses access to premium carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits, based on the application of mycorrhizal fungi in cropland.

Mycorrhizal inoculants are applied in agricultural soils to improve crop yields, save fertilizer, reduce plant stress, and improve soil health – but at the same time, these microbial products act as a natural pathway to permanently sequester carbon. This partnership aligns with Sustainable Travel International’s mission to provide programs that help travelers, businesses and destinations protect the environment, preserve cultural heritage and promote economic development.

Groundwork BioAg's Rootella Carbon™ program offers high-integrity, high-volume, durable carbon credits that are independently certified and approved, providing a reliable solution for organizations seeking to meet their net-zero pledges responsibly.

"By adding Rootella Carbon to our Climate Impact Portfolio, we reaffirm our commitment to promote holistic environmental stewardship so our members can visit – and protect – the places they love,” said Paloma Zapata, CEO of Sustainable Travel International. “This innovative, nature-based solution aligns with our mission to help the travel industry address its carbon liability while directly improving soil health around the world.”

Sustainable Travel International’s Climate Impact Portfolio includes a wide variety of projects in different locations that generate carbon credits as they reduce or remove emissions. The portfolio includes a mix of high-quality forestry, clean/efficient energy, blue/teal carbon, and innovative climate tech projects.

The demand for high-quality carbon credits is growing rapidly, with two-thirds of the world's largest companies with net-zero targets using carbon offsets to help meet their climate goals. Rootella Carbon credits stand out among durable CDR credits as a scalable solution that not only sequesters carbon in the soil but also improves crop yields, reduces chemical fertilizer use, mitigates plant stress and supports regenerative agricultural practices.

Dan Grotsky, co-founder and chief growth officer of Groundwork BioAg, said, "This collaboration not only validates the effectiveness of our Rootella Carbon program but also demonstrates the travel industry's commitment to sustainable practices. Together, we are paving the way for significant carbon sequestration by enabling travelers and rewarding farmers around the world – while contributing to a healthier planet."

Rooted in Groundwork BioAg’s history of helping growers improve the productivity and profitability of their farms, this partnership now gives travelers the opportunity to directly support farmers for their land stewardship while reducing their own carbon footprint.

Currently under validation within the Verra VM0042 v2.0 protocol, Rootella Carbon offers farmers the opportunity to earn up to 70% of net proceeds from carbon credit sales, making it an attractive option for growers looking to diversify their income streams. This innovative approach unlocks compensation for regenerative growers who would otherwise be ineligible for carbon credits, while incentivizing conventional farmers to adopt regenerative practices.
