# Elluminex's Roadmap To The Top: What Investors Need To Know

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/560261773/PmVy10XH.png)

The TON blockchain connects directly to Telegram's billion-user network. This offers a massive opportunity for first movers on-chain. The problem, however, is that currently, TON is not easy to use, especially for DeFi. Elluminex will transform this massive audience's access to DeFi through the first comprehensive hub on TON.

Building A Solid FoundationTheir roadmap starts with solid fundamentals. The DEX will launch with advanced trading features like limit orders and concentrated liquidity pools. The staking platform will let users earn yields while supporting network growth.

Education And The Cross-Chain BridgePhase two brings really interesting and important additions. The cross-chain bridge opens TON to the wider crypto ecosystem. Currently, if you want to swap tokens on TON, it's difficult, as most places only offer a few tokens.

Another issue is that it can be hard to get crypto or fiat into TON. The Elluminex bridge will help to solve this.

Also, the Elluminex Academy will guide new users through DeFi basics, turning Telegram users into confident DeFi participants.

Advanced Features And TechnologyElluminexâ€™s AI-powered portfolio tracker marks a technological leap forward. Users will be able to track performance, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions.

The pre-market OTC platform will provide early access to promising TON tokens before they hit exchanges. That means that people could access tokens such as Notcoin at the earliest possible time, and all from one place.

Mobile Accessibility And Community GrowthMobile integration will put everything at users' fingertips. The Elluminex app will bring full platform functionality to iOS and Android, meeting users right where they use Telegram daily.

The ecosystem will expand through community-driven growth. Hackathons will genrate new ideas. Ambassador programs will spread DeFi knowledge across TON. Strategic partnerships will create deeper connections within the blockchain space.

The ELX Token And TokenomicsSmart market players can join early through the upcoming ELX token presale. The token will power every part of the platform - from trading fee reductions to governance voting rights.

And here's a key feature: 50% of all fees collected in ELX will burn automatically, creating a natural supply reduction over time.

The Team And The VisionA team of blockchain veterans leads the project. Former developers from Google and Fantom bring real-world experience building complex DeFi systems. TON's lightning-fast blockchain gives them the perfect foundation to build on.

The numbers tell the story. Almost a billion Telegram users. No comprehensive DeFi hubs on TON. One clear solution. Elluminex will bridge this gap, bringing DeFi to an audience that's ready and waiting.

And it all starts with the upcoming presale.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
