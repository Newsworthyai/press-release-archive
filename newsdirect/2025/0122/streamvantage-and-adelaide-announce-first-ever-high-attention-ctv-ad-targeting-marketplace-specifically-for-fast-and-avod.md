# StreamVantage and Adelaide announce first-ever high-attention CTV ad targeting marketplace specifically for FAST and AVOD

Adelaide, the leader in attention-based media quality measurement, and StreamVantage, CTV advertising’s premier solution provider, have announced the first targeting marketplace for high-attention FAST (Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television) and AVOD (Advertising-Supported Video On Demand) content. Now CTV advertisers and their agencies can launch StreamVantage campaigns with high-attention targeting across FAST and AVOD via programmatic guaranteed, private marketplace, and managed service transactions.

Adelaide’s AU measures any media placement’s likelihood of capturing attention and driving subsequent impact. AU quality scores are generated by a machine-learning model that incorporates eye-tracking data from various sources, including TVision, device signals, and full-funnel outcome data. By overlaying AU on StreamVantage's FAST and AVOD inventory, this partnership allows advertisers to surface high-attention placements for targeting across a diverse range of publishers. An Adelaide analysis conducted with VIZIO in early 2024 found that FAST channels outperformed overall CTV attention benchmarks by 20–25%. This collaboration now makes high-AU FAST and AVOD inventory readily available for purchase.

“We are impressed with how the AU metric correlates to brand outcomes and confirms that many FAST and AVOD publishers have high-attention placements,” said Greg Smith, Founder and CEO of StreamVantage. “Given that ad rates in FAST and AVOD are already competitive, this marketplace will yield high-value placements for advertisers.”

“This partnership reinforces Adelaide’s commitment to making high-attention ad inventory more accessible to media buyers, ensuring campaigns deliver meaningful impact,” said Marc Guldimann, CEO of Adelaide. “We are excited to expand our AU metric into the rapidly growing FAST and AVOD ecosystems.”
