# AdvicePay Unveils Updated Corporate Branding to Reflect Evolution of its Platform

AdvicePay, the industry-leading platform for managing billing, payments, and compliance of fee-for-service financial planning, recently unveiled an updated corporate brand identity, which marks its evolution from a fee-for-service payments platform to a comprehensive solution that empowers broker-dealers, Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs), and solopreneurs to streamline operations and drive sustainable growth through fee-for-service financial planning.

The brand refresh includes a new logo, refined color palette, and updated messaging that better communicates the breadth and depth of the AdvicePay platform. The company’s website and social media channels have also been updated to reflect this new brand identity.

“Over the past eight years, AdvicePay has helped to transform fee-for-service planning into a mainstream segment of the industry, making it simple and straightforward for advisors to get paid for the value they provide,” said AdvicePay Chief Executive Officer and founder Alan Moore. “I am proud of the work we’ve done to advance this critical part of the industry and wanted our brand to fully reflect the broader scope of our mission. I want to thank the AdvicePay marketing team for their creativity and ingenuity in leading this effort.”

Since its public launch in 2018, AdvicePay has grown to serve more than 11,000 advisors and has processed 1.5+ million transactions totaling more than $770 million in financial planning fees from over 245,000 clients. The company’s refreshed branding emphasizes its expanded suite of capabilities, which now include eSignature, billing & payments, engagement workflow, approvals, deliverables tracking, and more.

AdvicePay proves that financial planning is profitable and can help firms build relationships with next-gen clients who are still building wealth, but will eventually convert to assets-under-management (AUM)-based billing clients. Unlike other tools in an advisor’s tech stack, AdvicePay is among the few technology platforms serving as a direct revenue generator.

“AdvicePay has evolved beyond simply processing payments,” said Shannon Beck, Head of Sales & Marketing for AdvicePay. “We now provide a comprehensive platform that empowers financial professionals of all sizes—from solo advisors to large broker-dealers—to integrate fee-for-service into their practice and drive sustainable revenue growth. Our new brand identity, embodying boldness, trustworthiness, and confidence, perfectly reflects this evolution and the enhanced capabilities of our platform.”
