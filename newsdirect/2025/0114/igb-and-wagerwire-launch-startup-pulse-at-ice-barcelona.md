It is dedicated to fun and educational content for and featuring exciting startups in the industry, who otherwise don’t get enough attention. Offering attendees a front-row seat to the next wave of innovation, storytelling, and collaboration in gaming, The Startup Pulse will feature three main components:

With over twenty years of experience in affiliate marketing, casino operations, and game aggregation, Cedomir brings a wealth of knowledge and a commitment to promoting API governance and best integration practices in the gambling industry. Other industry leaders will also participate in this dynamic session.
* Moments of Ethos, Mythos, Chaos: Founders will take the stage to share their defining moments—stories of success, failure, and growth that highlight the raw and real side of entrepreneurship. Featuring WagerWire’s Travis Geiger alongside other industry pioneers like Karolina Pelc (BeyondPlay) and this segment dives deep into the tension, chaos, and brilliance behind building a game-changing business.
