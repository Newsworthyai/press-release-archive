# Jason Britton of Reflection Asset Management to Serve as Newday Impact’s Chief Investment Officer and Assume Seat on Board of Directors

Newday Impact, a pioneer in values-driven investing, announced today that Jason Britton, founder of Reflection Asset Management (RAM) and Reflection Analytics, which developed the revolutionary Reflect software platform, will support Newday as Chief Investment Officer and join their Board of Directors.

"Jason’s leadership at Reflection Companies echoes our shared vision of transforming the investment landscape,” said Doug Heske, CEO and Founder of Newday Impact. “With him as CIO and through this collaboration, Newday will expand its product set and values-based analytics capabilities to individual investors while continuing to serve values-driven institutional clients.”

Mr. Britton’s extensive expertise in financial services, having advised on more than $10 billion in AUA throughout his career, and his reputation for investment innovation, as a process patent holder and professor of thematic investing, will support the already industry leading work of Newday Impact.

This partnership between Newday Impact and their NIO Platform, Reflection Asset Management, and Reflection Analytics brings together three institutions committed to providing investors the tools that allow them to get informed, involved, and invested in alignment with their principles.

“We’re entering a new chapter where values-based investing is no longer exclusive to institutions,” said Britton said. “I am so excited to be a part of the democratization of this type of investing. The Newday NIO platform will be the premier place for individuals to engage in all facets of impact.”

About Reflection Analytics

Reflection Analytics’ patent-pending software—Reflect—is the only ESG ratings tool designed to serve asset managers, financial advisors and investors/institutions across six key areas: advisory, due diligence, compliance, portfolio management, auditing and reporting. Unlike other ESG software, which are reliant on rating methodologies rooted in the corporate perspective, Reflect analyzes 250 data points from an investor-focused viewpoint. As the industry’s only “Names Rule-compliant tool,” Reflect helps portfolio managers meet new compliance standards, with the SEC’s expansion of the “Names Rule” to include ESG funds taking effect in less than two years. Reflect maintains comprehensive self-reported and third-party data on 6,500 companies, or 98% of the global market cap. For more information, visit: www.reflectvalues.com.
