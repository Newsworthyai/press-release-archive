Mariner, a leading national financial services firm, today announced the acquisitions of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cassady Schiller Wealth, Englewood, Colo.-based Jenkins Wealth and Marlborough, Mass.-based Triton Financial Group. The acquisitions comprise a combined total of approximately $1.087 billion in assets under advisement and contribute to Mariner’s national growth strategy and goal of reaching 5,000 advisors by 2027.

“At Mariner, we value partnerships with firms that demonstrate exceptional client focus and a proven track record of success,” said Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner. “Cassady Schiller, Jenkins Wealth and Triton Financial Group embody the principles our clients have become accustomed to and will be instrumental in building the holistic ecosystem that redefines how wealth is managed in this country.”

Cassady Schiller Wealth is a comprehensive financial services firm specializing in wealth management, financial planning, tax planning and retirement strategies. The eight-member team has over three decades of experience serving high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth business owners, medical professionals and closely held family businesses.

“Over the past 10 years, we have experienced tremendous growth. To take the firm to the next level for our clients and employees, we realized we needed to align with a like-minded partner, and Mariner stands out as the perfect match,” said Mike Clark, partner at Cassady Schiller. "This move represents an exciting milestone in our growth journey, and Mariner is the ideal firm to help us write the next chapter of our story."

Jenkins Wealth was founded in 2002 to help investors achieve financial confidence by offering them comprehensive financial planning and investment strategies that seek to deliver satisfying returns with less volatility. The firm is guided by its mission to provide efficient and secure investment strategies to both individual and institutional investors.

"My team and I are dedicated to being good stewards of financial resources and have been deeply committed to helping others achieve success and fulfillment in their financial lives,” said Brad Jenkins, founder, CEO, and chief investment officer at Jenkins Wealth. “Joining Mariner will enable us to expand our offerings and continue to serve our clients with the same dedication and transparency that have always defined our approach, and I couldn’t be more thrilled about the opportunities ahead for our clients and our team.”

Founded in 1995 by President Bob Gustafson, Triton Financial Group boasts a client-first philosophy and expertise across key areas including portfolio management, insurance planning, tax management and estate planning. Named for Triton, the Greek god of the sea known for his three-pronged spear, Triton Financial Group takes a "three-pronged approach" to wealth management, integrating financial planning, investment management and risk management to support clients in making informed financial decisions through a personalized approach that prioritizes trust and integrity.

“Our clients have always and unequivocally been our top priority, and joining Mariner allows us to continue delivering the same quality of service while adding value through Mariner’s resources and expertise,” said Gustafson. “Mariner’s focus on client-first service and its strong philanthropic culture made it the ideal partner for this next chapter of Triton’s journey.”

Houlihan Lokey acted as financial advisor to Cassady Schiller. Dynasty Investment Bank served as financial advisor to Jenkins Wealth. Pederson&Co served as financial advisor to Triton Financial Group. All three firms will assume the Mariner name upon their operational closes in the first quarter of 2025 and will remain in their current office locations with current teams in place. Mariner now has 124 locations nationwide, including an office in Puerto Rico.
