# Jamit Deploys Web3 Podcasting Platform on Lisk Network to Empower Creators and Enhance Audio Content

Lisk, a leading Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain empowering builders in high-growth markets, is proud to partner with Jamit, the world’s first web3 podcasting platform. Jamit is deploying its podcasting application on the Lisk network, offering a decentralized and scalable solution to empower audio creators, reward listeners, and reshape the podcasting landscape.

This strategic collaboration enables Jamit to leverage Lisk’s cost-efficient and scalable blockchain infrastructure, ensuring an optimal environment for both creators and listeners within the web3 ecosystem. Together, Lisk and Jamit are pioneering a new era of audio content creation that puts ownership, rewards, and creative freedom at the forefront.

A New Creative Economy for PodcastingJamit, created by the team behind West Africa’s pioneering music platform TruSpot, is redefining how stories are told and valued in the digital age. With a core philosophy focused on empowering creators, Jamit ensures that every podcaster retains 100% ownership of their content, while listeners are rewarded for their engagement through the platform’s innovative Listen-to-Earn system. This creates a truly sustainable and equitable ecosystem for all participants.

“We’re excited to support Jamit as it takes the next step in its mission to create a fairer, more inclusive podcasting industry,” said Dominic Schwenter COO of Lisk. “Jamit’s platform is a perfect example of how web3 technologies can be used to empower creators, reward listeners, and deliver value to the global podcasting community. We are proud to provide the scalable infrastructure to make this vision a reality.”

Unlocking the Future of Podcasting with Web3 and BlockchainJamit’s integration with Lisk’s Layer 2 blockchain enables creators to enjoy lower costs, greater efficiency, and the security of Ethereum, all while benefiting from faster transaction times and improved scalability. With Lisk’s infrastructure, Jamit can provide an optimized platform for podcast creators and listeners alike, paving the way for a new era of decentralized content.

At the heart of the Jamit platform is the NFT Headphone system, which allows listeners to earn rewards as they engage with content they love. This innovative approach not only incentivizes audience participation but also provides a new revenue stream for creators. As part of the platform’s web3 ecosystem, creators are compensated from the moment their content is released and interacted with, ensuring fair compensation from the start.

“Jamit is not just another podcasting platform, we’re building a new creative economy where every voice has value, and every story finds its audience,” said Ike Orizu, Founder and CEO of Jamit. “By leveraging Lisk’s blockchain technology, we are democratizing access to high-quality content creation tools and rewarding listeners for their engagement—changing the way the podcasting industry operates at its core.”

A Global Vision for the Future of Audio ContentJamit is particularly impactful in emerging markets, where traditional platforms have often failed to meet the needs of local creators and listeners. The platform’s creator-first philosophy, combined with Lisk’s global network, creates an opportunity to support diverse voices and stories from all corners of the world, amplifying local perspectives on a global stage.

Jamit’s Virtual Studio, an AI-powered tool for audio production, democratizes high-quality content creation, enabling creators from any background to produce professional-grade podcasts without expensive equipment. This inclusive approach opens up new opportunities for individuals across the globe to share their stories and build sustainable careers.
