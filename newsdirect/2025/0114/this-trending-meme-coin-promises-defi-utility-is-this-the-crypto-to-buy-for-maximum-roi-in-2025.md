2024 was a great year for crypto. Both Bitcoin and many large altcoins reached their all-time highs and the market is still gaining momentum. Moreover, the recent Bitcoin retracement below $100k suggests that traders are considering alternative investments.

This means that the altcoin season is starting again. Among the most promising projects in this cycle are Ethereum-based tokens, both utility tokens and memecoins. One particular memeFi token, blends the best features of both.

Traders Are Moving To Ethereum-based Altcoins With Bitcoin recently retracing to $94,000, traders are looking at altcoins that can give bigger returns. Most recently, reports surfaced of record profits on memecoins, including on platforms like Pump.fun. However, this Solana-based meme coin launchpad has attracted significant negative attention.

Most recently, suspected insiders have made $20 million on a Focai.fun token. The project has attracted criticism as insiders managed to buy 60.5% of the token’s total supply. Because Solana-based tokens are so easy to launch, the platform is attracting low-quality projects. This is why many traders are moving to Ethereum-based memecoins.

For one, Dogecoin is seeing a significant positive momentum, outperforming most other tokens. In the past week, the token was up 19.05%, thanks to continued attention from its main backer, Elon Musk. Ethereum-based utility tokens are also up, with Arbitrum notably up 14.5% over the past week.

One Ethereum Token Combines Memes With DeFiIn this bullish environment for Ethereum tokens, one project is attracting attention. The memeFi project Cutoshi recently raised over $1,572 million in presale investments. In particular, investors are attracted to its unique blend of memes and DeFi.

For one, Cutoshi is inspired by the lucky cat symbol, which is recognized worldwide. At the same time, it takes its name from the Bitcoin creator Satoshi, with whom it shares its passion for decentralization. By blending memes and DeFi, Cutoshi hopes to bring the benefits of decentralization to a wider audience than ever.

To achieve its vision for a more decentralized crypto space, Cutoshi is building a complete DeFi ecosystem. At its heart will be the Cutoshi multichain DEX, an exchange that hopes to compete with giants like Binance. Unlike Binance, however, Cutoshi DEX will allow users to retain full custody over their wallets. This ensures users' funds are safely within their control, just like Satoshi intended.

What is Cutoshi’s ROI Potential? Currently, Cutoshi is priced at $0.031, which is more than double its price at the start of the presale. However, if the project manages to achieve its goals, it can still deliver a substantial return on investment (ROI).

The potential for the project will ultimately depend both on its memecoin appeal and its DEX adoption. Because the project is still in its early stages, the potential for an upside is high. For instance, Cutoshi could realistically reach $1 in 2025 and still not break the top 200 tokens. However, this will ultimately depend on whether traders recognize its potential.

With more and more users understanding the importance of self-custody and decentralization, Cutoshi has a shot at gaining users. Thanks to its meme coin appeal, it also has a chance to reach viral status, further driving adoption.
