# Comcast to Expand Fiber Broadband Services Across Butte & Colusa Counties

Comcast announced it will expand its reliable, smart, high-speed, fiber broadband network in both residential and commercial neighborhoods in Northern California’s Butte and Colusa counties. By 2026 these expansion efforts will bring Comcast’s next-generation network to over 260 locations in Colusa County and to 445 locations in Butte County, all of which had previously been unserved.

This broadband network expansion is made possible by an over $8 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) Grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private funding by Comcast. Comcast also recently announced it received FFA grants from the CPUC to expand its fiber-rich network in Tulare, Marin, Sutter and Madera counties.

“Comcast’s commitment to digital inclusion means ensuring that everyone, no matter where they live, has the opportunity to succeed in the digital world,” said David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President, Comcast California. “By working together in these public-private partnerships, not only are we working collectively to close the digital divide in Butte and Colusa counties, but we also begin to create a brighter future for residents and ensure that all individuals have the tools and resources they need to succeed in a digital age.”

“I want to thank Comcast and the California Public Utilities Commission for working together, in this public-private partnership, as we continue to invest in the future of Colusa County,” said CA State Senator Megan Dahle (D-1). “Working together to close the digital divide in our region will open doors to education, healthcare, and economic opportunity for all residents, ensuring no one is left behind."

“Last-mile broadband investments in Butte County are needed and improve quality of life,” said Andy Pickett, Chief Administrative Officer for Butte County. “We are pleased to hear residents in and around the City of Oroville will have better access to broadband.”

Comcast’s commitment to communities goes beyond network expansion and aims to increase economic mobility through programs that help bridge the digital divide like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households low-cost, high-speed Internet and affordable computers. Since its inception in 2011, the program has connected more than 2.2 million Californians. Over the past three years, Comcast has invested over $130 million in cash and in-kind donations into California nonprofits focused on helping people build digital skills, expanding WiFi-connected Lift Zones and funding connectivity and Internet adoption programs.
