Oguz Alper Oktem, CEO of Marti Technologies, Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN: MRT), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Marti is Türkiye’s mobility super app, offering multiple transportation services to its riders. Marti operates a ride-hailing service that matches riders with car and motorcycle drivers and operates a large fleet of rental e-mopeds, e-bikes and e-scooters. All of Marti’s offerings are serviced by proprietary software systems and IoT infrastructure.

The company has begun to monetize its hide-hailing service, putting the company on the path to capturing Türkiye’s $7 billion ride-hailing opportunity.
