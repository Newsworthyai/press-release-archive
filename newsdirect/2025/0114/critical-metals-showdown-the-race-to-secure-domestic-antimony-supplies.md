# Critical Metals Showdown: The Race to Secure Domestic Antimony Supplies

Antimony, a critical mineral essential for semiconductors, military applications, and energy storage, is rapidly becoming a focal point in global trade tensions. Following China’s recent export ban on gallium, germanium, and antimony, the market dynamics of this vital resource are shifting dramatically—raising significant national security concerns for the United States and its allies.

“Secure sourcing of critical minerals is critical to the defense industrial base,” noted Adam Burstein, technical director for strategic and critical materials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy. Antimony’s unique properties make it indispensable for ammunition, military optics, flame-resistant materials, and high-tech devices, yet the U.S. currently has no domestic production.

In 2023, China, Russia, and Tajikistan supplied nearly 80% of the global antimony market. China alone produced nearly 50% of the world’s supply in 2024 but is now limiting exports as part of a broader strategy to consolidate mineral production internally and exert control over critical supply chains. This disruption has sent antimony prices soaring—rising 250% in 2024 and currently trading at record highs between $39,500 and $40,000 per metric ton in Rotterdam. Traders anticipate prices climbing even higher, with some small lots already sold at $40,000.

The stakes are high. As Ellie Saklatvala, head of non-ferrous metals pricing at Argus, noted, “The U.S. has already diversified its supply chains away from China where possible, buying more from Southeast Asia. However, it is unclear in the near term how they will be able to fill the gap now left by China.”

The U.S. Department of Defense has already invested over $439 million in building critical mineral supply chains and is backing domestic antimony mining projects, including a strategic mine in Idaho. Stockpiling and diversification efforts are key strategies to mitigate supply shocks and ensure continued production of essential military materials.

“Antimony is not just a commodity—it’s a cornerstone of military preparedness and economic resilience,” emphasized a defense industry expert. Its applications in ammunition, protective equipment, and military optics underscore its importance to U.S. defense capabilities.

These developments highlight antimony’s growing importance in geopolitics, presenting both challenges and opportunities as nations navigate supply chain disruptions, surging prices, and the quest for secure sourcing of critical minerals.

Perpetua Resources: Securing Domestic Antimony Supply

As China’s export ban reshapes the global antimony market, Perpetua Resources (Nasdaq: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA) has emerged as a crucial player in the effort to secure a domestic supply of this critical mineral. The company recently achieved a major milestone with the U.S. Forest Service’s issuance of the Final Record of Decision (ROD) for its Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho. This decision clears the path for the redevelopment of the only identified antimony reserve in the United States—a project that could significantly bolster the nation’s strategic mineral security.

The Stibnite Gold Project is expected to produce an estimated 148 million pounds of antimony over its first six years, supplying roughly 35% of U.S. annual demand based on 2022 consumption levels. With China responsible for nearly half of global antimony production, this project marks a pivotal step in reducing U.S. reliance on foreign sources. Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, emphasized the project’s importance: "The Stibnite Gold Project can deliver decisive wins for our communities, the environment, the economy, and our national security."

Beyond its critical mineral production, the project also promises substantial environmental and economic benefits. Perpetua plans to invest over $1 billion in the redevelopment of the abandoned Stibnite mine site, creating an average of 550 jobs in rural Idaho during operations. Environmental restoration is a cornerstone of the project, which includes removing legacy tailings, improving water quality, and reopening miles of river habitat for native fish species blocked for over 80 years.

The Stibnite Gold Project is also poised to be one of the highest-grade open-pit gold mines in the United States, with an estimated 4.8 million ounces of gold reserves and annual production of 450,000 ounces during its first four years. These combined outputs position the project as both an economic driver for the region and a strategic asset for the nation.

Perpetua’s decade-long commitment to the community and rigorous environmental stewardship have earned widespread support. During the public comment periods for the project, over 23,000 letters of support were submitted, underscoring its importance to stakeholders. Cascade Mayor Judy Nissula expressed the local sentiment: “Perpetua Resources has shown us the type of company they are. They’ve partnered with local businesses, provided well-paying jobs, and demonstrated their commitment to leaving the site better than it is today.”

As Perpetua finalizes permits and secures project financing, the Stibnite Gold Project represents a significant opportunity for the United States to rebuild its critical mineral supply chain, reduce dependence on adversarial nations, and strengthen its position in an increasingly competitive global market.
