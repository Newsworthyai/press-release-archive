While Bitcoin (BTC) is reaching an all-time high, the rich know where to keep their money. Now, the 1% are diversifying their portfolios and more and more are investing in Musk’s favorite coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) and the underdog Cutoshi (CUTO) also.

Bitcoin The First Real Crypto Still Winning BigBitcoin (BTC) is by far the most popular token among the wealthy and financial institutions. If they hold any crypto at all, chances are they are holding Bitcoin. The reason for this is that Bitcoin is the first crypto and is widely perceived as the safest coin to invest in.

What is more, Bitcoin is also showing no signs of slowing down its growth. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,463, near its all-time high. With a year-to-date price increase of 143%, Bitcoin even outperformed many major altcoins.

The thesis that Bitcoin is among the safest crypto assets seems vindicated. Now that regulatory and political changes in the US are making crypto go mainstream, Bitcoin will be among the top beneficiaries. Some analysts are even predicting the coin will reach $1M in the near future.

More realistic predictions put Bitcoin at $115,000 in a month, thanks to its strong technicals. Moving averages are overwhelmingly positive, indicating a strong buy. However, the token is entering overbought territory. This is why analysts see Bitcoin facing significant volatility in 3 months, with an average price of $112,000.

Still, Bitcoin is not going anywhere. The 1% are definitely taking note and are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their portfolios.

Dogecoin: The Meme Coin With Serious PotentialA potentially unlikely candidate for the 1% is Dogecoin (DOGE). Originally started as a joke token, Doge really made serious gains during the GameStop saga, largely thanks to its billionaire backer, Elon Musk.

Musk has been pumping Dogecoin for years and even said he is periodically buying Doge for his children. Thanks to this pumping by one of the most influential people on Earth, Doge went up. While Musk has recently become a somewhat controversial figure, he still has a strong following, even among the 1%. This is why many of them are loading up on Doge.

Currently, DOGE is priced at $0.4, with a year-to-date price increase of 340%. It remains one of the top performers among memecoins. This has convinced some analysts that Doge could reach the elusive $1 mark in the near future.

Cutoshi The Underdog Taking The Crypto World By StormWhile millionaires love Bitcoin and Doge, one token is increasingly attracting their attention. Cutoshi (CUTO) recently became viral after securing $1 million in investments weeks after its presale launch.

The reason why this memeFi token is popular is its unique blend of memes and DeFi. Like Dogecoin, Cutoshi is a meme token, based on the lucky cat (Maneki-neko) symbol. But like Bitcoin, it has real utility and is inspired by its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is all about decentralization, digital freedom and giving control to users. It will have a multichain DEX, which will enable users to retain custody over their assets. What is more, its learning platform will help educate new users about DeFi.

Cutoshi hopes to use memes to bring more people into DeFi. With more people knowing about the importance of self-custody, platforms like Cutoshi have a chance to grow the DeFi ecosystem.
