# Therma Bright Inc. (OTC: TBRIF) Expands in $6.72 Billion Compression Market

In an aging world where healthcare costs are rising, the demand for cost-effective, non-invasive treatments is skyrocketing. One sector seeing a surge in interest is compression therapy, a market projected to grow from $4.18 billion in 2024 to $6.72 billion by 2033. Traditionally dominated by compression stockings and bulky pneumatic devices, the space is undergoing a technological shift toward portable, user-friendly solutions—opening the door for companies developing next-generation devices.

One under-the-radar player making moves in this space is Therma Bright Inc. (TSXV: THRM) (OTCQB: TBRIF) (FSE: JNX). The company’s Venowave VW5, an FDA-cleared, battery-powered compression device, has been gaining traction in the U.S. market, especially following recent reimbursement approvals from Medicare and private insurers. With a growing distribution network, strong early sales, and a huge addressable market, Therma Bright is quickly positioning itself as a compelling small-cap investment in a sector experiencing major tailwinds.

With reimbursement momentum building and major distribution deals already in place, is Therma Bright an overlooked gem in the booming compression therapy industry? Let’s take a closer look at the opportunity.

Therma Bright Inc.: Advancing Medical Innovation with Venowave VW5

Therma Bright Inc. is a developer and investment partner in advanced diagnostic and medical device technologies. The company focuses on delivering high-quality, innovative healthcare solutions to both consumers and medical professionals.

Milestone Achievement: HCPCS Code Reimbursement Secured in Record TimeTherma Bright and its nationwide U.S. distribution partners have successfully secured Medicare and Medicaid HCPCS Level II code reimbursements within just 60 days. Since October 1, 2024, over 110 Venowave VW5 units have been deployed across the U.S. in pilot tests, with 25 units already receiving full reimbursement through commercial health networks and federal healthcare programs. The remaining 85 units are anticipated to follow suit soon.

Given these strong results, the company has initiated discussions on scaling sales, optimizing delivery logistics, and ramping up manufacturing with its distribution partners.

"Our U.S. national distributors are highly impressed with the speed of CMS reimbursements for the Venowave VW5," said Rob Fia, CEO of Therma Bright. "Typically, brand-new HCPCS Level II codes require more time to process, but our code has been efficiently handled within 60 days. This sets a strong precedent for even faster reimbursements in the future and supports our commercialization efforts."

Expanding U.S. Distribution with DME AuthorityTherma Bright has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with DME Authority, a Nashville-based distributor, to significantly expand Venowave’s reach. Under this agreement, DME Authority will establish at least three comprehensive distribution agreements, requiring an initial inventory purchase of $2 million. Collectively, these partners will commit to purchasing $6 million worth of Venowave VW5 units within the first six months of 2025, with an equal commitment for Q3 and Q4.

DME Authority will also acquire Therma Bright’s remaining in-stock inventory as part of this agreement, ensuring seamless market expansion.

"Our strategy to secure Venowave’s HCPCS code was crucial, and the timing couldn’t be better," said Erick Gosse, CEO of DME Authority. "Medicare patients have lacked a mobile mechanical compression solution—Venowave now fills that gap effectively."

Product Overview: Venowave VW5The Venowave VW5 is a compact, battery-operated peristaltic pump designed to improve vascular and lymphatic flow in the lower limbs. It qualifies for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement under 10 medical indications and is the only Medicare-approved mobile mechanical compression system under HCPCS code E0683.

* Clinically Proven Benefits: Increases venous blood flow by 64% within 2 minutes and by 88% after 50 minutes of use.
* Enhanced Mobility: Lightweight (250g), discreet, and wireless, allowing patients to remain active during treatment.
* FDA-Designated Durable Medical Equipment (DME): Designed for repeated use across multiple patients.

Major Purchase Orders Driving Market ExpansionTherma Bright continues to strengthen its market presence through key purchase agreements:

* Valor Medical Solutions: Placed an initial order for 100 Venowave VW5 units following successful pilot trials. The purchase equates to a minimum of $81,955 USD in HCPCS code reimbursements ($117,952 CAD). Valor anticipates increasing its orders biweekly to meet growing demand.
* DME Authority: Confirmed a major purchase order of 1,750 Venowave VW5 units, totaling $1.43 million USD ($2.05 million CAD) in reimbursements. This milestone further solidifies DME’s role as a Premier Distributor Partner for Therma Bright.

Market Outlook: Seizing a Growing OpportunityThe global compression therapy market, valued at $4.18 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to $6.72 billion by 2033, representing a CAGR of 7.3%. Therma Bright is well-positioned to capitalize on this expanding market through strategic partnerships, timely reimbursements, and the increasing adoption of Venowave VW5.

"With strong distributor commitments, rapid reimbursement processing, and increasing patient demand, we anticipate significant revenue growth in 2025 and beyond," added Rob Fia.

Therma Bright remains committed to innovation, accessibility, and enhancing patient care as it scales its commercialization efforts for Venowave VW5 in the U.S. healthcare market.
