# Deaf Organizations Fund Unveils 2025 Grantees Resourcing Deaf Communities

Deaf Organizations Fund (DOF) proudly announces the selection of four organizations receiving unrestricted grants this month to address the diverse needs of their deaf communities through 2025: Atomic Hands, Deaf Defy, Inc., DEAFinitely, Inc., and The Black Deaf Project. The $100K distributed among these organizations will support accessible educational and multicultural resources, break down healthcare barriers, and expand opportunities for DeafBlind youth, giving grantees the flexibility to direct funding where it is most needed.

“As a small, Deaf-run nonprofit, it means so much to see a funder like this one specifically targeting deaf-centric organizations,” said Zaineb Abdulla, Founder of Deaf Defy, Inc. “I love the inclusion of using American Sign Language in all engagement with DOF.”

DOF’s second unrestricted Impact Grant for Deaf Organizations received a record-breaking 84 applications from deaf-centric organizations and programs. In alignment with participatory grantmaking, a community-led grant review committee shaped the decision-making process. They evaluated all eligible applications and supported DOF in making the final award decisions.

“Our trust-based approach to grantmaking has been met with incredible support, and we’re excited to continue working alongside organizations that are igniting meaningful change in our deaf communities,” said Sasha Ponappa, Executive Director of DOF. "We are also deeply grateful for ongoing support from our donors and partners, whose contributions ensure DOF's ability to fund and resource deaf organizations."

As DOF enters its sixth funding cycle, the team is also focused on expanding resources beyond grant dollars. This support includes grantee coaching, technical assistance, the development of an accessible training program and community hub for deaf organization leaders, and advocacy for disability justice within the philanthropic sector.

To learn more about DOF’s impact and the work of its grantee organizations, interested parties are invited to view the newly released Social Impact Report. Funders and supporters who wish to contribute to DOF’s mission are encouraged to reach out directly.
