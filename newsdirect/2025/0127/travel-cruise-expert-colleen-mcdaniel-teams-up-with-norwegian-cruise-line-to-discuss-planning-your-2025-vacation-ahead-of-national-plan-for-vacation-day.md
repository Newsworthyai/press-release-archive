Right now, Norwegian is offering 50% off all cruises, combinable with its all-new More at Sea package, which includes more guest favorite amenities such as unlimited open bar, specialty dining, high-speed Wi-Fi, shore excursion credits, kids sail free on select voyages and more for the ultimate cruise deal with over $2,000 in added value. For even more savings, Norwegian’s new resident rate promotion offers an additional 20% off select Bahamas and Caribbean voyages sailing through April 30, 2025 for residents of Florida, California, New York, Texas, and Louisiana.

Through April 2025, Norwegian will have 13 ships sailing the Caribbean, offering families more to enjoy with port-packed itineraries to tropical beach destinations. Departing from 10 convenient U.S. homeports, including New York, Miami, Orlando, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, travelers can easily access stunning beach getaways.

The recently renovated Norwegian Encore, which will sail seven-day Caribbean voyages from Miami through March 2025 and again in the fall, features the exciting Encore Speedway, a two-story thrilling racetrack at sea, along with the Galaxy Pavilion virtual reality complex and a revamped adults-only Spice H2O outdoor lounge. Families can also enjoy expanded dining options, redesigned suites in The Haven—NCL’s exclusive ship-within-a-ship luxury experience—and a variety of family-friendly attractions, including an Aqua Park with multi-story slides and Splash Academy Youth Activities for kids.

For those looking for the latest and greatest experiences at sea, NCL’s newest ship, Norwegian Aqua, will debut in April 2025. The ship will offer Caribbean voyages from Port Canaveral and Miami, Fla. as well as itineraries to Bermuda from New York. Norwegian Aqua introduces the world’s first hybrid rollercoaster and waterslide, the Aqua Slidecoaster, which propels guests through thrilling twists and turns around the ship’s funnel. The ship also features the Glow Court, a digital sports complex with an interactive LED floor that transforms into a nightclub in the evening, along with 17 restaurants, including NCL’s first Thai restaurant—Sukhothai, and 18 bars and lounges. For entertainment, guests can enjoy “Revolution: A Celebration of Prince,” an immersive tribute show honoring the legendary artist.
