# ELD Asset Management Warns Trump Tariffs Could Stoke Inflation

ELD Asset Management, a leading regional investment and wealth manager, has issued a cautionary note to investors regarding the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs on imports from several of the United States’ major trading partners. The firm warns that these tariffs could have significant implications for inflation, both domestically and globally, and advises investors to be prepared for potential market volatility.

Wide-ranging impact

The proposed tariffs are expected to lead to price hikes on goods imported to the U.S. which could contribute to higher inflation in the world’s largest economy. The imposition of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports by trading partners cannot be ruled out and the ripple effects of these policies would almost certainly be felt worldwide as global supply chains and trade flows are disrupted, potentially triggering inflationary pressures in other economies.

Consequences of tariffs include:

1. Rising consumer prices
2. Supply chain disruptions
3. Central bank responses

Advice for investors

ELD Asset Management suggests investors remain open to further portfolio diversification into assets that tend to do well in inflationary environments including precious metals and other hedges like inflation-linked bonds which may help mitigate the risks associated with rising inflation.

Best to be prepared

“While it’s impossible to say for certain whether or not Mr. Trump will make good on his campaign promises vis a vis tariffs, it makes sense to keep one eye firmly on assets that perform well in inflationary environments. We think the potential for a rout in stocks and higher living costs for ordinary Americans could see President Trump hold fire but we believe it’s better to be prepared,” explained George Palmer - Director of Private Clients at ELD Asset Management.
