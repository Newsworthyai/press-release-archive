# The Starties: Real-Money Gaming Startups Celebrated in New Community-Driven Awards Show

The Starties, the groundbreaking awards show created by startups, for startups, will debut on March 12, 2025, at NEXT.io Summit New York. Co-produced by WagerWire and BettingStartups.com, the high-energy event will spotlight the most promising innovators in real-money gaming, bringing together a powerful community of founders, investors, and mentors who are driving the future of the industry.

In contrast to traditional industry awards, The Starties highlight the most innovative and promising early-stage companies across categories including Launch of the Year, Best Collaboration, Coolest Cap Table, Best Bootstrappers, Startup of the Year, and more.

The Starties was cofounded by Travis Geiger and Jesse Learmonth, cofounders of WagerWire and BettingStartups.com, respectively, and is co-produced by the two companies. The inaugural edition is in partnership with NEXT.io, and will take place during their Summit New York in Manhattan’s financial district. The Starties will benefit from multi-channel promotion through the Wire Media Group, BettingStartups.com, and NEXT.io.

Jesse Learmonth says the theme of year one is community. “The Starties will bring together a collective of builders, disruptors, and challengers that are creating the future of real-money gaming. Other awards shows give them a token ‘Rising Star’ category, but that falls short of the recognition they deserve. The Starties is here to put industry entrepreneurs front-and-centre.”

Travis Geiger added, "The Starties community was formed to celebrate excellence, elevate spirits and to support fellow-travelers knowing not everyone has the same advantages. The Starties stands out from the field as truly fresh and original. And hold onto your butts, because the awards on March 12 at NEXT Summit New York will blow you away.”

Pierre Lindh, co-founder & Managing Editor of NEXT.io, commented, "The Starties embodies everything NEXT.io stands for—community, collaboration, and breaking the mold. It’s a celebration of the talent pushing boundaries and we’re proud to support the journey and fueling what’s next.“

The presenting sponsor of the inaugural Starties is Eberg Capital, a leading investment firm with deep sector focus in sports, gaming, and entertainment. With investments in top sports franchises like the Miami Marlins, Real Salt Lake, the Utah Royals, and the Alpine Formula 1 Racing Team, Eberg Capital is reshaping the future of sports through strategic partnerships and innovation.

Roger Ehrenberg, founder of Eberg Capital, shared his excitement for the initiative: "The Starties has the potential to be far more than an awards show. It’s the foundation for a community where the best founders, investors, and operators in and around sports can come to engage, contribute, and win."

Also sponsoring the event is:

* Defy the Odds, an organization that supports underrepresented founders in the gaming industry by providing mentorship, resources, and access to capital. The “Defied the Odds” award, sponsored by the organization, will celebrate startups that have overcome challenges to succeed.
* Optimove Ignite+, the #1 CRM Marketing Platform’s program for accelerating growth of emerging iGaming and Sports Betting operators. The “Marketing Genius” award, sponsored by Optimove Ignite+, will recognize the marketing teams and campaigns that have had outsized impact engaging their target audiences.
* Sportradar Futures Hub. Sportradar is a leading global sports technology company creating immersive experiences for sports fans and bettors, driving pilot projects and adoption opportunities through Futures Hub while helping startups scale with unmatched distribution.

The awards ceremony, which organizers say will be hosted by a celebrity that “will blow peoples minds,” will be bookended by an hour of cocktails and networking. Drinks and light snacks will be provided.
