"We are thrilled to welcome Activate to The Orchard Town Center! As demand grows for unique experiences, we are excited to expand our offerings with Activate. At Vestar, we are committed to making The Orchard Town Center a vibrant lifestyle destination that serves as a true community hub. We believe Westminster’s community will embrace Activate with open arms, coming together for a fun and dynamic gaming experience. The opening of this indoor amenity is perfectly timed to provide a fun activity as the weather cools,” said Kate Heckman, Director of Marketing at The Orchard Town Center.
