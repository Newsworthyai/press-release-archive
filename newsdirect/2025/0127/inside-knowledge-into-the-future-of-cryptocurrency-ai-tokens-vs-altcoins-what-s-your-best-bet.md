# Inside Knowledge Into The Future of Cryptocurrency: AI tokens VS Altcoins, What's your best bet?

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/892346816/NbO19uEm.jpeg)

As the AI narrative is ramping up, a few projects are poised for massive ATH runs, with Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and Near Protocol (NEAR) leading the way. Cardano (ADA) also continues to make strides, with founder Charles Hoskinson unveiling the next critical upgrade that aims for an unparalleled level of decentralization.

Meanwhile, Cutoshi (CUTO) is rapidly emerging as the next big meme play, with its viral presale amassing over $1.64 million in record time. Which one of these promising altcoins could deliver the most outsized gains in 2025? Let’s dive deeper!

FET Is Bottoming Out, Is A Reversal On The Horizon?Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has been struggling over the past month after breaching below the crucial $1.26 support level and recording a 10% weekly loss. However, the chart shows that FET is poised for a breakout as it consolidates within a bullish falling wedge pattern, as pointed out by analyst CryptoSherlock.

The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is heading toward an uneventful weekend, as volume has also tanked 43% with about $155 million worth of FET traded across platforms in the last 24 hours. Currently trading at $1.20 with a market cap of $2.9 billion, FET is gaining attention from investors who are deeming it undervalued, especially in light of the growing demand for AI-focused crypto projects. Once a reversal is confirmed, FET is expected to soar above the key psychological resistance at $1.43, and if momentum is sustained, the next major targets are $1.65 and $1.91.

Near Protocol Gearing Up For BreakoutAt the time of writing Near Protocol (NEAR) trades at $4.91, following a 3.6% intraday decrease, which brings its weekly losses around 9.5%. While Near Protocol has largely underperformed over the last few months, aside from sporadic surges, analyst BullzToshi draws attention to a gigantic, multi-year cup & handle formation on the Near Protocol chart. Near Protocol is continuously testing the upper bound of the “handle” part of the pattern, and as resistance is weakening, a breakout above the trendline could result in a massive upward surge.

Recently, Near Protocol, in partnership with Proximity Labs, has launched the "Bitcoin January" initiative. The goal is to enhance Bitcoin’s integration into DeFi and unlock new opportunities for developers and consumers. This Near Protocol collaboration also introduces innovative features like Chain Signatures, Omnibridge, and Satoshi Ramp, helping advance blockchain interoperability, security, and scalability in DeFi applications.

Cardano Greenlights Introduces Plomin Hard Fork UpgradeCardano (ADA) is set to activate its Plomin hard fork, marking a critical step toward full decentralized governance. Plomin is expected to enhance Cardano’s autonomy and community-driven decision-making, aligning with its long-term decentralization vision. Cardano's DeFi ecosystem is also thriving, with total value locked (TVL) rising 25% in 2025 to $538 million, driven by platforms like Liqwid, MinSwap, and Indigo.

In terms of price action, however, Cardano has also been caught in a trading range, as bulls are struggling to defend the $1 level. Right now, Cardano is priced at $0.97, with a 2.2% decline on the daily timeframe, although it's still in the green on the monthly, showing off a 13% increase. While Cardano is quickly becoming one of the leading Layer 1 platforms in the space that can still yield predictable returns, it’s safe to say that the point of diminishing returns has been reached. This is why many ADA investors are opting to diversify capital into plays with greater room for growth, such as Cutoshi.

Cutoshi Eyes The Meme Coin CrownCutoshi does things differently from the vast majority of meme coins, as it brings real utility to the formula, creating a comprehensive ecosystem that can drive massive amounts of revenue. Cutoshi introduces a cutting-edge DeFi platform that connects isolated blockchains and allows seamless transactions for a wide array of digital assets.

Cutoshi is inspired by the Lucky Cat of Chinese legends, which is believed to bring good fortune to businesses and families. Similarly, Cutoshi brings good fortune to the blockchain and empowers its community with lucrative prizes and rewards.

Throughout the presale, users can earn rewards by completing tasks to help grow the project's user base and social media presence. For their efforts, they will receive cutopoints, which can later be redeemed for $CUTO tokens. Additionally, they can also stake the tokens and support the Cutoshi ecosystem while earning passive income. Early participants have already farmed more than 2.1 million $CUTO and those eager to join this new gold rush can learn more about it here!

Currently in stage 4 of the presale, $CUTO tokens are priced at just $0.031. With its unique utility and meme energy, Cutoshi could emerge as one of the hottest presale projects of 2025 and investors who take action now could secure generational returns once the bull run is in full swing.
