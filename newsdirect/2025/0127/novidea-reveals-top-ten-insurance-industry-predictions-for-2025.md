# Novidea Reveals Top Ten Insurance Industry Predictions for 2025

Novidea, creator of the cloud-native, global insurance management platform for brokers, agents, and MGAs, today revealed the top ten predictions they believe will shape the insurance industry in 2025. The trends driving these predictions will impact insurance organizations across the entire insurance distribution lifecycle. Novidea’s insurance industry experts identified these predictions by monitoring key events throughout 2024, receiving feedback from their global customer base, and engaging in dialogue with industry peers.

“In 2024, the insurance industry experienced significant operational transformation, facing more pressure than ever to innovate, improve efficiency, boost profitability, and deliver a world-class customer experience,” said Jeff Heine, Chief Revenue Officer at Novidea. “To help organizations prepare for the year ahead, our experts assembled a list of predictions that will shape how the industry progresses this year.”

The top predictions for the US insurance market are:

1. M&A will make a comeback. Insurance mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity will resurge in 2025 as the U.S. economy continues its post-pandemic recovery. VC investment in insurtechs will increase as interest rates begin to normalize. Carriers will increasingly consider acquiring MGAs. For these deals to be successful, the right insurtech platform will smooth the integration of purchased companies, facilitating automated and standardized processes across different lines and business types (such as wholesale, retail, and reinsurance) as they are acquired.
2. Cautious gains for reinsurers. Despite record-breaking climate costs, reinsurers will see modest growth in 2025. With the increased frequency of weather-related damages and claims, reinsurers must have greater visibility into the risk that carriers write. This market will rely heavily on tech solutions that deliver a single source of truth across the business, ensuring access to high-quality data. Reinsurers will increasingly want a direct line of sight into the risks being written in order to better manage them.
3. Cybersecurity insurance will evolve. The Crowdstrike outage proved that there are many nuances to cyber insurance policies. We still haven’t seen all of the fallout from this incident. Expect to see an influx of specialized risk products in 2025 catering to business interruptions caused by tech outages that are not malicious in nature. Now is the time for specialty insurers to take stock of their front, middle, and back office systems to ensure they’re ready for future changes.
4. E&S and specialty insurance growth spree continues. In the US, the excess and surplus (E&S) market was the breakout star of the industry in 2024, and this trend will continue in 2025. IT leaders in the E&S market will upgrade their technology to keep up with demand, particularly around automation, AI, cloud, customer experience, and data analytics. E&S wholesaler Pathpoint, a US customer of Novidea’s, is a prime example of one such company who’s already made strategic tech investments, resulting in a 20 percent policy submission growth rate and doubling its sales and underwriting operations.
5. Insurtech-led ecosystems will drive the next wave of insurance innovation. In 2025, the role of insurtechs in creating ecosystems and modular tech solutions will grow. They will serve as facilitators, enabling flexibility and providing the ability to integrate various technologies easily. Insurance marketplaces will continue to evolve and mature. Insurers will implement a robust API fabric and composite APIs to perform essential lifecycle functions.

In the UK, the top predictions that will shape the industry in 2025 are:

1. Profitability in distribution and the rise of MGAs. Carriers in the UK will face mounting pressure to broaden their distribution channels while maintaining profitability. Many will acquire or launch their own MGAs, which have become critical to distribution strategies. For carriers, MGAs offer a way to diversify their portfolios while maintaining tighter control over underwriting standards, helping them balance growth and profitability.
2. Innovation as a strategic imperative in anticipation of BP2. Innovation will be a central theme in 2025 for brokers, carriers, and MGAs. To innovate, these businesses must operate on a unified platform that supports and integrates with emerging technologies and data via APIs. This approach will allow insurers to harness the full potential of new advancements such as AI, complex document generation tools like Docomotion, and more. This drive toward innovation will accelerate with the anticipated BP2 plan set for 2025, bringing new standards to the industry. When delivered, BP2 is expected to create substantial opportunities for brokers, carriers, and MGAs to develop data-driven innovations that translate into customer-centric experiences across the value chain.
3. Climate extremes and insurability challenges. In the UK, climate extremes will become routine rather than rare. These conditions will strain policyholders and insurers alike, driving up the cost of insurance coverage and making carriers reluctant to insure high-risk properties. The UK wholesale insurance market will be particularly impacted as premium pricing and risk management become increasingly complex. For insurers to navigate these challenges, it’s crucial to use high-quality climate data to build resilience and effective risk management into their policies. Reinsurers will work more closely with carriers to deploy their capacity to risks they’re most comfortable with and align with MGAs on specific markets that are higher risk.
4. The insurance talent shortage will come to a head. The London Market has been facing a talent shortage for years, but in 2025, the situation will become urgent, and the industry must do more in 2025 to attract younger talent. One way to attract the next generation of insurance superstars is to highlight the industry’s innovation potential. Core platforms like Novidea enable insurers to be innovative businesses. In addition, departments solely responsible for innovation are now being integrated across all departments, creating a mindset of innovation at their core. This shift is essential for companies looking to stay competitive and recruit top talent.
5. Insurance organizations prepare for the AI revolution. Artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, and insurance is no exception. As AI matures, it promises to transform key processes like claims management, underwriting, and customer service. However, this evolution will not happen overnight. In 2025, insurers will focus on preparing their technology infrastructure and data systems to support AI-driven tools effectively. The most strategic move for insurance organizations is investing in a modern insurance management platform, such as Novidea’s. These platforms provide the flexibility to seamlessly integrate new functionalities, capabilities, and services, enabling businesses to adapt and thrive in this transformative era of technology.
