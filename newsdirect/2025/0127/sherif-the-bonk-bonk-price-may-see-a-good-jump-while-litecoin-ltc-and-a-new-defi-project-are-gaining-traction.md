The buzz in the crypto market is out of this world as traders seek significant gains. Well-known crypto predictors Sherif has made bold predictions for the meme coin Bonk (BONK), stating that it could surge by 10x. At the same time, there seems to be a slow but steady increase in interest in Litecoin (LTC) and a new DeFi project, Elluminex (ELX), which is beginning to catch the attention of smart crypto players.

While speculators like World of Charts have made bullish predictions for LTC, ELX is attracting attention thanks to its long-term vision. This project aims to bring DeFi to the TON Blockchain, which now boasts around 950M active users and over 1B recorded transactions. Therefore, many traders suggest ELX could be the next high-growth DeFi crypto in 2025.

Sherif: The Price of Bonk (BONK) Could Surge FairlyBonk (BONK) has been one of the best meme coins recently. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has jumped over 15% on the one-week chart. The Bonk price grew from around $0.000028 to over $0.000032 during that period.

Crypto analyst Sherif also excited traders with his Bonk price prediction. According to his X post, this meme coin is now in its "buy the news" phase as rumors about a BONK ETF came up. He predicts that Bonk (BONK) could see a huge return if this ETF gets approved.

However, many investors are putting the Bonk coin on the sidelines in favor of tokens like ELX. BONK has already surged nearly 200% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed.

The Litecoin (LTC) Price Looks Ready To Reach $150, Analyst StatesLitecoin (LTC) is also turning some heads with its price movement. As one of the top crypto coins, its value grew from around $100 to over $110 in the past week alone. In other words, over a 10% increase in just a few short days for the Litecoin price per CoinMarketCap.

The community is interested in Litecoin (LTC) thanks to bullish statements from analysts like World of Charts. According to his X post, this altcoin looks ready to soar to $150 soon.

Although this Litecoin price prediction has excited many traders, some are still cautious. This is because the Litecoin market cap now sits at $8B, which means it needs a lot of new money for its price to surge. But, crypto coins like ELX will not face this problem.

Elluminex (ELX) Seen As An Upcoming DeFi Game-Changer On The TON BlockchainWhile Bonk (BONK) and Litecoin (LTC) continue to ride bullish waves, Elluminex (ELX) is making headlines in its own right. This new DeFi hub will be built on the TON Blockchain, lacking in the DeFi department. It will introduce an all-in-one DeFi platform with features that make it stand out from its peers and help bring DeFi to this network.

For example, Elluminex will launch a DEX focusing on high liquidity and low fees for a top-of-the-line trading experience. Moreover, it will have a token reward system that rewards those who stake or farm the ELX native token. Thanks to its robust token burn system, this DeFi coin will have a deflationary model, increasing its scarcity/price over time. This has made interest in ELX skyrocket with over 4M tokens being sold in phase one of its presale alone.

To incentivize purchases, the Elluminex team announced that all ELX holders can vote on important decisions thanks to governance voting rights and access to premium features like AI-driven insights. It costs just $0.06 right now, but this DeFi coin price will rise to $0.08 after phase two begins. Those looking to capitalize on this 33% growth are now stacking up on ELX.

Can Elluminex (ELX) Outpace Bonk (BONK) And Litecoin (LTC) In Terms Of Gains?Although Bonk (BONK) and Litecoin (LTC) are turning some heads right now, Elluminex (ELX) has the potential to surge faster. This new DeFi crypto will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means it will need less money for its price to rise. A Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap listing is expected to trigger a massive rally. Thus, many speculators predict a potential good run in a price jump for ELX this cycle.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
