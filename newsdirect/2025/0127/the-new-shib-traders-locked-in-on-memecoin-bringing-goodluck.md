![](https://public.newsdirect.com/810747472/VMVW3dz3.jpg)

In 2021 Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the market by storm, becoming a millionaire-maker play and shooting up in the crypto top 20 with an 11-figure market cap. Newcomer Cutoshi (CUTO) could soon become the 2025 Shiba Inu; as in a similar fashion boasts a complete DeFi ecosystem that merges meme energy with real utility. Which sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill meme coins. With a cutting-edge decentralized exchange in the works and a vast array of features waiting to be explored, Cutoshi sets the bar higher than ever.

Shiba Inu Dips Below Support As Chart Flashes RedShiba Inu has been struggling over the past few weeks as it has been caught in a narrow trading channel around the $0.000020 mark. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu trades for $0.000019, following a 1.5% intraday dip, bringing its total weekly losses to an alarming 18%. As the focus is shifting toward trendier plays such as Cutoshi and Trump Coin, Shiba Inu’s trading volume has also recorded a significant 25% decline, with roughly $320 million worth of SHIB changing hands in the last 24 hours.

Despite this dip, Shiba Inu can still count on its strong fundamentals that could catalyze a reversal and a surge. Its daily burn rate surged by more than 600%, with over 3.2 million SHIB burned, sustaining the deflationary pressure. Additionally, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 network surpassed 815 million transactions and 2.1 million addresses, contributing to SHIB burns through BONE fees. On-chain data also revealed a 54% rise in daily active addresses, signaling increased adoption and cautious confidence.

While Shiba Inu gives mixed signals, many investors are opting to rotate funds into Cutoshi’s viral presale as a way to mitigate risk and lock in exponential returns.

How Cutoshi Redefines Meme CoinsCutoshi draws inspiration from the Lucky Cat presence in Japanese tradition. These cats are believed to bring good fortune to businesses and families, while Cutoshi brings good fortune to the blockchain and its rapidly growing community that now counts 3,700 active members.

Cutoshi’s unique MemeFi ecosystem is designed to empower and reward users. CUTO DEX is Cutoshi’s flagship feature, a state-of-the-art non-custodial exchange offering lightning-fast cross-chain transactions. The DEX launch was initially scheduled for the upcoming months, but the team has managed to bring the date closer, meaning that CUTO DEX along with the exclusive DeFi wallet will be live much sooner.

Cutoshi incentivizes users to engage with the ecosystem via the Cutoshi Farming mechanism. By staking the $CUTO token or providing liquidity, investors will have the opportunity to earn passive income. Additionally, during and after the presale, individuals can participate in special events and complete various tasks in exchange for points that can be later redeemed for CUTO tokens. Through this initiative, early adopters have already farmed over 2 million $CUTO. Want to join? Head over to the official website to learn more!

Stage 4 of the $CUTO presale is 74% complete and more than $1.6 million has been raised so far, as thousands of investors are rushing to secure an allocation. $CUTO is priced at just $0.031, a perfect entry point for those who want to join the Cutoshi revolution and reap incredible benefits once $CUTO is unleashed on the market.
