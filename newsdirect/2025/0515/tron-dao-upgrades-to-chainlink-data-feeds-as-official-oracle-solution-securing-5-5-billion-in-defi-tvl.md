Geneva, Switzerland, May 15, 2025 – TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), has adopted Chainlink Data Feeds as the official data oracle solution for the TRON ecosystem. This upgrade follows TRON DAO joining the Chainlink Scale program in October 2024.

The integration of Chainlink Data Feeds represents a strategic enhancement for TRON’s DeFi infrastructure, reinforcing security and reliability across the ecosystem. By adopting Chainlink as the official oracle solution, TRON DAO ensures that DeFi applications on the network benefit from the Chainlink standard for verifiable data.

“We’re excited that the TRON community has upgraded to Chainlink Data Feeds as the official data oracle solution for the TRON network, following TRON DAO’s decision to join the Chainlink Scale program earlier last year to accelerate its ecosystem’s growth. With over $5.5 billion in DeFi TVL on TRON now secured by Chainlink oracles, this upgrade marks a major milestone in the TRON DAO community’s commitment to leveraging robust and scalable DeFi infrastructure,” said Thodoris Karakostas, Head of Blockchain Partnerships at Chainlink Labs.

By leveraging Chainlink’s verifiable data infrastructure, TRON DAO continues to advance its mission of fostering a decentralized, transparent, and secure blockchain ecosystem. Developers and DeFi projects building on TRON can now utilize Chainlink’s trusted data solutions to create innovative and secure DeFi applications.

“By integrating Chainlink Data Feeds as the official oracle solution, TRON DAO is strengthening its DeFi ecosystem with a secure and reliable infrastructure,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO. “This transition empowers developers to build more scalable and resilient DeFi applications on TRON.”

As part of this transition, support and reliance on WINkLink as the oracle solution for TRON is discontinued. This move further strengthens TRON’s DeFi landscape where JustLend, the largest DeFi lending application on TRON, and others including the JustStable DeFi application and the USDD protocol will provide over $5.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), which will be secured by the Chainlink standard.
