# Demand for Drones Shows No Sign of Slowing: 4 UAV Stocks To Keep On Your Watchlist

Drones are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily lives thanks to their versatile nature. From agriculture and logistics to defense and data collection, drones are transforming not only how businesses operate but the broader society as well. In fact, governments are now adopting supportive regulations to ensure the safe integration of drones into civilian airspace. Meanwhile, public and private investments are increasing in drone-related technologies, setting the stage for massive growth among select UAV stocks. With recent research from Mordor Intelligence suggesting that the global drone market could surge to about $74 billion by 2030, here are four stocks that investors should consider adding to their watchlist:

ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) is a technology company specializing in AI drones, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS, and quantum computing solutions for mission-critical business applications.

The company recently announced that it had started expanding its United Arab Emirates (UAE) presence by establishing a new office to sell Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) offerings in Dubai. Initially the office will focus on delivering drone-powered cleaning services for building exteriors using the IQ Square drone tethered to a water pipe and electrical cord. This move opens up a new area of growth, considering the broader drone cleaning services market is projected to reach $13.2 billion by 2030.

Apart from that expansion, ZenaTech has been aggressively pursuing multiple revenue growth opportunities, which look set to begin paying off soon. For instance, its ZenaDrone subsidiary recently received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct commercial agricultural operations, opening it up to the global agriculture drone market, projected to be worth at least $23.78 billion by 2032.

Another potentially lucrative opportunity that ZenaTech is pursuing is environmental conservation with its drone-based early wildfire detection system. This new system has the potential to transform wildfire prevention using the ZenaDrone 1000 multifunction autonomous AI drone equipped with thermal imaging and LiDAR technology. The system has already received market validation as the company plans to start conducting onsite testing and evaluation with a prospective California business customer seeking to protect its 400-acre rural outdoor tourist attraction business from wildfires.

More importantly, ZenaTech plans to apply for the Blue UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) certification that lists and validates drones for military and government use, illustrating its commitment to improving its drone solutions. In the meantime, ZenaDrone is testing a new proprietary specialized camera that enables more efficient indoor applications, such as inventory and security management, when utilizing IQ Nano drone swarms for commercial and US defense applications. This could be crucial addition

Military and defense departments use small autonomous indoor drones like the 10X10 inch IQ Nano for various applications such as inventory management, indoor building reconnaissance, search and rescue, training simulations, and explosives detection.

AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE:UAVS) is a leading provider of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), sensors, and software solutions for customers worldwide in the commercial and government verticals.

The company recently released its FY2024 earnings, revealing revenues of $13.4 million as compared to $13.7 million during the year ended. However, gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 14.5%, to $6.3 million as compared to $5.5 million for the previous year. Total operating expenses decreased $25.7 million, or 57.6%, to $18.9 million as compared to $44.6 million for the prior year, driven by a $6.8 million reduction in operating expenses and impairment charges of $18.9 million.

During the period, UAVS received three of the largest product orders in its history, including a 49 UAS eBee Drone order for the French military, a 20 UAS Drone order for the United Arab Emirates security forces, and 60 RedEdge-P multispectral sensors for East Asia, which effectively positioned the company for long-term growth.

The company also strengthened its leadership structure with the appointment of globally recognized expert in aerospace, unmanned systems, and robotics, Grant Begley, as chairman of the board. Mr. Begley is a retired U.S. Navy Top Gun pilot and former Director of Tactical Aircraft, Missiles, and UAS.

Going forward UAVS believes that the combination of a leaner expense structure, record demand, and a growing product portfolio makes it well positioned to expand its customer base, secure new partnerships, and leverage its innovative drone technologies to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global UAS market.

Draganfly Inc. (NASDAQ:DPRO) develops cutting-edge drone solutions, software, and AI systems. Earlier this month, the company announced its first-quarter earnings, reporting a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.547 million, with gross profit also increasing 10.7% to $310,088 compared to the same period last year.

Among the key highlights of the quarter was the award of a waiver from the FAA under 14 CFR §§ 107.39 and 107.145, allowing Draganfly’s drones to operate over people and moving vehicles. This waiver enables the company to conduct flights beyond standard operational restrictions, facilitating advanced UAV operations in complex urban environments.

Draganfly has continued to reaffirm its position as a key player in UAVs with the signing of several partnership deals. For instance, the company recently announced a strategic teaming agreement with Autonome Labs, a humanitarian tech innovator, to develop an integrated aerial deployment solution for M.A.G.I.C. (Mine and Ground Inert Clearance), Autonome’s groundbreaking mesh-based demining system.

The collaboration will pair Draganfly’s Heavy Lift drone platform with Autonome’s M.A.G.I.C. system to safely and efficiently deploy demining mesh designed to detonate and neutralize landmines across hazardous terrain. This joint solution enables rapid clearance of explosive threats, significantly reducing risk to human demining teams and accelerating the restoration of safe, usable land.

In addition to that, Volatus Aerospace partnered with Draganfly to integrate Volatus' advanced bathymetric LiDAR technology with Draganfly's heavy-lift drone for a pilot project in oil and gas exploration.

Red Cat (NASDAQ:RCAT) is a drone technology company specializing in integrating robotic hardware and software for military, government, and commercial applications. It has developed a leading-edge family of systems, including the flagship Black Widow™, a small unmanned ISR system that was awarded the U.S. Army’s Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) Program of Record contract.

Red Cat has reiterated its FY2025 guidance of $80-120 million, driven by military contracts and strategic partnerships, including the recently announced partnership with Palantir Technologies. This collaboration will transform autonomous sUAS operations for modern warfare by utilizing Palantir’s advanced AI software running onboard the drone, which references up-to-date onboard satellite imagery to provide accurate navigation entirely independent of GPS or radio control signals.

Earlier this month, the company announced a significant testing milestone in their ongoing collaboration with Palladyne AI, a developer of artificial intelligence software for robotic platforms, after completing an autonomous, cross-platform collaborative flight involving three diverse heterogeneous drones.

During this most recent testing, Red Cat’s Teal 2 and Black Widow drones, along with the Palladyne™ Pilot AI software, operated each platform using onboard edge computing and constrained communication protocols without relying on centralized infrastructure for communication. The system enabled real-time, distributed detection and tracking of multiple dynamic and static ground objects—including humans and vehicles—in different regions of interest, providing a single operator with comprehensive situational awareness.

At the moment, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on the global defense drone supercycle against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions and increasing demand for unmanned systems. As a U.S.-based manufacturer and participant in the DoD’s Blue sUAS program, Red Cat should continue to benefit from U.S. legislative support for domestic drone production.
