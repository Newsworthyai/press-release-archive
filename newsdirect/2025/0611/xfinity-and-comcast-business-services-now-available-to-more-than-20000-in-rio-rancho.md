# XFINITY AND COMCAST BUSINESS SERVICES NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE THAN 20,000 IN RIO RANCHO

Comcast recently announced it has completed more than half of its expansion project in Rio Rancho, bringing its fast, secure and reliable fiber network to more than 20,000 homes and businesses. This includes Xfinity Internet with speeds faster than 1 Gig, Xfinity Mobile, and Comcast Business Internet and Mobile.

“We’re excited to see the progress being made on Comcast’s network expansion into Rio Rancho. This investment in Rio Rancho brings advancements that reflect our community’s growth,” said Greggory Hull, Mayor, City of Rio Rancho. “As the project continues, we look forward to seeing even more residents gain access to Comcast’s services, ultimately expanding network provider options for Rio Rancho citizens. Progress often comes with disruption, and while we haven’t been immune to challenges, we are thrilled to see Comcast crossing the halfway point of this project.”

When construction is complete, Rio Rancho residents will have access to Comcast’s Xfinity suite of products and services, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and managed home solutions. Local businesses also will have access to Comcast Business, which powers more small businesses in America and offers a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

“Comcast’s investment and continued expansion of broadband infrastructure is bringing fast, reliable internet to our businesses, entrepreneurs, and families. High-speed connectivity isn’t just about convenience as it has become the backbone of economic growth, attracting new industries, and strengthening our local economy,” said Jerry Schalow, President, Rio Rancho Regional Chamber of Commerce. “With this expansion, we’re not only creating opportunities for businesses but also ensuring our students have the tools they need to succeed.”

Comcast’s commitment to communities goes beyond network expansion and aims to increase economic mobility through programs that help bridge the digital divide like Internet Essentials, which offers low-cost high-speed Internet to eligible customers, and Lift Zones, which offer free Internet access for students and families to learn. Comcast is also investing in local nonprofit partners including Rio Rancho Public Schools, R4 Creating, ReadWest, Inc., along with economic development partners including the Rio Rancho Regional Chamber of Commerce and Sandoval Economic Alliance.

“We are incredibly grateful for Comcast’s generous support of our digital literacy programming. Their partnership and support enable us to continue expanding our initiatives, providing more adult students with access to educational resources,” said Cyndy Ratliff, Executive Director, ReadWest. “In addition, having a Comcast Lift Zone at our location offers a reliable space for students to connect and learn.”

As construction is completed, Comcast will notify residents and businesses about when they can sign up for service, or they can visit Xfinity.com/MyTown and enter their addresses for additional details on construction timing and service availability. Construction will continue throughout 2025 and is scheduled to be fully complete by 2026.

“We are proud to continue bringing our next-generation broadband network to Rio Rancho,” said Chris Dunkeson, Area Vice President, Comcast. “This expansion represents a significant investment in the community, providing residents and businesses with access to high-speed Internet that is essential for today’s digital world.”
