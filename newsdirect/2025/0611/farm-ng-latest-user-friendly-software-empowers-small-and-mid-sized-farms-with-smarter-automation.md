"Our goal has always been to empower farmers with equipment that is both powerful and affordable," said Brendan Dowdle, CEO of farm-ng. "These latest enhancements to the Amiga robotic platform are a direct response to feedback from our users, aiming to make advanced agricultural technology accessible for farms of all sizes."

The updated UI gives growers an intuitive dashboard to monitor robot health, switch between apps, and manage implements with ease, such as toggling sprayers on/off or setting tools to operate for specific durations. This design ensures that even those with minimal technical experience can effectively utilize the Amiga robot.

The new Job Manager lets users plan, save, and repeat complete tasks within defined paths and zones—enabling hands-free operations like seeding, weeding, or spraying with precision tool control. This streamlines repetitive work, saves time, and minimizes human error.

These updates are available over-the-air (OTA), ensuring that existing Amiga users can seamlessly upgrade their systems without the need for additional hardware or complex installations.
