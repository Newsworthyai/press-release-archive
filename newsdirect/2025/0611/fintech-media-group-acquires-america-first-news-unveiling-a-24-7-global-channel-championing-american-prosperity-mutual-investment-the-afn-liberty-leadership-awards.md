FINTECH Media Group, a global leader in finance and innovation media, today announced the acquisition of America First News (AFN). Relaunching as a 24/7 globally distributed news channel, AFN will deliver fact-driven reporting on how U.S. policies drive jobs, national security, and economic strength—while highlighting mutual investment and honoring excellence with the AFN Liberty & Leadership Awards.

AFN’s coverage will spotlight American factories and reshoring initiatives that support U.S. employment and reinforce critical global supply chains. Policy coverage will explore immigration enforcement, border security, tariffs, and technology sovereignty as strategic tools for worker and national protection. The new “Mutual Investment Spotlight” will showcase American companies investing abroad alongside foreign capital flowing into the U.S.—demonstrating how these dual streams elevate domestic prosperity and strengthen global partnerships.

Logging oversight and government accountability as priorities, AFN will conduct watchdog reporting on waste, fraud, and inefficiency in federal agencies. A dedicated investigative team will track the real-world progress of the Department of Government Oversight & Efficiency (DOGE), using GAO data, inspector general audits, and on-the-ground case studies to surface measurable outcomes and taxpayer impact.

“America First News is the unapologetic global voice for America’s economic leadership—championing innovation, protecting jobs and defense, enforcing smart trade and tech policies, and demanding accountability,” said Vince Molinari, Founder & CEO of FINTECH Media Group.

Evelio Silvera, Co‑Founder of AFN, added: “We’re about results, not rhetoric. AFN will document how informed policy delivers jobs, secure borders, tech resilience—and recognizes those making a difference at home and abroad.”

Josh Feuerstein, Co‑Founder & CEO of AFN, continued: “We’re bringing clarity back to news. Viewers will see measurable outcomes—from tariffs to investment and accountability to local impact—showing how policy fuels economic strength and public trust.”

As part of this initiative, AFN will introduce the AFN Liberty & Leadership Awards, a year-round recognition program celebrating individuals, organizations, and policy efforts that advance American economic interest and community resilience. Award categories include:

* Job Creation – honoring reshoring leaders and workforce growth
* Mutual Investment – celebrating capital flows that support U.S. jobs and global commerce
* Tech Sovereignty – spotlighting leadership in AI, semiconductors, and cybersecurity
* Border & Immigration Policy – recognizing principled enforcement that balances security with opportunity
* Government Accountability – awarding those exposing waste, fraud, and misuse of taxpayer funds
* Local Champions & Veteran Leadership – honoring veteran-led businesses and regional enterprises driving community revitalization

Nominees will be featured through in-depth programming, on-site segments, and live award presentations—bringing continuing community focus and showcasing those advancing American excellence.

AFN content, including award coverage and mutual investment insights, will be distributed across digital, television, mobile, podcast, newsletter, and streaming platforms. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AFN will expand into global bureaus to follow allied economies and investment centers.
