# Busy Summer? New Flexible Milk Pick-Ups &amp; Saturday Screenings Now Available

As families gear up for a summer full of memorable moments—travel, celebrations, and time together—Mothers’ Milk Bank California is making it easier for lactating parents to support medically fragile babies by donating breast milk. With free, flexible milk pick-up services and Saturday screening appointments, milk donation can fit seamlessly into even the busiest summer schedules.

Milk donations often dip during the summer months due to travel and scheduling conflicts, which is why these convenient options are more important than ever.

From June 21 through August 15, 2025, residents of San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Alameda Counties can schedule contactless milk pick-ups right from their homes — Monday through Friday — so donors can give without missing a beat in their summer plans.

For those interested in becoming donors but unable to complete screenings during regular business hours, Mothers' Milk Bank California now offers convenient Saturday Donor Screening Appointments, giving more families the opportunity to contribute on their own time.
