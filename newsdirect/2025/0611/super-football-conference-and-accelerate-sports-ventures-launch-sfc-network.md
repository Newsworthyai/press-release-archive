# Super Football Conference and Accelerate Sports Ventures Launch SFC Network

The Super Football Conference—the largest high school football conference in the country—in collaboration with Accelerate Sports Ventures, one of the leading NIL strategy, revenue generation and, innovation advisory firms for colleges and high schools, announced the launch of the SFC Network, the official streaming home for premier high school football starting in New Jersey.

Recognized as one of the top high school football conferences in the nation, The SFC Network will stream coverage of New Jersey’s top-tier programs including, Bergen Catholic, Delbarton, Paramus Catholic, St. Joseph Regional, Don Bosco, Seton Hall Prep, St. Peter’s Prep, Pope John, DePaul, and others.

“We know how important New Jersey high school football is in our communities and can’t wait for our student-athletes, coaches, parents, alumni, and fans to experience the SFC Network,” said SFC President Tom Mullahey.

In partnership with the new venture with the Super Football Conference, Accelerate Sports Ventures will strategically advise the league by creating the operational engine behind the streaming platform. This includes securing corporate partnerships and investing capital as well as executing strategic branding and marketing efforts for the platform. In addition, Accelerate will also work with technology and production partners to deliver the highest quality production and customer experience.

“Now is absolutely the perfect time to launch the SFC Network,” said Doug Fillis, CEO of Accelerate Sports Ventures. “With the evolution of NIL and college football programs on the verge of revenue sharing, we must deliver a high-quality production so student-athletes in the SFC can take advantage of these new opportunities. The SFC Network and the high-quality content will not only help athletes find opportunities with NIL and revenue-sharing at the next level but also help players begin building their personal brands.”

The SFC and Accelerate have partnered with Varsity Media, a leading high school sports production company based in Long Island to produce each game. Hudl, the industry leader in sports technology, will act as the technology backbone of the platform for subscribers to watch on SuperFootballConferenceNetwork.com.

“The game production that Varsity Media will deliver for SFC athletes will be outstanding. They bring a first-class reputation from the work they’ve done in Long Island and beyond,” the conference said. “Each game will feature professional announcers, multiple camera operators, a scoreboard, graphics, and a sideline reporter.”

Fans who subscribe to the network will receive access to a minimum of 40 games this fall, available both live and on-demand. Additional shoulder programming will be announced at a later date. Season passes are available now with promo code SFC for $79 at SuperFootballConferenceNetwork.com.
