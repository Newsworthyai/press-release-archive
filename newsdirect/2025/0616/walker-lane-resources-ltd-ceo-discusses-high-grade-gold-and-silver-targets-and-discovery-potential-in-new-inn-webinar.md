# Walker Lane Resources Ltd. CEO Discusses High-Grade Gold and Silver Targets and Discovery Potential in New INN Webinar

The Investing News Network (INN) has released a new webinar recording featuring Kevin Brewer, President and CEO of Walker Lane Resources (TSXV: WLR), in an in-depth conversation about the company’s diversified portfolio of gold and silver exploration projects across North America.

In the 45-minute session, Brewer outlines Walker Lane’s multi-asset strategy, including drill-ready projects in Nevada and British Columbia, and its plan to generate shareholder value through project discovery, development partnerships and targeted asset sales. The presentation also covers recent deals, including a $6 million option agreement with Coeur Mining for the Silver Knife project and a royalty-generating sale of a gold mill in California.

“Our goal is clear—develop high-grade gold and silver projects in proven jurisdictions and realize value at the optimal point in the discovery curve,” said Brewer. “We’re operating with a tight share structure, a highly experienced board, and a deep pipeline of exploration-ready assets.”

The discussion includes highlights of key properties such as:

1. Tule Canyon (Nevada): A high-grade gold and silver project with multiple historical mines and strong geophysical targets, scheduled for drilling in Q3/Q4 2025.
2. Amy (British Columbia): A CRD-style critical minerals target adjacent to Coeur’s Silver Tip Mine, with historical development and high-grade mineralization at surface.
3. Cambridge and Silver Mountain (Nevada): Early-stage prospects with visible gold, trenching results, and strong geological signatures.
4. Silver Heart and Logjam (Canada): Former flagship assets now being positioned for selective development using ore sorting and small-scale production strategies.

Brewer also provides insight into the company’s disciplined financial approach, noting that Walker Lane operates with one of the lowest G&A cost structures in the sector and leverages a virtual, contractor-based model to maximize exploration efficiency.

The webinar includes a Q&A segment covering:

1. Optimal timing for project monetization
2. Capital allocation strategies
3. Upcoming drill programs and permitting status
4. Comparative advantages of operating in Nevada and British Columbia
