# Bila Solar’s Indiana Factory Commences Production of Domestic Solar Panels, Strengthening U.S. Clean Energy Manufacturing at Key Policy Moment

Bila Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer, has begun producing its new line of domestic content solar modules at its Indianapolis factory.

This milestone marks Bila Solar’s entry into full-scale U.S. manufacturing, using American-made solar cells to build a reliable domestic supply chain for high-efficiency panels. The facility is Central Indiana’s first and soon-to-be largest solar panel factory — advancing efforts to reshore clean energy manufacturing.

“This is a pivotal moment not just for Bila Solar, but for the entire U.S. clean energy industry,” said Mick McDaniel, Vice President and General Manager of Bila Solar. “Our Indianapolis facility proves the power of smart, forward-looking policies that bring manufacturing back home. We’re proud to contribute to strengthening our domestic supply chain, creating good-paying jobs and advancing American energy independence.”

Bila Solar’s Indianapolis facility marks a critical milestone in reshoring clean energy manufacturing, establishing a reliable supply chain for high-efficiency panels. By driving local economic growth and providing developers with trusted, high-quality domestic content, this facility highlights the impact of policies that support U.S. clean energy growth, despite ongoing political challenges.

Get an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the first domestic content solar panels coming off the production line at Bila Solar’s Indiana facility. This video highlights the first panels produced, showcasing the start of U.S domestic-content solar module manufacturing in Indianapolis and the facility’s commitment to advancing clean energy in the Midwest.

Bila Solar’s 157,000 square-foot facility, retrofitted from a former Eli Lilly building, is now producing both our patented ultra-lightweight solar modules and newly launched 550W dual-glass conventional panels. The new product line uses U.S.-made solar cells and qualifies for the 10% domestic content bonus under the current federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a key policy designed to accelerate American manufacturing and clean energy deployment. This added value benefits developers and EPCs.

The factory is expected to create more than 75 advanced manufacturing jobs this year, helping develop critical clean-tech workforce skills and boosting the region’s economy.

Production began last week, with initial output focused on ground-mount fixed-tilt and carport applications. Bila Solar aims to reach 300 megawatts (MW) of annual capacity in Phase 1, scaling up to 1 gigawatt (GW) at full buildout.

A second video features interviews with Bila Solar’s leadership, including Indiana natives General Manager Mick McDaniel, Plant Manager Mike Vastag and Production Manager Kenny Stead. In this video, they share insights on workforce development, the rapid retrofit and launch of the Indianapolis factory, while highlighting Bila's efforts to strengthen U.S. supply chains and reshoring initiatives.

This announcement comes at a pivotal moment, as demand for U.S.-manufactured solar components continues to surge. Developers are increasingly focused on unlocking federal incentives, strengthening domestic supply chains and reducing reliance on imported technologies. While there are challenges facing the industry, including shifting federal policies and tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, the U.S. solar sector remains resilient.

According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2025 report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the industry added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in the first quarter of 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity in U.S. history.

“Proposed legislation in Congress could upend a thriving U.S. solar industry, which is reviving American manufacturing, lowering electricity costs, and generating hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars of investments, primarily in states that voted for President Trump,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Bila Solar’s investment in Indiana is proof of what is possible when we maintain the right policies that boost domestic manufacturing. Washington must make the right decisions now to ensure we can continue to lead the world in solar manufacturing and innovation.”
