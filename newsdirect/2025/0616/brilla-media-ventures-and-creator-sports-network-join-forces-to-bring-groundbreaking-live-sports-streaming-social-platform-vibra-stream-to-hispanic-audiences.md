Brilla Media Ventures (BMV) and Creator Sports Network (CSN) announced a groundbreaking partnership today that will provide brands with live, licensed creator-casts of sporting events for the U.S. Hispanic Market called Vibra Stream. With Vibra Stream, brands are now immediately, effectively, and measurably able to engage Latino audiences at scale to millions with their promotional videos and messages.

“Creator-led livestream casts represent an incredible new frontier for brands to engage Latino consumers at scale, with an innovative, turnkey solution that is just what many brands need to stand out and truly connect with fans,” said Alex Hernandez, Chief Revenue Officer of BMV. (Excellent case studies are available for brands who want to inquire about Vibra Stream’s successes).

Vibra Stream combines CSN’s extensive network of creators, sports licenses, production capabilities, and content relationships with BMV’s media, adtech, sales, and content expertise to deliver premium live sports, led by Liga MX Soccer games, for brands across a variety of live streaming platforms.

As part of their collaboration, and in the lead-up to the World Cup in the U.S., BMV and CSN are producing social live-streamed events designed to engage U.S. Hispanic audiences ranging from the premier Mexican soccer league, Liga MX, to European league soccer matches and International matches, MMA events, pop culture events, and more.

Leveraging this new content consumption trend this strategic relationship will create opportunities for the next generation of sports commentators while giving brands a more profound connection to deeply engaged fanbases across both the creator and respective sports properties.

Vibra Stream events are streamed live via creators’ channels, including Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Kick. BMV is further enhancing opportunities for brands by offering extended media inventory and content opportunities before and after the events, driving maximum value for brand partners.
