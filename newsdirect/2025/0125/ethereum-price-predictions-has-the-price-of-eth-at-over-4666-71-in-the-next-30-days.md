The Ethereum price faced significant corrections after the recent rally, during which demand dropped and uncertainty increased. However, the recent price action suggests the correction may be complete, and Ethreum could be entering a new trend with an increased bullish sentiment.

Meanwhile, a new popular ERC-20 token is also expected to be significantly boosted since this changing sentiment will provide a positive environment for faster growth.

Ethereum Starts Recovering: Potential For Another Surge?Ethereum had a massive rally in November 2024. After months of consolidation in a symmetrical triangle pattern, the price broke out of the upper trendline and surged over 70% within a month. Due to this enormous move, the Ethereum price rose to its 52-week High of $4,090, but demand dropped, and despite the momentum, it faced rejection at this level.

The price dropped to the $3,501 support level, from where it reversed but again got rejected from the $4,090 resistance level and started to decline, thus forming a double-top chart pattern. Ethereum corrected to the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), after which the price consolidated below the vertex of the double-top near $3,500 for two weeks.

However, demand for Ethereum increased last Friday, and the price moved above this resistance level. Due to this recovery, the price moved above the short-term 10-day and 20-day EMAs, and Ethereum now trades at $3,302.62

The demand is rising fast, as indicated by the MACD oscillator. As the correction is over, Ethereum is well-positioned for another rally, potentially taking the price above the 52-week High to the next significant resistance at $4,666.

Cutoshi (CUTO): Luckiest Meme Coin On The Ethereum BlockchainCutoshi is dubbed the luckiest meme coin since it takes inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat. In Asian countries, it is a tradition to keep a lucky cat figurine inside homes due to Chinese and Japanese folklore that says it has the power to bless its owners with good fortune.

The project aims to bring good luck and prosperity to everyone. Thus, it has transformed the cat into its native token, bringing it to the blockchain and making its lucky powers accessible to all.

To accomplish this goal, Cutoshi promotes the mass adoption of DeFi and blockchain technology. So, it has incorporated a learning academy into the ecosystem that helps reduce the knowledge gap and demolish entry barriers.

The Cutoshi Academy provides learning materials and modules that help newcomers learn complex concepts in an easily understandable format and quickly adapt to decentralization. Thus, newcomers can learn to use DeFi features and transition smoothly.
