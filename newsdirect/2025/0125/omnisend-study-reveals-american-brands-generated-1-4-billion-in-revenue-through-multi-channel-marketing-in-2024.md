# Omnisend Study Reveals American Brands Generated $1.4 Billion In Revenue Through Multi-Channel Marketing In 2024

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Omnisend, a leading ecommerce marketing platform, has released its annual ecommerce marketing study, revealing how American brands used a combination of email, SMS, and push notifications to achieve significant revenue growth in 2024. The study, analyzing over 11 billion messages, highlights the increasing importance of first-party data and automated marketing strategies.

The findings demonstrate a marked shift toward mobile messaging as an essential tool for ecommerce brands. SMS and push notifications are proving to be powerful channels for engaging customers and driving sales, particularly when combined with a robust email strategy.

Key Findings from the Omnisend 2024 Ecommerce Marketing Study:

* $1.4 Billion Revenue Milestone: American brands collectively generated $1.4 billion in revenue from 8.5 million sales, achieving an average order value (AOV) of $165.
* Surge in SMS and Push Notifications: Brands increased their use of SMS and push notifications significantly, sending 2.5 times more push messages and 43% more SMS than the year before, leading to a 68% overall adoption growth.
* Automated Messages Drive Conversions: Automated messages are performing exceptionally well, with a one-in-three conversion rate for users clicking on these messages, significantly higher than the one-in-17 conversion rate for scheduled messages.
* Automation Drives Revenue: Automated emails drove 29% of all sales despite representing only 1.5% of email volume, with similar positive trends observed for SMS and push notifications.
* Health and Games Lead Conversion Rates: The Health and Games industries showed the highest email click-to-conversion rates in the U.S. at 13.44% and 12.43%, respectively.

This report reinforces the importance of brands taking control of their customer communications through first-party channels, says Greg Zakowicz, Sr. Ecommerce Expert at Omnisend. The combination of email, SMS, and push notifications, when strategically automated and personalized, provides a predictable path for growing revenue and customer engagement.

The data underscores the effectiveness of using automated messaging triggered by user behaviors. This includes back-in-stock alerts, abandoned cart reminders, and welcome messages, all of which show a high degree of engagement and conversion.

Omnisend recommends the following key strategies for brands looking to improve their marketing efforts:

* Implement Behavior-Triggered Messaging: Use data to identify customer behavior patterns and send automated messages at key moments.
* Adopt a Multi-Channel Approach: Combine email, SMS, and push notifications for a more complete and engaging customer experience.
* Incorporate Social Proof and Scarcity: Add elements such as customer reviews, back-in-stock alerts, and low-stock notices to drive purchasing decisions.
* Analyze and Refine Regularly: Track metrics like open rates, click rates, and conversion rates to optimize your marketing strategies.

Brands that understand and utilize the power of first-party data and automated, multi-channel campaigns will be positioned for considerable growth in the year ahead, adds Zakowicz.
