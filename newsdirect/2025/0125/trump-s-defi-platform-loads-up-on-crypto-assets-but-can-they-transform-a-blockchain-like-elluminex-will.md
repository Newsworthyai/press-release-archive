![](https://public.newsdirect.com/235133499/9Q5OnpxI.jpg)

The new crypto project backed by the Trump family, World Liberty Financial, has recently added multiple altcoins to its treasury, including Ethereum (ETH), AAVE, stablecoins, etc. It aims to strengthen USD’s status in the DeFi sector by offering crypto borrowing and lending services.

Meanwhile, Elluminex (ELX), dubbed the next DeFi leader, is developing the first DeFi hub on the TON blockchain to revolutionize and seize the global DeFi market. Let’s analyze Ethereum, AAVE, and Elluminex to determine which altcoin has the best growth potential in the changing crypto landscape.

Ethereum (ETH) Drops Below The 100-Day SMAIn November 2024, the Ethereum price broke out of the upper trendline of a triangular pattern and surged over 70% within a month. The momentum slowly faded during the rally, and when Ethereum reached the $4,090 price level, it faced considerable bearish pressure. Due to this, the price dropped over 20% from this resistance and took support at $3,220.

Ethereum has traded sideways for over a month, facing rejection from the $3,746 price. The price has declined over 3% in the last 24 hours, and Ethereum is trading at $3,214.63. It trades below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and today has also moved below the 100-day SMA.

The Ethereum price has dropped below the $3,232 support level. If it continues to decline, the next significant support level will be $3,120, while if Ethereum surges from here, the immediate resistance level will be $3,461.

AAVE: Range-Bound Price Action Due To Low DemandAfter over two years of rejection, AAVE moved above the $136 resistance level on 9 September 2024 and consolidated below $166 for over two months. During the November rally, AAVE gained demand and reached the $389 price level due to immense buying pressure as the price surged by over 200% in just over a month.

AAVE lost demand at this level, and the price reversed when it encountered bearish pressure. For over a month, it has consolidated in the $273-$289 range below this resistance, and, at press time, AAVE trades at $332.11 after a 7.3% intraday decline.

Due to the falling price, the bearish sentiment is increasing, as indicated by the MACD oscillator, which has started to drop. Since AAVE has been in consolidation, the RSI has also dropped to 52. However, the price has corrected significantly, and if AAVE regains demand and breaks above the resistance, it can continue the previous uptrend.

Elluminex (ELX): Shaping The Future Of DeFiTON, the rapidly expanding blockchain network thriving with over 950 million active users and over 1 billion recorded transactions, has remarkable potential for expansion in the DeFi sector since DeFi on TON is in the early stages.

Thus, Elluminex aims to tap this potential and create an all-encompassing DeFi hub leveraging TON’s unmatched transaction speeds, highly scalable architecture, and infinite sharding capabilities to solve issues related to liquidity, security, and high transaction costs.

The Elluminex ecosystem will provide users with all essential DeFi functionalities, enabling them to trade, stake, farm, bridge, and track portfolios under a single platform. At the core of the ecosystem, the Elluminex DEX will allow users to trade their assets directly from their TON wallets and facilitate asset transfers across blockchains with an integrated cross-chain bridge.

Moreover, Elluminex will provide advanced features such as LP trading and limit orders for experienced traders. Traders will also have access to an AI-powered portfolio tracker, which will provide real-time data and on-chain analytics to optimize their investment portfolio. Still, the application’s interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly so newcomers can use it without difficulty.

Furthermore, Elluminex allows traders to grow their portfolios with the project by participating in its native token, ELX, ’s presale. The ELX token is priced at $0.06 in stage one of the presale and will surge to $0.08 in the second stage, providing a quick 33% return on investment. The token’s value will keep increasing similarly throughout the presale, so early buyers can make tremendous gains.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
