Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a leader in traumatic brain injury and stroke rehabilitation services, has launched the company’s first advertising campaign in its 45-year history. The initial campaign, “Rethink Rehab,” is aimed at medical decision-makers, prospective patients and their families and will roll out across video digital platforms, social media and out-of-home advertising, bringing a fresh and engaging message to consumers.

Designed to raise awareness of the CNS brand, its services and its impact, the campaign features dramatic, dark visuals that end on an inspiring note of hope for all that are recovering from brain injury or stroke. The campaign’s theme, “Rethink Rehab,” captures the essence of CNS’ mission to reduce disability and maximize independence, reinforcing its commitment to achieve the maximum quality of life for patients through brain injury rehabilitation.

"With 'Rethink Rehab,' we’re redefining how we connect with our audience,” said Ben Ashley, Associate Vice President Marketing and Communications for CNS. "Through this multichannel campaign, we aim to raise awareness of the CNS brand, our services, and our impact within both professional and cultural contexts. We recognize that our audience is diverse and that our influence extends to medical decisions, countless patients and their families. Our ultimate goal is to increase access to our care by spreading knowledge about CNS, even before it is needed. This campaign embodies our brand’s passion for neurorehabilitation and brings it to life in an authentic, compelling way.”

CNS employs a unique and individualized treatment approach that is transforming the understanding of effective neurorehabilitation programs for individuals recovering from brain injury and stroke. The creative agency behind the campaign is Moon Rabbit, an independent advertising agency with offices in New York, California and London. Their clients range from boutique to blue-chip and from consumer to biotech.

CNS’ partnership with Moon Rabbit has enabled them to highlight this impact through a 30-second spot. The video begins with an inspiring journey of a mother as she perseveres through her brain injury recovery. It concludes on a positive note as she successfully regains control of her daily tasks and family life. Throughout her journey, our experienced and compassionate staff are there to guide her every step of the way.

“‘Neurorehabilitation’ is a word only learned after a life gets fundamentally shaken. And yet, too often, the conversation in this space can feel detached & mechanical,” said John Tenaglia, Managing Partner, Client Services at Moon Rabbit. “Just as CNS brings humanity to their process, we aim to bring humanity to the conversation around what rehabilitation & recovery really look like.”

This short film is just one component of our exciting new multichannel advertising campaign with Moon Rabbit, which includes digital banners, out-of-home promotions, social media placements, radio spots, and published advertorials.

Key highlights of the campaign include:

* Multi-Platform Reach – The campaign will launch across social media, digital streaming, and radio and unique activations.
* Engaging Storytelling – The video begins with an inspiring journey of a mother as she perseveres through her brain injury recovery. It concludes on a positive note as she successfully regains control of her daily tasks and family life. Throughout her journey, our experienced and compassionate staff are there to guide her every step of the way.

The campaign officially debuted on February 1, 2025. Consumers can follow the conversation using #[RethinkRehab] and view campaign content at www.neuroskills.com, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or YouTube.
