As Dogecoin continues to lose its popularity, Solana’s Bonk also continues to see a low fall since its token burn on December 26, 2024. With two major meme crypto coins losing their value, traders are turning their heads towards an upcoming meme-utility project, Cutoshi (CUTO), which is already making noise during its presale period.

Dogecoin Losing FollowersAs the total supply of Dogecoin currently amounts to 148.16 Billion, showing an increase of 2.3%%, the number of token holders also sees an increase of 7.5%, amounting to 7.05 Million. Though holders are showing interest in Dogecoin, the coin has shown a dip of over 9.39% in the past week.

Early February brought doubts amongst traders as 750 Million Dogecoins were sold in the market. Besides, the biggest cheerleader of Dogecoin, Elon Musk, has not made any recent announcement supporting the coin, which has further led to a decrease in the coin’s potential. To top it off, SEC has not yet acknowledged Grayscale’s filing of Dogecoin ETF, which is raising speculations in the market.

Standing at $0.24313 at the time of writing, Dogecoin is showing a dip of 2.31% in the past 24 hours, with a decline of 45.42% in the 24-hour volume trade. As the price is hovering around the middle Bollinger band, Dogecoin is showing low volatility. Besides, MACD and RSI support a bearish trend, with the MACD line being below the signal line, whereas RSI stands strong at 44.85. The chances of Dogecoin falling below the red line seem to be higher.

Solana BONK Igniting Hope Amongst InvestorsThe trading volume of BONK continues to fall from 3.18 Billion to 60.15 Million, a clear dip of 98.1%. On the other hand, the NFT trade count is showing a decline of 90.1%, and whale stablecoin holdings are falling to 88.7%.

Though Solana Bonk had burned around $51 Million worth tokens, expecting a major price surge, the surge didn’t happen, leading to the fall of Bonk. Moreover, SOL’s monthly downfall of 35.09% is also affecting Bonk’s overall performance.

Solana Bonk stands at $0.00001587 at the time of writing, showing a decline of 3.79% in the past 24 hours, along with a fall of 22.89% in the 24-hour trading volume. It is clearly visible that Solana Bonk is going through a consolidation phase as the price is wavering around the middle Bollinger band. Besides, MACD is neutral, indicating that the chances of Solana Bonk having a good breakout is possible. Though RSI is at 47.64, the chances of the token having a breakout above $0.00001642 seems possible.

Cutoshi Garnering High Presale TractionWhile Dogecoin continues to lose popularity and Solana’s Bonk remains in consolidation, Cutoshi is garnering high traction during its presale phase. Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto, Cutoshi is a project that focuses on bringing the core concept of DeFi to users. An upcoming meme-utility project, Cutoshi is already gaining attention due to its unique features, and reward structure.

Even though Cutoshi has a limited supply of 440 Million tokens, it has an in-built scarcity model that induces token burning mechanism to decrease the overall supply. Moreover, it has already allocated 55% of its supply for presale, whereas the remaining is divided into farming, marketing and other categories.

Currently, Cutoshi is in the fifth stage of its presale period, valued at $0.0487. As early adopters continue to buy more Cutoshi, they are also getting benefits of the project’s token farming mechanism, which provides huge incentives for major liquidity providers. Besides, Cutoshi is already planning on launching engaging games and missions to encourage user engagement in the platform. To make it more interesting, winners will be rewarded with exciting surprises from the Lucky Cat Shrine, and even have a chance of getting their hands on the limited edition NFTs.

As Cutoshi proceeds with the presale, it is also taking the early adopters along with it. The referral program of Cutoshi allows users to gain a 20% bonus on each successful referral, giving them a chance to earn more CUTO before the project’s official launch. Moreover, traders think of Cutoshi as a highly potential project due to its upcoming DEX and swapping platform that intends to support over 20 blockchains and over thousand tokens, enabling easy swapping for users, with a low transaction fee of 0.25%.

Final WordsThough Dogecoin and Solana’s Bonk continue to fall, there are still chances of a trend reversal, which clearly shows the volatile nature of the crypto market. On the other hand, Cutoshi offers a safe space for traders to save their wealth. However, since it's still a presale project, it is better to conduct a thorough analysis before making any decision.
