# BridgeFT and ShellBlack Partner to Provide Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator Accelerator for Salesforce Financial Services Cloud

BridgeFT, a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company that enables enterprise wealth management firms, registered investment advisors (RIAs), turnkey asset management platforms (TAMPs), and Fintech innovators to deliver better, data-driven outcomes for their clients, announced today their partnership with ShellBlack, a leading Salesforce consulting partner specializing in wealth management solutions. The two firms have partnered to launch a Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator Accelerator for Salesforce Financial Services Cloud (FSC) on the Salesforce AppExchange. Powered by enriched multi-custodial data via BridgeFT’s WealthTech API, this innovative solution addresses one of the wealth management industry's most pressing challenges: unified total wealth data integration across multiple investment platforms.

The Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator represents a significant advancement in wealth management technology, offering seamless integration with more than 900 direct feeds from major financial institutions, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity Institutional, Pershing Advisor Solutions and Interactive Brokers.

“For many RIAs and wealth management firms, Salesforce FSC has quickly become the engine that connects the enterprise. By partnering with ShellBlack on this innovative new App, we are making it easier for financial institutions to link critical client and investment account information, transactional data, and CRM data seamlessly,” said BridgeFT Chief Commercial Officer Dave Hagen. “We are thrilled to be partnering with the ShellBlack team on this initiative, and we are excited to add them to our growing list of BridgeFT Marketplace partners that are reshaping wealth management technology.”

Key features of the solution include:

* Automated synchronization of financial accounts, positions, balances, transactions, tax lots and more
* Household-level investment visibility
* Multi-tiered matching logic for accurate data integration
* Pre-configured reports and dashboards for enhanced business insights

Unlike traditional portfolio management system connectors, ShellBlack's solution offers benefits that are unique in the industry, including tax lot synchronization and multi-provider data integration capabilities from hundreds of financial data sources. This comprehensive approach enables wealth management firms to streamline operations, enhance client service, and make more informed investment decisions.

"Wealth management firms have long struggled with fragmented data systems and time-consuming reconciliation processes," said Shell Black, president of ShellBlack. "Our Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator eliminates these pain points by providing a single, comprehensive view of client investments directly within Salesforce FSC."

The Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator supports data feeds from a broad spectrum of financial institutions, including custodians, banks, insurance carriers, and retirement plan providers, making it one of the most versatile solutions in the market. The solution is simple to configure, customizable, and integrates natively with Salesforce analytics and business process automation.

BridgeFT and ShellBlack are unveiling a live demo of the Multi-Custodial Data Aggregator Accelerator during an upcoming webinar on Wednesday, March 26th at 2:00pm EST. Register for the webinar to see the accelerator in action.
