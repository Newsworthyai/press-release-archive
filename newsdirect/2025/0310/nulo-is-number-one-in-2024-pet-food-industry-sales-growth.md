# Nulo is Number One in 2024 Pet Food Industry Sales Growth

Nulo was the pet food business front runner in sales and unit volume growth in 2024, due in no small part to its unprecedented Fuel Incredible campaign investment during the summer Olympic games. Nulo’s team of eight top medal winning Olympic athlete endorsers who are all devoted, doting pet parents, captured the hearts and minds of consumers and retailers alike. A comprehensive flight of TV advertising, social media integration and retail marketing programs, plus the enormous global media event that fixated consumer attention, combined to lift Nulo performance ahead of all other brands in national retail distribution.

For the 52-wek period ending January 18, 2025, Nielsen sales and unit growth report card verified Nulo’s pet food brand sales leadership among the top 15 pet food brands distributed through national retail outlets. Nulo sales volume was up 2.1% to $261.8 mm and unit volume growth increased 13.4% to 40.3 mm (Nielsen report does not include e-commerce platforms, Chewy.com or Amazon). Only three brands out of the 15 listed in the report posted year over year sales increases. The other two positive performing businesses were Purina (up 0.4%) growth and Hill’s Science Diet (advancing 1.7%). Overall pet food category sales softness for the year makes Nulo’s gain all the more impressive in a challenging business environment.

“Nulo led pet food business growth during a demanding period because of our industry leading marketing investments in the Fuel Incredible campaign,” said Michael Landa, Nulo Founder and CEO. “The program features eight top world-renowned Olympic medal winners, including the legendary Simone Biles, who are all pet lovers, Nulo nutrition supporters and believers. Additionally, we’ve seen traction and incremental growth from our new product innovations including the launch of the new Cold Pressed pet food category, our shelf stable ‘fresh’ Gently Cooked Meals concept, and an innovative new line of functional treats and dental chews.”

Landa said that all eight athletes have signed multi-year contracts and now that the games are in the past, will have more time to devote to Nulo events, sponsorships and in-market projects. “We’re just getting started deploying these highly credible, trusted voices on behalf of Nulo’s performance nutrition story,” he said.

Nulo is currently focused on new recipes and packaging improvements to its core FreeStyle kibble portfolio. “Our five dry kibble brands represent the greatest volume business opportunities for our retailers,” reports Eric Emmenegger, head of Nulo retail and product marketing, “so we are making investments there to help build on our current business momentum.”
