# Courageous Conservatives PAC to Rep. Pat Curry Ahead of June 6 Hearing: You Can’t Sue Your Way Out of Accountability

The Courageous Conservatives Political Action Committee, dedicated to electing leaders who uphold the values of sovereignty, strength, and principled conservative governance, will argue against a baseless “SLAPP” lawsuit brought by Rep. Pat Curry in court this week. Courageous Conservatives PAC is confident the court will recognize Curry’s attempt to sue critics into silence for what it is: a politically motivated attempt to suppress free speech and silence grassroots conservatives.

“This lawsuit isn’t about the law. It’s about power.” said Chris Ekstrom, Chairman of Courageous Conservatives PAC, “Pat Curry is trying to use the courts to muzzle those who dare to hold him accountable and remind him of the promises he made to his constituents. That’s not justice—that’s political retribution.”

The Courageous Conservatives PAC has moved to dismiss the suit under the Texas Citizens Participation Act, citing its clear protections of free speech, the right to petition, and freedom of association. The communications in question—texts and Facebook posts—were fully independent and directed solely to the public, urging civic participation on an important issue: the election of the Texas House Speaker.

“Our message to Pat Curry’s district and specifically the voters who elected him was straightforward,” Ekstrom added. “’Call Representative Curry and demand he keep his word’. That’s not just legal political messaging; it is how the American Republic was intended to function.”

Curry’s lawyers filed a response to the motion last week.

“Despite two months to think about it, amazingly, Curry’s lawyers made no attempt to explain why any of their claims have legal merit,” said Jerad Najvar of Chalmers, Adams, Backer & Kaufman LLC. “Our motion explained, point by point, why the PAC’s speech was legal and complied with Texas law. Instead of defending the substance of his frivolous claims, Curry makes the desperate argument that speech on an issue of public concern by a conservative group is somehow ‘commercial speech’ because the PAC paid to distribute it—and therefore not subject to dismissal under the TCPA. Curry’s argument wholly ignores decades of speech law.”

“Rep. Curry’s lawsuit is meritless, and frankly, dangerous,” Ekstrom said. “It sets a chilling precedent if public officials can sue private citizens and organizations simply for encouraging civic engagement. We’re not backing down—and neither should any American who believes in the First Amendment.”

Courageous Conservatives PAC is also seeking attorney’s fees and sanctions in response to the frivolous and retaliatory suit.

“Our commitment to conservative values and political accountability will not be intimidated into silence,” said Ekstrom. “We will continue to defend the rights of the people to speak out and demand integrity from their elected officials—no matter who tries to stop us.”

The hearing is scheduled for Friday, June 6, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. The Court is located at 501 Washington Ave., Waco, TX 76701. Interviews with Chris Ekstrom will be available in advance of and following the hearing.
