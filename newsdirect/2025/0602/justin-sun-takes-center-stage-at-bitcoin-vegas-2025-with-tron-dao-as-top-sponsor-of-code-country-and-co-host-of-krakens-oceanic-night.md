Geneva, Switzerland, June 2, 2025 — TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), participated in Bitcoin 2025, which took place May 27-29 in Las Vegas.

TRON DAO kicked off the week as a top tier sponsor for Code + Country's America 250 VIP Reception on May 27 at AYU Dayclub. This exclusive VIP experience hosted key political figures and leading voices in Bitcoin, AI, energy and technology, creating unparalleled opportunities for high-impact networking. Over 800 guests were in attendance, positioning TRON at the center of conversations shaping America's technological future.

Highlighting day one of the conference, Justin Sun, Founder of TRON and Advisor of WBTC, participated in the high-profile panel "Building The Future Financial Products of America" on the Nakamoto Stage.

Hosted by Kevin Kelly (CEO, Kelly Intelligence), the panel explored how blockchain technology and digital assets are reshaping traditional financial products for investors and institutions in the United States.

“We are going to see a lot more products that blend blockchain with traditional finance,” said Sun, “Kraken’s plan to offer tokenized versions of U.S. stocks and ETFs is a perfect example. This kind of blockchain integration across finance feels inevitable.”

On May 28, Sun also made an appearance at the ‘Whales & Insiders: BTCFi and New Yield Opportunities’ event hosted by MetaEra for a keynote session titled “TRON as the Global Settlement Layer.” Sharing the stage with top minds to drive conversations to frontier Bitcoin DeFi innovations.
