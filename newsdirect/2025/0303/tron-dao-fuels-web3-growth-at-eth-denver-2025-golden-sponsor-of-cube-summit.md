Geneva, Switzerland , March 3 2025 – TRON DAO made its way to ETH Denver 2025, one of the most talked about blockchain conferences in the industry. While attending ETH Denver, TRON DAO came in as a Golden Sponsor for the highly anticipated CUBE Summit.

The CUBE Summit, led by BuidlerDAO —short for the Collaborative University Blockchain Ecosystem Summit—marked the first-ever collaboration among twelve distinguished university blockchain clubs, including Cambridge, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, NYU, Oxford, Princeton, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UPenn, and Yale. The CUBE summit aims to cultivate emerging talent and foster innovative projects, paving the way for the next generation of crypto leaders.

Elfarra was also a judge for CUBE Summit’s Pitch Sessions — a platform for innovative projects to be built, showcased and pitched. Elfarra also presented a TRON award for the most outstanding project pitched that evening. Accelerating groundbreaking ideas that have the potential to shape the future of decentralized finance and Web3 applications.

TRON DAO also co-hosted CUBE Talent Night alongside BuidlerDAO and Blockchain at Berkeley which was held on 28th February. The networking session started off with a short welcome speech from TRON DAO touching on the latest updates happening on TRON, DeFi, and the broader Web3 ecosystem.
