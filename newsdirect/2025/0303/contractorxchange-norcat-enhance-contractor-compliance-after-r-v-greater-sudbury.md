ContractorXchange, a leading prequalification and contractor management software by AuditSoft, and NORCAT, a world-class training and certification provider, today announced a partnership to provide an end-to-end solution for contractor risk management, addressing the evolving legal landscape highlighted by the City of Greater Sudbury case.

R. v. Greater Sudbury (City) affirmed that project owners have ‘Employer’ obligations under the Ontario Health and Safety Act (OHSA), even when contracting out work. This means they remain responsible for worker safety and cannot simply delegate that duty to contractors. The case underscores the importance of prequalification and due diligence in ensuring worker safety and mitigating liability risks.

"ContractorXchange responds to the growing need for relevant, reliable, data-driven solutions to manage contractor risks and ensure compliance,” said Ben Snyman, CEO of AuditSoft. “By providing a structured prequalification framework, ContractorXchange in partnership with NORCAT enables project owners and those engaged in construction activities to demonstrate due diligence in contractor selection and risk management. Together, we’re able to provide an end-to-end contractor compliance solution, covering individual worker qualifications and safety training at the individual and worksite level, to compliance verification and evaluations at a corporate level. This way, we are giving organizations complete confidence in their supply chains and helping them navigate increasingly complex regulatory requirements for contactor management.”

“By combining our expertise with ContractorXchange, we’re bolstering our offering to existing NORCAT customers with a comprehensive contractor compliance solution,” said Jason Bubba, Chief Operating Officer. “This partnership enables us to deliver a more effective and affordable alternative to traditional prequalification and contractor management solutions while ensuring the highest standards of health, safety, risk management, and regulatory compliance.”

Key benefits of the partnership:

Worksite-Level Risk Management: NORCAT's training and certification programs empower organizations to manage contractor compliance directly at the worksite. NORCAT ensures that every worker on-site has the appropriate qualifications and OHS training and provides comprehensive Site Access Control to ensure that only trained and authorized personnel enter job sites.

Corporate-Level Risk Management: ContractorXchange enhances corporate-level risk management by collecting and verifying critical contractor data. This includes due diligence on OHS Management Systems (OHSMS), financial stability, historical OHS compliance, and evaluations of contractor experience and sustainability. These capabilities enable organizations to hire with confidence, while proactive monitoring and alerts help to maintain compliance. Organizations also gain access to a broader network of prequalified contractors.

This partnership streamlines prequalification and contractor compliance, making it more accessible and cost-effective for organizations. By integrating industry-leading training, certification, and risk management capabilities, ContractorXchange and NORCAT stand to help businesses navigate evolving regulatory requirements with greater confidence and efficiency.
