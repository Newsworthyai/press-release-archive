# LOVER® Cosmetics Demo’s Simple Beauty in 5-Steps on NewBeauty’s TalkShopLive® Channel

LOVER® Cosmetics founder Ashley Maurin Rodden demos the makeup line’s 5-step, simple-beauty makeup regime and magnetic palettes on NewBeauty Magazine’s TalkShopLive channel Tuesday, March 4 at 6:00 p.m. eastern.

“After doing hundreds of makeovers, women kept repeating the same two complaints, ‘I don’t know how to do my makeup’, and ‘I don’t have time’. Our 5-step makeup regime and guide show women HOW to do their makeup and our 5-step palettes help women do their makeup fast,” said Rodden.

LOVER Cosmetics placed first runner-up in Sept. at MakeupIn’s New York Beauty Tank Competition for its best-selling 5-step palettes and makeup classes. The line also serves as the makeup provider for the New York City Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, producing more than 1300 makeup kits for dancers and cheerleaders nationwide.

The everyday woman can learn how to simplify her makeup routine, travel and touch ups from the safety of her own powder room on Tuesday. Paris-trained makeup artist Ashley Maurin Rodden is offering a quick, 5-step demo on TalkShopLive. Each palette also has a QR code on the bottom that takes women to a 5-step video.

Palettes range from the smokey palette, to a very wearable nude shimmer palette, and the line’s best-selling matte palette that caters to a more mature client.

“The four palettes are the colors that are most purchased and put together year after year in my studio. And, they are multifunctional! The taupe color in each is a double for a brow filler, the light shadow services as a highlighter. The wearer can actually use this one palette for a full face,” said Rodden. “Plus, the rectangular space can be used to store lashes, extra lipstick or foundation for a busy woman on the go or for travels.”

Each of the palettes are made in the USA, vegan, paraben free, gluten free, EU complaint and cruelty free.

The cosmetic line was started by Kansas City’s Ashley Maurin Rodden in 2006 and gained notoriety as the National Sponsor of Miss Teen USA. Rodden spent a summer interning at Chanel, Inc., in New York City and Rodden studied makeup artistry in Paris, France, at the renowned Christian Chauveau makeup school. The Kansas City-based studio services women nationwide, providing in-studio and virtual makeup lessons. The line serves as the makeup provider for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and Spirit of America Productions, plus dance and cheer teams nationwide.

Founded in 2006, LOVER® Cosmetics LLC, is a full color cosmetics line. From day one, the goal was to make makeup simple for women. In 2009 LOVER® was named the national sponsor of Miss Teen USA. After hundreds, perhaps thousands of makeovers, the brand relaunched LOVER® Cosmetics in response to women’s two most common makeup dilemmas: 1) “I don’t know how to do my makeup” and 2) “I don’t have time.” The answer: LOVER®’s magnetic palettes, 5-step makeup regime and their soft, natural approach to makeup help women look good and feel good every day. LOVER placed 1St runner up in the nation at the 2024 MakeupIn beauty tank competition in New York. The brand is also the makeup provider for the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade and Spirit of America, designing more than 1300 makeup kits for cheerleaders and dancers nationwide.
