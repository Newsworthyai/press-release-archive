# XYPN Marks Biggest Year for Growth in 2024

XY Planning Network (XYPN), the leading comprehensive support platform for independent, fee-only advisors, is experiencing record-breaking organic growth. Last year 456 advisors joined the network—the most since launching over a decade ago—pushing total membership beyond 2,000. This surge demonstrates an accelerating demand for fee-only fiduciary financial advice which remains far from being fully met.

This growth also reflects a broader shift in consumer preferences, particularly among younger generations who prioritize transparent, ethical financial planning free from product sales. Among the approximately 100,000 households served by XYPN members, many clients seek financial advice tailored to their life stage—often planning for milestone or lifestyle goals, building wealth, preparing for retirement, or managing transferred wealth. Increasingly, traditional asset management alone no longer meets the needs of today’s investors.

As more advisors choose to serve this evolving client base, they turn to XYPN for the autonomy, infrastructure, support, and community needed to run successful independent firms. XYPN empowers its members to serve their client’s best interests with transparency and integrity, ensuring they thrive in a rapidly shifting industry.

Among XYPN’s other successes in 2024, its compliance solution registered 267 new Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firms and updated nearly 1,000 ADVs. The company also launched Sapphire, its RIA affiliation model, which represents 19 member firms.

“Over the past year, we’ve focused on bringing all the elements together, providing comprehensive services geared to new advisors and established firms who desire a holistic offering while maintaining their independence,” said XYPN CEO Alan Moore. “With the fee-only fiduciary standard quickly becoming the preferred option, it’s more important than ever for advisors to have the control, flexibility, and support that XYPN offers so they can serve who they want how they want. We are pleased to see so many advisors joining XYPN and taking control of their firms and livelihoods. And they aren’t just surviving, they’re thriving. Our member firms average 18% client base growth, compared to the industry average of 6.2%."

Unlike many industry players reliant on mergers, acquisitions, or venture capital, XYPN’s record-breaking growth is entirely organic—driven by independent advisors choosing to build firms that align with their values and serve diverse client needs. XYPN members specialize in a wide range of niches, including military families, sandwich-generation caregivers, traveling nurses, the LGBTQ+ community, Chick-fil-A owners, tattoo artists, women in technology, ex-pats, and ESG investors, among many others.

“I’m so proud of the growth we’ve experienced across all metrics,” said XYPN President Vince Hockett. “Best of all, our expansion has been entirely organic—not through M&A or private equity funding. This proves that the demand for fee-only fiduciary advice—and the advisors committed to delivering it—is growing exponentially.”

XYPN members choose the platform because it allows them to run their practices on their own terms. They can pick and choose the support they need across technology and compliance without locking them into lengthy contracts. Members can leave at any time with 100% of their business, clients, data, and brand.

In 2025, XYPN will introduce several new features, including a continuity and succession program and various bundled options to help members at critical points in their business journey, such as at launch and when looking to scale their business.
