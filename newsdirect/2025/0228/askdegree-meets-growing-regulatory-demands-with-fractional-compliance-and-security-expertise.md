# AskDegree Meets Growing Regulatory Demands with Fractional Compliance and Security Expertise

AskDegree, LLC, a fractional compliance and security solutions company, is helping venture-backed startups and high-growth technology companies navigate complex regulatory requirements with on-demand access to senior-level compliance professionals. This enables startups to meet regulatory requirements like Financial Markets Consumer Protections, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR without the high costs associated with traditional, full-time hires.

Compliance has become a non-negotiable requirement for startups seeking to secure funding, land enterprise clients, and remain competitive. However, maintaining an internal compliance team can be financially prohibitive. Depending on the location, hiring a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) can cost companies over $250,000 annually, while assembling an entry-level three-person compliance department can significantly surpass $405,000 per year. On average, organizations across all industries worldwide spend 5.47 million on compliance costs.

AskDegree’s fractional model reduces compliance-related expenses, offering a cost-effective and premium talent solution for startups without the budget and resources for an in-house team.

“Startups today are under immense pressure to meet security and compliance standards quickly while staying lean,” said Alexandria Degree, the CEO and Founder of AskDegree. “Our fractional compliance teams enable these companies to get enterprise-level compliance expertise without the overhead and weight of full-time hiring, allowing them to focus critical early-stage resources on scaling their core business.”

AskDegree’s fractional compliance solutions provide:

* Faster compliance readiness, helping startups achieve certifications faster than traditional in-house methods.
* Significant cost savings, allowing early-stage companies to allocate resources toward growth initiatives.
* Scalable support, with compliance teams that adapt to evolving business needs.
* Improved deal velocity, as companies meet enterprise partner requirements more quickly.

AskDegree’s fractional teams provide a proactive solution that helps companies acquire strategic partnerships, navigate audits, manage security frameworks, attract compliance and security-cautious customers, and prepare for due diligence all while maintaining business momentum. By working closely with internal leadership, the company ensures compliance efforts are aligned with business goals rather than becoming a drain on operational resources. This has proven critical for companies wanting to enter regulated markets, pursue enterprise contracts, or prepare for acquisition.

“Compliance is more than a checkbox; it’s essential for growth and staying power – customers, strategic partners, and investors are now demanding to see compliance in function, and not simply in ritual,” Degree added. “We’re committed to making compliance accessible so startups can scale securely without sacrificing speed or agility.”

As regulatory scrutiny intensifies and the market demands greater accountability, startups are expected to implement robust security and compliance measures earlier in their growth stages. AskDegree is positioned to meet the growing need for agile compliance solutions in the startup ecosystem, enabling companies to meet these challenges and convert them into competitive advantages. The company’s track record includes helping startups secure strategic partners that open the door to millions of dollars in added revenue, attract investment deals for rapid expansion, and achieve compliance and security postures that strengthen investor and customer confidence.

AskDegree’s clients span various industries, including fintech, health tech, insurance, and B2B SaaS companies – sectors where compliance requirements are particularly stringent.
