Kraken, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, today announced the listing of APENFT (NFT), a key token in the TRON ecosystem. The listing introduces APENFT/USD and APENFT/EUR trading pairs. In addition to the listing on Kraken, a Reef Program airdrop campaign of $90,000 worth of APENFT tokens has been launched.

Launched by the APENFT Foundation in 2021, APENFT uses TRON’s fast and low-cost blockchain to bring top-tier artworks on-chain and support the growth of the NFT ecosystem. As of March 2025, with over $430 million in market cap and more than 2.16 million unique holders, APENFT has become a leading force in the digital collectibles space. APENFT is now listed on over 30 major global exchanges, including HTX, OKX, and Poloniex.

Since its launch, the project has reached several important milestones:

* May 2021: Initiated an NFT airdrop program for TRON mainnet token holders, reaching millions of TRX users.
* December 2021: Collaborated with Christie's and Sotheby's to tokenize masterpieces by Picasso and Andy Warhol.
* 2023: Debuted APENFT Marketplace, now becoming the leading NFT trading platform on the TRON chain supporting hundreds of emerging artists through the Art Dream Fund.
* September 2024: APENFT Collaborated with SunPump to launch NFT Pump, the first fair-launch NFT tool in the TRON ecosystem, allowing users to mint NFTs at low cost using TRX.
* Q1 2025: Released NFT Pump 2.0, introducing the TRC404 standard for fractionalized NFT trading to enhance liquidity and user experience.

The listing of APENFT (NFT) on Kraken marks a significant step in its global expansion, offering increased exposure and access to institutional and retail investors across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. With NFT/USD and NFT/EUR trading pairs now available, APENFT gains direct entry into key fiat markets.

The launch is further supported by a $90,000 airdrop through the Reef Program, designed to boost engagement and broaden its appeal beyond the TRON ecosystem. Known for its high compliance standards and strong security, Kraken provides an ideal platform for APENFT to strengthen its credibility and reach.

APENFT officially launched on Kraken on March 20, 2025, at 11:59 AM UTC, marking a significant milestone in its path toward global adoption and broader market accessibility.
