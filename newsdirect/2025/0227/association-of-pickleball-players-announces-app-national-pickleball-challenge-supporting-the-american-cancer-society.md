# ASSOCIATION OF PICKLEBALL PLAYERS ANNOUNCES 
APP NATIONAL PICKLEBALL CHALLENGE SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY

The Association of Pickleball Players (APP) and the American Cancer Society will join forces during National Pickleball Month this April to launch the APP National Pickleball Challenge, a nationwide initiative designed to support people facing cancer and build healthier communities.

The APP National Pickleball Challenge tasks participants to play pickleball ten times during the month and track their active minutes, competing for a spot atop the national leaderboard. Whether it’s playing a competitive match, enjoying a casual match with friends, cardio training, or bouncing a ball up and down on a paddle, any pickleball-related activity will count towards the challenge. Players can register and start fundraising today on JustGiving and will start tracking their pickleball activity on April 1 via the Stridekick mobile application or manually.

“We are excited to work with the American Cancer Society to continue to use pickleball for good,” said Shannon Dan, APP EVP of Strategy and Growth. “By participating in this challenge, you can play the sport you love, reduce your personal cancer risk by staying active, and support people facing cancer. It’s such a fun, easy way to make a difference!”

One hundred percent of the proceeds raised during the APP National Pickleball Challenge will directly benefit the American Cancer Society and their mission through funding cancer research discoveries, enhancing direct patient support in 20,000 communities across the country and through advocating for policies that enhance access to cancer care.

How It Works
