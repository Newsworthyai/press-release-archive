# Motel 6 To Open New 295-Room Property Near Las Vegas Strip

G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and Studio 6, announced the signing of a new Motel 6 property located just steps away from the iconic Las Vegas Strip. The 295-room hotel, anticipated to open in May 2025, is one of the largest properties in the company’s history.

The property is owned by S.R.E Enterprises LLC, a Los Angeles-based company. The hotel is family-friendly and just over a mile from the famous Las Vegas Strip, making it an ideal destination for both business and leisure travelers.

“This new addition to our portfolio, which is strategically located in one of the world’s most visited destinations, is an exciting milestone,” said Sonal Sinha, CEO - G6 Hospitality. “We are grateful to our franchise partners and S.R.E Enterprises LLC, for their collaboration and trust, and to the G6 team for their support in bringing this project to life.”

“We’re excited to be a part of this new era for G6 Hospitality,” said Shawn Evenhaim of S.R.E Enterprises LLC. “This partnership allows us to bring great service and affordable lodging to the heart of Las Vegas.”

The exterior-corridor property will undergo renovations and interior remodelling to provide guests modern and comfortable guestrooms, each equipped with flat-screen TVs and Wi-Fi. The hotel also boasts free parking, an outdoor pool, and private access to the OYO Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the city welcomed about 41.7 million visitors in 2024. December alone saw approximately 3.4 million tourists visiting the entertainment capital, highlighting the continued appeal of Las Vegas as a premier destination for travelers.

G6 Hospitality recently announced its plans to invest $10 million in marketing to accelerate customer adoption and enhance brand engagement. The company will use this investment to expand its website and My6 app. Additionally, G6 aims to increase app installs by four times before the summer season begins. The company will also implement advanced digital targeting strategies, focusing on high-intent customers through direct partnerships with leading digital platforms like Google and Microsoft.

Global travel tech company OYO acquired G6 Hospitality from Blackstone Real Estate. The company plans to accelerate G6 Hospitality's growth, targeting the addition of over 150 hotels in 2025 under the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands.

This expansion is expected to strengthen the brands' presence in key markets such as Texas, California, Georgia, Arizona while preserving their core values and distinct identity. G6 Hospitality recently announced a strategic partnership with HotelKey, a leading hospitality technology provider, to enhance the technological capabilities across its network of properties in the US and Canada.
