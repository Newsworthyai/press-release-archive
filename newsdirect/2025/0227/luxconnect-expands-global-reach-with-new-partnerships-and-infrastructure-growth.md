# LuxConnect Expands Global Reach with New Partnerships and Infrastructure Growth

LuxConnect, a leader in sustainable data center operation and fiber network solutions, is accelerating international expansion through strategic initiatives to strengthen digital sovereignty, enhance connectivity, and position the company as a key resource in the global data infrastructure market.

For nearly 20 years, LuxConnect has built a reputation as a trusted partner for organizations requiring secure, scalable, and sustainable digital infrastructure. Its latest milestones, including a long-term fiber agreement with LuxNetwork and a sovereign cloud partnership with the Luxembourg government through its subsidiary Clarence, reinforce the company’s commitment to expanding access to high-security, high-performance digital solutions that support the evolving needs of the digital world.

"Each infrastructure investment and partnership we make is guided by the goal of creating long-term benefits for our customers and supporting the country's economic growth," said Paul Konsbruck, CEO of LuxConnect. "By expanding data center capabilities and improving national connectivity, we’re that ensuring enterprises have access to infrastructure that is secure, sustainable, and built for the future."

As part of its ongoing investment in connectivity, LuxConnect’s 10-year Indefeasible Right of Use agreement with LuxNetwork adds nearly 250 miles to Luxembourg’s fiber network. This expansion strengthens cross-border connectivity with major European hubs including Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. Situated at the heart of Europe’s largest economies, Luxembourg is an increasingly vital Information and Communication Technology hub, offering businesses a fast, reliable, and highly secure gateway to the European market.

LuxConnect has also deployed, in joint venture with Proximus, a sovereign disconnected cloud platform that is designed to keep sensitive public and institutional data secure while simultaneously offering businesses a reliable model for regulatory compliance. The joint venture is hosted in LuxConnect’s Tier IV-certified data centers and will ensure full confidentiality, complete control, and unwavering sovereignty for government operations while setting a new benchmark for industries that require the highest levels of security and compliance, including finance, healthcare, and gaming.

"Businesses are facing rising security threats, evolving regulations, and growing demands for AI and cloud computing,” said Konsbruck. "These investments and strategic partnerships reflect our commitment to being infrastructure partners that deliver stability and long-term value that meets the demands of today and the needs of tomorrow.”

With these advancements, LuxConnect continues to position itself as a premier infrastructure partner for global enterprises, cloud providers, and organizations navigating the complexities of data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.
