# Standard Fleet Now An Approved Provider of Hardware-Free Telematics For Off-Trip Insurance

Standard Fleet, a developer of connected vehicle technology, is now an approved telematics provider of Tint, a leading embedded insurance platform, to simplify telematics management for Turo hosts. Use of Standard Fleet eliminates the need for external hardware, allowing hosts on Tint’s off-trip telematics plan increased flexibility and reduced maintenance, making it easier to manage their vehicles. Tint provides off-trip insurance, which covers vehicles when they are not actively on a trip. Standard Fleet’s software-based telematics allows hosts to link their vehicles directly to Tint, enabling automatic location data without extra equipment or manual reporting.

“Our goal is to give hosts flexible, easy-to-use tools that fit their workflow,” said David Hodge, Founder and CEO of Standard Fleet. “For those who prefer a fully digital experience, our integration makes it simple to connect a vehicle in just a few clicks. It’s a fast, reliable way to share location and mileage data; no extra equipment or manual reporting required.”

With this solution, Tint receives total vehicle mileage directly from Standard Fleet’s connected vehicle platform. Hosts can authorize their vehicles digitally through a quick and intuitive process; no additional equipment needed. This ensures accurate tracking with no extra effort, making it easier to stay compliant and keep costs low. On average, Tint customers using Standard Fleet’s integrated telematics option save 40% on their off-trip insurance. By seamlessly verifying activity, Standard Fleet eliminates manual reporting and provides Tint with the data it needs, without added complexity for hosts.

“Tint’s off-trip insurance offers specialized insurance at a price that makes sense,” said Chris Aragon, Head of Mobility at Tint. “Standard Fleet helps us make that process even smoother by removing the need for external tracking devices. By eliminating hardware costs and setup headaches, they’re giving hosts an easy, affordable way to access cost-effective coverage without jumping through hoops.”

Becoming an approved telematics provider marks a key step in Standard Fleet’s transition beyond its EV roots, expanding its connected vehicle technology to a broader range of use cases, from fleet management to individual vehicle owners.
