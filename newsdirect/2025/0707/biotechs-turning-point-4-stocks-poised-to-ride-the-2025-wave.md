# Biotech’s Turning Point: 4 Stocks Poised to Ride the 2025 Wave

Biotech is entering a new phase of growth in summer 2025, backed by scientific momentum, clinical progress, and a more favorable investment landscape. Following a challenging few years, the sector is rebounding as interest rates ease and investors return to innovative, high-conviction names with late-stage programs and differentiated platforms.

New technologies are accelerating timelines across the board. AI is helping to identify drug targets and biomarkers with greater precision. Machine learning tools are now being integrated into trial design, patient selection, and outcome prediction. These shifts are making biotech pipelines more efficient and capital deployment more strategic. On the clinical front, novel immunotherapies, gene-edited cell therapies, and targeted neurology treatments are generating meaningful results in areas where patients have limited options.

Major conferences in 2025 have highlighted this progress, with new data in oncology, rare disease, and CNS disorders drawing attention from both clinicians and capital markets. Meanwhile, biotech companies with strong cash positions are using this window to sharpen their pipelines, scale promising programs, and position for regulatory dialogue.

Now let’s look at some noteworthy players in this sector.

Medicus Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: MDCX) is quietly building one of the more diversified and forward-looking pipelines in small-cap biotech. With active programs in both human and veterinary medicine, the company is positioning itself to deliver near- and mid-term clinical milestones while targeting meaningful unmet needs in oncology and urology.

A key driver of recent momentum is the company’s acquisition of Antev Ltd., a UK-based biotech advancing Teverelix, a next-generation GnRH antagonist. The drug is being evaluated in two distinct but high-value indications. The first is for acute urinary retention (AUR) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, where recurrence rates are high and existing treatment options remain limited. A planned Phase 2b trial will enroll 390 patients in the United States and Europe. The second, and potentially more differentiated opportunity, is in hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk. If successful, Teverelix could become the first therapy labeled for this specific high-risk subgroup, with a projected market of up to 4 billion dollars annually in the United States alone.

On the veterinary side, Medicus is targeting an underserved corner of oncology with its doxorubicin-containing microneedle array (D-MNA), developed to treat squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in horses. The company recently submitted a product development plan to the FDA under the Minor Use in Major Species (MUMS) designation, which could provide seven years of market exclusivity if approved. With limited non-invasive treatments currently available, this program opens a potential 250 million dollar market opportunity.

Medicus is also making progress in human dermatologic oncology. Its D-MNA platform is currently in a Phase 2 clinical study for basal cell carcinoma, with an interim analysis suggesting greater than 60 percent clearance. The trial is being expanded from 60 to 90 patients and is adding additional clinical sites in Europe and the UAE, supported by encouraging safety and efficacy results from earlier Phase 1 data.

From a financial standpoint, Medicus recently completed a 7 million dollar public offering to support its dermatology pipeline and has laid the groundwork for additional expansion through acquisitions and regulatory filings.

With active clinical programs in multiple geographies, ongoing trial enrollment, and two near-term Phase 2b studies addressing large market opportunities, Medicus appears well positioned for continued progress. The company is executing on a clear development strategy while remaining opportunistic about pipeline expansion. Investors looking for exposure to a small-cap biotech with broad therapeutic reach and upcoming catalysts may want to keep a close eye on MDCX.

Actuate Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ACTU) is developing elraglusib, a novel GSK-3 beta inhibitor, for use in difficult-to-treat cancers. In June, the company announced positive topline data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating elraglusib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study met its primary endpoint, showing a median overall survival of 10.1 months versus 7.2 months in the control group. This translated to a 37 percent reduction in risk of death and a doubling of one-year survival from 22.3 percent to 44.1 percent.

These findings were featured in an oral presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting and discussed further at a dedicated Key Opinion Leader event. Clinicians involved in the trial emphasized the magnitude of the overall survival benefit, especially in a setting where progress has been limited. Importantly, the combination also demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with adverse events comparable to chemotherapy alone.

Supporting data from the trial showed improved response rates, longer progression-free survival, and a greater duration of response. In addition, tumor biopsies from patients treated with elraglusib showed increases in CD8-positive T cells, NK cells, and markers consistent with reduced immune suppression. These changes align with the drug’s proposed immune-modulating mechanism.

On June 20, Actuate presented additional biomarker data from the same trial using machine learning to analyze pre-treatment plasma samples. Researchers identified a set of immune-related biomarkers, including CXCL2 and TRAIL, that correlated with better outcomes in elraglusib-treated patients. The company believes this approach could eventually support patient selection in future trials.

Actuate was also added to both the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 indexes in late June, following the company’s IPO last year. CEO Daniel Schmitt called the inclusion “a significant milestone” and noted that it came shortly after the company’s strongest clinical data to date.

With elraglusib continuing to show promise and additional studies planned, Actuate may be worth watching as it moves closer to regulatory engagement in a historically hard-to-treat cancer setting.

Caribou Biosciences (Nasdaq: CRBU) is at the forefront of a transformative shift in cell therapy, developing allogeneic CAR-T treatments designed for broad access and rapid deployment. With its proprietary Cas12a chRDNA genome-editing technology, the company is engineering cell therapies that aim to match the safety, durability, and efficacy of autologous CAR-T approaches.

The company is focused on two lead clinical programs: CB-010 for large B cell lymphoma and CB-011 for multiple myeloma. Both are currently in Phase 1 and showing early signs of clinical potential. For CB-010, Caribou has initiated a 20-patient confirmatory cohort using its HLA matching strategy in second-line large B cell lymphoma. Results are expected in the second half of 2025 and will include at least six months of follow up for most patients. The company is also engaging with the FDA to initiate a potential pivotal trial based on those results.

Meanwhile, CB-011 has advanced through multiple dose levels in the CaMMouflage Phase 1 trial for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Caribou plans to disclose updated safety and efficacy data on a minimum of 25 patients using a deeper lymphodepletion regimen later this year. These results will inform dose expansion decisions and potential next steps toward registration.

To concentrate resources, Caribou recently streamlined its pipeline, discontinued noncore programs, and reduced its workforce by 32 percent. As of March 31, the company had $212.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Management expects this will fund operations into the second half of 2027.

Investors looking for exposure to a high-conviction, genome-editing play in the CAR-T space should keep Caribou firmly on their radar ahead of two major clinical readouts in the coming months.

Neumora Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: NMRA) is tackling the global brain disease crisis with a unique approach that could transform treatment for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The clinical-stage company advances seven programs targeting novel mechanisms in brain diseases that remain underserved by current therapies. This diverse pipeline reflects Neumora’s mission to redefine neuroscience drug development and improve patient outcomes.

Neumora’s lead programs include NMRA-511 for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease and navacaprant for major depressive disorder. The company is on track to report topline data from the Phase 1b study of NMRA-511 around the end of 2025. Meanwhile, the optimized KOASTAL-2 and KOASTAL-3 Phase 3 trials of navacaprant resumed enrollment in March 2025, with data expected in the first and second quarters of 2026. These clinical milestones position Neumora at the forefront of promising brain disease therapies.

The company’s financial strength adds confidence to its growth potential. Neumora secured a $125 million venture debt facility from K2 HealthVentures, providing flexible capital that extends its cash runway into 2027. As of March 31, 2025, Neumora held $249.4 million in cash and equivalents to support multiple ongoing clinical development programs.

“Our vision is to make a difference for people living with brain diseases,” said Paul L. Berns, chairman and chief executive officer. “With our diverse, industry-leading pipeline, multiple upcoming clinical catalysts, experienced team, and strong financial foundation, we are making important progress towards achieving that goal.”

Neumora’s forward-looking pipeline, upcoming data readouts, and solid financial footing make it a compelling opportunity in the rapidly evolving biotech sector focused on brain health. As the global brain disease crisis demands innovative solutions, Neumora is positioned to deliver next-generation therapies that could reshape patient care.
