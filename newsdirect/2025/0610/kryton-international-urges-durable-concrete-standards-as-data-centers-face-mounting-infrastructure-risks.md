# Kryton International Urges Durable Concrete Standards as Data Centers Face Mounting Infrastructure Risks

As the demand for high-performance data centers surges around the world, Kryton International, the global leader in waterproofing and durability solutions for concrete, is calling attention to a growing threat to uptime and asset longevity: concrete degradation.

With operators increasingly adopting robotics and automation within their facilities, the need for ultra-durable, waterproof concrete is no longer optional — it’s critical.

According to Forbes, the average cost of a data center outage has soared to over $9,000 per minute, with some incidents exceeding $1 million per hour. Seemingly minor infrastructure failures — such as a hairline crack in a concrete slab that leads to water ingress — can escalate rapidly, damaging sensitive servers and power infrastructure. Even small leaks that do not fully penetrate can corrode the internal steel rebar and trigger a full collapse of concrete walls, cable trays, raised floors, power conduits, or cooling lines.

“Concrete is often treated as a static component of a data center, but in reality, it is a dynamic and vulnerable part of the facility,” said Kari Yuers, President & CEO of Kryton International. “Traditional concrete is prone to microcracking, water penetration, and abrasion — all of which can lead to costly damage, downtime, and reputational risk for operators.”

This risk is amplified by the massive volumes of water used to cool today’s data centers. Many large facilities use millions of gallons of water daily to regulate temperature — Google alone reported using over 5 billion gallons of water across its U.S. data centers in 2022. As cooling systems circulate water through and around concrete infrastructure, the potential for seepage and structural degradation grows — especially when relying on outdated or inadequately treated concrete.

Additionally, the implementation of robotics to handle racks within the facility – an increasingly more common practice within the data center industry – subjects the concrete to abrasion from wheeled traffic cycles.

Kryton’s Krystol Internal Membrane™ (KIM®) and Hard-Cem® admixtures provide industry-leading protection by making concrete self-sealing, waterproof, and resistant to abrasion — even under the heavy loads and constant movement associated with robotic systems.

“Data centers are expanding to handle the processing power of AI systems, and the modern, high-efficiency warehouses are increasingly being driven by robotics,” said Yuers. “That shift demands a new standard in concrete performance — one that resists not just time, but moisture and abrasion.”

The need is growing as hyperscale and edge data centers expand into regions with high water tables, such as Texas and the Southern U.S.; seismic activity; or wide seasonal temperature swings — all of which increase the risk of concrete deterioration. Once a water leak occurs, not only is there potential damage to electronics, but entire operations may grind to a halt for remediation and equipment replacement.

By integrating Kryton's innovative admixtures at the time of construction, operators can avoid costly shutdowns, eliminate reliance on external waterproofing membranes, and ensure long-term operational resilience.

Key Advantages of Advanced Concrete Solutions in Data Centers:

1. Moisture Protection: Waterproof concrete helps eliminate the risk of seepage and moisture migration through floors and below-grade walls, which is especially vital in facilities with raised floors or sensitive power and cooling infrastructure.
2. Long-Term Integrity: Abrasion-resistant concrete stands up to the high traffic and mechanical wear caused by heavy equipment, maintenance operations, and cable tray installations—ensuring longevity without the need for frequent repairs.
3. Energy and Cost Efficiency: By mitigating risks of structural damage, corrosion, and mold growth, advanced concrete formulations reduce the need for costly repairs, operational disruptions, and energy losses from compromised insulation systems.
