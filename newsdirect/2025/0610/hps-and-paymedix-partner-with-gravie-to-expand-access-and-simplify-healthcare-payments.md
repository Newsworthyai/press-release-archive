# HPS and PayMedix Partner with Gravie to Expand Access and Simplify Healthcare Payments

MILWAUKEE, WI – June 10, 2025 – PayMedix, a leading healthcare financing and payments solution, and HPS, one of Wisconsin’s largest independent provider networks, today announced a strategic partnership with Gravie, a health benefits company reimagining health plans for small and midsize businesses.

As a result of this partnership, eligible Gravie members will gain access to the comprehensive HPS provider network and benefit from the transparency and ease of the PayMedix payment platform. The collaboration reflects a shared commitment between Gravie, HPS, and PayMedix to help reshape the healthcare experience with solutions that prioritize improved access and member well-being.

"This partnership represents a fundamental shift in how regional employers can approach healthcare benefits," said Brian Marsella, President of HPS and PayMedix. "Gravie's mission to make health benefit plans work for everyone is well-aligned with our vision to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all. By combining Gravie's level-funded approach with our comprehensive network and payment solutions, we're creating new possibilities for employers to transition from traditional fully-insured arrangements to more flexible, cost-effective plan designs."

Through this partnership, eligible Gravie members will gain access to HPS's Wisconsin provider network, which includes over:

* 100 hospitals
* 30,000 physicians
* 1,200 clinics
* 630 behavioral health providers

Members will also benefit from PayMedix, a healthcare payment experience that simplifies the billing process. PayMedix pays contracted providers in full and consolidates all medical billing into one clear, monthly statement, the SuperEOB®, which displays all charges, insurance payments, and patient balances into a single view.

To make healthcare even more accessible for everyone, PayMedix offers interest-free financing and flexible repayment plans to all members for all allowed in-network expenses up to their out-of-pocket maximum, with no credit check required, removing a common barrier to care and delivering financial peace of mind.

"At Gravie, we're constantly seeking innovative ways to improve our members' healthcare experience," said Evan Peters, SVP of Networks at Gravie. "Partnering with HPS and PayMedix allows us to offer greater access to high-quality regional care while removing financial barriers that too often prevent people from getting the care they need. This partnership represents another exciting step toward making healthcare work better for Wisconsin families."
