# Medicus Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: MDCX) Positioned for Growth in a $5 Trillion Biotech Market

The global population is aging rapidly, with the number of people aged 65 and older expected to double by 2050. This demographic shift is driving a surge in chronic diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. At the same time, breakthroughs in biomedical research are enabling the development of targeted, more effective therapies, transforming treatment approaches in both human and veterinary medicine.

These twin forces, rising demand fueled by aging and disease prevalence along with technological innovation, are propelling unprecedented growth across biopharma markets. The global biotechnology sector is projected to expand from $1.74 trillion in 2025 to over $5 trillion by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5 percent. Specialty pharmaceuticals, including biologics and novel drug delivery systems, are expected to grow even faster, with forecasts predicting a 26.5 percent CAGR over the same period.

Oncology remains a key driver, with spending on cancer medicines forecasted to nearly double from $252 billion in 2024 to $441 billion by 2029. Meanwhile, veterinary oncology is emerging as a high-potential frontier, with the U.S. market alone projected to reach $1.48 billion by 2030, driven by rising pet ownership and demand for advanced care. The urology therapeutics segment also shows steady growth potential, expected to rise from $10.5 billion in 2024 to $15.8 billion by 2033.

Amid this expansive and interconnected landscape, Medicus Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: MDCX) is methodically positioning itself to capitalize on these powerful market tailwinds. Through a diversified portfolio of innovative drug delivery platforms and targeted therapies, Medicus addresses some of the most pressing health challenges across human and veterinary medicine.

Medicus Pharma: Methodically Building a High-Leverage Growth Story

Though still flying under many investors’ radars, Medicus Pharma is rapidly assembling the elements of a high-leverage growth story. On June 2, the company completed a $7 million public offering, selling 2,260,000 units at $3.10 each. Each unit includes one common share plus one warrant exercisable at the same price over five years.

The capital will primarily fund a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) using Medicus’s flagship doxorubicin-loaded dissolvable microneedle patch (D-MNA). Additional funds may support broader development in non-melanoma skin cancers or other pipeline programs.

Strategic Veterinary Expansion: FDA Submission for Equine Squamous Cell Carcinoma

This timely financing was quickly followed by a major regulatory milestone. On June 9, Medicus announced submission of a formal product development plan to the U.S. FDA for a veterinary application of D-MNA targeting equine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

The program is advancing under an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) file, aiming for conditional approval. It leverages the same microneedle patch technology used in human dermatologic trials, demonstrating a strategic effort to repurpose clinical data and technology across human and veterinary markets.

Tapping an Untapped Veterinary Oncology Opportunity

The equine indication represents a significant market opportunity. As CEO Dr. Raza Bokhari highlighted, “In veterinary medicine, where only a handful of oncology drugs are approved, developing a non-invasive treatment for equine SCC targets a largely unmet need, a potential $250 million market.”

The planned study will enroll 50 horses across five U.S. sites in a placebo-controlled design, comparing two D-MNA doses against placebo, with tumor response assessed at day 90. Medicus has secured FDA Minor Use in Major Species (MUMS) Designation, which grants seven years of market exclusivity upon approval, a valuable commercial advantage in a segment with limited competition.

D-MNA Platform: Promising Safety and Efficacy Data

The D-MNA patch, originally developed for human skin cancers, is supported by encouraging early data. A Phase 1 trial in Australia (SKNJCT-001) involving 13 patients with nodular BCC showed the treatment was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. Remarkably, 46 percent of lesions achieved complete histological clearance after a single application, an impressive result given the minimally invasive delivery.

This platform delivers doxorubicin directly into the dermis through a biodegradable microneedle array, minimizing systemic exposure while concentrating the drug’s effect at the tumor site.

Expanding Clinical Trials Across Continents

Building on this foundation, Medicus is running two Phase 2 trials. In the U.S., the SKNJCT-003 study recently expanded enrollment from 60 to 90 patients following a positive interim analysis that showed over 60 percent clinical clearance. This multicenter, placebo-controlled trial compares the patch to the standard of care, with European sites now joining due to growing investigator interest.

Concurrently, the SKNJCT-004 trial in the United Arab Emirates involves 36 patients across four hospitals, including Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, targeting both histological and clinical clearance endpoints.

Strategic Acquisition: Entering Late-Stage Urology

Complementing its internal pipeline, Medicus is also positioning itself as a consolidator of high-value assets. In April, the company signed a binding letter of intent to acquire UK-based Antev Ltd., whose lead candidate, Teverelix, is a GnRH antagonist in late-stage development for two urology indications: acute urinary retention (AUR) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk.

These combined markets represent a $6 billion annual opportunity, and Teverelix has completed multiple clinical trials in Europe. Under the deal, Antev shareholders would receive approximately 19 percent of Medicus’s post-merger equity, plus up to $65 million in milestone payments tied to regulatory and commercial successes.

A Platform With Multiple Growth Levers

Together, Medicus offers optionality and platform leverage across human oncology, veterinary medicine, and dermatology, all fields marked by limited innovation and strong pricing power.

Its lead asset is already in Phase 2 with international trial sites and active FDA engagement. The veterinary program offers a faster commercialization path with fewer regulatory barriers, while the Antev acquisition could propel Medicus into late-stage, multi-billion-dollar indications.

Why Investors Should Watch MDCX

Medicus Pharma (NASDAQ: MDCX) paints the picture of a small-cap biotech transitioning from concept to execution. The recent capital raise was non-dilutive and immediately followed by a key regulatory filing. Clinical trials across humans and animals are expanding, and a transformative acquisition is imminent.

With a methodical approach tying together clinical progress, intellectual property, and market strategy, Medicus is quietly building momentum, making MDCX a stock to watch closely in the second half of 2025.
