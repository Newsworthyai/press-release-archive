# EDGE Boost Launches Social Accountability Program, Adding Peer-Based Accountability to its Roster of Responsible Gaming Tools

EDGE Markets, the company behind EDGE Boost, one of the first debit cards designed specifically for responsible gaming, today announced the launch of its newest responsible gaming feature: a co-pilot system for social accountability. Through the EDGE Boost platform, users can nominate trusted friends or family to receive weekly reports of their transactions and participate in real-time limit adjustments, creating a shared commitment to more responsible play.

Social accountability leans on a core behavioral insight that accountability works best when it comes from someone you know, not a faceless platform or app. Early adoption of the co-pilot system has already exceeded expectations with 7% of EDGE Boost users enabling the feature, far surpassing the industry standard of 1-2% adoption for similar, operator-based responsible gaming tools.

“The reason why the co-pilot feature has been so successful is peer involvement,” said Seni Thomas, Founder and CEO of EDGE Boost. “Social accountability is why having a gym buddy works. By involving a buddy in your betting lifestyle, one is set up even better for responsible play. We have always said that EDGE Boost’s mission is to provide a safer and more responsible environment for users to engage with gaming and we know social accountability is doing just that.”

Co-pilots will receive weekly snapshots of a user’s EDGE Boost transactions. If a user attempts to raise their deposit or spending limits, a co-pilot must enter a verification code before the change can take effect.

The new feature aligns with the American Gambling Association’s (AGA) evolving Responsible Gaming Code of Conduct. Social accountability also helps foster responsible gaming by avoiding punitive approaches and reducing negative stigma.

The co-pilot feature is now live and available to all EDGE Boost users.
