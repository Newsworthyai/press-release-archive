# Wallid Unveils 3-Year Forecast and Strategic Vision for the Future of AI-Powered Shopping

As AI agents like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity increasingly shape how consumers discover and buy products online, Wallid.co Ltd, a London-based fintech innovator, has unveiled its official 3-year forecast for AI-powered e-commerce—alongside a strategic roadmap to help merchants and platforms adapt to this fast-evolving landscape.

Led by CEO Ilya Mikin, Wallid is building the payment and checkout infrastructure designed specifically for the AI-commerce era, where traditional storefronts are replaced by conversational and intelligent buying flows.

A Paradigm Shift in Online ShoppingConsumers are no longer relying on static search-and-scroll models. Instead, they're asking AI assistants for personalized product suggestions—and soon, they’ll expect these assistants to complete purchases within the same interface.

“We’re seeing the rise of ‘ask-and-checkout’ experiences,” said Ilya Mikin, CEO of Wallid. “This will radically change how brands are discovered and how transactions are completed.”

Early signs of this shift are already visible:

* OpenAI-Shopify integrations now allow real-time product discovery and purchases within ChatGPT.
* Tech giants like Amazon, Google, and TikTok are embedding AI agents for dynamic, contextual shopping experiences.

Market Outlook: AI Shopping Set to Hit $945B by 2028Wallid projects that AI-powered shopping will account for a growing share of global e-commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV):

* $189B by 2025 (3% global share)
* $630B by 2027 (10% global share)
* $945B by 2028, representing 15% of all online purchases

This surge represents not just a tech trend but a fundamental shift in consumer expectations—and a wake-up call for merchants and platforms to rethink how they sell.

This Matters: The Four Fronts of AI-CommerceAccording to Wallid’s research, merchants need to prepare across four critical dimensions:

1. Discovery: Product data must be structured for AI APIs, not just search engines.
2. Personalization: AI will only show the most relevant options; brands must earn that limited visibility.
3. Checkout:  Frictionless, AI-native checkout with real-time payments is essential.
4. Retention: AI agents can drive reorders, upsells, and smarter post-purchase flows.

“Wallid’s AI-personalized, open-banking powered checkout is designed for this future—one where payments are embedded, context-aware, and effortless,” added Mikin.

Wallid’s Vision: Payments That Work Where Conversations HappenBuilt specifically for embedded AI interfaces, Wallid’s next-generation checkout platform:

* Operates inside chat interfaces and AI agents
* Adapts in real-time to each customer’s context
* Powers low-cost, high-conversion account-to-account (A2A) payments
* Supports split-pay, cashback, and affordability-aware offers at checkout

As conversational commerce becomes the norm, Wallid is positioning itself as the go-to infrastructure for AI-optimized payments across platforms and geographies.

The Future Is Agent-Led CommerceWallid forecasts the rise of intelligent AI agents that shop on behalf of consumers with prompts like:

* “Find me a birthday gift under £50”
* “Reorder my supplements with next-day delivery”
* “Book my skincare subscription using the best cashback offer”

And with financial logic embedded into these AI systems—from credit scoring to loyalty and instant offers—Wallid’s mission is to become the transactional engine behind this future.
