# Attention Experts Expands International Footprint with New Offices and Strategic Partnerships

Attention Experts, a Sydney-based digital strategy firm, has announced the expansion of its international operations, establishing offices in London and Dublin to meet growing demand for data-driven digital marketing services across Europe.

The expansion marks a strategic milestone for the agency, which has seen steady growth since its founding in 2016. Initially established to address a market gap in performance-based digital strategy, Attention Experts has grown to support clients in more than 30 industries, including tourism, e-commerce, professional services, and nonprofit organizations.

“Our decision to expand into the UK and Ireland reflects both client demand and the increasing need for transparent, measurable digital outcomes,” said George Hawwa, Founder and Managing Director of Attention Experts. “This move allows us to better serve our clients with localized expertise while maintaining our commitment to data integrity and business results.”

Attention Experts provides a full suite of digital services, including social media strategy and management, SEO, SEM, programmatic advertising, email marketing, and website optimization. The agency benchmarks each campaign against clearly defined objectives, focusing on conversion rates, customer retention, and return on investment.

In addition to its client service offerings, the firm plays an active role in digital education. Hawwa is a regular lecturer at the University of Sydney and has delivered presentations on social media strategy to more than 30,000 professionals globally. He is also consulted as an expert witness in legal matters involving digital marketing and social media-related disputes.

Since 2020, Attention Experts has served as the official digital partner for several organizations, including Tourism Accommodation Australia and the Australian British Chamber of Commerce. The firm is a certified partner of both Meta and Google.

The agency’s boutique model continues to prioritize service quality and strategic selectivity, even as it scales internationally. Current office locations include Sydney, Melbourne, London, and Dublin.

“As the digital environment evolves with developments in artificial intelligence and privacy regulation, we are focused on helping clients navigate these changes with strategies grounded in performance and sustainability,” Hawwa added.
