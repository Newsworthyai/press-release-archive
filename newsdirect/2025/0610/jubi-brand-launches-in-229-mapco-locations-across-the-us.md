# Jubi Brand Launches in 229 MAPCO Locations Across the US

Jubi Brand, a rising leader in functional botanical beverages, today announced its official launch in 229 MAPCO convenience store locations across the United States. This rollout marks a major step in Jubi’s mission to make plant-based wellness products more accessible to everyday consumers. Beginning this month, MAPCO guests will be able to purchase Jubi’s complete lineup of functional wellness shots — including its flagship Focus + Mood, Energy + Clarity, and Recovery + Calm formulas. Each product is formulated with clean, plant-derived ingredients designed to support energy, focus, and overall balance, without the crash or additives found in traditional energy products.

“Our expansion into MAPCO represents a pivotal milestone for Jubi,” said Matt Delmore, Chief Marketing Officer at Jubi Brand. “We’re focused on delivering high-performance wellness products to customers where they live, work, and travel — and convenience retail plays a key role in that mission.”

Jubi products will be featured in specially marked wellness displays at participating MAPCO locations, offering consumers an on-the-go alternative for clean energy, mental clarity, and daily recovery. As Jubi continues to scale its retail footprint nationwide, this strategic partnership with MAPCO supports the brand’s vision of integrating botanical wellness into the mainstream consumer experience.
