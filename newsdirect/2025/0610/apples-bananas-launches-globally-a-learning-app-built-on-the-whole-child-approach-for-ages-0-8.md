“We’re parents too—and we’ve seen first-hand how hard it is to find something that’s educational, safe, fun, and grows with your child,” says Uday Phoolka, Founder and Creator of Apples & Bananas. “This app is designed to be the one place you can turn to for it all—whether it’s learning numbers, listening to a calming story, or exploring their creativity with music and play.”

What Makes Apples & Bananas Different:

Whole-child development: Supports cognitive, motor, emotional, mindfulness, and creative skills through a mix of guided learning and free exploration.
