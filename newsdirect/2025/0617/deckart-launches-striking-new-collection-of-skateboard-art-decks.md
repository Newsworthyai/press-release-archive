# Deckart Launches Striking New Collection of Skateboard Art Decks

Melbourne-based design studio DeckArt has just released a fresh collection of limited-edition skateboard art decks, offering a bold new take on the intersection of skate culture and contemporary design. The 2025 lineup features original graphics created in collaboration with a handpicked group of visual artists, illustrators, and designers.

Each deck is printed on Canadian maple and produced in small batches, continuing DeckArt’s focus on quality, creativity, and collectability. The new drop brings together a range of styles — from bold and expressive to minimalist and refined — all aimed at reimagining the skateboard as a meaningful design object. “This drop is about exploring new visual ideas while staying true to the roots of skate culture,” said Sam West, founder of DeckArt. “Each piece is a collaboration — not just between us and the artists, but with the wider culture and community around it. Whether you ride it or hang it, it’s meant to spark something.”

Available now exclusively at www.deckart.com.au, this new release has already started gaining attention from collectors, stylists, and design-forward retailers looking for pieces that reflect identity, creativity, and edge.
