# ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) Scales AI Drone and Quantum Computing Innovations for Defense and Commercial Markets

The global commercial drone market is taking off, with its value hitting $30.02 billion in 2024 and projected to grow at a 10.6% CAGR through 2030. From agriculture and filmmaking to emergency response and infrastructure inspection, drones are becoming indispensable tools for businesses and governments alike. As the industry evolves, companies are racing to integrate cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing into their offerings — reshaping what’s possible in aerial intelligence.

In this high-growth sector, ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) has been making headlines with a series of recent announcements that highlight its momentum and potential. Through strategic initiatives, acquisitions, and technological breakthroughs, the company is positioning itself as an emerging leader in both defense and commercial drone markets. Let’s dive into what’s driving ZenaTech’s progress and why it’s a company to watch.

 Pursuit of Blue UAS Certification for Military ApplicationsIn late January, ZENA announced that its subsidiaries, ZenaDrone and Spider Vision Sensors, are partnering with Taiwan-based Suntek Global to pursue Blue UAS certification for the IQ Nano drone sensor. Managed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), this certification would allow ZenaTech to supply drones directly to U.S. military and federal agencies — a major step toward securing defense contracts.

The IQ Nano is a compact indoor drone designed for precision applications like inventory management, search and rescue, and explosives detection. The company is also pursuing Green UAS certification — a commercial-grade approval — as a stepping stone toward Blue UAS. With the global military drone market projected to grow from $14 billion in 2023 to $47 billion by 2032 (Fortune Business Insights), ZenaTech is strategically positioning itself to capture a share of this expanding market.

 Expansion of DaaS Business Through AcquisitionsIn early February, ZenaTech signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire its fifth land survey engineering company, this time in Southeast Florida. The acquisition strengthens the company’s Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model, which combines AI-powered drones with established infrastructure businesses to modernize industries like land surveying and border security.

ZenaTech highlighted how drones could enhance Florida’s border security, where the state faced $8 billion in illegal immigration costs in 2023. Drones equipped with thermal imaging, night vision, and AI-powered tracking offer 24/7 surveillance in remote or high-risk areas — providing a faster, more cost-effective alternative to manned patrols.

 Advancements in Drone TechnologyOn February 6, ZenaTech announced that ZenaDrone is testing high-density batteries for the ZenaDrone 1000, its flagship AI drone built for both defense and commercial applications. Supplied by affiliate Galaxy Batteries Inc., the batteries aim to extend flight times and improve performance in missions like cargo transport and reconnaissance.

The ZenaDrone 1000 has already completed paid trials with the U.S. Air Force and Navy, demonstrating its potential in logistics and transportation operations. The company’s focus on NDAA compliance and its pursuit of Blue UAS certification could further boost its position in the defense market.

 Innovation in Drone Communications: DroneNetOn February 13, ZENA announced DroneNet, its proprietary drone communications management system. DroneNet allows for secure, uninterrupted communications in environments without reliable internet, cellular, or satellite coverage — a critical capability for military operations where real-time data transmission is essential.

ZenaTech is developing its own encrypted microchips for DroneNet, ensuring compliance with National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirements. Integrated with the ZenaDrone 1000, DroneNet enhances both security and operational range, making the system a powerful solution for defense and industrial applications.

 Quantum Computing Initiatives: Sky Traffic ProjectZenaTech’s quantum computing initiatives are also gaining momentum. On February 19, the company reported positive results from early testing of its Sky Traffic project, which uses AI and quantum computing to improve weather forecasting accuracy for aerial operations.

Encouraged by the results, ZenaTech is expanding its team with quantum, AI, and hardware engineers to accelerate development. The company envisions applications in traffic management, wildfire prevention, and defense operations — areas where rapid data processing and predictive analytics could revolutionize decision-making.

 Scaling Production for Defense and Commercial MarketsTo meet rising demand, ZenaTech finalized the third-generation design of its ZenaDrone 1000 on February 25. The latest model features a more powerful propulsion system, aerodynamic carbon fiber body, and enhanced lift capabilities for both defense and commercial applications.

The company plans to manufacture at least ten units per month starting in Q1 2025 at its Sharjah, UAE facility, while ramping up NDAA-compliant production at its Phoenix, Arizona facility for U.S. Department of Defense applications.

 Commercial Sector Growth: IQ Square DroneIn the commercial sector, ZenaTech is advancing its IQ Square drone, which entered the manufacturing stage on February 27. Designed for building inspections, land surveys, and power washing, the IQ Square plays a central role in the company’s growing DaaS model.

With the global market for drone cleaning services projected to reach $53.89 billion by 2030 (QYResearch), the IQ Square provides an automated, cost-effective solution — eliminating the need for scaffolding and manual labor in large-scale cleaning jobs.

 DaaS Model: Revolutionizing Traditional IndustriesZenaTech’s DaaS model enables businesses and government agencies to access drone solutions on a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need for upfront hardware or software investments. By acquiring established land survey firms and integrating AI drones into their operations, the company is proving how drone technology can transform traditional industries.

 Conclusion: A Company to WatchAs ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) scales production, expands its market reach, and drives innovation in AI drones and quantum computing, it’s positioning itself as a rising player in the technology and defense sectors. With strategic acquisitions, groundbreaking technologies, and increasing traction across multiple industries, ZenaTech’s recent developments underscore its potential to capitalize on the growing demand for secure, reliable, and efficient drone solutions, making ZENA a stock to watch.
