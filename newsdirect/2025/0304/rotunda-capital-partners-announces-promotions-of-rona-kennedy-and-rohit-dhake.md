# Rotunda Capital Partners Announces Promotions of Rona Kennedy and Rohit Dhake

Rotunda Capital Partners (“Rotunda”), an operationally focused private equity firm that partners with family-founder owned businesses, is proud to announce the promotions of Rona Kennedy to Partner, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer, and Rohit Dhake to Managing Director. These promotions reflect their exceptional leadership, expertise, and commitment to Rotunda’s values.

Since joining Rotunda in 2019, Rona has been a driving force behind the firm’s financial management and compliance initiatives. Her strategic oversight has strengthened internal processes, enhanced operational efficiency, and helped maintain regulatory compliance, positioning Rotunda for future growth. Rona also founded Rotunda’s Women in Leadership (WIL) group in 2022 with a mission to share resources, set personal and professional goals, and foster growth within the firm and across the portfolio.

Rohit, our first employee in 2016, has played a critical role in building Rotunda primarily through investment execution and portfolio management. His deep understanding of thematic sourcing, deal structuring and value creation has helped Rotunda partner with and scale middle-market Rotunda portfolio companies.

“Rona and Rohit have been key contributors to Rotunda’s growth and success,” said John Fruehwirth, Managing Partner. “Their expertise and leadership will continue to shape the firm’s future, and we are excited to see them take on these expanded roles.”
