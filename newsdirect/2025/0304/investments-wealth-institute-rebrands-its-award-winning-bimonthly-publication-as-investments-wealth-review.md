# Investments & Wealth Institute Rebrands its Award-winning Bimonthly Publication as 
‘Investments & Wealth Review’

The Investments & Wealth Institute (the Institute) – the premier credentialing body, continuing education resource, and professional membership association for elite financial advisors and wealth management professionals – has launched Investments & Wealth Review (The Review), a new iteration of its hallmark publication, formerly known as Investments & Wealth Monitor.

The Review is the Institute’s bimonthly, award-winning, peer-reviewed magazine, written by award-winning authors from academic institutions and leading financial firms. Each issue includes current industry news and thought-provoking articles on the investment, legal, regulatory, business development, retirement, and wealth management topics that matter most to wealth management professionals and their clients. The refreshed name and design reflect a modernized look and feel while maintaining the same trusted content that Institute members rely on.

“To kick off the new look, and the new year, we wanted to temporarily shift our editorial focus—moving beyond investment topics to provide ‘advice to advisors.’ To do this, we’ve brought together industry lifers to share their insights on pressing challenges and the road ahead,” said Avi Sharon, PhD, CAIA®, Chair of The Review’s Editorial Advisory Board and Managing Director at Golub Capital. “We’re excited to continue delivering essential insights to investment and wealth professionals in a fresh, modern way that aligns with the Investments & Wealth Review rebrand.”

The January/February 2025 Investments & Wealth Review includes the following features:

• The Advice Industry, a Reckoning: A Discussion with David DeVoe, James Grubman, PhD, and Mark Tibergien, a roundtable discussion moderated by Avi Sharon, PhD, CAIA®. This feature highlights the forces shaping the wealth management industry and the evolving role of advice and reveals some important factors for advisors to consider in the new year.

• A Changing Financial Advice Industry: Key Trends in 2025, by Daniil Shapiro, CFA®, Andrew Blake, Brad Bruenell, Chayce Horton, Stephen Caruso, and Andrew Larsen. This feature outlines how success ahead will depend on how well advisors and wealth management firms adapt to shifting demographics, financial trends, and evolving product options.

• Transition Advice: From “Single Shingle” to Integrators and Aggregators, by Liz Nesvold and Peter Nesvold, JD, CFA®, CPA. This feature shares the insights from two industry veterans for advisors who currently are navigating or contemplating an advisor transition.

• The Adviser’s Advisor: Seeking Market Counsel, by Brian Hamburger, JD, CRCP. This feature outlines the sea of potential legal, regulatory, and compliance perils when enterprising advisors build an independent practice.

• The Human Element in Advisor Education: A New Standard of Care for Next-Gen Advisors, by Ken Haman. This feature shares how training in the “human element” can enable next-generation advisors to more capably take the reins of larger, more complex RIA businesses.

• The Demise of Fiduciary Advice? by Knut A. Rostad, MBA. This feature reviews the shift in priorities of the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the interpretation, application, and enforcement of conduct standards rulemaking.

• Microtargeting: Finding Your Niche in a Sea of Sameness, by Moe Allain, RMA®, CPWA®, AAMS®, MBA. This feature details how, by embracing a niche practice, advisors can establish expertise, reduce stress, and drive growth in assets, revenue, efficiency, and referrals.

• Rethinking Your Business Development Strategy: People Are from Earth; Advisors Are from Another Universe, by Tom Anderson. This feature lays out how the changes in consumer behavior and advisor practices have created mismatched engagement preferences between prospects and advisors.

• UHNW Wealth Intelligence: A Brief History, by David Friedman. The background behind the ultra-affluent niche market provides a useful view into the identification of the global rich and thoughtful ways to approach and service them.

• Pricing and Best Practices for Ultra-High-Net-Worth Clients, by Paul Ferguson, JD, CPA-PFS, CFP®, CLU, and James “Jamie” H. McLaughlin. This feature summarizes the fee debate in advice and wealth management, which requires broad grounding in history and practice.

• The Economic Impact of Certification on Today’s Wealth Management Practices, by John J. Bowen, Jr., and George Walper, Jr. This Investments & Wealth Research study reveals how advanced certifications have emerged as critical tools in advisor differentiation, providing both the technical expertise and professional credibility that advisors need to attract, serve, and retain ideal clients.

In alignment with its ongoing commitment to delivering peer-reviewed research and thought leadership from esteemed practitioners and industry experts, The Review has introduced a dedicated “Content Preview" section featuring content from the Journal of Investment Consulting and the Retirement Management Journal, with articles published on an ongoing basis and complete electronic issues made available annually. The Review will increase the visibility of supplemental "Between the Issues" content – such as Investments & Wealth Research and Masters and Visionaries Interviews– through digital distribution and promotional channels.

Beginning in January 2026, The Review will introduce an annual "Commencement" issue, showcasing the most distinguished and award-winning content from the preceding year, all Masters and Visionaries Interviews, and, where feasible, critical organizational updates such as the Institute and Institute Foundation annual reports, Defining Wealth Management summaries of the CIMA®, CPWA®, and RMA® Bodies of Knowledge, and a comprehensive catalog of the Institute’s educational programs and conference offerings.
