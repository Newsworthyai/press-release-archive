# Peru’s Historic Export Growth Expands its Global Reach

Peruvian exports in 2024 marked a 15.6% increase compared to the previous year, reaching a total of USD 74.7 billion. This strong performance highlights the dynamism of Peruvian trade and the consolidation of key sectors in international markets. Among the top destination markets, China led with USD 25 billion in exports, reflecting a 9.2% increase, followed by the United States with USD 9.5 billion (+3.6%) and the European Union with USD 8.2 billion (+19.1%). Other key markets included India, Canada, and Japan, which also saw remarkable expansion

Growth was particularly strong in non-traditional exports, which create more jobs, add value, and strengthen production chains. This sector increased by 11.3%, reaching USD 20.6 billion—significantly higher than the 1.6% growth recorded in 2023.

The United States remained the top destination for non-traditional exports, totaling USD 6.6 billion, a 15.9% increase. The European Union followed with USD 4.1 billion (+21.7%), while Chile recorded USD 1.2 billion (+3.8%).

The impact of free trade agreements

Peruvian trade has benefited greatly from free trade agreements. Currently, 22 trade agreements allow Peruvian products to access strategic markets with preferential conditions. In 2024, exports under these agreements totaled USD 64.99 billion, representing 87% of total exports.

The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism has played a key role in negotiating and managing these agreements, ensuring better conditions for Peruvian exporters and reducing trade barriers in international markets.

Growing sectors: agribusiness, metallurgy, and metalworking lead the way

Peru is emerging as a dynamic industrialized country with a modern, high-tech agricultural sector and a thriving manufacturing industry. Strategic trade policies and innovation have positioned it as a key global supplier, with vast opportunities for expansion.

Three non-traditional sectors stood out for their remarkable performance. Agribusiness led with USD 11.6 billion in exports, a 21.6% increase, driven by high-value products such as blueberries (+36%), avocados (+29.5%), and cocoa (+257.5%). Meanwhile, metallurgy and metalworking saw significant expansion, reinforcing Peru’s strength beyond agriculture in international markets.

As the world’s top exporter of blueberries, asparagus, grapes, quinoa, and fishmeal, Peru continues to strengthen its global presence.

Export agenda for the future

With a diverse offering, sustained growth, and the support of strategic trade agreements, Peru continues its path toward a more competitive and globally integrated economy.

In this context, the Commission for Promotion of Export and Tourism (PROMPERÚ), will continue working to strengthen the internationalization of Peruvian companies, promote market diversification, and expand the presence of high-value-added products abroad. The goal is to build on these achievements, ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth that benefits more regions and productive sectors across the country.
