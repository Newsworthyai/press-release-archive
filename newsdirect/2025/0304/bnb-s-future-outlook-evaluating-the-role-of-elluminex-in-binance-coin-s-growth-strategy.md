![](https://public.newsdirect.com/251534244/WBYFaCQ9.jpg)

Do you know what the popular DEX PancakeSwap’s user-friendly interface and low-fee structure did for BNB?

PancakeSwap helped draw massive traffic to the Binance smart chain. BNB saw a huge migration of users to its platform, and suddenly, every user wanted BNB for pasting gas fees and staking on the DEX. The result? BNB prices skyrocketed from $40 in 2021 to $600 in the same year.

That’s the power true DeFi capabilities hold for a blockchain ecosystem and its native token. BNB is one of the most valued and stable cryptocurrencies today.

Elluminex, an all-in-one DeFi platform native to the TON ecosystem, is set to bring the same promised fate for one of the most popular blockchain ecosystems today. Elluminex is bringing DeFi capabilities to crystallize true earning opportunities for the 950 billion users active on the TON ecosystem, bringing shared liquidity to thousands of applications and commissioning seamless transactions across chains.

Let’s learn more about BNB's outlook before we figure out how Elluminex is to TON what PancakeSwap was to BNB.

 BNB’s Future Outlook: What’s In Store For The Behemoth Token BNB price is expected to continue its upward trend as more and more users continue to flock to the BSC blockchain for its low fees and fast transaction speed. BNB could hit a price of $761 by the end of 2025, according to The Currency Analytics prediction platform. It reached an all-time high of $750, and its market cap reached $100 billion YoY.

Messari’s report also points to the growing relevance of Binance Smart Chain, given its expanding ecosystem and continuous improvements. However, the growth of multi-utility DeFi platforms like Elluminex on TON can promote another migration to the popular blockchain hosting Telegram and its mini-apps.

 Elluminex is Championing Speed, Scalability, and Security in DeFiElluminex is a multi-utility DeFI platform on the TON blockchain. It brings DeFi utilities to the otherwise fragmented TON ecosystem. Elluminex is different from other DeFI platforms as it targets the challenges hindering TON’s growth today. Its DEX offers low slippage-low fees transactions and swaps across chains, orders, and tokens. Elluminex will also give access to yet-to-be-launched tokens via its TON Pre-market platform.

Users will be able to stake $ELX tokens and win yields via its advanced staking and farming mechanisms. They can also partake in liquidity provision and contribute to liquidity pools in exchange for high APY returns.

Elluminex’s interesting tokenomics speaks for decentralized DeFI governance. $ELX has a maximum supply of 350 million tokens, out of which 50% goes to the early investors during presale. Elluminex’s presale is currently live on its official website, and any investor who wants to become a part of the revolution by rewriting user interaction and passive income capabilities on the TON ecosystem is welcome to join the league!

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
