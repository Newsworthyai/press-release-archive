# XRP’s Legal Battles Continue: Investors Eye Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Cutoshi as Alternative Meme Cryptos

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/745122262/GO376AIG.jpeg)

As XRP’s legal showdown with the SEC drags on, traders are diversifying into meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cutoshi (CUTO). Unlike XRP’s regulatory uncertainty, these memecoin projects are relatively safer bets with humor-driven communities and niche utilities.

Out of these emerging memecoins, Cutoshi, a DeFi-focused project, stands out with its scarcity model and Lucky cat lore, with some crypto enthusiasts predicting it may outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in growth in 2025.

XRP’s Legal Limbo and Market PressuresXRP’s price hovered near $0.50 as its legal battle entered a critical phase in 2020. The SEC seeks to appeal a 2023 ruling that partially cleared Ripple, arguing XRP constitutes security. Legal expert John Deaton calls the SEC’s case “weak,” but prolonged litigation could delay institutional adoption.

Traders note XRP’s 141% gain last year lags behind Bitcoin’s rally, pushing traders toward faster-moving assets. ETF applications from firms like Bitwise offer hope, but a $300 target remains unrealistic—its market cap would need to hit $17 trillion, dwarfing today’s entire crypto market. For now, XRP holders hedge bets elsewhere.

XRP is currently trading at $2.52 and has taken a hit, dropping 7.90% over the past week, which is slower than the rest of the crypto market. On a brighter note, trading volume for XRP jumped to $2,524,401,591 in the last 24 hours, showing a 25.90% increase from yesterday—the market is definitely active! Nonetheless, XRP has a total supply capped at 100 billion.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Meme Hype Meets Volatility Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2308, trapped in a “boring phase” since December 2024. Analysts like Trader Tardigrade predict a breakout past $1.30 post-March, citing historical patterns. Yet skeptics question its utility beyond Elon Musk’s tweets. Shiba Inu, down 26% monthly, faces its own reckoning—analyst Ali Martinez warns of a 48% drop to $0.000008 if key supports fail.

Once dubbed the “Doge killer,” SHIB struggles to differentiate in a sea of Solana-based rivals. Both coins highlight meme crypto’s double-edged sword: viral potential undercut by inflationary token supplies.

Cutoshi: The Lucky Cat MemeCoin with DeFi UtilityCutoshi ($CUTO) offers a twist - an Ethereum-based meme coin with deflationary mechanics. Its presale has raised over $2M with a current price of $0.0487 per token (up from an initial $0.015 per token, 224% rise).

Unlike Dogecoin’s infinite supply, Cutoshi caps tokens at 440 million, burning 7% to boost scarcity. The ecosystem will include a multi-chain DEX, yield farming, and NFTs tied to Japanese Lucky Cat folklore. Cutoshi’s lore draws from centuries-old tales where cats symbolize prosperity. Modernized, this ethos translates into DeFi tools: a non-wallet-connect DEX for privacy, an academy educating newcomers, and NFTs rewarding early adopters.

With 55% of tokens sold in its presale and CEX listings planned, $CUTO mirrors Shiba Inu’s 2021 structure but adds token burns—a feature that could fuel a 100x growth.

Apart from the DEX, Cutoshi has also released “Cutoshi Quests and Farming”, a yield farming initiative that’s gamified to improve community participation through achievements, missions, and reward points. These “Cutopoints”, can be redeemed for various benefits across the ecosystem, and stand to increase both participation and passive income for users.

With XRP's legal woes highlighting crypto’s regulatory risks and the decreasing community participation from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Cutoshi carves a middle path for buyers - meme appeal anchored in DeFi utility and cultural lore that can potentially bring back Ethereum based tokens back on traders portfolios.
