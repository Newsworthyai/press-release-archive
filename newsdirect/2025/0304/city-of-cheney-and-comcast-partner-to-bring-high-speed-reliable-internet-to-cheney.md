# City of Cheney and Comcast Partner to Bring High-Speed, Reliable Internet to Cheney

The City of Cheney and Comcast have finalized an agreement that will expand the availability of fiber broadband, high-speed internet services to Cheney. Comcast will construct the infrastructure and make available a 100-percent fiber-optic network to bring internet, mobile, entertainment, and security services from Xfinity and Comcast Business to 2,800 homes and businesses in the city.

“The City of Cheney looks forward to partnering with Comcast to provide another option for high-speed, reliable, secure internet services for our residents and businesses. We appreciate Comcast’s desire to invest in our wonderful community,” said Mark Schuller, Cheney City Administrator.

"Having fast and reliable internet is super important these days, which is why Comcast is working hard to connect more families and businesses in Spokane County," said Rodrigo Lopez, Senior Vice President, Comcast Pacific Northwest Region. "We're expanding our fiber networks in Chattaroy, Medical Lake, Four Lakes, and now Cheney because these areas are growing. By building the best internet infrastructure now, we're making sure these communities will thrive in the future."

Once permits are obtained and construction has begun, Comcast will create an online resource for people seeking information about the project, including answers to frequently asked questions and product and service details.
