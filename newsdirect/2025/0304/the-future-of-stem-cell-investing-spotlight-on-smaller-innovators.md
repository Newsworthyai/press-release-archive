# The Future of Stem Cell Investing: Spotlight on Smaller Innovators

The global stem cell therapy market is entering an era of unprecedented growth and innovation. Valued at $5.13 billion in 2024, the U.S. stem cell market alone is projected to reach $15.79 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.9%. Globally, the market is expected to hit $28.89 billion by 2030, fueled by advancements in regenerative medicine, increased government funding for research, and the development of groundbreaking therapies for conditions like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders.

Stem cells, often called the body’s internal repair system, have the unique ability to divide and regenerate, offering hope for treatments that address the root causes of diseases rather than just managing symptoms. From repairing damaged tissues to regenerating organs, the potential applications of stem cell therapies are vast and transformative. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved several stem cell-based treatments, and the pipeline of new therapies continues to expand.

This rapid growth is driven by several key factors: the rise of stem cell banks, increasing therapeutic potential, and a surge in research aimed at developing regenerative medicines. While large pharmaceutical companies and research institutions play a significant role, smaller biotech firms are also making important contributions, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in this dynamic field.

CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) is a biotechnology company that uses the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool to develop treatments for serious diseases. This powerful technology, which won a Nobel Prize, enables scientists to modify faulty genes that cause a variety of illnesses. The company made a major breakthrough in late 2023 when its first product, CASGEVY, became the first-ever CRISPR-based therapy to gain FDA approval. CASGEVY targets two blood disorders—sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT)—by utilizing stem cells, marking a significant milestone in the practical application of gene editing.

The launch of CASGEVY has been progressing well. By the end of 2024, over 50 treatment centers globally were set up to administer the therapy, and more than 50 patients had already begun the treatment process. The company anticipates further growth in patient enrollment in 2025, with clinical trials for children aged 5 to 11 now completed, with results expected later this year. In addition to CASGEVY, CRISPR Therapeutics is exploring ways to improve stem cell therapies, including developing methods that avoid the need for intensive pre-treatment steps.

While the company is initially known for its blood disorder treatments, CRISPR Therapeutics is expanding its focus to other areas, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. One promising program is CTX112, an advanced CAR T-cell therapy that uses modified immune cells to fight blood cancers. Early results from clinical trials have been promising, and the FDA has granted CTX112 a special designation to expedite its development. Updates on CTX112’s progress are expected in mid-2025. CRISPR is also investigating the potential of CTX112 in treating autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, with more data anticipated in the coming months.

CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) is also looking into regenerative medicine, with one of its key initiatives, CTX211, aiming to treat Type 1 diabetes using stem cells. The goal is to enable patients to produce their own insulin, potentially eliminating the need for daily injections or long-term medication. Additional information on this program is expected in 2025.

Financially, CRISPR Therapeutics is in a strong position, with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, providing a solid foundation for continued research and development. While CASGEVY’s sales may face slow growth due to the complex nature of the treatment process, the company remains focused on long-term goals, developing transformative therapies that could significantly impact patients’ lives.

Despite challenges in the stock market, many analysts maintain an optimistic outlook for CRISPR Therapeutics. Some predict a potential 87% increase in its stock price within the next 12 months, especially if upcoming clinical trial results prove positive. With its innovative technology, diverse therapeutic pipeline, and solid financial backing, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) is well-positioned to remain a leader in gene editing and stem cell therapies.

Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ: MESO) is a biotech company focused on developing stem cell-based treatments for severe inflammatory diseases. One of its major advancements is RYONCIL, a mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy that received FDA approval in December 2024. RYONCIL is designed to treat steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (SR-aGvHD), a life-threatening condition in which a patient's immune system attacks the body after a bone marrow transplant. In clinical trials, RYONCIL demonstrated a 70% response rate, with 49% of patients surviving for four years. The therapy is priced at $194,000 per infusion and is available through Mesoblast’s MyMesoblast patient services hub, with distribution managed by Cencora.

Mesoblast is also expanding the use of its stem cell technology for other conditions. The company is testing RYONCIL in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease, a severe inflammatory bowel disease. Early studies in adults have shown promising results, and Mesoblast plans to extend testing to children who have not responded to other treatments. Additionally, Mesoblast is developing REVASCOR, a stem cell therapy aimed at treating heart failure. In 2024, the FDA supported an accelerated approval pathway for REVASCOR in patients with end-stage heart failure who rely on mechanical heart pumps. Mesoblast is also researching REVASCOR for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a rare heart condition, which could open the door to further FDA approvals.

On the financial front, Mesoblast is in a relatively strong position. The company raised $161 million in a private placement, leaving it with approximately $200 million in cash to support its ongoing research and development activities. Mesoblast has also reduced its operating expenses by 22% from the previous year, indicating improved financial management. With the FDA-approved RYONCIL and a pipeline of other promising therapies, Mesoblast appears positioned to continue its work in stem cell-based treatments.

bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLUE), founded in 2010, has been a significant player in the field of gene therapy, focusing on developing treatments for severe genetic diseases like sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Over the years, the company has received FDA approvals for three gene therapies, positioning itself as a leader in the space. However, despite its scientific accomplishments, bluebird bio has faced substantial financial challenges, leading to its decision to go private in 2025.

In early 2025, bluebird bio announced an agreement to be acquired by global investment firms Carlyle Group Inc. and SK Capital Partners, along with a team of biotech executives. Under the terms of the deal, bluebird bio’s stockholders will receive $3.00 per share in cash, with the potential for additional payouts of up to $9.84 per share through a contingent value right, depending on the performance of its product portfolio. The acquisition, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will provide bluebird bio with the capital needed to scale the commercial delivery of its gene therapies. "For more than a decade, bluebird has been at the forefront of gene therapy, delivering treatments to patients facing life-threatening genetic diseases," said Andrew Obenshain, CEO of bluebird bio. "However, as financial challenges mounted, it became clear that securing the right strategic partner was critical to maximizing value for our stockholders and ensuring the long-term future of our therapies."

The acquisition arrives at a difficult time for bluebird bio. The company has faced mounting financial pressures, including the denial of a priority review voucher by the FDA and the risk of loan default. By partnering with Carlyle and SK Capital, bluebird bio aims to secure the necessary resources to continue its operations and bring its therapies to patients. Upon completion of the deal, bluebird bio will no longer be publicly traded, and former Mirati Therapeutics CEO David Meek is expected to take over as the new CEO.

bluebird bio has achieved notable scientific milestones, particularly with its LYFGENIA (lovotibeglogene autotemcel, or lovo-cel) gene therapy for sickle cell disease. At the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2024, the company presented long-term data showing that LYFGENIA significantly reduces or eliminates vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) in patients with sickle cell disease. Among the 58 patients treated in the HGB-206 and HGB-210 studies, 94.7% achieved complete resolution of severe VOEs, with benefits sustained for a median of over four years. Notably, patients with a history of overt stroke, a severe complication of sickle cell disease, remained stable without recurrent strokes for up to nine years post-treatment. These results highlight the therapy's potential to address the underlying cause of the disease.

Despite these scientific successes, bluebird bio’s financial struggles highlight the challenges of commercializing high-cost gene therapies, particularly in a complex reimbursement environment. The decision to go private reflects the difficulties in balancing innovation with financial sustainability. While its shares will soon be removed from public trading, bluebird bio’s contributions to the field of gene therapy remain significant. Its therapies have provided new treatment options for patients with severe genetic conditions, and its ongoing research continues to advance gene therapy science. As the company transitions to private ownership, its focus on delivering innovative treatments to patients will remain central to its mission.
