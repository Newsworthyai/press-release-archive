# Lash Therapy Continues to Grow Internationally

Lash Therapy Australia, the award-winning beauty and wellness brand known for its innovative lash and brow care products, is thrilled to announce its official launch into Costco Canada. This strategic expansion marks a significant milestone for the Australian-based company as it continues to grow its international footprint.

Canadian customers will now be able to find Lash Therapy's bestselling Lash & Brow Serum, included in their Complete Lash Set kit in select Costco Canada locations and online at Costco.ca. The partnership with one of North America’s most trusted retailers signals growing global demand for premium, results-driven beauty solutions that are Cruelty-Free, vegan, and backed by science.

“We’re so excited to bring Lash Therapy to Costco members across Canada,” said co-founder of Lash Therapy Australia, Emma Spiliopoulos. “This expansion reflects our commitment to making high-quality beauty products accessible to more people, and we couldn’t be prouder to be partnering with a retailer that shares our values.”

Lash Therapy has built a loyal following thanks to its dedication to clean, effective formulas that deliver visible results. With millions of units sold and countless 5-star reviews, the brand continues to set new standards in the lash and brow care industry.

“We are thrilled to bring our hero lash serum to the Canadian market through such an iconic retailer like Costco,” said Spiliopoulos. “We created Lash Therapy to solve our own frustrations with harsh beauty products, and now we’re proud to share our clean, effective formulas with customers across the globe.”

The brand’s international momentum was further highlighted by several high-profile activations in the U.S. throughout April, including:

* A NYC based editorial and influencer event sponsored by Global Victoria Australia, showcasing premium Melbourne-born brands.
* Numerous appearances during Coachella's music and influencer events, strengthening its presence among beauty tastemakers and digital creators.
