# CURE ALZHEIMER’S FUND APPOINTS TWO NEW MEMBERS TO ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing research with the highest potential to prevent, slow or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, announced today that Christine Villas-Boas and Brittany Bowlen have been appointed to its Board of Directors.

“We are pleased to welcome two new voices to our Board—Christine and Brittany each bring a unique passion and perspective that will help us better serve our mission to fund research aimed at curing Alzheimer’s disease,” said Henry McCance, Board Chair and Co-Founder of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “This expansion of our board is a meaningful step forward as we continue to grow thoughtfully and stay focused on making a lasting impact on the fight against this devastating disease.”

“Brittany and Christine bring outstanding leadership expertise and a clear passion for our cause,” said Meg Smith, CEO of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “Their diverse experience in strategy and commitment to impactful philanthropy will enhance our efforts to accelerate critical research. We’re excited to welcome their insight and energy to our board.”

Christine Villas-Boas currently serves as President and Treasurer of the Michel and Claire Gudefin Family Foundation, a leading supporter of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. Ms. Villas-Boas, a Connecticut College graduate, began her career at Chase Manhattan Bank in 1974, working in U.S. Corporate Banking and International Capital Markets across New York, Paris, and London. She later consulted in credit and corporate finance training. Ms. Villas-Boas also serves on the board of the Learn2Earn Charitable Foundation based in Naples, Florida. Inspired by personal loss—her mother Claire, who died of Alzheimer’s in 2015, and other family members affected by the disease—Christine and the Michel and Claire Gudefin Family Foundation are deeply committed to supporting Cure Alzheimer’s Fund in its mission to find a cure. She became a Trustee in 2021 and joined the Board of Directors in 2025.

Brittany Bowlen is a seasoned leader in consulting and professional sports, most recently serving as the Senior Vice President of Strategy for the Denver Broncos. In addition to her professional career, Brittany is deeply committed to driving community impact, currently serving as the Vice Chair of the Board of Directors for Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver and as a member of the Board of Visitors for Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. She holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Fuqua and a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) from the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business.
