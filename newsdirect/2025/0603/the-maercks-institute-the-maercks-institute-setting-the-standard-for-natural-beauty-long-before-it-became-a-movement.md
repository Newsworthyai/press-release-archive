# The Maercks Institute: “The Maercks Institute: Setting the Standard for Natural Beauty Long Before It Became a Movement”

In an era where media headlines are flooded with “new” trends like midface support, filler fatigue, and natural rejuvenation, one internationally renowned center stands out not for following the movement—but for leading it long before it became popular. The Maercks Institute, based in Miami and The Hamptons, has been quietly and consistently advancing aesthetic medicine with an unwavering philosophy of natural beauty since its founding by Dr. Rian A. Maercks in 2009.

Aesthetic Facial Balancing: A Vision Ahead of Its Time

While today’s aesthetic world catches up to these ideas, Dr. Maercks’ pioneering principles remain unchanged. Nearly fifteen years ago,Long before terms like "facial balancing" became industry buzzwords,he introduced Aesthetic Facial Balancing™—a revolutionary technique focused on holistic facial harmony rather than isolated volumization. In 2012, he demonstrated this radical approach by injecting 35 milliliters of hyaluronic acid filler into his own face to educate both patients and peers about the principles of balance and subtlety (watch here).

In videos from 2011 to 2018, Dr. Maercks warned about the risks of low cheek filler, superficial interventions, and the illusion of “filler migration,” which he challenged as a misdiagnosis of poor technique. His candid public discussions foreshadowed today’s aesthetic backlash and the growing demand for natural, understated results. In a 2018 news appearance, he predicted the very conversations now dominating the field—about overfilled faces, the limits of injectables, and the return to surgical excellence (watch here). Even earlier, his 2011 mini-documentary offered a deeply thoughtful exploration of facial perception and the psychology of beauty (watch here).

What is truly striking is how consistent Dr. Maercks' voice has remained. Watching these early videos alongside his current content reveals not only the same advanced understanding of anatomy and aesthetics—but also the same calm, thoughtful, and humble tone that resonates with patients and professionals alike. This enduring consistency has created a body of work that has quietly shaped the industry while remaining distinct in its authenticity.

Deep Plane Facelifts: Elevating Standards

Nowhere is this more evident than in Dr. Maercks’ approach to the midface, which he has long emphasized as critical to true rejuvenation. While the term “deep plane facelift” is now ubiquitous, Dr. Maercks has long spoken out against the superficial use of the phrase, warning that many so-called deep plane procedures fail to address the midface properly—a key reason why many patients come to him for revisional surgery. His commitment to midfacial support and deep suspension techniques has earned recognition from his peers, including a recent feature by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons: “The Mid-Facelift Is Taking Facial Aesthetics by Storm”.

Dr. Maercks has also been at the forefront of refining deep plane facelift techniques. His MAERCKS Lift (Musculo-Aponeurotic Elevation and Retention Check Kedge Suspension) addresses the foundational structures of the face, providing support where it's most needed. This method not only yields natural-looking results but also minimizes recovery time, allowing patients to resume social activities shortly after the procedure.

In an era where the term "deep plane facelift" is often misapplied, Dr. Maercks emphasizes the importance of true midface support. He cautions against superficial techniques that fail to address the deeper ligaments and structures, which can lead to unnatural results and the need for revision surgeries.
