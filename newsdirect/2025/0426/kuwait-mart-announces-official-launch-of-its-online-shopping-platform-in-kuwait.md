# Kuwait Mart Announces Official Launch of Its Online Shopping Platform in Kuwait

Kuwait Mart, a new online shopping platform built specifically for customers in Kuwait, has officially launched. The platform currently offers a handpicked range of products from both local and international suppliers, with plans to expand its selection as the platform grows. It is designed to provide a faster, more convenient, and trustworthy online shopping experience.

The launch comes at a time when e-commerce in Kuwait is experiencing steady growth. According to ecommerceDB by Statista, Kuwait is now the 59th largest e-commerce market globally, with revenues expected to reach nearly $2 billion by 2028. With over 90% mobile phone penetration and a young, digitally active population, online shopping continues to expand across the country.

Despite this momentum, key challenges remain—such as limited delivery coverage and a reliance on cash payments. Kuwait Mart addresses these gaps by offering a simple user interface, direct supplier relationships, and prompt, reliable delivery across Kuwait.

The platform was developed entirely in-house using custom scripts, giving Kuwait Mart full control over performance, security, and scalability. This approach allows the team to adapt quickly to market needs and improve the shopping experience over time.

“This launch represents more than just a website going live,” said Fahad Alhumaidi, CTO & Co-Founder of Kuwait Mart. “We built the platform from scratch to offer something tailored to Kuwaiti shoppers—something faster, safer, and smarter than what’s currently out there.”

Kuwait Mart begins with a focused product lineup but is designed to grow, adding new items and features to meet the evolving needs of customers and suppliers alike.
