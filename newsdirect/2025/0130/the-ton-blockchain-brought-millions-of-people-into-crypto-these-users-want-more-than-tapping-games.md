2024 saw Toncoin becoming one of the fastest-growing blockchains in the Layer 1 space, counting more than 100 million active addresses. One of Toncoin’s most attractive aspects is its wildly popular Telegram-based gaming platform, which achieved viral status with titles like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat. However, many speculators still deem Toncoin as underrated, mainly due to its lack of a comprehensive DeFi framework that unlocks its full potential.

This is why the upcoming launch of Elluminex represents a crucial milestone on the Toncoin roadmap. Elluminex (ELX) is a decentralized exchange that aims to provide a complete DeFi experience to the Toncoin ecosystem, while simultaneously tapping into Telegram’s 950-million user base. With this in mind, speculators foresee incredible rallies for Elluminex, and savvy crypto enthusiasts are already rushing to the $ELX presale to secure their position.

Discover Elluminex - Toncoin’s Better Version Of UniswapElluminex emerges as a pioneering force that harnesses the capabilities of the TON network while solving the typical inefficiencies of established DEX platforms. Protocols such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap lack true interoperability between blockchains. This leads to a wide array of issues that compromise the user experience, as sub optimal chain integration dilutes liquidity increasing waiting times and fees.

To solve this, Elluminex introduces an advanced cross-chain bridging mechanism, enabling nearly instantaneous transactions across disconnected blockchains. This allows Elluminex to aggregate liquidity from various sources, which minimizes transaction delays and slippage, ensuring users can capitalize on the latest trends without incurring unforeseen expenses.

Another defining aspect of Elluminex is its focus on self-custody. Traders maintain complete control over their assets, removing reliance on intermediaries and third parties. Additionally, Elluminex does away with KYC verification requirements, enabling users to protect their anonymity.

The Elluminex ecosystem is underpinned by the native $ELX token, which facilitates staking, governance, and other utility functions. Early adopters stand to benefit from staking rewards projected at an impressive 18% APY, incentivizing both initial participation and long-term engagement. But the privileges don’t end here, as holders will have access to an exclusive over-the-counter platform. Users will be able to purchase new TON-based projects before they are released to the public, allowing them to secure an allocation at preferential prices early on.

Toncoin Set For A Major Reversal Amid Technical Updates And This Explosive Telegram AnnouncementToncoin (TON) recently launched the v2024.10 update, introducing critical improvements to network efficiency and security through enhanced data management and reduced transmission rates. Other crucial Toncoin upgrades include faster channel creation, improved Distributed Hash Table (DHT) lookups, and numerous bug fixes.

Technicals aside, Telegram recently broke the Internet by declaring Toncoin the only accepted cryptocurrency within its network. While this is not entirely surprising, as Toncoin has been developed by Telegram, up until now, the messaging app has integrated several different cryptocurrencies. The exclusivity agreement means that Toncoin will be the only protocol for linking Telegram Mini Apps to blockchain wallets, effectively restricting other blockchain networks from integration. This move comes as the TON Foundation prepares for "explosive growth in 2025," leveraging Telegram's massive global user base and positioning Toncoin as the primary cryptocurrency for the platform's services.

Notcoin Set To Benefit From The Bullish Toncoin NewsDespite being one of the most popular TON-based games on Telegram, Notcoin (NOT) has been struggling during the bearish start of 2025. Notcoin has nosedived from its June 2024 all-time high of $0.029 to $0.0051, representing an 80% breakdown in value. Notcoin’s persistent downward trajectory highlights significant market skepticism about its future potential, while short positions are piling up in the order books.

Trading with a 5% daily loss, Notcoin continues to struggle, as speculators expect a breach of the current support level in the upcoming days. However, the picture is not entirely bearish for Notcoin. The recent Toncoin developments and the incoming resurgence of the crypto gaming narrative could allow Notcoin to regain ground in the upcoming months.

Join The $ELX Presale Before The Next SurgeIn just a few days, the Elluminex presale has raised over $300,000 as demand is rising rapidly. At the time of writing, $ELX tokens are selling at a discounted price of just $0.06, marking the perfect entry point for early adopters. With the $ELX valuation expected to experience massive price multipliers as the cycle progresses, there has never been a better time to look into this new gem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)
