Dogwifhat (WIF) continues to struggle as most of its 2024 gains were wiped out over the past few weeks. Investors appear to be growingly disillusioned with meme coins as it’s now becoming clearer that 99% of the recent entries are purely driven by hype and once the market hops onto the next trend, they quickly become irrelevant.

While this is true for most memes, outliers that bring real use cases tend to thrive in the long run, as Shiba Inu and Bonk have demonstrated. This is why newcomer Cutoshi (CUTO) is rapidly gaining traction, as its meme energy is backed by a vast DeFi ecosystem that could soon see it rival established protocols like Uniswap and PancakeSwap.

Dogwifhat Rebounds, But Momentum Has Waned QuicklyAt the time of writing, Dogwifhat (WIF) trades at $1.14 with little to no movement in terms of 24-hour price action. Zooming out, things are looking quite bearish for Dogwifhat, as over the last month alone more than 38% of its value has evaporated. After experiencing a sharp rejection at $4.18 in November, Dogwifhat has been in a free fall, with its price spiraling downward and threatening a close below the critical $1 support.

While this type of extreme swings is not something out of the ordinary for meme coins, the market-wide uncertainty further exacerbates Dogwifhat’s problem. Currently, Dogwifhat finds itself in a do-or-die situation, and bulls must hold this level at all costs or further breakdowns could follow. Analyst Val Me shares a similar opinion, as she posted a chart reading on X drawing attention to Dogwifhat’s critical price zones, with a dive toward the $0.32-$0.36 territory to be considered a realistic scenario.

How Cutoshi Raises The Bar For Meme CoinsCutoshi draws inspiration from the Lucky Cats of Japanese traditions, which are displayed in stores and homes as tokens of good fortune. Cutoshi, is quite literally a token of good fortune, as it’s designed to reward users that engage with its vast ecosystem via the Cutoshi Farming initiative.

Cutoshi’s flagship feature is CUTO DEX, a decentralized exchange that connects isolated blockchains. This will allow for seamless cross-chain swaps at near-instantaneous speed and with fees as low as 0.25%. Users will have access to an exclusive DeFi wallet for optimal asset management, and no KYC will be required to join, ensuring that their personal data remains inaccessible to third parties.

Through the Cutoshi Farming model, investors will have the opportunity to earn income while completing fun missions and quests or by staking the $CUTO token. Over 3,700 participants have farmed more than 2.1 million $CUTO tokens.

Stage 4 of the presale is 70% complete and with $CUTO selling for just $0.031, this is the perfect entry point for investors to capitalize on the utility-driven meme coin revolution. When taking into account Cutoshi’s much smaller market cap compared to the likes of Bonk and other memes, Cutoshi is set to bring disproportionately higher returns once the bull run is in full swing. Don’t miss out!
