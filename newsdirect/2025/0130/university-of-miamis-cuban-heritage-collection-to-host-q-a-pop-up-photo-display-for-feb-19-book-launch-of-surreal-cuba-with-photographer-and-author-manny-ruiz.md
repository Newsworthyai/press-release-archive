The University of Miami Libraries Cuban Heritage Collection is hosting a Q&A and pop-up photo display for the book launch of “Surreal Cuba” with photographer, author, and noted media entrepreneur Manny Ruiz on February 19 (RSVP here). The event will take place at the Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion of Otto G. Richter Library 1300 Memorial Drive Coral Gables, FL 33146.

Ruiz’s groundbreaking photo book, which features interactive QR codes that link to the riveting backstories behind the images, captures the haunting essence of life during Revolutionary Cuba’s “Special Period” (1993–1994). Ruiz was just 23 years old when he embarked on the award-winning documentary photography project, which is partially archived in the collections of the University of Miami Libraries, and which last year inspired the globally acclaimed Bistec podcast series.

During the Q & A mixer, Ruiz will share the fascinating stories behind some of his most iconic photographs, reflect on the creative process that spanned decades, and discuss the legacy “Surreal Cuba” holds for the island and the diaspora.

Visit the Cuban Heritage Collection on Feb. 19 for the opportunity to meet the artist, explore his evocative photography, and engage in a conversation about art, history, and exile. Light refreshments will be served.

Event highlights:

* Photography display: View selections from “Surreal Cuba”
* Book launch: Explore the interactive publication firsthand
* Q & A with Manny Ruiz: Gain insights into the photos, stories, and inspiration behind the project
* Networking mixer: Connect with fellow art and history enthusiasts
