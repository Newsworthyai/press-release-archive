# Former ESPN NBA Insider Adrian Wojnarowski Joins Players Health’s NIL Advisory Board, Begins Brand Ambassadorship

Players Health, the leading provider of athlete safety and insurance solutions, today announced the appointment of St. Bonaventure men’s basketball general manager and former ESPN NBA Insider Adrian “Woj” Wojnarowski to its NIL Advisory Board and as a brand ambassador. The partnership formally began on Friday, April 4, when Woj appeared on behalf of Players Health at the NCAA Men’s Final Four in San Antonio, Texas.

Widely regarded as one of the most respected names in sports media, Woj joins the Players Health NIL Advisory Board after retiring from his award-winning role at ESPN, where he spent years breaking NBA news and guiding coverage across the network’s platforms. Now, as the general manager for St. Bonaventure men’s basketball, he oversees a broad range of responsibilities, including name, image, and likeness opportunities, transfer portal management, and alumni relations.

“St. Bonaventure has given me opportunity to utilize three decades of relationships to create the greatest possible impact on the next generation of athletes,” said Wojnarowski. “Joining Players Health allows me to widen that circle even further, especially now, when NIL has opened remarkable doors. We want to ensure that while these athletes seize their opportunities, they do so with the safety and support they deserve.”

Wojnarowski will join fellow industry leaders on the Players Health NIL Board of Advisors to drive strategic initiatives, engage in educational panels, and advance the Players Health mission at industry events.

“Woj revolutionized sports journalism with his approach to reporting and relationships, and now he is bringing that same forward-thinking mindset to our team as one of the first GMs in college athletics,” said Tyrre Burks, Founder & CEO of Players Health. “NIL has fundamentally transformed the collegiate landscape, and there is no one better equipped to help us navigate this new era. His insights will be invaluable to our success as we work to develop solutions that keep athletes safe, supported, and empowered at every stage of their athletic career.”

Players Health and Wojnarowski traveled to San Antonio for the NCAA Men’s Final Four, where Wojnarowski took part in a panel discussion on the evolution of the general manager role in collegiate athletics. The panel was held on Friday, April 4 at the Boggess Center during the Global NIL Conference hosted by Silver Waves Media.

The announcement comes just three months after Players Health closed a $60 million Series C funding round to accelerate the expansion of their innovative athlete safety and insurance solutions across youth, recreational, collegiate, and professional sports.
