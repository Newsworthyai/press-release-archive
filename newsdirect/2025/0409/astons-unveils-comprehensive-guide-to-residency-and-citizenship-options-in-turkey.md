# Astons Unveils Comprehensive Guide to Residency and Citizenship Options in Turkey

Astons, a leading global immigration and investment advisory firm, is shedding light on the various residency opportunities available in Turkey—one of the most strategically located and culturally rich countries bridging Europe and Asia.

With increasing interest from international clients seeking second residency or citizenship options, Astons highlights Turkey’s two primary legal pathways: the Turkey residence permit system and the Turkey Golden Visa program, also known as Citizenship by Investment.

“Turkey is rapidly becoming a top destination for investors, retirees, digital nomads, and global citizens seeking both lifestyle and mobility,” said Alena Lesina, spokesperson for Astons. “We are proud to guide our clients through each step, whether they are pursuing temporary residence or Turkish citizenship through strategic investments.”

Flexible Residency or Full Citizenship—Astons Helps You Choose the Right Path

The Turkish Residence Permit System offers short-term, long-term, family, and student permits, ideal for those working, studying, or joining family members. These options provide flexibility and affordability for foreigners seeking to stay legally in the country.

The Turkey Golden Visa Program, meanwhile, offers a direct route to citizenship for investors. By purchasing real estate valued at $400,000 or investing $500,000 in banks or bonds, clients can obtain a Turkish passport within 3 to 6 months—one of the fastest citizenship-by-investment timelines globally.
