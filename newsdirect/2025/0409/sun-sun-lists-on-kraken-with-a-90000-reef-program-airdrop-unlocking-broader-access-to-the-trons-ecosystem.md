Kraken, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has officially listed SUN (SUN), a core governance token of SUN.io. The SUN.io platform integrates such functions as token swaps, liquidity mining, stablecoin swaps and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the TRON public chain, focusing on building TRON’s DeFi ecosystem with decentralized exchanges (DEX) at its core. The new listing introduces two major trading pairs, SUN/USD and SUN/EUR, making SUN available to a wider market. In conjunction with this listing, an airdrop Reef Program offering $90,000 worth of SUN tokens launched at the same time.

Launched in 2020, SUN.io has grown into a cornerstone of the TRON ecosystem. As of April 2025, the SUN token has reached over $649 million in total value locked (TVL). As the first platform on TRON to combine stablecoin swaps, token mining, governance, and trading, SUN.io stands as the network’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX).

The platform has driven significant innovation, including the launch of SunSwap for efficient token swaps and the introduction of SunPump in 2024, which became a major hub for meme coin projects on TRON.

Sun.io has grown significantly, reaching several milestones:

* August 2024: SunPump launched as TRON’s first fair-launch platform for meme coin issuance and trading. Since its debut, it has supported over 96,000 projects and generated more than $3.73 billion in transaction volume.
* SunPump’s unique bonding curve mechanism has drawn significant attention, attracting over 430,000 followers on X. It has generated 15 million new transactions and brought in 550,000 new wallet addresses to the TRON ecosystem—reaching a peak daily transaction volume of $350 million.
* 2025: SunPump introduced SunGenX, an AI-powered tool designed to simplify token creation through chatbot interactions.

The addition of SUN (SUN) on Kraken marks a pivotal step in its global growth, pushing its exposure across major markets in North America and Europe. With SUN/USD and SUN/EUR trading pairs now available, SUN (SUN) extends its reach into major fiat markets.

Kraken, known for its robust security measures and high compliance standards, offers the perfect platform for SUN to strengthen its credibility, particularly in stablecoin trading and meme coin issuance. The listing not only enhances the security of funds on SunSwap but also elevates the global appeal of the SunPump initiative, accelerating the international growth of the TRON ecosystem. Additionally, with the Reef Program airdrop of $90,000 worth of SUN tokens happening simultaneously, fueling SUN(SUN) to tap into a wider audience.

SUN officially launched on Kraken on April 8, 2025, joining other TRON ecosystem tokens such as APENFT, JST, WIN, and STEEM. The listing reflects growing market interest and further strengthens TRON’s presence on leading global exchanges.
