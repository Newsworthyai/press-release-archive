# Shiba Inu's Path to $0.01: Exploring Emerging Meme Coins with High Growth Potential

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/767626260/2fPauOSA.jpeg)

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is losing its cool as a OG meme coin in the last month. On-chain data reveals a major drop in new user adoption, trading volumes and overall transaction volume, all indicative of decreasing trader confidence. In contrast, new meme coins like Cutoshi (CUTO) are predicted to outperform Shiba Inu, in growth, in 2025.

Shiba Inu’s Struggle with GrowthOn-chain data shows a sharp drop in new address formations itself, a strong indicator of network growth and overall trader interest. A detailed analysis shows that new users stopped following the price uptrend, making the spike on the chart visible with the steepest decrease of SHIB being in new addresses at the peak in late 2021. This indicates that retail fervor, which was a major factor in driving SHIBs spectacular ascent, has diminished considerably.

The decline in SHIB’s price from it's all time high (ATH) adds to this struggle. SHIB still stalks over 80% lower than its ATH, with little in the way of recovery, according to data. Its repeated selloffs have been accompanied by only intermittent rallies, often which have seen local rejection at psychological price points.

However, the most significant worry for SHIB holders remains the growing depletion of Shibarium transactions, which has now plummeted by 99%, signalling waning community engagement. The Layer-2 scaling solution was created to improve transaction speeds and lower gas fees but adoption has been tepid. That was until ShibaSwap launched, which promises to enhance usability as well as liquidity.

ShibaSwap: A Potential Bullish Catalyst for SHIB?Despite having a long way to go, ShibaSwap could prove to be a bullish catalyst for SHIB — if it can add more DeFi functionalities and draw liquidity providers.

SHIB could recover some of the momentum it has lost with deeper DeFi integrations, and possible exchange listings. According to data from CoinMarketCap, SHIB's 24-hour trading volume at the moment stands at $139 million (a 37% decline). This decreasing volume indicates lower trader interest and lower price action. A meme coin needs continuous trading activity to keep its hype cycle going, and SHIB’s declining volume indicates that traders are shifting toward other speculative assets with better upside potential.

Further, the declining transaction number indicates that the highly promoted Shibarium didn’t make a lasting impact, leading many to now question whether it can deliver on its promise to reach $0.01 mark.

Beyond Luck—Cutoshi Rewards Participation!For buyers wanting a newer option, Cutoshi can be a great choice. Cutoshi combines the appeal of meme coins with the niche appeal of a well-calculated DeFi ecosystem. Taking inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat and the ethos of Satoshi Nakamoto in creating a decentralized financial ecosystem, Cutoshi deviates from other tokens by presenting real utility to investors.

Cutoshi can currently be bought through a presale, with a total supply of 440,000,000 tokens (ERC-20). Currently in stage 5/6 with each token priced at $0.0487.

Many KOLs are also calling the meme coin “Next Shiba Inu Rival”. Cutoshi’s NFT collection consisting of 8,000 pieces provides exclusive rewards, staking benefits and access to unique features of the ecosystem. That means holders are not only receiving art, they’re receiving tangible benefits that can enhance their involvement and earnings. This initiative guarantees rewards for participation rather than speculation by distributing these NFTs to early adopters and active members of the community.

With Cutoshi's gamified DeFi model, Cutoshi Quests, engagement transcends simple investment and becomes an interactive experience. Cutopoints (points awarded by completing quests) can be exchanged for rewards on the Cutoshi platform. Instead of just holding tokens, users will actively earn and magnify their holdings, making DeFi enjoyable yet productive!

The multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) enables users to make cross-chain transactions without limitations. An on-chain transaction fee of 0.25% fuels the ecosystem with 80% of revenues going towards rewarding liquidity providers and 20% going towards buybacks and burns, a win-win that helps sustain token value while also benefiting those who engage for the long-haul.
