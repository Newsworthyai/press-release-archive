# The Rager Foundation Expands Scholarship Program to Support Eagle Scouts in Higher Education

The Rager Foundation, a Wilmington-based nonprofit dedicated to educational advancement, has announced the expansion of its scholarship program to assist Eagle Scouts in pursuing higher education. As tuition costs continue to rise, the foundation aims to provide financial relief to these distinguished individuals, reinforcing its commitment to fostering leadership and academic excellence.

With a mission to strengthen educational opportunities and technological progress in Delaware, The Rager Foundation has played a pivotal role in community development. By extending financial support to Eagle Scouts, the foundation acknowledges their dedication, resilience, and contributions to society, ensuring that young leaders have the resources needed to succeed in higher education.

Jason Rager, the founder and board member of The Rager Foundation, achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in January 2003. Reflecting on his journey, Rager emphasized the significance of this milestone, stating, “Becoming an Eagle Scout shaped my leadership skills and sense of responsibility. Higher education is increasingly expensive, and through this scholarship program, we aim to assist Eagle Scouts in overcoming financial obstacles on their academic paths.”

Attaining the rank of Eagle Scout requires extensive leadership, perseverance, and commitment to community service. Candidates complete rigorous projects while balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and often employment. These experiences cultivate crucial life skills such as time management, problem-solving, and resilience—qualities that contribute to success in both higher education and professional careers. Mr. Rager went on to form Rager Capital Partners and now manages a family office.

The escalating costs of college tuition, which can range from $20,000 to $70,000 annually, pose a significant financial challenge for many students and their families. The Rager Foundation's expanded scholarship program seeks to bridge this gap by supporting Eagle Scouts who have demonstrated academic excellence, leadership, and community involvement, ensuring they have the financial assistance needed to achieve their educational goals.

Eligible Eagle Scouts are invited to apply for the scholarship, which is open to undergraduate and graduate students with a strong record of leadership and service. Applications can be submitted through The Rager Foundation’s official website at https://ragerfoundation.org/, where detailed eligibility criteria and application forms are available. The foundation encourages all qualified candidates to take advantage of this opportunity to advance their education and career aspirations.

Established to support educational initiatives and technological growth, The Rager Foundation remains committed to empowering individuals and families throughout Delaware. Through strategic fundraising and community partnerships, the foundation has successfully supported numerous organizations and initiatives that contribute to regional development, reinforcing its dedication to creating a brighter future through education.
