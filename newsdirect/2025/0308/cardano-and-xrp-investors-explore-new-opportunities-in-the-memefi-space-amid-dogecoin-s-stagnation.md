# Cardano and XRP Investors Explore New Opportunities in the MemeFi Space Amid Dogecoin's Stagnation

While regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP appears to be easing, and Cardano is showing signs of recovery, Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing bearish pressure, leading traders to look for the next big opportunity.

Meanwhile, Cutoshi ($CUTO), an emerging MemeFi project, is gaining momentum with its community-focused ecosystem and presale movement, setting itself apart from traditional meme coins.

Regulatory Shifts and XRP’s Changing LandscapeThe SEC is dealing with some internal shake-ups, which could mean it will soften its crypto enforcement.

Former enforcement head John Reed Stark recently declared that they might drop the Ripple appeal, hinting at a change in how they view digital assets.

Meanwhile, XRP has been consolidating below the key $3 resistance level. It started last week at $2.75, then faced a lot of selling.

Traders say if it can break past $3, it might climb to between $4.30 and $6.40. But if it can't, it could drop back down to $1.90 or $2.

Cardano’s Market Struggles and Signs of RecoveryCardano (ADA) has been experiencing market volatility, recently achieving a near 4% recovery despite negative sentiment stemming from the Bybit exchange theft.

Technical signs point to potential growth, with patterns like a cup-and-handle forming. However, its future direction remains uncertain.

However, ADA remains at a crucial juncture. If the token fails to hold the $0.74 level, analysts predict a sharp drop to $0.65.

At the same time, if it surpasses $0.78, a surge toward $0.85 could follow. With ADA still trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), trend strength remains weak, making MemeFi an attractive sector for ADA investors seeking higher returns.

Dogecoin’s Stagnation: The Death Cross LoomsOnce the undisputed leader of memecoins, Dogecoin is showing signs of stagnation. Despite active addresses increasing by 34%, price action has remained lackluster, currently trading 66% below its all-time high of $0.73.

Technical traders warn that Dogecoin is nearing a “death cross”, where the 23-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average—a classic bearish signal. If this materializes, DOGE could fall to $0.18, representing a 26% decline.

The worst-case scenario would see DOGE revisiting pre-November 2023 levels at $0.13, marking a 72% decline from recent peaks.

How Cutoshi Prioritizes Community Ownership with Long-Term ViabilityCutoshi, the Ethereum based utility memecoin that is set to rival other trending memecoins such as Dogwifhat and Bonk, and may turn out to be the next memefi coin set for 100x growth.

At the heart of Cutoshi’s ecosystem is its upcoming multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX), which will enable users to trade assets across different blockchains securely and privately—without the need to connect their wallets.

Cutoshi also plans to increase user participation through Cutoshi Quests and Farming, a gamified yield farming program designed to encourage engagement and reward users. Participants can complete missions, unlock various in-game achievements, and earn "Cutopoints," which can be in turn redeemed for various ecosystem benefits.

Investors will also have an option to invest into Cutoshi’s staking programs, which can earn them passive income while actively contributing to the $CUTO ecosystem’s liquidity. Cutoshi is also launching a collection of 8,000 exclusive NFTs to reward active community members and early adopters.

These features provide opportunities for long-term wealth accumulation, making Cutoshi more than just a speculative asset.

Cutoshi’s presale has gained remarkable traction, signaling strong trader confidence. The presale has gone through multiple stages, with the token price surging from an initial $0.015 to $0.0487 in Stage 5, marking a significant increase, with over $2.1 million invested in total.
