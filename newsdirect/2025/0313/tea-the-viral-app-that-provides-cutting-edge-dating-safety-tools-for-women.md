# Tea: The Viral App That Provides Cutting-Edge Dating Safety Tools For Women

As the popularity of online dating continues to increase, so do the risks. With millions of women navigating dating apps daily, safety should be a non-negotiable priority—yet traditional platforms continue to leave users vulnerable to major safety risks. Tea is addressing these problems head-on.

Tea is not a dating app. It's a dating safety platform built exclusively to protect and empower women, equipping them with cutting-edge tools to vet potential dates, verify identities, and make informed choices before ever meeting "their match" in person. Or, on the contrary, do a background check on the guy they just met at the bar in real-time.

Founder Sean Cook launched Tea after witnessing his mother get catfished online by scammers and criminals alike, exposing the glaring safety gaps in modern dating platforms. Determined to disrupt an industry prioritizing swipes over security, Cook created Tea—a dating safety app for women powered by AI-driven safety technology and real-time identity verification tools.

A 2019 ProPublica report conducted with Columbia Journalism Investigations, revealed that over a third of the 1,200 women surveyed had been sexually assaulted by someone they met on a dating app. In 2023, Time Magazine referenced this report, noting that while some platforms require background checks, experts caution that the widespread underreporting of sexual assaults means these measures alone cannot guarantee safety. Tea is tackling this issue head-on, redefining dating safety by giving women control and a powerful community to lean on.

"With millions of women facing online dating risks daily, I knew there had to be a better way," said Sean Cook, Founder of Tea. "Tea was built to provide women with an easy way to vet potential dates without fear instantly. Dating should be exciting, not dangerous-and we're here to revolutionize online dating safety for women."

How Tea is Revolutionizing Dating Safety

Unlike dating apps, the purpose of Tea is to verify the identity of people on match-making apps.

Tea is transforming the way women navigate modern dating, offering a simple yet powerful way to prioritize safety before meeting someone new. Users appreciate the ability to discreetly inquire about past experiences so they can gain peace of mind and make more informed decisions. With its user-friendly design and commitment to transparency, Tea is empowering women to look out for one another like never before.

"Tea isn't just an app; it's a movement. With the power of real-time safety tools and a community of women supporting each other, we're giving women the confidence and security they deserve," said Daniella Szetela, Tea's Chief Female Officer and the viral influencer behind @Daniella.Your.BFF, her social media community with over 500,000 women across her social platforms.
