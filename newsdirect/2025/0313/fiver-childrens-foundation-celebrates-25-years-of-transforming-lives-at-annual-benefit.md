# Fiver Children’s Foundation Celebrates 25 Years of Transforming Lives at Annual Benefit

The Fiver Children’s Foundation is thrilled to announce its 25th Anniversary Benefit, a milestone celebration honoring a quarter-century of empowering youths across New York. This year’s event will bring together supporters, alumni, and community leaders to celebrate Fiver’s transformative ten-year commitment to youth development and raise critical funds for its year-round and summer programs.

Fiver’s unique model provides children with a decade-long journey of mentorship, educational support, leadership development, and the unforgettable experience of Camp Fiver. Through this long-term engagement, Fiver equips young people with the tools to make ethical and healthy life choices, graduate high school and college, and become engaged, impactful citizens.

This year, Fiver is proud to recognize the exceptional contributions of distinguished honorees with the Richard Adams Leadership Award:

* Eric and Kyuri Weng
* Erika Weinberg on behalf of Latham & Watkins LLP
* Fiver’s Emeritus Board of Directors

Additionally, the Thomas and Heather Tucker Visionary Award will be presented to Fiver alumnus and Board Member Jonathan Jean-Pierre, celebrating his extraordinary achievements and dedication to Fiver’s mission.

“The 25th Anniversary Benefit is not only a celebration of our past achievements but also a powerful reminder of the thousands of lives transformed by Fiver’s commitment to youth development,” said Executive Director Christie Ko. “With the continued support of our community, we are excited to expand our reach and deepen our impact for the next generation of Fiver leaders.”

The benefit will take place on June 3rd at 583 Park Avenue, offering an evening of inspiration, recognition, and philanthropy. All proceeds will directly support Fiver’s programs, ensuring that young people continue to receive the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
