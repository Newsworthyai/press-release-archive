“Over the past few years, we’ve seen population growth in the North Dallas area, with Plano being one of the fastest growing regions,” said David Harrington, CEO of CNS. “We are increasing our footprint in Texas to meet the high demand for our facilities and individualized services to bring high-quality post-acute care to not only North Texas but also neighboring states like Oklahoma.”

Patient-centered approach to treating brain injury

CNS, highly regarded for its expertise in brain injury and stroke treatment as well as its experienced staff. Three of CNS’ clinics, including one in Irving, recently received accreditation by the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence for demonstrating its commitment to the standards of excellence for applied behavior analysis services. As CNS’ fifth Texas location, the Plano clinic will deepen the post-acute care provider’s commitment to the Dallas Healthcare community and the state.

CNS’ Plano location’s many advanced-care features include:

* Programs for vision, neurobehavior, cognitive retraining, speech, physical and occupational therapy provided by highly trained and certified clinical therapy staff
* The ZeroG® Gait and Balance System

Brain injury and its devastating and costly effects

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by blunt, traumatic forces to the brain. Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) is a non-traumatic brain injury or disease such as stroke, encephalitis or other infectious diseases, anoxic/hypoxic injury (lack of oxygen to the brain), aneurysms, seizure disorders, surgical procedures and toxic exposure. According to the Brain Injury Association of America, 2.9 million Americans visit the emergency department due to a TBI every year.

According to the Texas Brain Injury Alliance:

* 144,000 Texans sustain a TBI each year — one every 4 minutes
* More than 381,000 Texans live with a disability due to a TBI — 2% of the population
* More than 5,700 Texas residents are permanently disabled by TBI each year

Convenient Location

CNS’ new clinic offers space to accommodate a broader population of inpatient, outpatient, day treatment and residential post-acute brain injury patients. It is adjacent to the Dallas North Tollway and located minutes from area airports and hotels.
