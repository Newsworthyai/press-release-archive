# NAVEX launches AI training to educate organisations on the EU AI Act and stay safe in the workplace

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, announces its Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Work training to educate EU employees on AI risks and best practices. With the implementation of the EU AI Act, employees need to understand both the possibilities and limitations of AI to help organisations remain protected and compliant.

Available now, this localised course introduces learners to critical AI basics, including its capabilities and variations. They will also find out about risks and best practices, how the European Union regulates its use for deployers of high-risk systems, and the obligations imposed upon companies using AI.

The training is designed to help organisations stay ahead of both the benefits and risks presented by the fast-moving developments in AI. It covers:

1. Risks and best practices for using AI in the workplace
2. Ethical considerations when using AI, including fairness, discrimination, transparency, and accountability
3. General guidelines on data privacy, security, and compliance
4. Organisation’s responsibilities under the EU AI Act as deployers of high-risk AI systems
5. A foundational understanding of what AI is, how it works, and its various applications
6. An overview of machine learning, natural language processing, and automation tools
7. AI tools employees may encounter at work and common use cases like automating workflows and analysing data

“As AI tools become more integrated into everyday processes, an organisation’s commitment to doing business the right way becomes more important than ever. While AI’s role in the workplace can bring tremendous opportunity, it can also pose tremendous risk,” said Jen Farthing, General Manager of Training Content at NAVEX. “As a result, training on proper AI use is critical to ensuring employees understand how to use these tools responsibly, efficiently, and ethically.”

Training helps mitigate risks, ensures compliance with data privacy laws, and explains ways to avoid potential biases that may result from the use of AI. It also empowers employees to leverage AI to boost productivity, creativity, and decision-making while avoiding pitfalls like over-reliance on automated systems.

NAVEX also offers an Artificial Intelligence Basics version of the course for employees outside of the European Union. See here for details.
