# IotaComm® Sponsors Healthy Green Schools &amp; Colleges Program to Advance Healthier, Smarter School Environments Nationwide

IotaComm, Inc. ("IotaComm"), a next-generation wireless communications and Internet of Things (IoT) solution provider, is proud to announce its official sponsorship of the Healthy Green Schools & Colleges (HGSC) program. As a sponsor, IotaComm is supporting the nationwide effort to transform K–12 and higher education facilities into cleaner, safer, and more sustainable environments for students and staff—no matter the zip code.

HGSC, a program of the Healthy Schools Campaign, is designed to help school facility professionals identify low- and no-cost strategies to improve indoor air quality (IAQ), sustainability, and operational efficiency. Developed in collaboration with school facilities experts, the program equips institutions with the tools to address workforce development, resource constraints, and long-standing environmental health disparities, especially in historically underfunded communities.

“This partnership isn’t just about measuring air quality—it’s about making it meaningful,” said Charlie Thiel, Chief Revenue Officer at IotaComm. “Where others offer a snapshot, we provide the full movie. Our Delphi360™ platform collects and transforms data into operational intelligence that district leaders can use to help their schools not just meet standards, but strategically improve environments where students learn and teachers work.”

IotaComm’s Delphi360™ platform uses secure connectivity and battery-powered LoRaWAN® sensors to collect key IAQ parameters—including carbon dioxide (CO₂), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), temperature, humidity, and VOCs—every 30 minutes. This data is then transformed into actionable insights that empower district leaders, superintendents, and facility teams to make smarter, evidence-based decisions. These insights are especially valuable in helping schools meet HGSC certification requirements, such as CO₂ monitoring across 100% of occupied spaces.

“The highest value of IAQ data is in trend analysis—not just static readings,” Thiel added. “Delphi360 helps districts identify issues before they escalate and demonstrates measurable improvements that strengthen transparency with their communities.”

A Data-Driven Path to Healthier Schools HGSC’s three-step improvement model—Assess, Commit, Improve—guides institutions at every stage of their sustainability journey:

* Assess: Schools complete a free online self-assessment to evaluate their current performance and score themselves against the HGSC standard.
* Commit: Schools officially join the program and gain access to training, peer support, and best-practice guidebooks.
* Improve: Schools implement changes at their own pace, with expert guidance to address root causes, track progress, and eventually achieve certification status.

“Unhealthy indoor air, poor ventilation, and harmful chemicals from outdated maintenance practices put students and educators at risk and impact learning outcomes,” said Sara Porter, Program Director of Healthy Green Schools & Colleges and Vice President of External Affairs at Healthy Schools Campaign.

“These challenges are most acute in schools serving low-income communities and students of color. HGSC is designed to remove systemic barriers and create healthier learning environments for all.”

“IotaComm’s data-driven approach enhances our program by turning indoor air quality goals into everyday operational improvements,” Porter added.

“It’s this kind of practical innovation that helps schools move from intention to impact.”

Supporting a Mission of Equity, Transparency, and Impact For IotaComm, this sponsorship represents a natural extension of its mission to deliver scalable, sustainable technology that bridges the gap between data, equity, and action in public infrastructure. We are not just supporting an initiative – we’re helping redefine what it means to create safe, equitable learning environments in the 21st century. The partnership also aligns with IotaComm’s active crowdfunding campaign, which invites everyday investors to fuel the company’s growth and mission of making smart, healthy infrastructure accessible to every community.
