# This $13M Biotech Has $40M in Pentagon Funding – Here’s Why BiomX Could Be Biotech’s Best-Kept Secret

With 3X Its Market Cap in Military Grants and Analyst Targets of $15-16, This Military-Backed Phage Therapy Pioneer Trades at Just $0.48 (NYSE: PHGE)*, all while their competitor (NYSE: ARMP) trades at over 6X‎‎ ![‎](https://public.newsdirect.com/615232105/CRcbtP99.png)

BiomX Inc. (NYSE: PHGE)* presents an unusual situation in biotech: a company trading at just below a $13 million market cap that has secured $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency. This Pentagon backing, administered through the Naval Medical Research Command, has enabled the company to advance its bacteriophage therapies without the typical shareholder dilution that plagues early-stage biotechs.

The military’s interest centers on antibiotic-resistant infections emerging from conflict zones. According to BiomX CEO Jonathan Solomon, medical personnel are “seeing soldiers coming out of the Ukraine war with extremely antibiotic-resistant infections.” This real-world crisis has elevated phage therapy, using viruses that naturally kill bacteria, from scientific curiosity to strategic priority.

‎

The Numbers Behind the StoryBiomX’s recent Phase 2 DANCE trial results help explain the military’s confidence. The study of 41 patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis showed:

* Statistically significant reduction in ulcer size by week 12 (p=0.046)
* Greater than 40% difference in healing between treatment and placebo groups by week 10
* Significant improvement in ulcer depth at week 13 (p=0.048)
* Significant reduction in ulcer area expansion (p=0.017)
* No serious adverse events

These results matter because diabetic foot infections lead to approximately 160,000 amputations annually in the U.S., creating an $8 billion healthcare burden. The same Staphylococcus aureus bacteria causing these civilian amputations also complicates combat wound care, making BX211 a dual-use technology.

‎

Beyond Military ApplicationsWhile defense funding validates the technology, BiomX’s commercial opportunity spans multiple indications. The company’s BX004 program for cystic fibrosis demonstrated that 14.3% of patients (3 out of 21) completely cleared chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections after 10 days of treatment, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One patient had carried the infection for 35 years before achieving clearance.

BiomX estimates addressable markets of $2.5 billion globally for diabetic foot infections and $1.6 billion for cystic fibrosis. The FDA has already granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations to BX004, potentially accelerating the regulatory pathway.

‎

The Market Disconnect & OpportunityCurrent analyst coverage reveals a striking valuation gap. H.C. Wainwright maintains a Buy rating with a $15 price target, while Laidlaw & Company also rates the stock Buy with a $16 target. From recent trading levels around $0.52, these targets represent potential upside of approximately 2,800-2,900%.

Laidlaw analyst Yale Jen called the BX211 Phase 2 results “an absolutely positive surprise,” characterizing the asset as “high value and clinically de-risked.” H.C. Wainwright’s assessment emphasizes the program’s advancement toward “important regulatory discussions” with the FDA.

The disconnect becomes even more apparent when compared to peers. Armata Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: ARMP), the only other publicly-traded pure-play phage therapy company, trades at approximately $70 million, more than 5X BiomX’s valuation despite having just one clinical program compared to BiomX’s two Phase 2 assets and $40 million in military backing.

‎

Understanding the OpportunitySeveral factors contribute to BiomX's current valuation disconnect:

* Non-dilutive funding advantage: The $40 million military grant has funded clinical development without issuing new shares, preserving value for existing shareholders.
* Limited competition: No new drugs have been approved specifically for diabetic foot osteomyelitis in over 20 years, giving BiomX potential first-mover advantage in a massive unmet need.
* Impressive platform validation: Success in two separate indications (DFO and cystic fibrosis) demonstrates the broader applicability of the phage platform.
* Near-term catalysts: Phase 2b results for BX004 expected in Q1 2026, FDA meetings for BX211 Phase 2/3 design, and potential additional military funding or partnerships.

‎

The Broader ContextBiomX operates within converging megatrends. The Biden administration has proposed $88.2 billion for biodefense over five years, while organizations like DARPA and ARPA-H are investing hundreds of millions in next-generation antimicrobials. NATO has formed a task force specifically to reintroduce phage therapy in military medicine.

The company’s ability to address both military and civilian needs positions it uniquely as governments worldwide recognize antimicrobial resistance as a national security threat. With China producing 80-90% of antibiotic raw materials, supply chain vulnerabilities add urgency to developing alternative therapies.

‎

Looking AheadBiomX’s story combines validated science, government backing, and massive market opportunities with a market cap that appears disconnected from fundamental value. The $40 million in Pentagon funding alone exceeds the company’s current market valuation by 3X, while clinical success and analyst targets suggest significant upside potential.

As the company advances toward Phase 2/3 trials for BX211 and awaits Phase 2b results for BX004, the convergence of military necessity and civilian healthcare needs could transform this overlooked biotech into a key player in humanity’s fight against antibiotic-resistant infections.
