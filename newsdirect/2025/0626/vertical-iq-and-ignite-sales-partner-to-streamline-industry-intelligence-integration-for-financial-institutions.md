# Vertical IQ and Ignite Sales Partner to Streamline Industry Intelligence Integration for Financial Institutions

Industry Intelligence leader Vertical IQ and award-winning bank sales engagement platform Ignite Sales, Inc., recently formed a partnership that enables Vertical IQ content to be dynamically applied within the Ignite Sales Engagement Platform to simplify the user experience for business banking sales and financial institutions.

Companies formed with shared objectives

This alliance is a natural fit for the two organizations, both of which focus on financial institutions’ sales enablement and success.

Originally created by bankers for bankers, Vertical IQ was developed with the goal of delivering actionable, convenient, and focused economic and industry insights to help financial professionals win, grow, and retain more business. The easy-to-use platform has since expanded to serve a broad array of professionals including those within accounting, business process organizations, financial advisory services, insurance, business consultants, and more. Vertical IQ’s content currently covers more than 97% of the economic revenue in the U.S. and Canada through more than 920 Industry Profiles and 3,400 local economic reports.

Ignite Sales equips banks with intelligent sales engagement solutions to guide their customers to the right financial products. The Ignite Sales data-driven AI platform delivers interactive, personalized conversations between a banker and a small business customer, helping them uncover the customer’s unique banking needs. The platform also allows self-service users on a financial institution’s website to explore personalized financial solutions that fit each business’s unique needs.

One-stop access to valuable industry content

The collaboration between Vertical IQ and Ignite Sales integrates Vertical IQ’s robust industry and economic content directly into the Ignite Sales platform, enabling frontline bankers to access useful Industry Intelligence in real-time during customer conversations. The integration not only enhances the value of each customer interaction, but also simplifies the user experience for the two companies’ shared financial institution clients.

“Our partnership with Ignite Sales is about empowering bankers with actionable insights exactly when and where they need them,” said Paul Hock, VP of Sales and Strategic Partnerships at Vertical IQ. “By surfacing elements of our Industry Intelligence directly within the Ignite platform — and simplifying access to additional Vertical IQ content — we’re enabling more informed conversations that lead to deeper relationships and better outcomes for the bank or credit union and their customer.”

The alliance between the two organizations also addresses a growing demand among banks to streamline the processes used by their frontline teams, saving time while still delivering personalized, consultative experiences for customers. By embedding Vertical IQ content directly into the Ignite platform, bankers can now access key industry trends, pain points, and financial benchmarks without switching between platforms, making it easier to guide customers and prospects through their financial journeys. The result is more knowledgeable and confident bankers and higher satisfaction of businesses with their business banking experience.

“Our mission at Ignite Sales has always been to help financial institutions deliver exceptional, tailored customer experiences that enhance banker confidence and business satisfaction during the sales process,” said Ken Patrick, Chief Growth Officer of Ignite Sales. “This partnership with Vertical IQ takes that commitment to the next level by providing bankers with immediate access to high-value industry data within our digital engagement service. The result is smarter conversations and a seamless experience for our financial services clients.”

The integration is currently being rolled out with the two companies’ joint financial institution clients and is expected to be available to all Ignite Sales users in Q4 of 2025.
