June 26, 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland - TRON DAO announced today that the total circulating supply of USDT on the TRON blockchain has exceeded $80 billion, further cementing TRON’s position as the top blockchain for USDT activity. With USDT holding more than 63 percent of the global stablecoin market and surpassing 155 billion dollars in circulation, over half of that supply is issued on TRON. Since January 2025, the supply of USDT issued on the TRON network has grown by approximately 20 billion, according to a data platform Token Terminal. TRON continues to lead all blockchain networks in USDT issuance, transaction volume, and daily user activity.

TRON has established itself as the preferred settlement network for stablecoins, hosting around 60 percent of payment transaction volume. Its scale and efficiency continue to position it as the backbone for digital dollar movement across borders and diverse financial applications.

As of June 2025, TRON processes over 8.9 million daily transactions and has surpassed 315 million total user accounts. Additionally, the network facilitates an average of $21.5 billion in daily USDT transfers. With over 1 million unique wallets transacting USDT each day, TRON also leads in active stablecoin wallet usage, representing 28 percent of global active addresses.

With stablecoins playing an increasingly important role in cross-border settlement, financial access, and dollarization in emerging markets, TRON has established itself as one of the most widely used blockchain networks in the world. Its combination of scale, speed, and low transaction costs has made it the preferred environment for stablecoin activity worldwide.

“TRON’s success is grounded in its alignment with the core values of crypto—openness, user empowerment, and real-world utility,” said Justin Sun, founder of TRON. “USDT on TRON has become the go-to choice for millions of people because it works—it’s fast, efficient, and easy to use. The TRON ecosystem remains focused on building reliable infrastructure for the next generation of digital finance.”

TRON’s leadership in the stablecoin space continues to evolve to meet growing institutional demand. In April 2025, World Liberty Financial chose TRON to launch its USD1 stablecoin, which began minting earlier this month. Additionally, the TRON ecosystem has deepened its focus on financial compliance through the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a joint initiative with Tether and TRM Labs. Since launch, T3 FCU has worked with law enforcement agencies worldwide to freeze over $160 million linked to illicit activity.

As the digital dollar economy continues to expand, TRON remains a core pillar of the infrastructure driving greater efficiency and financial inclusion.
