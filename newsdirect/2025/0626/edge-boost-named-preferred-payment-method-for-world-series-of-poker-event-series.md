# EDGE Boost Named Preferred Payment Method for World Series of Poker Event Series

EDGE Boost by EDGE Markets, a financial platform for smart bettors and gamblers, has partnered with World Series of Poker, the premier series of worldwide poker tournaments. The EDGE Boost debit card is now the preferred payment method for WSOP, offering ease of payment, safety and several exclusive on-site perks for tournament players.

In past tournaments, WSOP players were limited to $10,000 per transaction and had to complete a lengthy approval process, often resulting in frequent cash deposits. Now, those using the EDGE Boost card through PayPal checkout can bypass traditional credit card verification. They can also make entries up to $250,000, which eliminates the need to carry large sums of cash at the event and increases security measures.

“Poker players competing at WSOP events typically face many roadblocks funding their entry at the casino and managing any payout,” said Seni Thomas, CEO and Founder of EDGE Markets. “In the past, players had to bring multiple checks from different accounts which complicated the deposit process and led to security issues of players walking around with large cash rewards. EDGE Boost simplifies this entire process and makes it entirely digital. Now these players can focus on their game without worrying about these extra factors. This partnership lays the groundwork for the future of gaming.”

This focus complements player safety and strengthens WSOP’s appeal as an attractive event for poker players globally.

“EDGE Boost is going to completely transform the WSOP experience,” said Greg Chochon, Chief Operating Officer at WSOP. “This partnership immediately enhances our brand and player experience through tangible benefits that make them feel safe and supported. Together, we are setting a new standard for how the rest of the gambling industry should operate. We also hope this improvement attracts more players to our events because of the frictionless financial process made possible by EDGE Boost, leading to a safer and easier-to-use system for all involved.”

"EDGE Boost gives players what we've needed for years - seamless access to our money, without hassle or judgment," said Lexy Gavin-Mather, Professional Poker Player and Coach.

EDGE Boost is also sponsoring an exclusive lounge at the WSOP in Las Vegas through July 11. It offers EDGE Boost cardholders a private space with refreshments, Wi-Fi, and autograph sessions from poker champions like 17-time WSOP Bracelet Winner Phil Hellmuth and WSOP Main Event Champion Jamie Gold.

“EDGE Boost is more than a card; it’s a tech revolution for gaming,” Hellmuth said. “Instant access, ironclad security, and flawless control - all designed to let you play your game.”

"If you're still traveling with cash, wiring money, or dealing with silly limits you're way behind,” Gold said. “EDGE Boost is a literal game changer! It's a Visa debit card built for serious players who want control over their bankrolls. It saves me so much time and keeps me safe! No brainer to sign up ASAP."
