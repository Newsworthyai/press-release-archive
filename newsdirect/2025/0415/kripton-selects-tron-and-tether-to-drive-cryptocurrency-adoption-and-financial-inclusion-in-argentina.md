Buenos Aires, Argentina – April 15, 2025 – Kripton, a leading e-commerce platform in Argentina, announced today a comprehensive strategic alliance with TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps). Together, they will launch initiatives aimed at revolutionizing digital payments and expanding financial inclusion in the Argentine market.

In this multi-faceted collaboration, more than 2,000 merchants working with Kripton will adopt USDT (Tether USD) as their premier digital dollar, enabling secure, efficient, and subsidized payments on the TRON network. TRON will subsidize all transaction fees between Kripton and its users, significantly reducing costs and improving efficiency for consumers and merchants.

Additionally, the strategic alliance will offer interest-free microloans to central market workers for the purchase of carts and work apparel, promoting economic growth and financial inclusion.

The microloan initiative is projected to generate approximately 110,000 transactions and $2 million in volume over an 18-month period. Funding of the microloans will be derived from transactions conducted by market workers using USDT balances on the TRON network at Kripton-integrated businesses.

"We are excited to have TRON join this initiative we've been working on," said Juan Pablo Moreno, CEO of Kripton. "Given that TRON is the network with the highest number of USDT transactions and has been actively working with the community for the longest time, we are confident that this integration will benefit our users and contribute to the growth of the crypto ecosystem in Argentina."

This strategic alliance connects ongoing collaborative efforts between Kripton, TRON, Tether, and civil organizations that promote the use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in Argentina.

"TRON is committed to promoting the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the region," said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson at the TRON DAO. "This collaboration with Kripton and Tether is an important step toward the mass adoption of blockchain technologies in Argentina and the region."
