FINTECH.TV, a global media platform focused on finance and innovation, today announced a strategic partnership with 3PRO TV, South Korea’s leading financial and investment content platform. The signing ceremony took place at the New York Stock Exchange.

The collaboration brings together FINTECH.TV’s global distribution network and editorial expertise in blockchain and financial markets with 3PRO TV’s strong presence in Asia. The two companies will co-produce original programming and work together to expand into key international markets, including Abu Dhabi and Japan.

“This partnership reflects our shared mission to elevate financial literacy and innovation across borders,” said Vince Molinari, Founder and CEO of FINTECH.TV. “By combining FINTECH.TV’s global reach with 3PRO’s deep connection to Asian audiences, we are building a new bridge for cross-cultural dialogue in the financial world.”

Founded in 2018, 3PRO TV has become a premier South Korean financial content platform, with 4.5 million YouTube subscribers. The company operates four affiliates spanning media and publishing. In 2023, it launched “Global Money Talk” to enter the U.S. market, where it has seen rapid audience growth.

Looking ahead, 3PRO TV plans further expansion into Japan, ASEAN countries, India, the Middle East, Europe, and South America—targeting 50 million global subscribers by 2028.

“This partnership with FINTECH.TV marks a pivotal step in our global expansion strategy,” said Donghwan Kim, CEO of 3PROTV. “We’re excited to collaborate on creating impactful content that empowers a new generation of investors around the world.”

The agreement also opens the door to potential mutual investment and deeper resource integration between the two companies.
