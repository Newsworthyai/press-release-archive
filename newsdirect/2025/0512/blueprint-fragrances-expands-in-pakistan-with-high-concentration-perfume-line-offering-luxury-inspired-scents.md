Founded in 2024 by digital entrepreneur Muhammad Basit Khan, Blueprint Fragrances was created to fill a gap in the Pakistani market: offering long-lasting, high-performing fragrances without the markup of designer labels. Using 50ml bottles with up to 40% perfume oil concentration, the brand prioritizes scent quality and performance while keeping costs manageable for the average consumer.

Blueprint Fragrances operates via its official website (www.blueprint.pk) and delivers across Pakistan. With the growing trend of online shopping and increasing interest in niche and designer-inspired scents, the brand has built a loyal following through social media, influencer collaborations, and targeted digital campaigns.

The brand’s catalog features a range of men's, women's, and unisex perfumes that echo the scent profiles of globally popular designer fragrances. Each perfume is uniquely named under Blueprint’s own branding while clearly communicating the scent experience to potential buyers. The product line has also expanded to include fragrance testers and gift sets, making it suitable for both personal use and gifting.

In recent months, Blueprint Fragrances has focused on growing brand visibility through media features, strategic partnerships, and PR campaigns. The brand’s growth has been guided by Basit Khan’s experience in content creation and digital marketing, which helped Blueprint build a strong presence across Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms. Future plans include the development of original fragrance blends, international shipping options, and physical retail presence in key urban markets.

With a streamlined operation model, Blueprint Fragrances maintains low overhead by using simple black shipping boxes and labeled bottles while allocating higher costs toward raw materials, premium fragrance oils, and customer experience. Despite basic packaging, the brand emphasizes that the value lies in what truly matters, the scent itself.

The rapid growth of Blueprint Fragrances reflects a broader trend of small-scale, digitally native brands disrupting traditional luxury industries in South Asia. By combining strong digital marketing with an understanding of fragrance culture, Blueprint is carving out a distinctive space in Pakistan’s evolving perfume market.
