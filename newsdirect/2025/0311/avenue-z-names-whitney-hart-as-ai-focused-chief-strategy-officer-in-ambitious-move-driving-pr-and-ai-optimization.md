She has advised industry leaders, institutions, and governments on navigating digital disruption, leveraging AI and emerging technologies to secure competitive advantages.

“AI is rewriting the rules of audience engagement, content creation, and content consumption, and the organizations that proactively manage their presence in and engagement with AI today will define the next era of influence.” said Whitney Hart, Chief Strategy Officer at Avenue Z. “Our team at Avenue Z is proactively thinking about how AI will fundamentally change not only content creation and consumption but also the broader financial, legal, and societal implications. I’m thrilled to join a team that is not just responding to change but shaping it through proprietary frameworks and proactive stewardship.”

Before joining Avenue Z, Hart led high-profile initiatives across Web2 and Web3, serving as Executive Director of Feral File, where she pioneered digital art infrastructure and museum partnerships, and as Interim Chief Marketing Officer of Trilitech, where she was responsible for the Tezos blockchain brand and ecosystem.

“Whitney is a force multiplier—she sees around corners and understands where AI, finance, and culture converge,” said Herzog. “We began working on AIO at the onset of Avenue Z, and now, her expertise will accelerate our mission to help brands dominate in the new AI-driven search results.. The next wave of digital marketing belongs to first movers, and Whitney is a key architect of that shift.”

Under her leadership, Avenue Z will expand its AIO (AI Optimization) capabilities, helping brands drive influence through AI-powered search engines, building reputation and revenue across all channels in an increasingly algorithm-driven world.

“Digital authority is no longer just earned—it’s architected,” said Herzog. “We’re creating systems that don’t just react to AI’s evolution but actively shape how brands are discovered, positioned, and trusted in this new era.”

Herzog added, “That’s why we’re making big investments on AI search and the future of influence. With Whitney leading strategy, Avenue Z is uniquely positioned to deliver an advantage that others haven’t even begun to understand.”
