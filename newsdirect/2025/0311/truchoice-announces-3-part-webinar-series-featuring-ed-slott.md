# TruChoice Announces 3-Part Webinar Series Featuring Ed Slott

TruChoice Financial Group, LLC (TruChoice), one of the largest distributors of insurance products in the financial services industry, is proud to announce its upcoming three-part webinar series, "Taxes, Roth Conversions, and Income Strategies," featuring Ed Slott.

The comprehensive webinar series is designed to equip financial professionals with the knowledge and strategies needed to help their clients navigate the complex landscape of retirement income planning and tax optimization.

The series kicks off on March 20, 2025, at 1:00 PM (CT) with "Ed Slott’s Guide to Turning Tax Challenges into Maximum Client Value." Attendees can join Ed Slott, known as America's CPA, for an urgent and transformative presentation on maximizing retirement tax planning opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Key focus areas will include maximizing client value, preparing for policy shifts, Ed Slott's tax planning paradigm shift, revolutionizing wealth transfer, and defying higher taxes.

The second webinar, "Roth Conversions: Devil is in the Details," will take place on March 27, 2025, at 1:00 PM (CT). Presented by TruChoice’s Brian Kunkel, JD, CMFC®, CRPS®, RICP®, this session will delve into the details of Roth IRA conversions and explore alternative approaches to achieving financial goals. While large 401(k)s and traditional IRAs may seem attractive on paper, there can be unintended tax consequences for those who do not understand the impact of additional income on their financial strategies.

The series concludes on April 3, 2025, at 1:00 PM (CT) with "Income Strategies: Are Your Clients Getting What They Paid For?" also presented by Brian Kunkel. Fixed and fixed index annuities continue to see record-breaking sales growth, offering a solution to address many of the challenges associated with longevity and retirement income. However, it is crucial to understand whether clients are getting what they paid for. This webinar will explore ways to leverage the benefits associated with fixed and fixed index annuities and why it is important for financial professionals to understand the assumptions insurance companies use when building retirement income products.

Financial professionals can register for the webinar series at www.truchoicewebinars.com. Each session will be conducted live, allowing participants to engage in real-time Q&A with the speakers. Recorded sessions will also be available for those who cannot attend live.
