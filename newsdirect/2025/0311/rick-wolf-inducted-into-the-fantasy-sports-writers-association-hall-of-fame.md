# Rick Wolf Inducted into the Fantasy Sports Writers Association Hall of Fame

Full Moon Sports, a leading sports consulting company specializing in fantasy sports, sports betting and horse racing, is thrilled to announce that founder, Rick Wolf, has been inducted into the Fantasy Sports Writers Hall of Fame. The FSWA was founded in 2003 to be a voice for writers in fantasy sports.

As an engineer, executive, and talent mentor, Wolf has dedicated his life to fantasy sports. Over the years, he has also been a publisher, writer, editor, and radio broadcaster on SiriusXM. Still, the FSWA inducted him for advocating for and mentoring content creators at CBS Sports, Rotoworld, NBC Sports, and Fantasy Alarm.

Andy Behrens, President of the Fantasy Sports Writers Association, summarized: "Rick's induction into the FSWA Hall is long overdue and richly deserved. He's a pioneer in the industry with an extensive coaching tree and an accomplished fantasy sports player. Our Hall of Fame would not be complete without him."

“To be honored by an organization that promotes the work of the most talented content creators feels like a dream, “ said Rick Wolf about the induction. “We are not done. Too many talented publishers, content creators, and broadcasters are not getting work and recognition. Full Moon is committed to advocating and mentoring as many of these geniuses as possible.”

In 2010, the Fantasy Sports Writers Association established a Hall of Fame to recognize fantasy sports publishers, editors and writers who possess a distinguished body of work and/or those who have helped advance the careers of others in the fantasy sports industry.

Wolf joins Greg Ambrosius, Matthew Berry, Ron Shandler, John Benson, Paul Charchian, Peter Schoenke, John Hunt, Ian Allen, and Emil Kadlec in being inducted into the Fantasy Sports Hall of Fame and the Fantasy Sports Writers Association Hall of Fame.
