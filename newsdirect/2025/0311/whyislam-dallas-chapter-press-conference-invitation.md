PURPOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN:

This Ramadan Billboard campaign aims to educate non-Muslims about the significance of Ramadan and the core values of Islam. The message, displayed prominently on the billboard, highlights Ramadan as a month of reflection, giving, and spirituality, encouraging those unfamiliar with the faith to learn more.

Sponsored by ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America), the billboard directs viewers to 1-877-WHYISLAM and www.whyislam.org, where they can find answers to their questions about Islam and Ramadan.

"Our goal is to foster understanding and create a bridge between Muslim and non-Muslim communities. Ramadan is a time of self-discipline, generosity, and deep spirituality, and we welcome everyone to explore its significance."

The billboard also carries the message "Fast With Us!", inviting people of all backgrounds to experience fasting for a day and gain insight into the spiritual practice observed by millions worldwide. With growing curiosity about Islam, this initiative seeks to provide an open and welcoming platform for education and dialogue.
