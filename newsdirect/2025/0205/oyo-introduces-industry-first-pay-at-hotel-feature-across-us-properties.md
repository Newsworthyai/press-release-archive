# OYO Introduces Industry-first Pay at Hotel Feature Across US Properties

* First major hotel chain in the US to offer flexible pay-at-property option
* Innovative payment solution addresses growing demand for booking flexibility
* Feature rolled out across 400+ OYO properties in 35 states

Global hospitality technology company OYO today announced the launch of its innovative Pay at Hotel feature across all US properties, becoming the first major hotel chain to offer guests the flexibility to pay directly at the property. This launch marks a significant step in OYO's commitment to making travel more accessible and convenient for its growing US customer base.

The new payment option allows guests to secure their bookings without upfront payment or credit card details, addressing a key pain point in the hospitality industry. Themed around ‘as easy as OYO’, the feature complements OYO's existing suite of customer-friendly policies, including its streamlined three-click booking process and last-minute booking capabilities.

Nikhil Heda, Head of Business Development, OYO US said, "The introduction of Pay at Hotel represents a transformative step in how Americans book their stays. We understand that travelers, especially those booking last-minute or managing uncertain schedules, need more flexibility in their payment options. This feature directly addresses that need while maintaining our commitment to providing affordable, accessible accommodations across the United States."

The Pay at Hotel feature has already been successfully tested in the Houston market, where it demonstrated strong customer adoption and positive feedback. The feature is now being rolled out across OYO's network of more than 400 hotels in 35 states, making it particularly valuable for business travelers and spontaneous trip planners.

Initial data from the Houston pilot program showed increased booking flexibility led to a significant reduction in cancellation rates, higher customer satisfaction scores, particularly among business travelers and strong adoption among last-minute bookers, who constitute a growing segment of OYO's customer base.

This launch comes as OYO continues to strengthen its position in the US market, following acquisition of G6 Hospitality that operates Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands. The Pay at Hotel feature, however, will only be available at OYO hotels and not at G6 Hospitality properties. The initiative will further differentiate OYO in the competitive US hospitality market, where the company has consistently demonstrated strong growth and innovation in the economy segment.

The feature is now available through OYO's mobile app and website, requiring just three simple clicks to secure a booking without immediate payment. This innovation aligns with OYO's technology-first approach, which includes AI-powered customer support, dynamic pricing, and an integrated loyalty program.
