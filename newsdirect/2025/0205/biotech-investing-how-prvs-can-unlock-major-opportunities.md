# Biotech Investing: How PRVs Can Unlock Major Opportunities

In the world of biotechnology investing, companies often struggle to bring new drugs to market. Developing treatments for rare diseases can be incredibly expensive, and because these conditions affect relatively few patients, the financial payoff isn't always clear. To help incentivize drugmakers, the U.S. government created the Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program in 2007. PRVs act as a powerful tool that can significantly speed up the FDA approval process, making them a highly valuable asset—especially to major pharmaceutical companies.

A PRV is awarded when a company gains approval for a drug that treats a rare pediatric disease (RPD), a tropical disease, or serves as a medical countermeasure for serious public health threats. Normally, FDA drug approvals take around 10 months, but using a PRV shortens that timeline to just six months. This four-month head start can be a game-changer, allowing companies to get a competitive edge or generate extra sales from blockbuster drugs. Since these vouchers don’t expire and can be freely bought and sold, they often end up in the hands of big pharmaceutical companies willing to pay top dollar for the advantage.

PRV prices have historically hovered around $100 million, but with uncertainty surrounding the renewal of the rare pediatric disease PRV program, recent sales have surged past $150 million. If the program isn’t renewed, PRVs could become even scarcer, potentially driving prices even higher. Big pharma companies are fiercely competing for these vouchers, particularly in lucrative fields like obesity treatments, where shaving months off a drug’s approval timeline could mean capturing billions in market share.

For small biotech companies, receiving a PRV can be a major financial boost. Take Day One Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: DAWN) as an example. The company was awarded a PRV after its pediatric cancer drug, OJEMDA (tovorafenib), received FDA approval. Rather than using the voucher itself, Day One sold it for $108 million, securing much-needed funding without diluting shareholder value. This kind of transaction highlights why PRVs can be a game-changer for biotech firms—providing an immediate cash infusion that can support further drug development.

With PRVs becoming an increasingly hot commodity, investors should keep an eye on biotech companies with potential voucher-earning drugs in development. With PRVs becoming increasingly valuable, several biotech companies could be next in line to benefit. Let’s take a look at three stocks with potential PRVs on the horizon.

OS Therapies:

OS Therapies (NYSE-A: OSTX) is emerging as a strong contender for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), a potential game-changer for the company. The company is developing OST-HER2, an immunotherapy designed to prevent the spread of osteosarcoma (OS), a rare and aggressive bone cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. Because OS Therapies holds a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) from the FDA, an approval for OST-HER2 would make it eligible for a PRV—potentially bringing in around $150 million in non-dilutive funding.

For a small biotech company, this is a game-changing opportunity. "The data we generated in our Phase 2b trial with OST-HER2 provides the first glimmer of hope in over 40 years that a paradigm shift could radically change the course of this deadly disease," said CEO Paul Romness. If OS Therapies secures FDA approval, not only would it mark a major breakthrough for osteosarcoma treatment, but the PRV could also provide the financial runway needed for future expansion.

OS Therapies has already hit a key milestone, achieving the primary endpoint in its Phase 2b trial for OST-HER2. The treatment demonstrated a 33% Event-Free Survival (EFS) rate at 12 months, compared to just 20% in historical controls. Even more compelling, 91% of patients treated with OST-HER2 were alive at the one-year mark, versus 80% in the control group. These results indicate a significant improvement over existing treatment options, which have remained largely unchanged for decades.

With these promising results in hand, OS Therapies plans to file for FDA approval (Biologics Licensing Application, or BLA) in late 2025, with potential approval by mid-2026. If successful, the company would receive a PRV just before the program sunsets, making it one of the last biotechs to benefit from this lucrative incentive.

Financial Stability and Growth Potential

Despite being a small-cap biotech, OS Therapies has positioned itself well financially. Over the past six months, the company raised $13.1 million through an IPO and a subsequent private placement. These funds are earmarked for final clinical trial payments, commercial manufacturing, and regulatory expenses—all crucial steps toward bringing OST-HER2 to market.

Moreover, OS Therapies recently acquired key clinical assets from Ayala, including two additional Listeria-based immunotherapy candidates for lung and prostate cancer. This acquisition not only expands the company’s pipeline but also significantly reduces future cash obligations, improving long-term financial prospects.

The Bigger Picture

Beyond osteosarcoma, OST-HER2 has potential applications in other HER2-positive cancers, including breast cancer and canine osteosarcoma, where it has already received conditional approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Additionally, the company is advancing its tunable Antibody Drug Conjugate (tADC) platform, a next-generation cancer therapy designed to improve targeted drug delivery.

With multiple clinical programs, a solid financial strategy, and a real chance at securing a PRV, OS Therapies stands out as a compelling investment opportunity in biotech. If OST-HER2 gains FDA approval, the PRV could provide a significant financial boost—offering the company valuable resources for further development and creating substantial upside potential for investors.

SpringWorks Therapeutics:

SpringWorks Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SWTX) is a biotech company focused on developing treatments for severe rare diseases and cancer. Its first FDA-approved drug, OGSIVEO® (nirogacestat), treats desmoid tumors, but the company’s next major opportunity lies with mirdametinib—a drug currently in development for neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN), a rare condition that causes tumors to form along nerves.

In the ReNeu trial, mirdametinib showed impressive results in both adults and children, reducing tumor size and improving pain and quality of life. Because of these promising outcomes, the FDA has granted Priority Review status to the drug, with a decision expected by February 28, 2025. If mirdametinib is approved, SpringWorks could earn a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which would be a highly valuable asset for the company.

A PRV allows for a faster approval process, providing a significant advantage for drugmakers. The company could choose to sell the PRV for a substantial financial boost, potentially funding future drug development or pipeline expansion without diluting shareholder value.

With SpringWorks poised to potentially earn a PRV through mirdametinib, 2025 could be a pivotal year for the company, positioning it as a leader in rare disease treatments. Investors should keep a close eye on SpringWorks as it works toward FDA approval for mirdametinib and the possible PRV windfall.

PTC Therapeutics

PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative treatments for rare diseases. The company has two important drugs that could earn PRVs in the near future, each representing a valuable opportunity for investors.

First, vatiquinone, a drug for Friedreich ataxia (FA)—a rare, progressive disease that affects the nervous system—has been submitted for FDA approval. The company believes this drug could fill a big gap in treatment for both children and adults with FA, as there are very few options available right now. Vatiquinone has shown strong results in clinical trials, with evidence of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. If approved, it could earn PTC a PRV, which could then be sold for a significant financial boost.

The second drug, Sepiapterin, is being developed for phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare metabolic disorder that can cause serious developmental issues. PTC recently submitted Sepiapterin for FDA approval, based on promising trial results showing it can help patients manage the disease and even reduce their reliance on strict diets. If this drug gets FDA approval, it could also bring in a PRV for PTC, providing an additional source of funding.

With two drugs in the pipeline that have the potential to earn PRVs, PTC Therapeutics is an exciting company to watch. These PRVs could provide significant financial support, helping the company continue its important work in rare disease treatments.
