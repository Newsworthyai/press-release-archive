# TechNexus Venture Collaborative Unveils Electrification 50 List

TechNexus Venture Collaborative, a leading investor in electrification startups, today announced the inaugural Electrification 50, a list of 50 U.S. hard-tech startups electrifying the physical world around us. The list recognizes startups developing innovative solutions to address the climate crisis and accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.

"Startups on the Electrification 50 are developing groundbreaking technologies that will transform the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us," said Terry Howerton, TechNexus CEO and co-founder. "We believe that they have the potential to make a significant impact on the fight against climate change and transform industries."

The Electrification 50 startups were selected based on a variety of criteria, including their technological innovation, market potential, and impact on the electrification ecosystem. The list includes companies working in a wide range of sectors, including aviation, marine, and recreational vehicles.

Founded in 2007, TechNexus helps large corporations build collaborative relationships with ambitious startups. As a trusted investment partner, TechNexus works with leading companies in legacy industries to back disruptive tech startups relevant to their business.

"We're proud to bridge that gap, connecting corporations with these emerging technology companies to accelerate the adoption of solutions that will transform our world."

Companies on the Electrification 50 include Harbinger Motors, an EV startup disrupting the medium-duty commercial and specialty vehicle industry that recently raised $100 million in Series B funding. Others, like Lightship, are developing an all-electric recreational vehicle. H3X, another startup on the list, makes electric motors for aerospace, defense, marine and heavy industry applications.
