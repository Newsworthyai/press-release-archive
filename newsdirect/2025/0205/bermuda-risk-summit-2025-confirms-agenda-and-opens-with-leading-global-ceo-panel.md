# Bermuda Risk Summit 2025 Confirms Agenda and Opens with Leading
Global CEO Panel

February 5, 2025: The Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) has confirmed the agenda for the highly anticipated Bermuda Risk Summit 2025, from March 10 to 12 at the Hamilton Princess & Beach Club. This year’s event, themed “Redefining Resilience,” will gather global leaders in property and casualty insurance, reinsurance, and risk management to discuss the evolving landscape and emerging challenges.

The Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers (ABIR) and EY return as title sponsors, reinforcing their commitment to driving industry-leading conversations in the risk and insurance sectors. Further strengthening its impact, new Silver sponsor, Ariel Re, and Supporting sponsor, SiriusPoint, have also joined the event. Their involvement underscores the summit’s growing significance as a global platform for risk and reinsurance leaders.

The opening panel, Navigating Global Risk: Insights from Industry Leaders, features John Huff, CEO & President of ABIR, as moderator. This session will set the stage for a thought-provoking discussion on the evolving risk landscape, with a panel of Global CEOs including Stephen Catlin (Founder and Executive Chair of Convex Group), Mark Cloutier (Executive Chairman and Group CEO of Aspen Insurance Group), Nicolas Papadopoulo (CEO of Arch Capital Group), and Kathleen Reardon (CEO of Hiscox Re & ILS). They will share their perspectives on how their businesses are navigating an increasingly complex global risk environment while supporting economies around the world. The discussion will cover how the sector is responding to emerging challenges, adapting to shifting market dynamics, and implementing resilience-focused strategies. Attendees will gain valuable insights into the innovative approaches shaping the future of risk management and ensuring long-term industry sustainability.

John Huff, CEO & President of ABIR, said: "From geopolitical instability to inflationary pressures and increasing climate-driven catastrophes, the risk landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace. As the world’s largest reinsurance market, the Bermuda industry plays a critical role in absorbing global shocks, ensuring financial resilience in times of uncertainty while protecting families, businesses and communities. This year’s Bermuda Risk Summit is the opportunity to bring together the brightest minds in risk and reinsurance to move beyond theory and into action. We’re not just discussing risk — we’re forging the solutions that will define the future of global stability.”

This year’s agenda includes high-impact discussions on the most pressing topics in risk and reinsurance today. Highlights include:

* Black Swans, Grey Rhinos, and the Risks We Face — A strategic session on forecasting uncertainty and mitigating volatility in global markets.
* Building Bridges Across Borders to Strengthen Global Partnerships — A deep dive into cross-market collaboration, and innovative partnerships that drive resilience, capital efficiency, and global expansion.
