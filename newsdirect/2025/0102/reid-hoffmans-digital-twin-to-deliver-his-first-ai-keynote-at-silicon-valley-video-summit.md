# REID HOFFMAN’S DIGITAL TWIN TO DELIVER HIS FIRST AI KEYNOTE AT SILICON VALLEY VIDEO SUMMIT

ReidAI, the AI-generated digital replica of LinkedIn co- founder, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, will keynote the 2025 Silicon Valley Video Summit (SVVS) on January 28 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. This annual event serves the information needs of enterprise video creatives, producers, and engineers, helping them to explore the future of media creation, enterprise broadcasting, immersive events and experiences, and emerging production workflows.

ReidAI will be joined on stage in a fireside chat with his creator Ben Relles, former head of innovation at YouTube Originals, and currently working with Reid across a number of Hoffman’s investments in AI and video. In their conversation, ReidAI and Relles will discuss how the digital twin was built and what he means to the future of enterprise video and communications.

The ReidAI persona was generated by a custom chatbot built on ChatGPT an ultrarealistic digital replica of Reid Hoffman. The chatbot was trained on 20 years of Hoffman's books, speeches, podcasts, and other content. Since then, ReidAI has appeared in interviews, judged competitions, translated speeches, and even had a conversation with a younger ReidAI (trained only on data created before 2004) talking to the present Reid Hoffman. This is his first-ever keynote in the ongoing exploration into the role of digital replicas.

“I am super excited about this Summit and my first keynote,” ReidAI explained. “One fun fact is that in the time it takes for Ben and me to deliver our keynote, I could process over 10 million minutes of enterprise video, unlocking insights that would transform communication and collaboration.”

The ReidAI keynote is being presented by Virtual Events Group (VEG) which curates the live-event portion of the SVVS program. “Video is transforming how the enterprise communicates, meets, and informs. Today, every company is a media company – or it is trying to become one. AI and new production techniques are rapidly transforming how that can be achieved,” says Robin Raskin, VEG founder.

AI and media creation will be a consistent theme throughout many of the sessions at the upcoming show, which is free to qualified production professionals. B&H and ASG are the title sponsors for the third year running. SVVS is the once-a-year gathering of the Valley’s enterprise and broadcast media production, and event professional community.
