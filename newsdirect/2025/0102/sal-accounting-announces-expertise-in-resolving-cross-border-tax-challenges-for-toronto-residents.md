Addressing Common Cross-Border Tax Mistakes

Cross-border taxation requires compliance with the tax regulations of both Canada and the United States. Many Toronto residents, including dual citizens, expatriates, and entrepreneurs, face challenges such as double taxation, missed deductions, and severe penalties due to common filing mistakes.

SAL Accounting highlights the following frequent errors:

Failure to File Mandatory Tax Forms: Missing forms like the T1135 for foreign income or assets over CAD $100,000 can result in fines of up to $2,500.

Neglecting Foreign Tax Credits: Many fail to claim credits for taxes paid in the U.S., leading to double taxation.

Misreporting Global Income: Incorrect reporting of worldwide income can trigger audits and penalties.

Overlooking Tax Treaty Benefits: The Canada-U.S. tax treaty offers provisions to reduce withholding taxes and exempt specific income categories, which are often underutilized.

Inaccurate Currency Conversions: Using outdated exchange rates for U.S. income creates discrepancies in filings.
