# Solana Volatility: SOL Under Pressure, Cutoshi Presale Emerges As The Deflationary Utility Meme Coin to Watch

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/796455171/Hb9XhIlS.jpeg)

Solana’s (SOL) price has changed since the second week of January 2025, leading savvy buyers to look at practical alternatives like Cutoshi ($CUTO). Cutoshi is a playful "meme" coin combining fun with financial uses. While Solana struggles to stabilize, Cutoshi’s presale is considered a safer, community-supported investment that can do well in unpredictable markets. This token aims to be entertaining and useful—making it a possible safe choice amidst the changing crypto market.

SOL’s Bearish Signals: A BreakdownSOL has dropped 15% in just three days, falling below $190 and reaching its lowest point in the last 20 days. Signs show that the market is weak: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is close to oversold levels, and SOL's price is lower than the moving averages (100, and 200 EMA). More than $15 million in long positions have been sold off. It adds to the selling pressure—making it likely that SOL will drop further.

The present SOL situation shows the risks of depending only on assets that are not perpetuity-based, an issue that Cutoshi hopes to solve.

Cutoshi: Meme Coin Appeal Meets DeFi SubstanceCutoshi ($CUTO) combines meme culture and real benefits. It takes inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto’s idea of decentralization and the Chinese Lucky Cat, representing good fortune. Here’s what is included in its ecosystem:

* Multi-Chain DEX: A user-friendly (privacy-promised) crypto exchange that charges a small fee of 0.25% per trade. Most of the fees go to users who provide liquidity, and some help increase the value of a token called $CUTO.
* Yield Farming & Quests: Users can earn $CUTO and points by providing liquidity and completing community challenges. These can be traded for rewards on the Lucky Cat Leaderboard.
* NFT Collection: 8,000 special digital collectibles are available for early users. They offer benefits and can be used in the DeFi platform.
* Learning Academy: Free courses on cryptocurrency, with advanced content available for $CUTO, to help more people learn about DeFi.

Tokenomics Built for Scarcity and GrowthCutoshi has 440 million $CUTO tokens that will decrease in number over time, unlike SOL, which increases its tokens. Here’s how the tokens are distributed:

* 55% for presale: You can buy them for $0.031 each in its current stage 4.
* 10% for farming rewards: These tokens encourage community involvement.
* 7% for strategic burns: This reduces the total supply, making each token more valuable.

Cutoshi has a clear growth plan:

* Stage 1) A presale, audits, and yield farming.
* Stage 2) A DEX launch and buyback program implementation.
* Stage 3) Establish an online store and expand through partnerships in the DeFi markets by 2031.

SOL vs. $CUTO: Stability Through UtilitySOL has strong partnerships and a market cap of $15.3 billion, which makes it stable. However, it doesn’t have much protection against value loss, making it risky in a market downturn. In contrast, Cutoshi uses fun meme marketing and DeFi tools to appeal to both casual and serious investors.

In a market where even popular coins like SOL are struggling, Cutoshi stands out because it is rare, useful, and has a strong community. Traders believe that $CUTO could see a rise similar to Shiba Inu’s in 2021 but with smarter financial strategies. As SOL investors look to diversify their holdings, Cutoshi’s presale at $0.031 stands out as a good opportunity.
