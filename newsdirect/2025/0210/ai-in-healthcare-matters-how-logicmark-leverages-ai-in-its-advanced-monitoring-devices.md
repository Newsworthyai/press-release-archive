Artificial intelligence has permeated every aspect of our lives, from how we bank to how we consume entertainment. It’s also playing an increasing role in healthcare, helping doctors, hospitals and healthcare facilities improve care while cutting costs.

It’s not surprising AI is finding its way into healthcare. The global healthcare market is huge, projected to hit $44.76 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 9% between now and 2032. But it’s also a market with a lot of inefficiencies that AI can play a role in improving, from enhancing care to assisting doctors and nurses in diagnosis and treatment. With remote monitoring, AI holds the promise of reducing costs and ensuring ongoing care. Not to mention AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting on the administrative front, freeing up caregivers to focus on care.

AI Already Assisting The Medical Community As it stands, AI is already helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses, improve and assist in treatment planning, enable early detection of diseases and ailments, better manage and protect patient data and improve patient care in and out of the hospital.

Take medical imaging, for starters. AI algorithms can quickly analyze X-rays, CT scans and MRIs, helping doctors spot diseases and tumors with greater speed and accuracy. AI is also being used to accelerate drug development and enable virtual assistants and chatbots, taking telemedicine to the next level.

But AI’s role doesn’t end there. It is also playing a big role in medical and monitoring devices that help people live independent lives. That’s particularly important as our population ages. Older adults want to live more independently, and medical and monitoring devices are an important part of achieving that goal. AI collects and analyzes data from the monitoring device in real-time, looking for anomalies in patterns that could signal something is amiss and potentially save a life.

How LogicMark’s AI-Powered Devices Can Save Lives That’s particularly true of the AI-driven devices LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK) is producing. The maker of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communications devices and Internet of Things technologies is no stranger to AI, incorporating it into two of its popular monitoring devices – the Freedom Alert Max and the Freedom Alert Mini. Both are designed to empower people to live independently on the go and at home and rely on AI to make it happen.

Take the AI-driven fall detection technology that is integral to both of these devices.

LogicMark’s built-in fall detection technology senses when someone has fallen and sends an alert to an emergency monitoring center, a loved one or 911. It can prove life-saving if a user falls and can’t dial an emergency contact due to an injury they’ve sustained or because they’ve become unconscious or disoriented. This is an extremely important feature – unintentional falls are the leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. LogicMark reports its AI will continue to learn and be updated to ensure it evolves to meet the needs of the user.

Hand-in-hand with fall detection are the company’s GPS location services which can pinpoint where the user fell and alert authorities. The devices connect to a 24/7 monitoring service that promptly contacts first responders, loved ones or caregivers when necessary. All of that is possible thanks to LogicMark embracing AI.

LogicMark Turns Mobile Phones Into Safety Devices Then there’s LogicMark’s Aster app that turns mobile phones into personal safety devices. With a tap or slide of the screen, help can be on the way in minutes. Loved ones can track you until you reach your destination, automatically call for help if you don’t check in on the app after a scheduled meeting or appointment and send emergency services to your exact location thanks to GPS tracking. The companion Bluetooth button, which is free when you sign up for Aster, is a small device that clips to a purse, keychain or backpack strap that users can push to call for help without opening their phone. The button calls for help with three presses, and a 24/7 monitoring service will answer and stay on the phone until users feel safe.

But it doesn’t end there. The company is on a mission to empower people of all ages to lead lives with dignity and independence and is on a path to create a connected care platform that brings together software apps, health communication devices, services and technology, all driven by AI. It’s not surprising the executive team at LogicMark is made up of leaders with years of experience and patents in AI and the Internet of Things. That gives them the insight necessary to develop smart monitoring devices that protect people at home or on the go.

AI is playing a major role in healthcare, helping doctors make better diagnoses and hospitals cut costs. It’s also improving care and giving people freedom and independence. LogicMark is focused on taking this market to the next level and is relying on AI for an assist.
