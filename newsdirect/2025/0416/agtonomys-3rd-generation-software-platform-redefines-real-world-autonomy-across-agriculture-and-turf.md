# AGTONOMY’S 3RD GENERATION SOFTWARE PLATFORM REDEFINES REAL-WORLD AUTONOMY ACROSS AGRICULTURE AND TURF

Agtonomy, a trusted provider of automation and AI solutions, today announced the release of its third-generation Agtonomy Platform™, the most advanced software platform for agriculture and land management. Formerly known as TeleFarmer™, the latest update introduces enhanced fleet intelligence powered by Physical AI, new equipment platform support for mixed fleets, expanded capabilities for diverse crops, turf and open-field operations, and a new name that reflects its growing range of real-world applications across industries.

Unlike other autonomous solutions that rely on extensive infrastructure or operator oversight, Agtonomy’s platform delivers true turnkey autonomy—ready to perform from day one without pre-mapping or local base stations. By combining embedded connectivity with vision-based navigation and advanced AI, Agtonomy continues to raise the bar for practical automation in agriculture, enabling broad adoption faster.

“There’s a big difference between testing autonomy in controlled environments and deploying it in the real world,” said Tim Bucher, co-founder and CEO of Agtonomy. “Permanent crop autonomy is one of the toughest challenges in agriculture. Our platform has been refined through years of experience navigating narrow rows with high value crops on either side and no margin for error. This latest update takes that expertise further—expanding application while maintaining our commitment to reliability and precision.”

Key Features of the Third-Generation Platform

1. Infrastructure-Free Autonomy

* On the latest Agtonomy-Enabled platforms, integrated cellular and Starlink connectivity, combined with vision-based navigation, eliminates the need for local base stations or manually driven record-and-repeat paths. The result is true autonomous operation from day one, with simplified setup and reduced costs.
* Where 3D satellite imagery is available, site setup can be completed remotely, eliminating the need for an on-site visit and streamlining deployment.

2. Turf & Open-Field Automation

* The platform now supports autonomous mowing and task execution across diverse environments such as golf courses, sod farms, pastures, municipal green spaces, and open fields. Agtonomy-Enabled equipment executes these tasks with industry-leading precision, helping reduce labor costs while improving consistency and coverage.

3. Enhanced Fleet Intelligence with Physical AI

* Agtonomy’s Physical AI enables a single operator to manage 10+ tractors simultaneously—with no practical upper limit. As the system learns from real-world operations, fleet efficiency continues to improve.

4. Expanded Equipment Support

* The platform now supports mixed-fleet operations across various equipment types, including new equipment integrations like the factory-fit Bobcat CT4045 diesel tractor—a robust solution for demanding autonomous tasks.

A Proven Platform for the Real World

As Agtonomy enters this next phase of scale and adoption, the company remains focused on what matters most: making automation truly usable. Backed by years of field experience in the most unforgiving environments, the platform is not only smart and scalable, but deeply practical.

“This update is all about removing barriers for operators,” said Nic Fischer, head of software at Agtonomy. “No base stations, no complicated mapping—just tap a few buttons and let your equipment do the work autonomously. Its practical autonomy for all operators day one.”

With a flexible platform that adapts to different terrains, tasks, and equipment, Agtonomy is empowering operators to do more—with less effort, less complexity, and the precision today’s operations demand.
