# CoorsTek Denver Metro Regional Science & Engineering Fair (DMRSEF) Returns to the University of Colorado Denver

The CoorsTek Denver Metro Regional Science & Engineering Fair (DMRSEF) is back and set to take place on Friday, February 28, 2025, at the University of Colorado Denver. This annual event is a celebration of science, engineering, and innovation, bringing together students from grades 6-12 across eight Denver metro counties to showcase their original research.

Last year's fair was a tremendous success, thanks in part to the incredible contributions of volunteers and judges. With over 150 projects recognized, the fair empowered 227 students from 34 schools to shine. This year, we aim to make the event even greater and continue to inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.

CoorsTek invests in the Denver Metro Regional Science & Engineering Fair (DMRSEF) to empower the next generation of STEM professionals by fostering an enthusiasm for science and inquiry. The company believes in providing students with opportunities to engage with the STEM community, compete for awards, and gain valuable experience in presenting their research. By supporting the fair, CoorsTek aims to inspire young innovators and celebrate their achievements, ensuring they have the necessary resources to excel in their scientific endeavors.
