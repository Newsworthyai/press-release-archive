Reach Target Audiences Effectively: Deliver your message directly to the audiences that matter most on the platforms they rely on for news and information.

The Problem: Visibility on Major Platforms

While major online news sites attract more than 1 billion visitors per month, the visibility of individual releases on these sites remains a significant hurdle. Finding specific content directly on these platforms is notoriously difficult, leaving issuers with limited opportunities to gain visibility:

1. Google Search – Content may rank highly, but it relies on the user’s ability to search using precise keywords or headlines.
2. Direct Links – Links provided by newswires like News Direct are effective but limited to the audiences with which they are directly shared.

Adding to these challenges, traditional newswires are unable to provide engagement metrics for content on these platforms. While there is undoubtedly value in the exposure placement on these sites provide, the lack of data specific to the performance of individual releases leaves a critical gap regarding how to determine the true ROI of such placements.

Revolutionizing the Newswire Experience

News Direct is committed to leveraging the most current available technology to transform the newswire industry. From streamlining workflows to enhancing the user experience, the platform’s innovations have consistently delivered exceptional value. News Direct Louder represents the next step in this journey, empowering clients with tools that prioritize transparency, visibility, and results.

“At News Direct, we’ve always believed in challenging the status quo to deliver better outcomes for our clients,” said Gregg Castano, Founder and CEO of News Direct. “With News Direct Louder, we’re not just addressing visibility challenges —we’re redefining what’s possible in news and content distribution.”
