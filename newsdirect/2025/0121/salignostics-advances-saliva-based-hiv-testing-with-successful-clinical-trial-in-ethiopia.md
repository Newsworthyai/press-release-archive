# Salignostics Advances Saliva-Based HIV Testing with Successful Clinical Trial in Ethiopia

Salignostics, a leader in saliva-based diagnostic innovation, proudly announces the successful completion of a clinical trial in Ethiopia for its groundbreaking saliva-based HIV rapid test. This major milestone brings Salignostics closer to providing a transformative solution for HIV testing, particularly in areas with limited access to healthcare infrastructure.

The trial, conducted in November 2024, evaluated 50 saliva samples from individuals diagnosed with HIV alongside 50 samples from healthy participants. The results demonstrated exceptional accuracy, with sensitivity exceeding 90% and specificity surpassing 98%. These findings underscore the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic medium and highlight its potential to address critical healthcare challenges worldwide.

Accurate, accessible HIV testing is vital for early detection and treatment, especially in underserved regions. Salignostics’ saliva-based test eliminates the need for blood draws and specialized equipment, offering a cost-effective and non-invasive alternative that can be deployed in homes, clinics, or community health settings. This innovation not only reduces barriers to testing but also empowers individuals to take control of their health with privacy and convenience.

“This successful trial highlights the value of saliva as a diagnostic medium,” said Dr. Guy Krief, Co-founder and Deputy CEO of Salignostics. “By leveraging our technology, we aim to complement existing HIV testing methods and provide a reliable, accessible solution that meets the needs of diverse communities worldwide.”

The global HIV diagnostics market is rapidly expanding, driven by increasing demand for decentralized and user-friendly solutions. The market is projected to reach $3.88 billion by 2021, with forecasts of further growth to over $7 billion by 2034 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% from 2024 to 2034.

Building on its success with saliva-based diagnostics, Salignostics continues to expand its portfolio. The company has a proven track record, including CE, UKCA, and TGA certifications for its Salistick pregnancy test, which has achieved over 500,000 units sold and ordered across markets such as the UK and Israel. Salignostics’ development pipeline also includes applications for oral cancer, respiratory conditions, and sexually transmitted infections, further demonstrating the versatility of saliva as a diagnostic tool.

For Salignostics, the successful Ethiopian trial is a significant step forward in transforming global healthcare. By providing accurate and accessible HIV testing, the company is addressing critical gaps in public health while reinforcing its commitment to innovation and quality in diagnostics.
