# IntusCare Announces Marcus Whitney as New Board Member, Strengthening Leadership and Expertise in Healthcare Innovation

IntusCare, a technology leader in the PACE market, today announced the addition of Marcus Whitney, founder and managing partner of Jumpstart Health Investors (JHI), to its Board of Directors. A healthcare venture capitalist, author, and thought leader, Whitney brings his extensive expertise in healthcare innovation and strategic investments and marks a significant step forward in the company’s commitment to improving healthcare outcomes for older adults through technology and services.

As a founding partner of JHI, an early-stage healthcare venture capital firm, Whitney has been instrumental in driving investments that focus on high-impact healthcare solutions that address healthcare disparities and push for equitable access to care. Whitney’s approach emphasizes not use innovation but inclusivity – values that align with IntusCare’s mission to enhance PACE and value-based care (VBC) organizations.

Whitney joins the board at IntusCare as the company continues to expand its technology platform, recently announcing a new EMR and practice management solution, CareHub, along with a risk adjustment system, IRIS, both uniquely designed specifically for PACE and VBC organizations.

“Marcus’s visionary approach and expertise in healthcare innovation will enhance our approach at IntusCare as we continue to look for ways our technology and services will empower the healthcare providers we support,” said Robbie Felton, CEO at IntusCare. “His expertise will be invaluable as we continue to develop technology that enables healthcare providers to deliver more effective, compassionate care to underserved elderly populations.”

“I am honored to serve on the board for IntusCare. The IntusCare team is leading the industry in redefining care for a critical population,” said Whitney. “I look forward to contributing to their mission and the bright future ahead.”

In addition to his role at JHI, Whitney is a best-selling author of “Create and Orchestrate,” about claiming your creative power through entrepreneurship. Whitney is an Aspen Health Innovators Fellow and serves on multiple boards that support healthcare and the arts; this includes the Healthcare Financial Management Association National Board. He is also co-founder and minority owner of the Major League Soccer team, Nashville Soccer Club. Whitney competes in Jiu Jitsu as an International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) World Master Champion.
