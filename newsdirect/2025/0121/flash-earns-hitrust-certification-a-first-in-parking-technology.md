# Flash Earns HITRUST Certification, a First in Parking Technology

Flash, the leading AI-powered parking technology provider, today announced it has achieved HITRUST Certification for its PARCS and Valet solutions, the first and only parking technology provider to earn the distinction. The achievement confirms Flash’s data security practices meet the highest standards trusted by 81 percent of U.S. hospitals and health systems.

Flash's HITRUST-certified PARCS and Valet solutions align its security frameworks with those of its healthcare clients and reduce their implementation complexity and risk. The certification also gives assurance to patients, visitors, physicians and staff that their information is safe from the moment they enter the parking facility.

“We have a track record of setting new standards in parking," said Flash CEO Dan Sharplin. “Our focus on reimagining the parking experience calls for putting security front and center, within and beyond healthcare. We’re also committed to a great experience for operators and owners, and this certification allows us to carry the technical burden of compliance on their behalf.”

Flash PARCS and Valet solutions have earned the trust of the country’s largest medical district and from healthcare systems in major metros nationwide, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, New York City, Orange County, Phoenix, Pittsburgh and San Diego.

Flash’s industry-leading parking technology has also earned designation as a Level 1 Service Provider by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), which it has maintained for 11 consecutive years. Its cloud-based platform can process over 500 million transactions yearly in a secure environment that limits the risk of data loss, disruption, or corruption. Operating entirely in the cloud also allows Flash to manage compliance for operators and owners, pushing security updates and routine system checks required by PCI and HITRUST standards over the air, which become operational within minutes.
