# NAVEX Celebrates the Grand Opening of its New Bangalore Office

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, today announced the grand opening of its permanent Global Capability Center (GCC) office in Bangalore, India.

In May 2024, NAVEX established a permanent presence in India as a significant step forward in executing on its strategic goals driven by the company’s ongoing commitment to international growth, talent acquisition, and investment in technology and services. The new office will house around one hundred experts including the customer success, product engineering, marketing, human resources, product planning, management, and information technology teams.

The center will help the business operate with agility while building awareness among companies in India, and Asia more broadly, seeking governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) expertise. It will play a pivotal role in accelerating product innovation, providing excellence in customer experience, and building on the company’s legacy.

Udayakumar Sethu, Vice President of Software Engineering and India Site Leader at NAVEX, adds, “We are delighted to reveal our new Global Capability Center! It is a huge development in our globalization strategy, and it will help us to build awareness and momentum in the vibrant Bangalore market. As a purpose driven company, NAVEX prides itself on creating a people-first culture that is meaningful and relatable to each person. We aim to be a diverse, inclusive, and sustainable company that celebrates cross-cultural collaboration and communication.”

The India office showcases NAVEX’s commitment towards expansion into South Asia. The company’s global footprint provides more opportunities for its team members to grow, contribute, and thrive, as the center offers a new workspace that will inspire everyday collaboration, shared knowledge, and learning. Current facilities include designated parking, a food court, employee transport and more to ensure all employees work in a supportive, safe, and secure environment.

The NAVEX GCC’s proximity to key Asian markets, such as Singapore, Japan, and Australia, also adds fundamental value to business operations. With a presence now across America, Europe, and Asia, NAVEX’s impact spans the globe, providing over 88 million employees at more than 13,000 organizations with a safer place to work. Due to significant international customer momentum in Europe, the company opened a new London office in 2023. The move follows its growing presence in Finland, the acquisition of WhistleB in Sweden, and the establishment of its Frankfurt data facility.
