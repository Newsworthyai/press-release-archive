# LIVE TINTED Unveils Its First-Ever Commercial with “It Feels Good To Be Seen” Campaign

LIVE TINTED, the prestige beauty brand founded by industry changemaker Deepica Mutyala, announces today the launch of the brand’s “It Feels Good To Be Seen” campaign, debuting LIVE TINTED’s first-ever TV commercial, which emphasizes the brand’s role as an innovator and pioneer in inclusive makeup. LIVE TINTED celebrates the campaign launch in partnership with Ulta Beauty, featured in the commercial, as LIVE TINTED sets out to expand to all 1,400 Ulta Beauty stores by Spring 2025. In tandem with the campaign launch, the brand has also welcomed new products to their robust offerings with the launch of the Legacy collection.

LIVE TINTED’s “It Feels Good To Be Seen” highlights the brand’s mission to bring change and representation to the $570B+ beauty industry. Inspired by Deepica’s own founding story, the 90’s-set commercial depicts two teenage girls of different skin tones experimenting with makeup. One girl, with darker skin, is disheartened when the foundation options are too light for her, reflecting the collective struggle of women of color to find inclusive makeup. The scene transitions to the present day, where the same young girl is now a mother, and she is able to find makeup to match her skin tone with confidence. Together, the mother and daughter explore LIVE TINTED's display of makeup available in inclusive shade ranges at Ulta Beauty, celebrating beauty for all.

“The scene in the commercial is representative of moments myself and many other women of darker skin tones have experienced throughout life,” said LIVE TINTED Founder and CEO Deepica Mutyala. “Since I was a little girl playing with makeup in search of a product that matched my skin, I knew I wanted to create a beauty brand where women would feel seen and represented for who they are. Seeing this commercial come to life is monumental for the brand, especially since it airs near the 10-year anniversary of my viral YouTube video that catapulted the launch of LIVE TINTED to where we are today.”

The campaign employs a comprehensive 360-degree strategy to maximize impact, featuring influencer and celebrity makeup artist collaborations and engaging in-store marketing assets at Ulta Beauty. Additional efforts include PR initiatives and social media strategies to drive brand engagement and widespread awareness. LIVE TINTED will continue to reinforce the campaign’s message throughout the year to sustain momentum and reach a broader audience.

“As the first South Asian-owned makeup brand at Ulta Beauty, Live Tinted has deeply resonated with our diverse community of beauty enthusiasts, especially through its inclusive ethos and versatile products like the Huestick – which went viral on social and is now a tried-and-true staple in our guests’ beauty routines,” said Jessica Phillips, Vice President of Merchandising, Ulta Beauty. “With a shared mission to create new beautiful possibilities for beauty lovers of all generations, skin tones and types, we’re so proud to see Live Tinted’s incredible growth continue to shine and serve as an inspiring success story for up-and-coming beauty brands.”

Ulta Beauty has been an integral player in the campaign and has contributed significantly to the brand’s growth since its launch in 2018. The brand first debuted exclusively in select stores in 2021 through the retailer’s Sparked initiative and then went on to be available at Ulta Beauty at Target locations. LIVE TINTED has become one of many fastest-growing prestige brands at Ulta Beauty, taking up six feet of retail space and will now be available to shop in all 1,400 stores across the U.S. by the spring. This will include the brand’s new Legacy collection which launched online and in stores on Thursday, January 9. Inspired by the legacy you dream of leaving on the world, the volumizing eye makeup trio features:

* Legacy Lash Volumizing & Lengthening Mascara ($26; $16 travel size): A serum-mascara delivering instant volume and long-term lash benefits with clean, weightless ingredients. Clinically proven to boost lash volume by +171% instantly and +113% over time.
* Legacy Liner Liquid Kajal ($22): Carbon-black-free and eye-safe, this liquid liner features 100% natural bamboo charcoal and a flexible felt tip for precise lines with a satin finish. Quick-drying and smudge-proof, it's been tested against water, tears, and life itself—this liner stays flawless all day.
* Legacy Eyelash Curler ($17): Wide, curved design for all eye shapes, featuring hypoallergenic silicone pads and a marigold orange tone for enhanced lash visibility.

The launch of LIVE TINTED’s “It Feels Good To Be Seen” campaign coincides with the 10th anniversary of Deepica’s 2015 viral YouTube video (11M views) showing how to conceal dark under eye circles using red lipstick. The video catapulted Deepica’s influence in the beauty space and championed her as an advocate for inclusivity and representation. She has since been awarded TIME Magazine’s Next Generation Leader in 2022, co-created Mattel’s first South Asian CEO Barbie, and continues to use her platform and vision for the future of beauty to further establish LIVE TINTED as a premier clean, inclusive beauty brand.
