The launch comes as industry research from CrescentRating indicates Asia is positioned to become the next major halal travel hotspot, with Muslim travellers increasingly seeking travel options that align with their religious requirements while still delivering premium experiences.

"Halal Holidays was founded with a simple mission: to make it easy for Muslims to travel confidently and comfortably," said Vincent Tan, founder of Halal Holidays. “We understand that faith plays a crucial role in travel decisions, and our goal is to provide a platform where Muslim travellers can find reliable, convenient, and fulfilling holiday options — all in one place.”

The newly launched website features a comprehensive range of halal-certified travel packages across popular Asian destinations, including Thailand, Japan, Turkey, the Maldives, South Korea, Indonesia, and the UAE. Each package guarantees essential Muslim-friendly amenities including 100% halal-certified meals, prayer facilities, modest accommodation options, and culturally sensitive services.

HalalHolidays.asia differentiates itself through specialized offerings, including halal beach holidays, family-friendly packages, luxury escapes, cultural tours highlighting Islamic heritage sites, and Umrah Add-On Packages that combine spiritual journeys with leisure travel. The platform's Umrah series allows travellers to coordinate religious pilgrimages with visits to nearby countries while maintaining Islamic etiquette.

"From search to booking, we've made sure HalalHolidays.asia delivers a frictionless and trustworthy experience," said Vincent Tan. “We want to eliminate the anxiety Muslims often feel when booking travel, especially when unsure about halal options abroad.”

The mobile-responsive platform enables users to browse packages by destination, theme, or travel type, with transparent information about included halal amenities. The site also offers real-time support from Muslim travel consultants fluent in English, Malay, and Arabic.

Post-pandemic travel trends show Muslim travellers increasingly prioritizing meaningful experiences, spiritual rejuvenation, and ethical tourism options. Asia's cultural diversity, affordability, and growing Muslim population position it as an ideal region for halal tourism growth.

The company has established strategic partnerships with halal-certified hotels, Islamic tour operators, restaurants, and community centres to build a comprehensive ecosystem for Muslim travellers. Future development plans include a mobile app, loyalty programs, and content collaborations with Muslim lifestyle influencers.

"We're not just selling vacations. We're helping Muslims reconnect with the world, with their families, and with their faith — through travel," added Vincent Tan.
