The crypto bull market is benefiting whales more than any other trader segment. These whales have been accumulating crypto over the past year, registering record profits since November. Now, many are diversifying their portfolios, looking for the next potential 100x gainer.

In this context, Dogecoin whales are looking at a new MemeFi token. Thanks to its blend of meme coin virality and DeFi utility, whales see Cutoshi as the next big thing to invest in.

Dogecoin Gears Up For Big MovesAfter years of stagnation, the meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) finally came back into the spotlight. Thanks to rather unexpected developments, Dogecoin is once again one of the most exciting cryptos to invest in.

Its latest rally started with Donald Trump’s election victory in November. Rather than just as a result of the resulting broader crypto market rally, Dogecoin traders saw potential in another development. Notably, Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter, made a strategic alliance with the future US President.

This has catapulted Musk to a likely cabinet position in the new administration. Notably, Musk will head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), likely named after Dogecoin. With the media spotlight on Musk, Dogecoin traders hope that the billionaire will continue to promote Dogecoin, as he did in the past.

In addition, reports are surfacing of X (formerly Twitter), finally getting the long-anticipated payments feature. Some traders are speculating that Dogecoin could be integrated into X, which may be a key source of demand. For this reason, multiple analysts predict a potential rise to $1 in 2025, from its current level of $0.38.

Whales Invest $1,600,177.914 In CutoshiWhile Dogecoin is gearing for gains in 2025, whales are looking for even better opportunities. Some believe that a new memeFi token, Cutoshi (CUTO), is the project for potential 100x gains. For this reason, this new token has already secured more than $1.6 million in presale funding.

Thanks to this presale success, Cutoshi is becoming viral, recently trending on X. The main reason for its appeal is its blend of memecoins and DeFi utility. For one, Cutoshi is a fun memecoin, with a lucky cat symbol to appeal to meme coin traders. At the same time, Cutoshi is also a DeFi project that’s all about making decentralized technology accessible.

At its core is the Cutoshi multichain DEX, which wants to make DeFi trading accessible to all. It features low fees and an intuitive interface, as well as a learning platform for new users. These features appeal to new traders. At the same time, Cutoshi offers all the benefits of DeFi, including self-custody, trading without barriers and decentralization.

Thanks to its clever use of memes, Cutoshi hopes to bring a completely new generation of traders into DeFi. With more traders entering the market than ever, Cutoshi hopes to make meme coin traders into real DeFi fanatics and challenge centralized exchanges like Binance.
