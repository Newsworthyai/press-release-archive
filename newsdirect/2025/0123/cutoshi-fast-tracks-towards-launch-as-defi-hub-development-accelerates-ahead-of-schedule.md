# Cutoshi Fast Tracks Towards Launch As DeFi Hub Development Accelerates Ahead Of Schedule

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/253032047/mVt0HOcf.png)

Recently, the Cutoshi community has become the fastest-growing meme coin community. Widespread participation has significantly boosted the project’s development and impacted its presale success. Due to this, CUTO has zoomed through the presale rounds and is now ahead of schedule for its launch on popular exchanges.

As early presale investors await the launching, the project’s team is updating the presale timeline and shifting more focus to the development to finish adding the platform features and final touches to offer investors the DeFi hub with its DEX and wallet in complete working condition before the schedule so they can immediately start using it to manage their finances.

Cutoshi’s Unique MemeFi ApproachThe project has adopted a hybrid approach to cater to the needs of both types of crypto enthusiasts. Cutoshi combines the fun of a meme community and the practicality and real-world use cases of a utility token, giving rise to a hybrid token.

Cutoshi is inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Cutoshi embraces privacy, security, and monetary freedom and follows Satoshi's ideals to promote decentralization and create an efficient global economy free from centralized control.

On the other hand, Cutoshi’s meme characteristic is based on the Chinese Lucky Cat, Maneki-Neko. According to Japanese and Chinese folklore, the lucky cat has extraordinary powers and blesses its owners with good fortune. Thus, Asian people traditionally decorate this idol’s figurine in their homes to receive its blessings.

Cutoshi aims to spread this luck worldwide. Thus, it has tokenized the lucky cat into its native token, CUTO, bringing it to the blockchain and making it accessible to everyone. People can harness its powers by including it in their portfolios and receive good luck and wealth in their digital assets.

Cutoshi’s Unified DeFi HubThe main component of this memeFi ecosystem is the Cutoshi DEX (Decentralized Exchange), which is in the final stages of development and will be launched soon for members to access. This DEX is developed to be cross-chain interoperable and thus will allow users to swap their assets peer-to-peer across multiple blockchain networks.

The DEX is capable of performing lightning-fast asset swaps with low slippage at a tiny 0.25% fee. Moreover, the transaction fees will be in the form of CUTO tokens, 80% of which will go to liquidity providers, and the remaining 20% will be burned to create a deflationary effect on the token’s value and ensure its growth over time.

Another essential part of the ecosystem is the Cutoshi Academy, established to reduce the Web3 knowledge gap. Through this learning academy, Cutoshi aims to spread the mass adoption of decentralized technology.

Through this academy, community members can access engaging learning materials and modules that explain complex DeFi concepts in an easily understandable way. All the knowledge will be free so newcomers can learn, adapt, and start using decentralized means of managing their finances.

Benefits of The CUTO Token PresaleThe Cutoshi presale has raised over $1.6 million, showcasing the immense demand from crypto and DeFi enthusiasts. The presale started with the CUTO token valued at $0.15 for first-stage investors, who have made over 106% returns on their initial investments since the price surged through the presale rounds to the current $0.031 in stage four.

However, those who missed out on these early gains still have time to get in and lock their spot in the future of DeFi since the presale will only accelerate with the project's ongoing growth and increasing demand. The token's value will continue surging, and the presale will provide investors with returns similar to the early stages.
