The crypto market rally is pushing all tokens up, but not all will benefit equally. So far, established projects like Shiba Inu and Pepe have already seen major gains. With their market caps in billions, there is not as much upside.

That’s why traders are looking for new tokens with major potential. One of them has already raised over $1,634,237.332 in investments and with its current momentum, set for a bright future ahead.

Cutoshi Set For 10x Gains In The Next 30 DaysWhile both Shiba Inu and Pepe have already seen significant gains, one token has substantial potential to outperform them. MemeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO), a new project that is currently trending on X, has secured over $1.6 million in investment and could be headed for 10x major gains very soon.

Most recently, traders were attracted to this Ethereum-based project for its combination of memecoin and DeFi utility. Cutoshi is not just a fun memecoin, but also one that is building a complete DeFi ecosystem.

Its DeFi ecosystem will feature its own multichain DEX, which puts decentralization first. The DEX will offer self-custody, low fees and trading without barriers. Thanks to its intuitive user interface, it hopes to appeal both to seasoned traders and newcomers.

With the token over half way through its presale, it is rapidly concluding. This means that the token will soon trade on the open market and when this happens, Cutoshi has the potential for major gains. For this reason, some traders are predicting 10x gains in just the next 30 days.

If Cutoshi’s DeFi ecosystem gets traction, it may become one of the biggest Ethereum-based memecoins on the market.

Shiba Inu Prediction For 2025The “Dogekiller” Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been making some big moves recently. Thanks to the overall market rally, Shiba Inu has seen strong growth this year. At its current level of $0.00002383, the biggest Ethereum meme coin was up 142.88% last year.

These price increases were a combination of broader market trends and Shiba Inu’s ecosystem developments. For one Shibarium, its Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has been gaining traction recently. Token burns, which are key for Shiba Inu, also played an important role. Notably, on December 3, Shiba Inu’s burn rate rose by 1,500%. In 24 hours, over 30 million Shiba Inu tokens left circulation.

Current conservative predictions for 2025 put Shiba Inu between $0.0000105 and $0.0000125. More optimistic predictions suggest that SHIB could reach $0.000033 or even reach a high of $0.00006392.

Still, Shiba Inu will likely not repeat the rally it did in late 2021 when it reached its all-time high of $0.0000884. The token now has a huge market cap of $14.04 billion, ranked 15th among all crypto assets. Traders who want to see 10x or 100x gains are now looking for lower-cap tokens that can replicate Shiba Inu’s success.

Pepe Coin Set For Big Gains In 2025 One token that recently replicated Shiba Inu’s early success is Pepe. This Ethereum-based meme coin quickly rose through meme coin rankings, registering huge gains this year. Notably, Pepe was up a staggering 1641.41% year over year, reaching its current level of $0.00002067. What is more, the token reached its all-time high in December, at $0.00002825.

Numerous indicators show that Pepe still has momentum going forward. For one, Pepe has seen significant whale activity, with one whale getting $24.5 million worth of Pepe. These big whale moves come in anticipation of major price rallies.

For that reason, Pepe, price predictions currently suggest a significant upside. One prediction suggests a potential 227% upside in early 2025. Most predictions range from $0.000037 to $0.000073 for 2025, suggesting a more modest increase. Still, if Pepe manages to secure the spotlight again, traders are speculating that the $0.0001 level is not beyond its reach.
