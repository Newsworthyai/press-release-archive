Cryptocurrency payments in retail have long been seen as a futuristic concept, but that future could now be within reach. Rezolve Ai (NASDAQ: RZLV), a leader in conversational commerce, and Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin platform, have teamed up to bring crypto into everyday shopping. By integrating Tether’s Wallet Development Kit (WDK) with Rezolve Ai’s Brain Checkout platform, this collaboration aims to create a seamless, fee-free payment system that could make using crypto as simple as swiping a credit card.

This collaboration has the potential to revolutionize retail, the two companies argue, by helping consumers pay with a single tap, while potentially saving merchants billions in processing fees. Rezolve Ai asks; could this be the tipping point for mainstream crypto adoption?

Aiming To Create A Seamless Shopping ExperienceRezolve Ai and Tether say they are combining their expertise to potentially revolutionize how people shop and pay. Rezolve Ai offers AI-powered solutions that make online shopping faster, easier and more personalized. Tether, on the other hand, is a pioneer in stablecoin technology, with its USD₮ stablecoin being the largest in the industry, boasting over $138 billion in circulation.

The collaboration integrates Tether’s WDK, an open-source crypto wallet library, into Rezolve Ai’s Brain Checkout platform. Tether’s WDK allows developers to build mobile, desktop and web wallets, enabling consumers to securely store and use cryptocurrencies for transactions. Meanwhile, Rezolve Ai’s Brain Checkout platform allows consumers to make instant purchases across any of a retailer’s digital channels, potentially creating a seamless shopping experience from engagement to checkout.

By combining these technologies, Rezolve Ai says the integration will allow consumers to use cryptocurrencies to pay for products offered by merchants using its Brain Checkout. Together, the two companies aim to make cryptocurrency as easy to use as cash or credit, potentially bringing it into the mainstream retail world.

The companies say that their collaboration offers significant benefits for both merchants and consumers.

The Rezovle Ai, Tether Integration Could Offer Benefits To Merchants And ConsumersOne of the biggest potential advantages for retailers is economic. Rezolve Ai estimates that merchants worldwide spend over $600 billion annually on credit card and payment processing fees, which eat into their profitability. By integrating Tether’s WDK with Brain Checkout, this initiative eliminates these fees entirely, creating a fee-free payment system that allows merchants to keep more of their revenue, Rezovle Ai says.

Additionally, Tether’s global reach could bring new customers to retailers. With over 400 million users worldwide, Tether’s stablecoins (e.g., USD₮, MXN₮, CNH₮) are pegged to local fiat currencies, making them accessible and familiar to consumers in different regions. This could open up new opportunities for retailers to attract a broader customer base, Rezovle Ai says.

For shoppers, the integration could mean more payment options and a frictionless checkout experience. The plan is that consumers will be able to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether’s stablecoins to pay for everyday items, from groceries to transportation, with just a single tap.

The system also offers added security and fraud protection, reduced transaction costs, and faster payment processing—key advantages of using cryptocurrencies in e-commerce, Rezovle Ai says. By expanding the number of merchants that accept crypto, this collaboration could make it easier for consumers to incorporate cryptocurrency into their daily lives.

A Shared Vision To Transform RetailRezolve Ai and Tether share a vision of making cryptocurrency ubiquitous and as easy to use as traditional payment methods. Rezolve Ai’s globally scalable platform, combined with Tether’s blockchain technology, could reshape the global retail market.

“By embedding crypto functionality into everyday shopping experiences, Rezolve Ai is breaking down barriers to adoption and enabling consumers around the world to use cryptocurrency seamlessly in their daily lives,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. He added that this initiative “will empower both consumers and retailers.”

Daniel M. Wagner, CEO of Rezolve Ai, echoed this sentiment, saying, “We’re pioneering a disruptive solution set to transform the $30 trillion retail sector” and are working to “reshape the global payment landscape.”

The Road Ahead Rezolve Ai believes its total addressable market is upward of $540 billion, as noted in its June 2024 investor presentation. The company says it is off to a strong start to 2025, announcing multiple new customer wins in early January. Shoeby, one of the Netherlands’ leading fashion retailers with over 210 stores, has selected Rezolve Ai to transform its online shopping experience through the adoption of the cutting-edge BRAiN Commerce solution. Mitch van Deursen, CEO of Shoeby, expressed his enthusiasm, “Rezolve Ai’s BRAiN Commerce solution is a game-changer for Shoeby. By embracing conversational commerce and reducing cart abandonment, we are setting a new benchmark for online shopping in the fashion industry. This partnership is key to delivering the personalized, seamless experience our customers expect while strengthening our position as a digital retail leader.”

In addition to Shoeby, Royal Caviar Club (RCC) announced it was integrating Rezolve Ai’s conversational commerce tools to help it redefine the luxury shopping experience by allowing it to offer personalized interactions, streamlined checkouts and AI-driven product recommendations.

Rezolve Ai says it is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of retail innovation. By making cryptocurrency payments accessible, secure and easy to use, Rezolve Ai and Tether say they are not just keeping up with the times—they’re shaping the future of how we shop and pay.
