# TRUMP Investors Now Collecting Ethereum (ETH)-Based Tokens as Elluminex ($ELX) on TON Presale Gains Momentum

Donald Trump introduced his own cryptocurrency, the Official Trump (TRUMP) token, on Jan. 18. Soon after its launch, the token's market cap soared to $15 billion in just 24 hours, surpassing the rise of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

However, underneath this radiant picture, an ominous reality has been emerging, which now has pushed many so-called “Trump whales" to join a new addition—Elluminex.

Trump token copycats on the rise:The Official Trump (TRUMP) coin's notoriety has spawned over 700 copycat tokens as of Feb. 8, 2025, as reported by The Guardian. None of these tokens have official ties to the original TRUMP meme coin. This is serving to confuse more and more investors while increasingly exposing them to scams, leaving speculators open to the risk of real losses.

In the last 24 hours, the TRUMP coin has witnessed a fall of over 28% in its trading volume and is currently trading at $17.32. This price is a depreciation of 76.98% from the token’s high seen on Jan. 19 when TRUMP reached around $75.

People, however, distrust the token as a rug-pull or pump-and-dump scheme, reports TRM. A rug pull occurs when a developer withdraws the liquidity of the token, effectively crashing its price and leaving investors at a loss. On the other side, pump-and-dump involves artificially inflating the price of a token so that the insiders can sell at a peak price, edging out before it crashes. No doubt, the skepticism is validated, as TRUMP’s price crashed by 76.78%.

The funky appeal of TRUMP-like meme coins seems to be losing its steam as the investors are now increasingly keen on projects that have real utility and long-term promise.

Elluminex: An new-generation alternativeElluminex is an emerging all-in-one DeFi hub project in the crypto landscape that runs on Telegram Open Network (TON) and is accessible on the Ethereum chain. Elluminex (ELX) targets utility and looks towards the future of DeFi. With a focus on solving fragmented liquidity, exorbitant fees, and limited accessibility, Elluminex is set to redefine DeFi by leveraging the fast-growing blockchain in the world, TON Blockchain.

The hallmark of DeFiUnlike meme coins, which are fueled by hype, it provides a full-service platform that brings together a DEX, yield farming, staking, cross-chain bridging, and AI powered portfolio tracker. By addressing usability and scalability, Elluminex is trying to provide a sustainable base for the next wave of investors and developers alike.

Elluminex’s vision goes beyond merely trading and speculation. The project is looking to empower through education and make the technology available for all by breaking down the complex blockchain technology so users can confidently access it—doing what blockchain technology was originally meant to do!

The platform also offers an innovative pre-market feature allowing new projects launching on the TON blockchain to be accessed and will allow investors to discover diamonds before they hit the mainstream.

Inclusion and innovation thus are the hallmarks of Elluminex that make it a beacon of next-gen DeFi solutions with a tangible impact, distinct from the meme coin space that has often failed to provide any real contributions to the ecosystem.

Presale Opportunity In the presale, now in its first stage, the token initially sells for $0.06, with market anticipation predicting a jump to around $0.08 for the next stage. The growing interest in the presale is increasingly being invoked by investors keen to exploit the value on offer with more than 5.4 million tokens sold to a tune of $325,429 USDT so far.

The deflationary nature of $ELX tokenomics as well as the cross-chain attributes are what separates Elluminex from others in the industry. $ELX powers the Elluminex platform while the token burning mechanisms reduce the total supply, thereby increasing the token's chances of rising in value in the long run.

For users wishing to escape the jaws from the clutches of volatility and limited utility of the meme coins, Elluminex presents a very solid alternative: a choice that combines utility and scalability.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, it would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. (ELX is a transformative crypto for the TON chain)

Simply having lots of token holders and liquidity means nothing if project owners, developers are not able to tap into and utilise it, and crypto users are not able to trade it freely and seamlessly.
