# Meme Coin Showdown: PEPE & SHIB Stalling, Cutoshi’s Presale Leads the Next 100x Wave

The meme coin industry, once mainly inspired by virality, is now changing. While Pepe (PEPE) coin and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle to provide gains, a new contender is at the center of attention, with its deflationary presale and full-fledged ecosystem. Analysts suggest this Ethereum-based token, inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s ideas, can be the next 100x altcoin in 2025.

PEPE & SHIB: Limitations PEPE and SHIB are heavily dependent on meme culture and community hype. However, their lack of utility has now become a big concern for them. Experts believe that to have relevance in the market in the long term, a project needs to have some functionality that adds value to the lives of users. Both SHIB and PEPE seem to be missing that.

Adding to that, SHIB’s infinite supply and PEPE’s overreliance on market sentiment leave them vulnerable as investors pivot toward projects with tangible use cases. The memecoin sector, valued at $76.4 Billion (CoinGecko), is maturing and demanding more than just virality.

This is where Cutoshi changes the game. It is a project that uses the Lucky Cat’s cultural symbolism of prosperity and couples it with a DeFi ecosystem that is designed for growth. Unlike its competitors like PEPE and SHIB, Cutoshi is creating a path to financial freedom.

Cutoshi’s USPsCutoshi’s presale structure is a masterclass in deflationary design. With 55% of its 440 million tokens allocated to presale along with a 7% burn event, it has limited supply. This contrasts sharply with SHIB’s inflationary model.

But Cutoshi’s real strength lies in its ecosystem:

Multi-Chain DEX: This platform allows cross-chain swaps with a 0.25% fee, funneling 80% back to liquidity providers. This is 100% a win for decentralized trading efficiency.

Gamified Farming: Users earn $CUTO through quests. This increases engagement and gives the community a chance to earn passive income.

Educational Hub: The Cutoshi ecosystem also provides free resources that educate common people about DeFi, blockchain, and Web3. However, there will be paid modules, too which will require $CUTO coupons. Hence, the creation of demand for Cutsohi tokens.

These tools position Cutoshi as a “MemeFi” champion, bridging the gap between meme culture and real-world utility.

Analysts Predict a 100x WaveTop traders feel that the next crypto cycle will favor tokens like Cutoshi, which leverage DeFi fundamentals. Its Ethereum foundation also gives it an edge over Solana-based meme coins.

PEPE, SHIB or Cutoshi: Which One to Buy?While PEPE and SHIB are obviously industry legends, Cutoshi represents evolution. Its presale is ending soon and has already raised more than $1.6 million. Cutoshi offers more than luck - it provides the tools for financial autonomy. So, if you are looking for the meme coin that can be the next PEPE, SHIB, or DOGE in terms of returns, Cutoshi might just be the one.
