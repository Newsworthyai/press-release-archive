# Green Lantern Solar Transforms Reclaimed Gravel Pit in Brighton, VT, Into Clean Energy Resource, Sells Project to Sea Oak Capital

Green Lantern Solar, an innovative and trusted renewable energy developer, has announced the sale of its Brighton (Vermont) Solar project to Sea Oak Capital, LLC.

The project, sited on the closed portion of an operating family-owned gravel operation, demonstrates the potential to transform otherwise unproductive land into a valuable clean energy source. This project is yet another example of Green Lantern’s commitment to projects that provide long-term, stable revenue streams to rural landowners and small businesses.

The 500 kW(AC) solar project serves nearby farms, the Town of Brighton, and the Newport Ambulance Service, a nonprofit regional ambulance service that covers 18 towns in three counties in Vermont with four stations. This transaction builds on the success of more than a half-dozen Vermont projects Green Lantern Solar has sold to Sea Oak Capital.

“This project epitomizes our mission to deliver clean energy, provide generational sources of income to landowners, support local businesses and revitalize underutilized spaces,” said David Carpenter, VP of Development & Chief Legal Officer, Green Lantern Solar. “We had the opportunity not only to develop this project, but in the process, help the landowner achieve full compliance with existing land use permits. We’re excited to see the whole commercial ecosystem surrounding this project thrive under Sea Oak Capital’s management.”

Sea Oak Capital continues to expand its community-centered portfolio with this acquisition.

“Community solar projects are a cornerstone of our growth strategy,” said Dan Poydenis, Chief Executive Officer, Sea Oak Capital. “Our collaborations with Green Lantern Solar consistently deliver impactful results, supporting Vermont’s renewable energy goals while creating meaningful energy cost-savings for local businesses. Their streamlined approach and commitment to excellence have made this transaction seamless and efficient, and we look forward to continuing this successful partnership.”
