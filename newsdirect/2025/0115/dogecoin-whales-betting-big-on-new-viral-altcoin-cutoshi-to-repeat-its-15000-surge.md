Dogecoin has been one of the biggest winners in the latest bull market. Thanks to surprising developments in the US, the token has regained a lot of its momentum. Still, Dogecoin whales are also looking for smaller tokens that can replicate the success of the biggest meme coin.

That’s why many are betting big on a new Ethereum-based token. This innovative meme coin comes packed with utility, which helps it attract both memecoin and DeFi investors.

Dogecoin Whales Make Big MovesThe original meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has attracted significant whale attention. Following Donald Trump’s victory in November, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter, Elon Musk, holds the ear of soon-to-be the most powerful man on Earth. This has prompted whales to stock up on Doge.

Notably, whales bought over $500 million in Doge tokens in just 48 hours last week. On January 3 alone, whales bought 1.08 billion Doge tokens, worth $350 million. This activity was fueled by social media enthusiasm for Doge.

These rumors are coupled with ongoing speculation over Musk’s companies, like Tesla and X integrating Doge payments. For instance, rumors started circulating of Tesla accepting Dogecoin at its charging stations. While the official Tesla website makes no mention of this, the news caught on. Social media users and some crypto websites amplified this idea.

What is more, there are ongoing speculations that X (formerly Twitter) will also enable payments in Dogecoin. While these speculations are so far unconfirmed, they are fueling the excitement over Dogecoin. This activity could propel Dogecoin to the key $0.5 level, and then beyond to $1.

Still, it is highly unlikely that Dogecoin can match its gains when it rose upwards of 15000%. That’s why Dogecoin whales are diversifying their portfolios. In particular, many are looking at a new memeFi token Cutoshi.

Can Cutoshi Repeat Dogecoin’s Early Success? For years, Dogecoin holders have been looking to repeat the token’s early success. Many meme coins came and went in that period. However, a new token stands out as a strong contender: Cutoshi (CUTO).

Thanks to its blend of memecoin and utility, some Dogecoin whales believe it has a chance at repeating Dogecoin’s success.

So far Dogecoin whales have poured substantial capital into Cutoshi. Notably, the token already raised over $1.5 million in presale investments, just months after its launch. What appeals to them is Cutoshi’s blend of utility and memes.

For one, Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi token. It is inspired both by the Chinese Lucky Cat symbol as well as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is all about digital freedom, decentralization and empowering users.

Its upcoming multichain DEX will aim to make DeFi accessible to all kinds of users, not just the more technical ones. It will also feature key DeFi features, such as self-custody and low fees. With the DeFi space growing faster than ever, this is a major opportunity.

With a focus on DeFi, Cutoshi hopes to attract meme coin traders into the world of decentralized technology. Whales are already understanding its potential, and regular users may soon follow. If this happens, Cutoshi is in a good position to replicate Dogecoin success.
