The crypto bull market has seen several standout performers, including Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. These memecoins are at the center of the rally for several reasons. Dogecoin, thanks to its connection to Elon Musk, and Shiba Inu thanks to its significant new ecosystem development.

At the same time a new token is racing towards $1, and traders are asking whether it can beat Doge to the mark.

Can Dogecoin Reach $1? Dogecoin (DOGE) was one of the biggest winners in the late 2024 bull market. Thanks to Donald Trump’s victory, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter, Elon Musk, will likely hold a prominent position in the new administration. While Musk recently took significant criticism from Trump supporters, he still has many supporters.

For this reason, Dogecoin was up 361.40% over the last year, with most of these gains coming after the November election. Currently, at $0.3897, traders are now gearing for Dogecoin’s next all-time high. With a previous all-time high of $0.7376 in 2021, $1 is certainly not beyond Dogecoin’s reach.

The next potential catalyst for Dogecoin is Trump’s inauguration, as well as Elon Musk’s entry into the administration. Notably, Trump announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in which Musk will have a key role.

Still, the path to $1 may not be smooth sailing. Notably, Elon Musk recently took substantial criticism over his stance on H1-b visas. While Musk argued for more legal immigration, Trump supporters criticized the system over alleged abuses. If Musk loses favor among Trump’s base, Dogecoin will likely suffer as well.

Can Cutoshi Reach $1 Before Doge? Amid Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s rise, a new memeFi token is attracting attention. The bullish market has spilled over to Cutoshi (CUTO), which recently raised over $1,572,177.600 in presale investments. This token combines memes with DeFi utility and is attracting a lot of attention.

Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a serious DeFi project. It aims to use the appeal of memecoins to bring more people into the world of DeFi. At its core is a multichain DEX, which hopes to make DeFi more accessible than ever. With self-custody, low fees, and an intuitive user interface, it hopes to bring DeFi to the masses.

With a presale price of just $0.031, its rise to $1 would be nothing short of remarkable. However, if its ecosystem catches on, and its meme coin traders discover its appeal, it has a real potential to reach this mark.

Unlike Shiba Inu, Cutoshi has a very limited number of tokens. This means that $1 is a realistic goal, even at current crypto prices. However, whether or not it can reach that mark before Dogecoin will ultimately depend on whether or not it is successful in creating a community-run ecosystem that brings decentralization to everyone.

Shiba Inu Unveils TREAT TokenJust like Doge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the strongest performers in this cycle, cementing its second place among memecoins. In the last five days, the token was up 15.59%, on a mix of market news and the latest ecosystem developments.

Most recently, Shiba Inu unveiled its TREAT token, a major step to boost its governance. The Shiba Inu team announced expansive functionality for the token. Its features will include distributing ecosystem rewards, yield farming, decision-making, crypto payments, and more.

Still, despite the expected favorable regulatory changes in the US, TREAT will not be for US users. This is likely because the Shiba Inu team believes the SEC would classify it as a security. Unlike Shiba Inu, TREAT is not just a meme coin and has significant utility. For that reason, the current SEC might classify its launch as an illegal securities offering.

Still, this could change when the incoming administration unveils new crypto regulations. What this regulation will be remains to be seen, but a more favorable crypto framework stands to boost Shiba Inu significantly. Still, unlike Doge, Shiba Inu will likely never reach the $1 mark, thanks to its huge token count.
