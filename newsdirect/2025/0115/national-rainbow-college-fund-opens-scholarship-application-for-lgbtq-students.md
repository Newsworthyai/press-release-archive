# National Rainbow College Fund Opens Scholarship Application for LGBTQ+ Students

National Rainbow College Fund (NRCF) announced the opening of its inaugural application cycle for the first scholarship designed to exclusively support California’s LGBTQ+ students regardless of the public nature of their sexual identity.

National Rainbow College Fund will provide up to $500,000 in scholarship awards for 200 students with an award of $2,500 per selected student. The application period is from Jan. 15, 2025, to March 5, 2025, and students can apply at RainbowCollegeFund.org/apply. National Rainbow College Fund is powered by San Diego Foundation, one of the largest community foundations in the U.S. and the largest provider of scholarships of any community foundation in California.

“Our mission at National Rainbow College Fund is to lessen the financial burden for young people who identify as LGBTQ+ or who are grappling with the secrecy of remaining in the closet," said Mark Stuart, President and CEO of San Diego Foundation. "With that commitment in mind, we will make students' privacy the highest priority during the application process. Together, we will break barriers, transform lives and build futures.”

Scholarships may be used for tuition, books, fees, room and board and other educational expenses. It does not need to be repaid. To apply, a student who identifies as LGBTQ+, whether publicly or privately, must be a high school senior; an incoming or current college or university student; or an adult re-entry student.

Applicants must have lived in California for at least one year and demonstrate financial need by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the California DREAM Act Application or the Federal Student Aid Estimator Tool. Students must plan to enroll in at least six units in an accredited public or nonprofit community college; four-year university or trade/vocational school anywhere in the United States.

About National Rainbow College Fund

National Rainbow College Fund (NRCF) is the first scholarship designed to exclusively support LGBTQ+ students pursuing their ambitions for higher education regardless of the public nature of the student’s sexual identity. The groundbreaking fund addresses the unique challenges LGBTQ+ students face such as social acceptance, mental health issues and family rejection that can hinder their ability to afford college, which in turn impacts long-term economic earning power. Setting the precedent in California, San Diego Foundation’s vision is for the fund to grow to be a national source of financial aid for LGBTQ+ students to attend the technical school, college or university of their choosing.
