# Soccersm Launches Mainnet on Lisk with Airdrop and Decentralized AI-Powered Prediction Market

Soccersm, a decentralized AI-powered prediction markets platform, is thrilled to announce the official launch of its mainnet on Lisk, an Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchain and member of the Optimism Superchain. To celebrate the launch, Soccersm and Lisk are rolling out an airdrop of 50,000 LSK tokens to both new and existing Soccersm users. This milestone introduces a fully decentralized platform for users to stake, predict, and earn from a wide variety of events—from sports and pop culture to cryptocurrency and politics.

Soccersm’s mainnet launch represents a major advancement in the prediction markets space, offering users a unique opportunity to challenge their peers in P2P (peer-to-peer) prediction pools, benefit from AI-powered prediction analytics, and participate in fun, game-like experiences for rewards. The platform also brings an entirely new level of decentralization, eliminating the traditional gatekeepers and allowing users to have complete control over their stakes and rewards.

“We are innovating the prediction markets space by combining the power of decentralization with AI-driven insights,” said Baah Kusi, Co-Founder of Soccersm. “Our platform is built to empower users with the tools they need to make smarter predictions, while offering an engaging and fun experience. With our mainnet launch on Lisk, we’re excited to provide a more decentralized and user-controlled alternative to existing centralized prediction platforms.”

Key Features of Soccersm’s Decentralized Prediction Market Platform:

* P2P Prediction Pools (Challenge Pools): Users can stake against each other on the outcome of various events, including sports, crypto prices, politics, and pop culture. These decentralized pools provide an engaging way to test predictive skills and potentially earn rewards.
* AI Prediction Agent: Soccersm’s proprietary AI analytics tool offers pre-match predictions and recommendations, making it easier for users to make informed, data-driven bets.
* Balls Games: A series of fun, curated games, including the Wheel of Balls, Random Balls, and No Loss No Balls, where users can win exciting prizes while having fun.
* $Balls Token: The native cryptocurrency of the platform, used for staking, accessing predictions, and participating in games. The more $Balls tokens users stake, the more opportunities they have to earn.

Lisk Airdrop Details

To celebrate the mainnet launch, Soccersm and Lisk are offering an airdrop of 50,000 LSK tokens to all new and existing users, with additional allocations for those holding trophies. Trophies are earned through participating in challenge pools and referrals, and more trophies mean more rewards! The LSK airdrop tokens can only be used in participating challenge pools. All new and existing Soccersm users are eligible. Extra token allocations for users with trophies—more trophies = more tokens!
