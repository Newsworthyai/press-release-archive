Wasatch Front, Utah is one of five regions where 100 local businesses will receive Comcast RISE grants, including Boston, Grand Rapids, Mich., Nashville, Tenn., and Seattle. The 500 total recipients will join the 14,000 entrepreneurs nationwide who have been supported through Comcast RISE since the program launched in 2020.

“Among the many things we all love about Utah is our vibrant small businesses and Comcast’s commitment to supporting them,” said J.D. Keller, senior vice president of Comcast’s Mountain West Region. “The Comcast RISE program will deliver innovative and impactful resources that will make a lasting impact on small businesses in Utah. Supporting small businesses is crucial for economic development and ensuring that the backbone of our communities can thrive.”

I am so grateful for the Comcast RISE program and hope that it can help other businesses in the future because it certainly helped mine."
