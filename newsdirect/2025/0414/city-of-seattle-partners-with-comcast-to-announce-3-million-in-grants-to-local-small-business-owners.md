# City of Seattle Partners with Comcast to Announce $3 Million in Grants to Local Small Business Owners

Today, Comcast announced that it will award 100 small businesses in King County with over $3 million in monetary, marketing, and technology grants through the Comcast RISE program. Expanding upon Mayor Bruce Harrell’s recent announcement to help local businesses grow and succeed, Comcast RISE is supporting the growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs committed to uplifting their local communities with comprehensive grant packages that include a technology makeover, creative production, a media schedule, educational resources, a $5,000 monetary grant, and business consultation services.

"Seattle wouldn’t be Seattle without our small businesses—they create jobs, build community, and add to the vibrancy of our neighborhoods,” said Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell. “From inflation to public safety concerns, I hear directly from business owners about the challenges they face and their desire to succeed here. That’s why we’re excited to welcome the Comcast Rise grant program back to not just Seattle, but all of King County — which offers more than just financial support, but critical investments in technology, marketing and operations to help businesses stabilize, grow and succeed. Our local economy depends on all of us —public and private sectors — working together and leveraging our resources to build a stronger and more resilient economy.”

According to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report last month, revenue concerns are surging as inflation remains a dominant challenge for small businesses. The concern for inflation reached a new high with 58% of small business owners reporting inflation as a top concern. Further, more than 1 in 3 small business owners are concerned about revenue, the highest share since 2021.

“Small business owners are facing significant financial concerns and economic uncertainty, and we want to help,” said Rodrigo Lopez, Region Senior Vice President for Comcast in the Pacific Northwest. “Among the many things we all love about the greater Seattle area is our vibrant small businesses community and we strongly encourage small business owners to apply to Comcast RISE. This program is designed to give you the resources to help your business thrive and contribute to the economic growth and resilience of our community.”

From May 1-31, eligible small businesses in King County can apply for the Comcast RISE program at www.ComcastRISE.com. Winners will be notified in August. Starting in April and throughout May, local small businesses can learn more about the Comcast RISE program, eligibility requirements, and how to apply by attending free information sessions being held by Comcast RISE community partner organizations, including the Bellevue Chamber, Greater Seattle Business Association (GSBA), Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce, and Tabor 100.

“When it comes to small businesses, we all know the challenges: we’ve seen the news, the closure notices, the boarded-up storefronts,” said Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. “But there is good news on the horizon with another round of Comcast RISE grants and services to support Puget Sound region small businesses. Too many of our small businesses are on the bubble, and Comcast is serious about being part of the solution by offering financial support and technology services that help local businesses get a leg up. These businesses are the social fabric of our neighborhoods, and that’s why the Chamber is thrilled to be partnering with Comcast to help our members connect to this opportunity.”

King County is one of five regions selected by Comcast in which 100 local businesses will be awarded the grant package. Other regions where small businesses will be awarded grant packages include Boston (MA), Grand Rapids (MI), Nashville (TN), and South Valley (UT). These recipients join the 14,000 entrepreneurs nationwide who have been selected as Comcast RISE recipients since the program launched in late 2020.
