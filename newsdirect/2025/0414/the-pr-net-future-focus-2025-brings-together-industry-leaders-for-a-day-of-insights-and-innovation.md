The day began with How to Thrive During the Great Media Disruption, which addressed the challenge of building trust and relevance in today’s fragmented landscape. Dan Simon, Founder of Qwoted, emphasized the shift toward community-driven media: “Group chat is really interesting. We can’t fully measure it yet - it’s kind of the dark social of the medium. But once we can, it’ll be clear that people trust people more than they trust brands.” Helen Tobin, Head of Communications at Substack, echoed this theme, adding, “What’s valuable now is having an authentic voice. People subscribe because they feel a genuine connection and want to get someone’s perspective.” Andy Pray, Founder of Praytell, pointed to the role of AI in enhancing storytelling: “AI allows smart people to be smarter. It helps us skip the grunt work and focus on the story.”

The second panel, Social Impact Strategies: The Case for Brands Doing Good, focused on how businesses can build brand equity through purpose. “Doing good is good for business,” said Crystal Carroll, Head of PR at Ulta Beauty. “As a consumer, you want brands that align with your values.” Anna Doré of Rothy’s stressed the need for consistency: “It’s not about short-term sales - it’s about long-term value.” Rachel Henderson Eliff of Fenton added, “When you truly listen to your communities and respond to their needs, it leads to better outcomes - better profits and stronger, more meaningful brands.”

In Owning the Narrative: Staying in Control in the Age of AI, panelists explored how communicators can maintain brand voice while leveraging technology. “Using AI can be like onboarding a new hire,” said Samyutha Reddy, Strategic Advisor and former Head of Marketing at Jasper AI. “It’s smart, but without the right context, training, and time, it won’t be effective.” Parker Olson, Co-Founder of PodPitch, encouraged experimentation: “Go and play with tools. Block your calendar for an hour every Friday to explore. Just play, play, play with AI.” Paul Miser, EVP at 5WPR, framed AI as a strategic asset: “It helps map the ecosystem, define the right narrative, clarify the CEO’s role in it, and build a roadmap for content and thought leadership.” Erica Vlahinos of OpenAI emphasized the human factor: “We’re going to see the currency of what only humans can do increase. People will spend more time connecting and creating—rather than just doing tasks.”

Maximizing Affiliate Marketing in a Changing Media Landscape tackled performance, measurement, and relevance. “Reddit is in the middle or lower funnel—we might hate it as industry people, but it’s the most authentic conversation about your brand that people trust,” said moderator Nik Sharma of Sharma Brands. Courtney Vanpraag of impact.com explained, “With full visibility into every touchpoint, you can see the true impact of your press.” Paddy Cleary of Paul Street urged brands to learn from their audience: “Promote honest reviews from your audience. These channels require very specific approaches.” Teresa Grammatke of eAccountable concluded, “Be where your audience is - whether that’s Reddit, Substack, or anywhere else.”

The panel What’s Next in Influencer Marketing? examined the evolution from celebrity endorsements to community trust. “A brand’s success isn’t just about reaching audiences—it’s about earning their trust through creators and the communities they build,” said Jo Cronk of Whalar. Mary Ogushwitz of Magrino emphasized strategy over scale: “Just having a list of top influencers isn’t strategic and won’t meet your goals.” Sara Feder of WeArisma reinforced the power of smaller voices: “Often, it’s the cool kid in Austin or Atlanta who’s actually making brands relevant.” Patrick Janelle of Untitled Secret added, “With influencers, you either don’t know them—or you’re their biggest fan. That level of affinity is incredibly powerful.”

The Power of Brand Partnerships explored how collaborations can become long-term brand builders. “Our biggest fear is coming into the conversation too late. If there isn’t a story to tell, you can’t just PR it,” said Sara Joseph Noyes of BerlinRosen. Eléonore Dethier of Sotheby’s explained, “Every collaboration must tell an authentic story. Less is more - too many partnerships dilute the brand.” Danielle Bias of MOCA noted, “There’s still space for magic to happen… and the ROI is incredible because you can’t orchestrate it.” Moderator Noria Morales distilled the key takeaway: “Partnerships always take longer than you think you need.”

AI & The Creator Economy: Redefining Influence and Creativity unpacked how AI is shaping the next wave of content creators. “74% of people are more likely to trust someone like them than an institution,” said moderator Tara Hagan of Edelman. Valerie Chapman of INFRM described the next phase: “We’re shifting from the creator economy to the curator economy. Niche communities will emerge - and brands will have to find them.” Edelman’s Alexia Adana added, “We need transparency - not just from big tech companies, but also from brands.” Melissa Grevstad of Dove grounded the discussion in brand purpose: “Our north star is real beauty. Technology will come and go, but our compass remains.”

Seeing the Brand Everywhere: Activating Brand Love at Scale centered on distribution and omnichannel relevance. “Distribution will become increasingly important,” said moderator James Nord of Fohr. “Influencers help you reach the nooks and crannies of the internet.” Marriott’s Stephanie Goldstein explained the shift in value: “The traditional model doesn’t score well when you factor in cost to produce and where attention is focused.” Meredith McLuckie of DICK’S Sporting Goods added, “Influencer content outperforms brand content - and costs a fraction of traditional media.”

In The Future of Travel & Hospitality Marketing, panelists emphasized experience and storytelling. “It’s all about that 360-degree approach,” said David Zapata of Zapwater Communications. Jamari A. Douglas of Bermuda Tourism Authority noted, “People love personalization - but we also need to be honest about how we use their data.” Sarah Evans of J/PR added, “Luxury is different for everyone - today it’s not about what’s hot, but what stories we have to tell.”

The day closed with What is PR Today… and Where is it Going?, a candid look at the current state and future of communications. “Sometimes in PR, you have to say, ‘That’s not going to happen,’” said Gabrielle Gambrell of Hachette Book Group. Anthropologie’s Kate Haldy underscored values-driven storytelling: “Gen Z is shopping for values, purpose, and alignment… and holding brands accountable.” Josh Rosenberg of Day One Agency reflected on changing targeting strategies: “Culture is so niche now - it’s about connecting the brand truth to the fan truth.” Vanessa von Bismarck of BPCM offered a closing thought: “AI can make the grunt work easier, but we’re still in the business of human connection.”

The 2025 Future Focus Conference offered a day of thought leadership, bold ideas, and meaningful connection - cementing its role as a must-attend event for marketers, communicators, and creatives shaping what’s next.
