# Peru Officially Inaugurates Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai

Peru officially inaugurated its national pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai, marking a significant milestone in its participation in one of the world’s most prominent cultural and economic events. The opening ceremony was led by Peru’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, Desilú León Chempén, alongside the Ambassador of Peru to Japan, Roberto Seminario, and Commissioner General of the Peru Pavilion, Daniel Cavero.

Held under the theme “Infinite Possibilities,” the Peru Pavilion offers a dynamic platform to project the country’s rich cultural, historical, and natural heritage to the world. The initiative, led by PROMPERÚ, integrates tradition, innovation, and sustainability, promoting an image of Peru as an opportunity-rich, future-oriented nation.

Minister León Chempén emphasized the significance of Peru’s participation: “Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai is one of the most important global events for cultural, economic, and diplomatic exchange. With over 28 million visitors expected, it presents an unprecedented opportunity to showcase Peru’s richness, diversity, and potential to the world. Our participation, aligned with the theme ‘Infinite Possibilities,’ allows us to promote an image of Peru as an innovative, sustainable, and opportunity-rich country.”

Guests explored immersive exhibitions such as “The Treasures of the Lord of Sipán” and “Peru and Japan”, celebrating the historical and cultural ties between both nations. Live gastronomic demonstrations delighted attendees with tastings of Peru’s iconic dishes, including ceviche, and the world-famous cocktail pisco sour, made from the country’s national spirit, pisco.

As part of the inaugural event, the Embassy of Peru in Japan unveiled Pukara-chan, the official mascot of the pavilion. Inspired by the traditional toro de Pucará—a symbol of prosperity and protection—Pukara-chan was specially created to commemorate 150 years of diplomatic relations between Peru and Japan. The character will serve as a cultural ambassador throughout the duration of the Expo.

The Peru Pavilion promises an engaging experience, inviting visitors to discover the country’s unique blend of ancient traditions, natural wonders, world-renowned cuisine, and modern innovation. With a vision toward a sustainable and interconnected future, the pavilion reflects Peru’s unwavering belief in a world of infinite possibilities.
