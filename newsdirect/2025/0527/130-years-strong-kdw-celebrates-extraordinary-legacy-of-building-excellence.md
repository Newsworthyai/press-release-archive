# 130 Years Strong: KDW Celebrates Extraordinary Legacy of Building Excellence

KDW, an award-winning Texas design-build firm, is celebrating an extraordinary milestone — 130 years of continuous, multigenerational family-owned operations. Since its founding in 1895, the company has grown from a reputable and respected East Texas construction business to Texas’ premier design-builder.

"Celebrating 130 years in business is a rare and humbling milestone. It’s a testament to the enduring relationships we’ve built along the way,” said KDW Co-founder and CEO Keith Dalton. “We are profoundly grateful to the clients who have trusted us to bring their visions to life. Their partnership and friendship have fueled our growth, inspired our innovation, and sustained our legacy that began with a simple promise: to go beyond for every client. We carry that promise forward with pride and purpose, with a commitment to deliver every project with excellence and integrity for generations to come.”

In 1895, the Kingham family established its first construction company in Nacogdoches, Texas, where it shaped the infrastructure of East Texas, building schools, hospitals, churches and several Stephen F. Austin State University buildings. In 2004, the business entered a new era with the launch of Kingham Dalton Wilson, Ltd. (KDW), a strategic partnership between the Kingham family, Keith Dalton and Welcome Wilson Jr. that brought together their respective years of experience with forward-thinking practices needed to meet the needs of global and domestic companies.

Today, KDW operates from offices in Houston, Austin and Nacogdoches, supporting clients in commercial and industrial sectors with an integrated, single-contract design-build model staffed by in-house architects, in-house designers and multidisciplinary building professionals.

KDW is a one-stop partner for global, national and local businesses alike. Its portfolio of more than 2,500 projects includes award-winning work for Elin Energy and Waaree Solar, state-of-the-art manufacturing and logistics facilities for Goya Foods, Sika and MAN Energy Solutions, advanced recycling centers for Balcones Resources, and destination venues such as Typhoon Texas Waterparks and the Fredonia Hotel.

The firm has built more than $1 billion in projects since 1895 but recognizes its true impact in its long-standing relationships. By prioritizing open collaboration with clients, design partners and trade professionals, KDW establishes the foundation of trust and transparency that leads to successful completions.
