This FDA registration enables Adia Labs to distribute Adia Vita nationwide, expanding access to cutting-edge stem cell therapies for doctors and clinics across the country. With traditional stem cell treatments often costing between $15,000 and $35,000 per procedure, Adia Med stands out by offering high-quality therapies at more affordable rates, fueling rapid client growth.

Adia Nutrition’s growth trajectory in 2025 has been marked by several key corporate advancements. In February, the company took steps to strengthen its financial and operational foundation by retiring 25 million undocumented shares, successfully removing its shell risk designation, and launching Adia Labs LLC. These strategic moves not only reinforce investor confidence but also set the stage for an OTCQB uplisting, which will enhance the company’s market visibility and liquidity.

To accelerate its expansion, Adia Med is forming partnerships with elite Medical Spas, establishing satellite locations that provide a scalable and low-risk model for nationwide growth. With over 4.5 million Florida residents aged 65 and older, Adia Med is uniquely positioned to address a significant demand for age-related treatments, particularly for conditions like Alzheimer’s and autoimmune disorders.

With the expansion of TPE, the nationwide rollout of Adia Vita, and the impending OTCQB uplisting, ADIA is entering a phase of rapid growth. As Adia Nutrition Inc. (OTC: ADIA) continues to scale operations and push the boundaries of regenerative medicine, it is well-positioned to deliver innovative healthcare solutions while generating value for investors, making it a stock to keep an eye on.

Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: FATE) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in iPSC-derived cellular immunotherapies.
