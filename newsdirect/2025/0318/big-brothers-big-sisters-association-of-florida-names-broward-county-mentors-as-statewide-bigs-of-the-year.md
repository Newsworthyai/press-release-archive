# Big Brothers Big Sisters Association of Florida
names Broward County mentors as statewide Bigs of the Year

Big Brothers Big Sisters Association of Florida selected Broward County volunteer mentors Brian McGrath and Samara Minichiello as Big Brother and Big Sister of the Year for the state of Florida. McGrath and Minichiello, who were chosen from more than 10,000 mentors at 11 agencies across the state, are now in contention for the National Big of the Year awarded by Big Brother Big Sisters of America. The national honor will be announced in April.

“We are so proud that two of our Bigs were chosen for this statewide honor,” said Malena Mendez, President and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County. “Brian and Samara epitomize how effective mentoring changes the lives of youth for the better, forever. Because of their efforts, we see their Littles thrive, become stronger and more confident, while laying down a strong foundation for future success.”

Big Brother of the Year Brian McGrath was matched with Bryson when he was a shy 8-year-old facing a myriad of challenges. His Big became a stable and supportive figure in his life, and over the past four years, Brian has encouraged Bryson in academics, sports, and personal growth, helping him build confidence, resilience, and important life skills. From bonding over basketball to reading together, their relationship has blossomed into a true friendship. Brian’s consistent support and dedication have made a lasting difference in Bryson's life.

Big Sister of the Year Samara Minichiello has been a Big Sister to 13-year-old Jahniya for nearly three years. She has supported Jahniya through multiple trials, ranging from a precarious home situation to her mother’s debilitating illness. Minichiello describes her Little as “the poster child for resilience,” and has developed a special bond with Jahniya, rooted in trust and doing the right thing – even when it’s difficult. In addition to being a stand-out Big Sister, Samara has encouraged her friends and family to become Bigs and currently serves as co-chair for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward’s Women on the Verge, which raised funds for scholarships.

“The influence and impact that Brian and Samara have demonstrated in their respective long term mentoring relationships is undeniable and is a clear example of how one person’s commitment, support and dedication can unlock their Little’s potential. Congratulations Brian and Samara, said Daniel G. Prinzing, CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters Association of Florida.”
