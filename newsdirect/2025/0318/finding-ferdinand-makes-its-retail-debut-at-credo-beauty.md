# Finding Ferdinand Makes Its Retail Debut At Credo Beauty

Finding Ferdinand, the sister-run brand on a mission to elevate your everyday routine with vegan, skin-loving formulas, is making its retail debut through a partnership with Credo Beauty. The clean beauty brand will be available online on credobeauty.com on March 18, 2025, and will roll out to 14 Credo Beauty stores nationwide.

Founded in 2015 by Nhu Le and now run alongside her sister, My Le, Finding Ferdinand celebrates its 10-year anniversary this year, marking a decade of innovation in color cosmetics. Nhu and My’s inspiration for the brand came from the incredible women in their family, especially their mother, a two-time cancer survivor whose strength continues to inspire the brand’s deep commitment to clean formulas.

"We’re excited to partner with Credo Beauty, a brand and team we deeply admire for their commitment to clean beauty, sustainability, and education. Like Credo, we’re passionate about creating products that not only perform exceptionally well but also resonate with our clients on a personal level. We're thrilled to see our black lip balm become a daily essential for so many and look forward to continuing to connect with the amazing community through Credo’s incredible in-store experience," said Nhu Le, Founder of Finding Ferdinand.

“Credo Beauty is excited to be the first retail partner of Finding Ferdinand, bringing their beautiful products and unique brand vision to our passionate community. Their dedication to sustainability and clean, high-performance formulations aligns perfectly with our values. We love how they connect with customers through custom creations, and their viral black lip balm—offering the perfect touch of color and hydration—has quickly become a daily essential for the Credo team," said Jessica Trieber, VP of Brands at Credo Beauty.

Finding Ferdinand’s clean, high-performance beauty essentials are designed for the way you live: easy to wear, impossible to mess up, and always a perfect fit. The brand is best known for its cult-favorite product, The Black Lip Balm, which went viral and sold out 10x, thanks to its innovative, buildable color payoff that enhances any natural lip color.

The brand is also set to launch an all-new limited-edition Raspberry shade of its iconic lip balms in tandem with the retail launch on March 18. This hydrating, sheer balm will feature a dark red buildable hue with cool undertones and medium shine, along with a delicious raspberry scent for a sensory experience.

Starting on March 18, the following Finding Ferdinand products will be available at Credo Beauty:

* Delicious Balms ($26 each; 6 shades available at Credo Beauty): Super hydrating and moisturizing sheer lip balms with just a touch of color and a delicious scent. Buildable colors that are easy to wear every day, each paired with its own distinctive scent.
* Delicate Gloss ($26 each; 6 shades available at Credo Beauty): A non-sticky lip gloss infused with marula oil and nyamplung seed oil with a touch of color, perfect by itself or on top of a lipstick for an extra shiny finish.
* Tender Blush ($28 each; 6 shades available at Credo Beauty): A lightweight cream blush infused with Squalane that blends easily into the skin for a buildable touch of color.

Finding Ferdinand products are 100% vegan and cruelty-free, offering proprietary cosmetic formulations that are clean and non-toxic. Finding Ferdinand takes to heart being a part of creating a better future for the world, and is committed to keeping the brand’s production sustainable - from working in small batches to prioritizing recyclable, recycled, or refillable components.
