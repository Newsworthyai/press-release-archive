# Text becomes HubSpot App Partner with a certified integration

Today, Text announced that it has built a LiveChat integration for HubSpot and has joined HubSpot’s App Partner Program as an app partner with a certified integration. HubSpot, the customer platform for scaling companies, works hand-in-hand with App Partners to help grow their business by extending the product value of their apps and distributing quality apps through the HubSpot App Marketplace.

The direct connection between LiveChat and HubSpot makes managing leads easier and more efficient. By eliminating the need for manual data entry and switching between systems, users can save time and reduce costs. With just a click, they can nurture leads, create support cases, update customer information, and store chat transcripts - all in one place.

“Our customers want to achieve great results fast, and we’re always looking to provide solutions and tools that will help them do their jobs quickly and streamline operations,” said Scott Brinker, VP of platform ecosystem at HubSpot. “Text’s offering is a great option for achieving that efficiency, and we’re excited that they’re a part of the App Partner Program.”

HubSpot’s App Partner Program is an ecosystem of valuable third-party integrations. Certified integrations demonstrate an investment in product quality and customer experience.

“Becoming a HubSpot App Partner with a certified integration for LiveChat is an exciting achievement for the Text team. By integrating with HubSpot, we’re enabling both Text and HubSpot customers to amplify their engagement strategies, streamline their workflows, and drive meaningful growth, reaching billions of users. ”, said Szymon Klimczak, Chief Growth Officer of Text. “Together, we’re unlocking new opportunities for businesses to connect with their audiences in more impactful ways.”
