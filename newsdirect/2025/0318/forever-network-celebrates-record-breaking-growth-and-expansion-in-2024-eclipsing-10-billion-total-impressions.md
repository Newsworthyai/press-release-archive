Forever Network, one of the fastest-growing and most engaged independent sports content brands in the world and a trailblazer in sports media, today announced it achieved unprecedented milestones in 2024, setting new benchmarks for engagement, global reach and strategic expansion. The company saw 176% increase in total impressions when compared to what was recorded in 2023, underscoring the network’s rapid and sustained growth.

Forever Network's sports verticals experienced unparalleled engagement during the year, as reported by Comscore. Some of the headline data from 2024 included:

* Forever Network amassed 10.87 billion impressions and reached 372 million unique individuals.

In the United States, Basketball Forever ranked 22nd overall and 8th in sports for total digital media actions and engagements according to Comscore. In Australia, the company maintained its number one ranking for the fifth consecutive year. The company now reaches 65 million unique users monthly in the U.S. and 400 million globally each year, with no signs of slowing down.

“Getting ranked so high by ComScore legitimizes the hard work we have put in since expanding and establishing a North American presence at the beginning of 2024,” said Alex Sumsky, CEO and co-founder of Forever Network. “We couldn’t be here without our devoted team and their commitment to user experience, ensuring we are people’s go-to source and have the best content for all things basketball, football, hockey, baseball soccer and cricket. This also provides us with a significant benchmark for measuring our success as we continue to establish ourselves as a major player in the sports media world in the US and across the world.”

In total, Forever Network reached over 302 million unique individuals from its most popular countries including the United States, Philippines, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. With the upcoming expansions into combat sports, Esports, tennis and golf, projections estimate that Forever Network will amass 18.5 billion impressions by the end of 2025.

Forever Network also secured major deals with top-tier wagering, betting and data analytics companies in both the U.S. and European iGaming markets, including DraftKings, BetMGM, FanDuel, 888 and others. Forever Network also executed 2024’s most engaged betting partnership on Meta through a collaboration between FN and Rivalry and tallied over $2 million in partner revenue for 2024.

Additionally, proprietary iGaming products will debut both in the U.S. and internationally, targeting over 100,000 active users in their first year. The company's free-to-play game, V.O.A.T., has already attracted 50,000 active players, even before its full-scale launch and marketing efforts, signaling massive growth potential.

“The popularity we have achieved and growth we have experienced since the start of 2024 is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Basketball Forever Chief Strategy Officer Nick Kelland. “With plans for four new verticals to debut this year and our proprietary iGaming product, there is no end in sight to our growth and where 2025 can take us.”
