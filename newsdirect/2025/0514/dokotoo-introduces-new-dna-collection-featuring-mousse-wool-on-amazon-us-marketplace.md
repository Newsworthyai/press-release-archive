# Dokotoo Introduces New DNA Collection Featuring Mousse Wool on Amazon US Marketplace

Dokotoo, an emerging women’s fashion brand, has announced the launch of its DNA Collection on Amazon’s U.S. platform—a line crafted from a proprietary “Mousse Wool” fabric. This latest release, described as a gesture of appreciation to the brand’s dedicated customer base, blends technical innovation with timeless design—a signature move for a label that has quietly led the lightweight knitwear niche.

The collection includes a curated range of lightweight sweaters, cardigans, and blouses designed for versatile wear. Presented in neutral tones such as oat milk, charcoal, and dusty rose, the pieces are intended to offer both practical layering and year-round comfort. The introduction of Mousse Wool forms part of Dokotoo’s ongoing product development strategy to enhance fabric performance without compromising on aesthetic appeal.

“Our design direction has always been informed by customer preferences for garments that suit everyday movement and varied environments,” said Kim Lee, Brand Development Director at Dokotoo. “With the DNA Collection, we aimed to develop a textile solution that balances comfort, thermal efficiency, and long-term durability.”

Dokotoo’s strategy stands apart from fast-fashion norms. Since its debut in 2019, the brand has focused on “slow-burn staples”—pieces designed for repeated wear rather than seasonal trends. This approach has cultivated a dedicated following; its Lightweight Knitted Blouse, a bestseller with over 8,000 ratings, is frequently referred to as a “workwear secret weapon” in online forums.

Yet the true test of the collection lies in its longevity. As Lee notes, “We didn’t create something simply ‘pretty for now’. This fabric is intended to withstand years of wear and washing. That’s how you honour loyalty.”

The DNA Collection is available exclusively on Amazon U.S., reaffirming Dokotoo’s commitment to accessible distribution and consistent quality.
