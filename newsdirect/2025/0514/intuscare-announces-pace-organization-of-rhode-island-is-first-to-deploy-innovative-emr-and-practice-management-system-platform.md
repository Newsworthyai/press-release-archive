# IntusCare Announces PACE Organization of Rhode Island is First to Deploy Innovative EMR and Practice Management System Platform

IntusCare, a technology leader in the PACE market, today announced that PACE Organization of Rhode Island (PACE-RI) has officially gone live with IntusCare CareHub, an EMR and practice management system built for PACE’s value-based care model. PACE-RI is one of the nation’s most innovative Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). The successful launch marks a major milestone in a years-long partnership between the two organizations that has been defined by co-creation, trust, and an implementation model centered on deep collaboration.

To prepare PACE-RI for the launch, IntusCare delivered a fully immersive, white-glove implementation for PACE-RI, reflecting its commitment to long-term success. The support included in-person workflow discovery sessions with operational subject matter experts and super users, as well as twice-weekly SOP alignment meetings to evolve internal processes alongside CareHub’s capabilities. IntusCare also led a four-day, on-site training bootcamp spanning multiple PACE-RI centers and conducted weekly readiness scoring calls with PACE-RI leadership. During go-live, the team implemented a three-day, center-wide support structure and ensured hands-on involvement from IntusCare’s product team throughout every stage of the process.

“This wasn’t just a rollout, it was a joint effort to reimagine how our teams work and collaborate,” said Joan Kwiatkowski, MSW, Chief Executive Officer at PACE-RI. “What excites us most about CareHub is that it’s built for PACE, with PACE. From the start, it’s been thoughtfully designed around the unique needs of our model. We’re confident it will help us operate more efficiently and stay better connected across teams.”

In the months ahead, CareHub is expected to deliver measurable gains in interdisciplinary team coordination, reduce documentation time, and improve visibility across clinical and operational workflows. “The ability to link CareHub with other IntusCare products like IRIS and Analytics creates a powerful, all-in-one solution for our clinical and administrative teams,” said Liz Boucher, Chief of Organizational Performance at PACE-RI. CareHub will help us work more efficiently and reduce the burden on staff, creating a happier workforce and freeing up time to focus on caring for our participants. And when we can spend more time with participants, we see better outcomes—especially when paired with easier access to key data that enables earlier, more effective interventions.”

PACE-RI’s leadership and frontline staff have played a foundational role in the development of CareHub through their work on the CareHub Product Steering Committee, whose input has directly shaped features like IDT tasking tools, intuitive care planning modules, and embedded compliance support. That collaboration will continue as PACE-RI expands its use of CareHub and helps guide future enhancements.

“As our first partner, PACE-RI has helped us build something truly transformative for the PACE community,” said Robbie Felton, Chief Executive Officer at IntusCare. “This go-live isn’t just the culmination of a product build—it’s the start of a new era in how technology supports participant care.”
