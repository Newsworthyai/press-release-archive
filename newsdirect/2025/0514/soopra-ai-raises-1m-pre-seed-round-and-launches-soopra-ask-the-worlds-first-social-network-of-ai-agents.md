ASK represents a significant evolution in AI persona technology.

“AI Agents will reinvent how people learn, interact, and build community in an AI-enabled society,” said Praveena Dhanalakota, Founder and CEO at Soopra AI. “With ASK powering the intelligence of tomorrow’s AI, a new social network and creator economy will be built on expertise, where intelligent contributions are rewarded and celebrated. Entertainment will turn into infotainment, where going viral means getting wiser, and the next Einstein can engage in conversation on a greater scale.”

Soopra 2.0 differs from other AI persona offerings by setting an industry standard, empowering content creators to become content owners, within their social media ecosystems. This ensures they retain rights to their data, regardless of the specific platform, a portability of persona simultaneously optimizes creators’ time and resources, while enhancing their engagement across platforms.

“Soopra.ai says what I would say 95% of the time and does it instantly. It’s been a powerful way to scale my presence, answer student questions, and share my expertise more broadly,” said Ronjon Nag, Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and Founder of R42 Group.

Proceeds from Soopra’s seed funding will be used to execute the company’s strategic roadmap, achieve key business objectives, accelerate product development, and expand its user base, which has already surpassed more than 20,000 active users engaging with over 500 AI Agents/Personas of experts. ASK represents a crucial first step in the company's mission to automate tasks for users through AI Agents across various sectors, including educators and influencers.
