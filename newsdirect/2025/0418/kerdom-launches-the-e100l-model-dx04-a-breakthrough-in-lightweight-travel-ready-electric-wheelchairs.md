# KERDOM Launches the E100L (Model DX04): A Breakthrough in Lightweight, Travel-Ready Electric Wheelchairs

KERDOM, a U.S.-based leader in personal mobility innovation, is proud to announce the official launch of its most advanced electric wheelchair yet — the E100L (Model DX04). This model sets a new benchmark in lightweight design, everyday comfort, and true travel readiness for seniors, caregivers, and individuals seeking a more independent lifestyle.

Weighing only 33 lbs (without battery), the DX04 is the lightest wheelchair in KERDOM’s lineup, purpose-built for users who need portability without compromising safety or performance. Its compact frame folds in just three seconds, making it ideal for storage in tight spaces, fitting easily in car trunks, airplane compartments, closets, and more.

Designed to provide freedom and independence, especially for older adults, the DX04 helps users regain control of their daily mobility. Its lightweight construction allows for easy lifting and handling by seniors and caregivers alike, while the airline-approved battery system makes it ideal for those who travel frequently. For those searching for a truly Lightweight and Travel-Friendly Wheelchair, the DX04 delivers an exceptional balance of performance, comfort, and portability.

Lightweight, Compact, and TSA-Approved

The Model DX04 offers a powerful combination of portability and ease of use. It features a sleek silver aluminum alloy frame that’s not only stylish but also highly durable. When folded, the chair measures just 29” L x 12” W x 22” H, yet when fully extended, it delivers a comfortable ride with 40" L x 23" W x 37" H dimensions and 17.5” of seat width.

Its tight 22-inch turning radius allows for smooth maneuvering in small indoor areas such as hallways and kitchens, while 12” rear wheels and dual 250W brushless motors provide stable and quiet navigation across outdoor surfaces like gravel, grass, and ramps.

Designed with Strength and Style

Comfort is a top priority in the DX04’s design. It includes a breathable ergonomic seat cushion with a width of 17.5 inches, a depth of 16 inches, and 2 inches of supportive padding. The seat height from the floor is a comfortable 19 inches, offering easy access and a natural seated position. Armrests flip up for convenient side entry and the joystick can be positioned on either armrest based on user preference.

The chair supports up to 350 lbs, making it reliable for a broad range of users without sacrificing performance or comfort.

Flexible Power Options to Meet Diverse Travel Needs

Designed for both daily errands and extended journeys, the DX04 offers adaptable power solutions to suit varying mobility requirements. Users can select from:

Standard Battery: 24V 12AH lithium-ion (up to 15 miles range)

Extended Battery Option: Dual 24V 20AH lithium-ion (up to 30 miles range)

All battery packs are airline-safe, removable, and easy to recharge, enabling greater flexibility and control over travel distance and charging frequency.

Comfort That Lasts All Day

Recognizing the importance of lasting comfort, especially for frequent users, the DX04 is equipped with an ergonomic seat featuring breathable padding, a 17.5-inch seat width, and a seat height of 19 inches from floor to cushion. Lift-up armrests provide convenient side access, while the joystick controller is designed for left- or right-side mounting to accommodate individual preferences.

To ensure a worry-free experience, KERDOM offers a 5-year warranty on the frame, along with a 7-day risk-free trial and a 60-day return or exchange policy.

The KERDOM E100L (Model DX04) is available now for pre-order with early shipping scheduled for June. Orders include free delivery across the continental United States.
