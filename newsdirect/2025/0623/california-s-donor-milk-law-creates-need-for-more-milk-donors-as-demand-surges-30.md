# California's Donor Milk Law Creates Need for More Milk Donors as Demand Surges 30%

Six months after California's groundbreaking Assembly Bill 3059 expanded insurance coverage and hospital access to life-saving donor milk, Mothers’ Milk Bank California is facing a 30% surge in demand, leaving vulnerable newborns at risk of going without this essential nutrition. Mothers’ Milk Bank California is urging eligible nursing mothers to donate and help meet the growing needs of medically fragile newborns across the state.

AB3059, also known as the Human Milk Bill, mandates commercial insurance coverage for medically necessary pasteurized donor human milk, treating it as an essential health benefit. It also clarifies that hospitals do not need a tissue bank license to distribute milk from a licensed tissue bank, eliminating a key barrier to access.

While this legislation represents a tremendous victory for vulnerable infants and their families by making life-saving donor milk more accessible and affordable, it has created an unprecedented surge in demand that is straining the current supply. The expanded insurance coverage means more families can now access donor milk for their medically fragile babies, but the donor base has not kept pace with the new surge in demand for human milk.

Without additional donors, wait times for families may increase, and some infants who desperately need donor milk may face delays in receiving this vital nutrition. The success of AB3059 depends not only on policy change but on community action. Eligible mothers can help bridge this supply gap to try to ensure every baby who needs donor milk can receive it without delay.

“This is a breakthrough in equitable neonatal care,” said Jennifer Benito, CEO of Mothers’ Milk Bank California. “But we need the public’s help to meet the rising demand to try to ensure that every baby receives this lifesaving nourishment.”

In 2023, California recorded over 36,000 preterm births, and many of these fragile infants relied on donor milk to thrive. Now, use of donor milk is increasing not only in NICUs but also in Well Baby and Postpartum units, where emerging research shows it may reduce feeding complications, support gut health, and lower the risk of hospital readmissions, even for full-term newborns.

“We’ve normalized blood donation as a vital act of generosity. It’s time we do the same for breast milk,” said Benito. “Because of AB3059, Mothers’ Milk Bank California is seeing a dramatic 30% increase in demand for donor milk—a spike we believe is directly tied to expanded insurance coverage and the removal of the tissue bank license requirement for hospitals. Every ounce donated can mean the difference between stability and struggle for a newborn.”
