# Cisco &amp; Qualcomm Extend Direxion’s Edge in Single Stock Daily Leveraged &amp; Inverse ETFs

Direxion, a leading provider of ETFs for tactical traders, and a pioneer in Single Stock Daily Leveraged & Inverse ETFs, expanded its industry-leading lineup of high-powered trading tools with the launch of four new funds tracking the performance of Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM). These funds provide traders with amplified, or inverse, exposure to CSCO or QCOM via the Direxion Daily CSCO Bull 2X ETF (Ticker: CSCL) and Direxion Daily CSCO Bear 1X ETF (Ticker: CSCS), or the Direxion Daily QCOM Bull 2X ETF (Ticker: QCMU) and Direxion Daily QCOM Bear 1X ETF (Ticker: QCMD).

“Cisco and Qualcomm are at the forefront of networking and wireless innovation, sectors that are integral to the digital economy,” said Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion. “By introducing these ETFs, we empower traders to capitalize on short-term movements in these pivotal technology stocks, reflecting our commitment to providing targeted tools for dynamic market engagement."

Designed for active traders, Direxion’s pairs of Single Stock Leveraged & Inverse ETFs are built for short-term trading – not long-term investing. These ground-breaking trading tools are intended for experienced traders with a high risk tolerance. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these products track the price of a single stock rather than an index, offering no diversification benefits.

All Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center, where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if Leveraged and Inverse ETFs – including Single Stock Daily LETFs – are right for you.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in CSCO or QCOM.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in a Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund's investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning.

Leverage Risk – The Bull Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. A total loss may occur in a single day. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund’s correlation with CSCO or QCOM and may increase the volatility of the Bull Fund.

Daily Correlation Risk - A number of factors may affect the Bull Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with CSCO or QCOM and therefore achieve its daily leveraged investment objective. The Bull Fund’s exposure to CSCO or QCOM is impacted by CSCO or QCOM’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bull Fund will be perfectly exposed to CSCO or QCOM at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bull Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to CSCO or QCOM increases on days when CSCO or QCOM is volatile near the close of the trading day.

Daily Inverse Correlation Risk - A number of factors may affect the Bear Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of inverse correlation with CSCO or QCOM and therefore achieve its daily inverse investment objective. The Bear Fund’s exposure to CSCO or QCOM is impacted by CSCO or QCOM’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bear Fund will be perfectly exposed to CSCO or QCOM at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bear Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to CSCO or QCOM increases on days when CSCO or QCOM is volatile near the close of the trading day.

Cisco Systems, Inc. Investing Risk – Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. Cisco Systems, Inc. faces risks associated with: impacts on operations from various avenues; supply chain disruptions; volatility of sales to service providers and cloud markets; changes in distribution; high competition; need to manage strategic alliances; complexities of inventory management; changes in supply and demand for software subscriptions; reliance on new product development; among other risks.

QUALCOMM Incorporated Investing Risk – Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. QCOM faces risks associated with: concentration of revenues amongst a small number of customers; vertical integration; concentration of business in China; requirements to grow the business and add new products and services; inability to profit from acquisitions and strategic transactions; limitations in supply chain and in demand for products and services; among other risks.

Information Technology Sector Risk – The value of stocks of information technology companies, and companies that rely heavily on technology, is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation, and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from competitors with lower production costs.

Semiconductor Industry Risk – Semiconductor companies may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on such companies’ profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Companies in the semiconductor industry may have products that face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel.

Additional risks of each Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, and Cash Transaction Risk. Additionally, for the Direxion Daily CSCO Bear 1X ETF and Direxion Daily QCOM Bear 1X ETF, Shorting or Inverse Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of a Fund.
