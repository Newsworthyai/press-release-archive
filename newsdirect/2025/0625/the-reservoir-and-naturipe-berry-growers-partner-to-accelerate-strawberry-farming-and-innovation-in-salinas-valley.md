# The Reservoir and Naturipe Berry Growers Partner to Accelerate Strawberry Farming and Innovation in Salinas Valley

The Reservoir, a California nonprofit building a new system for agricultural innovation, has partnered with Naturipe Berry Growers, Inc., one of North America’s oldest and most respected strawberry growers, to bring dedicated farming innovation and commercialization to Reservoir Farms, its flagship on-farm startup incubator in Salinas Valley. As the second farming partner following Tanimura & Antle, Naturipe brings deep berry-growing expertise, reinforcing Reservoir Farm’s commitment to advancing high-quality specialty crops. The partnership lays the foundation for a long-term innovation, bridging cutting-edge research with real-world farming systems.

Located at the intersection of Highway 68 and Hitchcock Road, the Reservoir Farms site is minutes from downtown Salinas and sits in the heart of one of the most productive specialty crop regions in the world. With 15 acres under development, Reservoir Farms is purpose-built to provide startups with direct access to farmland, infrastructure, and growers—offering the kind of in-field testing and feedback loop that’s essential for bringing new technologies to market.

Under the terms of the partnership, Naturipe will manage an initial five acres of strawberries at Reservoir Farms, overseeing all aspects of planting, field preparation, harvesting, and production. The company will also work closely with The Reservoir and participating startups to explore opportunities for technology integration, field validation, and innovation in sustainable farming.

“Naturipe brings unmatched farming leadership, a deep-rooted commitment to the Salinas Valley, and a strong belief in what’s next for agriculture,” said Danny Bernstein, founder and CEO of The Reservoir. “This partnership represents the best of what Reservoir Farms is about—bringing experienced growers together with innovators to build practical, scalable solutions that serve the entire agricultural community.”

The collaboration represents hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual in-kind value, contributed by Naturipe in the form of operational support, infrastructure, and agronomic expertise. In recognition of its leadership, Naturipe will be named a Premier Sponsor of Reservoir Farms and will play a central role in shaping both operations and strategic programming on-site.

“We see Reservoir Farms as a unique platform to accelerate innovation that’s grounded in real farming,” said Hank Guerrero, Vice President of Ag Operations at Naturipe Berry Growers. “Our partnership is a natural extension of our values—supporting a stronger, smarter, and more sustainable future for specialty crop agriculture.”

A New Model for AgTech DeploymentFounded in 2024, the Reservoir is building a new ecosystem for agricultural innovation—connecting startups, growers, and institutions to solve generational challenges in farming. Reservoir Farms is its flagship program: a nonprofit, on-farm startup incubator that helps agricultural robotics, automation, and digital solutions scale faster by embedding them in working production environments.

Reservoir Farms Salinas is the first of multiple locations set to launch across California, with the goal of bridging the gap between prototype and adoption by breaking down the barriers separating Silicon Valley innovation from farmland. With support from partners like Naturipe, startups will be able to iterate rapidly, generate critical performance data, and build trust with the growers who rely on their tools.

Reservoir Farms will dedicate portions of its acreage to key crops in Salinas Valley—starting with strawberries, leafy greens, and vegetables—using staggered planting schedules and variable plot sizes to support a wide range of pilot activity. The site will also feature co-working facilities, infrastructure for equipment testing, and shared services to support early-stage ventures.

Built to Scale Impact Across AgricultureReservoir Farms is committed to:

* Empowering Farmers: Providing access to the latest technologies to help address labor shortages, improve yields, and reduce input costs.
* Accelerating Startups: Supporting over 50 early-stage companies within the first five years through direct field engagement.
* Boosting the Local Economy: Creating over 500 high-quality jobs and new career pathways in high-tech agriculture.
* Driving Sustainability: Piloting technologies that support water efficiency, improved soil health, and regenerative farming practices.

“This initiative reinforces the Salinas Valley’s role as a global leader in agricultural innovation,” Bernstein said. “Together with Naturipe, we’re building a launchpad that turns visionary ideas into practical, profitable, and climate-resilient solutions for California and beyond.”

The official groundbreaking for Reservoir Farms is planned for late summer 2025.
