# CryptoELITES Makes A Jaw-Dropping Ethereum Price Prediction While Investors Stock Up On Ripple And Elluminex Before The Next Bull Run

People in the crypto space are talking because a prominent analyst, CryptoELITES, issued an unexpected price prediction for Ethereum (ETH). He predicts a potential surge to $10K soon. Meanwhile, investors choose to stockpile Ripple (XRP) and Elluminex (ELX) before the next bull run starts.

While XRP is one of the top 10 altcoins rising on the price charts, ELX is a presale star that could redefine the DeFi space forever. It aims to bring DeFi to the TON Blockchain, which now boasts over 950M users and around 1B recorded transactions. Therefore, Elluminex is set to become one of the hottest new DeFi projects in 2025. Some experts even predict a potential 7x surge for ELX this cycle.

CryptoELITES: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) May Skyrocket To $10,000Ethereum (ETH) is a top 5 cryptocurrency that is seeing some volatility right now. On the one-week chart, its value has fallen from around $3,300 to nearly $3,250. In other words, there was nearly a 5% drop in the Ethereum price in just a few short days, as per CoinMarketCap.

Nevertheless, market expert CryptoELITES remains optimistic for Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, nothing is stopping this crypto coin from potentially reaching $10,000. This Ethereum price prediction has turned many heads in the crypto community.

However, it is worth mentioning that the Ethereum market cap now sits at around $400B. ETH will need much new money to see a big price jump. On the other hand, crypto coins like ELX will not face this issue.

Prominent Expert Forecasts The Ripple (XRP) Price May Rip Through $8On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) has been rising on the price charts. This altcoin has experienced over a 45% price surge in the past 30 days, as per CoinMarketCap. The Ripple price grew from around $2.20 to over $3.20 during that time.

The community is also turning towards Ripple (XRP) thanks to some bullish statements from Mikybull. In a recent X post, this market expert said its value might rip through $8 before a cycle top, thanks to bullish fundamentals.

Although this Ripple price prediction has made waves, many investors are still putting it on the back burner for ELX. This is because XRP has already surged over 500% in the past 12 months. Thus, its highest upswings may have passed - leaving traders to look at other altcoins.

Elluminex (ELX) To Bring DeFi To The TON NetworkWhile Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) get the main focus, Elluminex (ELX) is stealthily coming as the one to watch in the DeFi market. Elluminex is a DeFi hub bringing DeFi to the TON Blockchain. The TON blockchain, supported by Telegram, affords Elluminex access to almost 1B potential users. This is good for Elluminex because the platform can go from being a concept to something widely used in a few days.

However, Elluminex is more than just a DEX. It will also introduce an educational academy where traders will learn about DeFi. Thus, users will learn how to trade confidently and make good decisions. Additionally, its AI-powered portfolio tracker will bring effortless trading and real-time data to traders. As a result, both novice and experienced traders could gravitate to the Elluminex platform.

The ELX token, the platform's backbone, follows a deflationary model that guarantees greater value with increased scarcity over the years. Those who participate in the presale benefit the most since they can get the DeFi crypto before it gets listed on a Tier-1 CEX like Uniswap. ELX is worth just $0.06 in phase one of its presale. But this DeFi coin price will rise to $0.08 after phase two begins—a 33% return.

Ethereum (ETH) vs. Ripple (XRP) vs. Elluminex (ELX) – Which Crypto Coin Stands Out Right Now?Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Elluminex (ELX) are all crypto coins that could see big price gains soon. However, one may differentiate from the rest. This is Elluminex, as it will have a smaller market cap than its peers. Therefore, it will need less money for its price to surge.

Plus, it may disrupt the DeFi market, which IBS Intelligence predicts could be worth $48B by 2031. Due to all these factors, many analysts foresee a potential 7x value jump for ELX coming this year.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
