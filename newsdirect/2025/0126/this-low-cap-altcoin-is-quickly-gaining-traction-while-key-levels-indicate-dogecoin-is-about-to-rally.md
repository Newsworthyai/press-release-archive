# This Low Cap Altcoin Is Quickly Gaining Traction, While Key Levels Indicate Dogecoin Is About To Rally

Prominent technical gurus like Ali Martinez are bullish on DOGE, though the recent Trump/Musk clash over a new AI investment may cause tensions that could affect the price of Dogecoin negatively. Meanwhile, stakeholders looking to find a new coin rather than chase small gains on big-cap coins are betting on an early-stage TON-based DeFi project.

Will Trump And Musk’s Clash Impact Dogecoin Prices? Dogecoin is currently testing key support levels at $0.33, which have historically served as a springboard for upward momentum. On the daily chart, DOGE has formed a bullish flag pattern, often signaling a potential breakout. Crypto guru Dima James Potts, who studies post-presidential inauguration patterns, believes that if DOGE can reclaim $0.36 with strong volume, it could set the stage for a rally toward the next resistance at $0.42.

Still, technical analysis can only take us so far, especially because a lot of DOGE’s prominence stems from its association with the world’s richest man.

Trump told the world yesterday that he is planning to create a company called Stargate, designed to grow AI in the US. At the announcement, Trump was accompanied by the leaders of OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle.

Perhaps because Elon Musk has publicly declared that he doesn’t trust OpenAI’s Sam Altman, or maybe because he felt D.O.G.E wasn’t getting enough attention, he went onto X and criticized the project, saying that the enthusiasts didn’t have the money.

According to Politico, reports from the White House say that Trump is ‘furious’ with Musk.

This isn't the first clash between the two men. If Trump fires Musk will Dogecoin crash with it? For now, the market seems unaffected and DOGE is up by 2.6% on the 24-hour charts.

Elluminex Bridges DeFi And Telegram’s Billion UsersMeme coins like DOGE are big business, but the real profits are now made by whales like Musk, or early entrants who got in at a low market cap.

For those who want the allure of a meme coin like Doge, without the uncertainty posed by such a controversial figurehead, Elluminex might be one to check out.

Elluminex describes itself as ‘The future of DeFi on TON’. The team, who hail from Fantom and Google, believe they have what it takes to become the default DEX and Defi protocol of choice for the TON blockchain. The platform will assist users with an AI portfolio tracker to help with decision-making and risk management.

Considering that TON runs alongside the huge messaging app Telegram and that there is no decent TON DeFi solution at the moment, there is a lot of potential in this idea.

Games like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat have done the work in bringing Telegram users to TON and crypto. Now Elluminex plans to bring DeFi to those users and more, by making trading and using decentralized finance as simple, fast, and rewarding as gaming on TON.

Since the Elluminex presale is brand new and has raised over $300,000 in under a week, it seems that many investors are enthusiastic about their vision.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
