While older meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are stalling, the Trump coin (TRUMP) took the market by storm. The reason for this is quite obvious, as just a few days ago Donald Trump officially stepped into his role as the 47th president of the United States, which sent shockwaves across the crypto market and propelled Bitcoin (BTC) to a new all-time high.

A newcomer, Elluminex (ELX) is also generating considerable buzz with the presale of the $ELX token reaching viral status and amassing over $300,000 in funds in a matter of days. This article will explore Elluminex’s prospects and compare its growth potential to trending majors like TRUMP and PEPE.

Elluminex - The New DeFi King? As TRUMP gains traction, Elluminex (ELX) stands out as an outlier which could potentially give established DEXs like Uniswap a run for their money. Elluminex stands out as the first-ever decentralized exchange to leverage the untapped potential of the TON blockchain. This gives Elluminex an incredible advantage as it allows it to tap into Telegram’s massive user base of nearly 1 billion people. The Elluminex-Toncoin relationship brings forward a rapid-growth formula that could lead to outsized returns as the 2025 cycle progresses.

Elluminex's premise addresses major pain points in the DeFi space. These include liquidity dilution and the subpar interoperability between blockchains. Through its innovative cross-chain bridge, Elluminex enables lightning-quick transfers across major blockchains, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. This frictionless approach relieves users of the need to cycle between multiple single-chain platforms.

Furthermore, investors will have access to a special portfolio-tracking app for efficient wealth management while simultaneously receiving real-time data insights and analytics. This tool gives market participants the extra edge they need to stay ahead of the curve and make informed split-second decisions.

The $ELX token is the backbone of the Elluminex ecosystem, powering all major processes, like governance, staking, and other exclusive features. With the $ELX pre-sale kicking off, early buyers have a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to the next big DeFi play that could reshape the TON ecosystem and the decentralized finance market in general.

PEPE Price Continues To Drop Despite Halving EventOver the past few weeks, rumors about a possible Pepe halving started topping headlines. The idea was that a reduced emission rate would increase Pepe’s scarcity and drive its price higher by creating a disparity between supply and demand. However, this Pepe news was disproved shortly after as it turned out that speculations were unfounded. This took a toll on holders’ sentiment, which was already shaky due to Pepe’s poor performance over the past few weeks.

At the time of writing, Pepe sells for $0.000015 after its price broke below the crucial $0.000018 support. Pepe’s total monthly losses now amount to over 20%, prompting savvy investors to cut their losses and rotate funds into undervalued projects that are still flying under the radar, one of them being Elluminex. While Pepe's bottom seems to be in, speculators aren’t seeing any signs of an imminent recovery, as the attention of market participants is focused on more trending plays, such as TRUMP.

TRUMP Enters Cool-Off Phase After Memorable RallyTRUMP experienced one of the most legendary rallies in recent crypto history, as it skyrocketed from a sub-$1 valuation all the way up to a $75 all-time high in less than a day. This explosive growth led to TRUMP entering the top 20 reaching a $15 billion market cap around the peak, surpassing Pepe and other meme coins with ease. The TRUMP surge not only saw a huge price multiplier but also minted a fair share of new crypto millionaires along the way, sending the entire market into a frenzy.

As the dust settled and selling pressure intensified, TRUMP entered a descending channel, with its price finally stabilizing around $39, following a nearly 50% drop. TRUMP’s rise led to a gold rush, as tens if not hundreds of tokens started popping up, all tied to prominent personalities from Donald Trump’s inner circle, including his son Donald Jr., Elon, and Vivek. Furthermore, almost the entire Trump family was tokenized as well, with Melania and Barron reaching respectively over $2 billion and $400 million in a matter of a few hours.

Learn More About The $ELX PresaleWhile meme coins are fun and can bring massive gains, projects like Elluminex present a much better opportunity, as they combine explosive price action and robust fundamentals. This ensures stability in times of increased turbulence and sustainable long-term growth.

Stage 1 of the $ELX presale is now live and tokens are selling for just $0.06. When taking into account all that Elluminex brings to the table, and its unique potential to unlock an entire new market, securing an allocation is highly recommended, especially with the bull run gearing up for the next upward move.

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
