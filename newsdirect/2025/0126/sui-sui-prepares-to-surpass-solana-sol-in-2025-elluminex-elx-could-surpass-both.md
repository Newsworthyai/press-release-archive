Layer-1 blockchains continue to dominate the market, with scalability and transaction speeds being critical differentiating factors driving adoption. While Solana was the trendiest blockchain of 2024, Sui's cutting-edge parallel processing capabilities and roots in Meta’s Libra project have positioned it as a serious contender to potentially surpass Solana.

Elluminex, a Toncoin-based project, is stepping into this competitive arena with a bold vision to revolutionize decentralized finance. By creating a seamless all-in-one platform, Elluminex leverages Toncoin’s scalability to deliver unmatched functionality and usability for DeFi enthusiasts, making it a standout presale opportunity in the current market. Here’s the rundown on Elluminex’s bullish potential.

Here’s Why Sui Could Become The Next Best Layer-1 Safety Net To AccumulateSui has quickly established itself as a formidable contender in the Layer-1 blockchain space, drawing from its roots in Meta's ambitious Libra project and utilizing the innovative Move programming language. The unique design of Sui allows for parallel processing and horizontal scaling, enabling Sui to process up to 297,000 transactions per second, outpacing Solana’s 65,000 TPS during testing.

Recent integrations, such as with PhantomWallet, widely considered to be Solana’s flagship wallet, will make Sui more accessible to a wider audience and degen traders. Bolstering its reputation as a potential “Solana killer," this positions Sui as a major player in the ongoing bull run, as well as the next one predicted to occur in 2029 in line with the 4-year cycle.

Despite its potential, Sui is considered overbought and faces challenges such as being proof of stake which could hinder its long-term prospects. For investors seeking early-stage opportunities with higher upside potential, emerging projects like Elluminex on the Toncoin blockchain present a more compelling alternative over Sui, especially as the market shifts focus to undervalued contenders as market euphoria reaches a new high in the upcoming months

The Go-To Project For High-Profile Projects Is Officially Solana In Early 2025As the trendiest Layer-1 in 2024 overall, Solana already looks set to dominate 2025, with its rapidly expanding ecosystem and key milestones driving its momentum. The launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins has generated unparalleled excitement, with TRUMP reaching a $14 billion market cap and sparking a double-digit surge in Solana’s value.

This frenzy saw trading volume soar to $36 billion, propelling Solana to an all-time high of $294. Additionally, this temporarily overwhelmed Coinbase's infrastructure, leading Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to acknowledge the need to scale their infrastructure to meet the growing demand for Solana, calling the surge a “high-quality” problem that clearly demonstrates Solana’s increasing relevance in the cryptocurrency space. These developments highlight Solana’s appeal as the go-to blockchain for high-profile projects, surpassing competitors like Ethereum, which many now view as outdated.

Adding to its bullish momentum, speculation around Solana’s potential inclusion in a proposed US crypto reserve under the pro-crypto Trump administration has further fueled investor confidence. Combined with the possibility of ETF approvals under a more crypto-friendly SEC chair, Solana is poised to attract billions in institutional investments in 2025

Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi platform built on the TON Blockchain and Ethereum, offering a seamless decentralized finance experience with innovative features. Users can engage in staking, farming, and enjoy AI-powered portfolio tools, all while participating in a cross-chain ecosystem.

Elluminex is unique in that it is bringing DeFi to the TON Network/Blockchain which at the moment is very limited in this sense with very few options available to its users. Despite this the TON Network is still the fastest growing blockchain in the world and many view it as a future powerhouse to rival Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

By bringing DeFi to the TON Network, Elluminex would immediately transform the chain and take its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. Much like Uniswap did with Ethereum, Pancakeswap did with Binance Chain and Jupiter did with Solana.
