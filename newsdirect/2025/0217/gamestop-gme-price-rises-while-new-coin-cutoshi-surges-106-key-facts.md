GameStop is gaining attention in the crypto industry as rumors spread about the meme stock investing in Bitcoin. While investors are speculating about the sudden strategy of GME and how the power of community building backs it up, another project shows a similar pattern on the sideline. Cutoshi (CUTO), an upcoming meme-crypto project, has its priorities sorted out, with community building and incentivizing at the top.

GME Soaring Over The WeekWhen the CEO of GameStop, Ryan Cohen posted a picture with Michael J Saylor, who’s the co-founder of MicroStrategy, on 8th February 2024, sparks started to fly in the crypto industry. Sources state that GME is thinking about investing in Bitcoin, which is quite similar to how MicroStrategy invested on BTC and had massive gains.

Though Saylor had no inputs on the investment discussions, the picture itself was enough for GameStop Corp (GME) to experience over 20% hike within 24 hours. In the past one week alone, it showed a hike of 66%, with a current value of $0.00017021.

There’s still no sure news of GME investing in BTC directly, but inside sources do claim that the meme stock might consider following the footsteps of MTSR. Besides, history has been proof of how GME soared with the power of the community back in 2021 when retail investors were betting on its downfall. The power of community helped it skyrocket its value to almost $500 per share, which was a historical move in the crypto industry.

GME had previously entered the crypto industry with its crypto wallet and NFTs, back in 2022, that had to be shut down in 2023 due to regulatory uncertainties. However, the recent news of BTC investment can fuel GME’s growth in the industry.

If GME directly announces its BTC investment plans, the GameStop community will help it soar above the meme coin leaderboard in no time. Besides, it has around $4.6 Billion in cash reserves, which it has been using for investments and security assets as per its last December filing.

CUTO Following The Community-Driven ApproachCutoshi, an upcoming potential DeFi-based project, is following the footsteps of GME’s community-building approach. CUTO follows the core principles of blockchain technology inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto. It follows the concept of designing a solid decentralized platform with proper privacy and monetary freedom for users.

Currently, CUTO is in its fourth stage of presale, where it stands at $0.031 and has already raised $1,766,837.002. As the price of CUTO changes everyday, early adopters get the opportunity of gaining high returns in every stage of the project. Besides, CUTO is also providing an extra limited period 35% bonus on all purchases for Valentine’s Day.

On top of that, CUTO follows a community approach, through its learning academy, NFTs, token farming, and much more.

CUTO Learning AcademyThe upcoming educational DeFi platform of CUTO is already making noise in the market as most of the modules in this platform can be accessed for free. However, there will be certain premium modules that will require investors to use their CUTO tokens. By doing so, the CUTO team is increasing the utility and value of the deflationary coin.

CUTO’s Token Farming, Quests And Loyalty RewardsTo keep the community engaged, the CUTO team is introducing yield farming where liquidity providers get the chance of earning exclusive rewards. CUTO is also introducing exciting quests for investors to remain active on the community platform and earn CUTO points in exchange for completing their missions.

Besides, CUTO also plans to release limited edition NFTs, with DeFi utility, that early adopters can earn by participating in the quests, and engaging in the platform.

Final WordsWith speculations going on in the meme-crypto industry about GME investing in BTC, investors are turning their attention to CUTO due to its unique approach and benefits. Though CUTO is still on the presale stage, it still holds high potential of surging through the market. However, it is highly suggested to conduct thorough research before making an investment decision.
