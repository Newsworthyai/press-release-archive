# Why Peru should be your strategic fashion & textile partner?

Peru is poised to make a significant impact at Coterie New York, one of the world’s most prestigious fashion trade shows. From February 18 to 20, eight distinguished Peruvian brands will present their latest collections, demonstrating the country’s exceptional artistry, use of high-quality materials, and dedication to ethical production. This year’s featured brands—Balkanica, Carla Testino, De Loreta, Estrafalario, Fringe Mod, Hera Concept, Kero Design and Kuna—seamlessly integrate heritage with contemporary design, attracting the attention of global industry leaders.

For fashion brands seeking quality, innovation, and sustainable manufacturing, Peru presents a compelling opportunity. Here are five key reasons to collaborate with Peru:

Unparalleled Raw Materials

Peru is a leading global producer of premium alpaca fiber and Pima cotton, both highly regarded for their softness, durability, and superior quality. Alpaca fiber, valued for its luxurious texture and thermoregulating properties, offers warmth and breathability, making it an ideal choice for high-end fashion. Meanwhile, Pima cotton—one of the world’s finest—provides exceptional comfort and durability, elevating any collection with its refined feel.

Competitive Trade Advantages

Under the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, Peruvian garments enter the U.S. market duty-free, offering brands a significant cost advantage without compromising on quality.

Commitment to Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Sustainability is a fundamental pillar of Peru’s fashion industry. From organic cotton farming and humane alpaca shearing to partnerships with rural knitting cooperatives, Peruvian manufacturers prioritize responsible sourcing, fair trade, and environmentally conscious production processes.

End-to-End Manufacturing Excellence

Peru is a leader in full-package manufacturing, providing an integrated production model that spans fabric sourcing, design, and garment finishing. This comprehensive approach ensures efficiency, consistency, and superior quality, streamlining the production process for international brands.

Scalable, Globally Competitive Production

With a strong reputation for excellence, Peru’s textile and apparel industry is flexible and highly competitive on a global scale. Whether catering to emerging designers or established international brands, Peruvian manufacturers offer the expertise, capacity, and adaptability to meet diverse production needs—delivering high-quality products on time and at scale.
