# VOESH Adds New Foot Care to Love with Solemate Heel Repair Balm Lavender

After the overwhelming success of the Solemate Heel Repair Balm Mint, VOESH New York is thrilled to introduce the latest addition to its foot care lineup: Solemate Heel Repair Balm Lavender. Building on the excitement surrounding the original formula, this new lavender-scented version promises a soothing experience while delivering the same powerful hydration and nourishment for dry, cracked heels.

The Solemate Heel Repair Balm Lavender combines vegan squalane, organic virgin olive, macadamia, and jojoba oils to repair rough, damaged skin and restore softness. The balm is also enriched with lavender essential oil to hydrate and help reduce foot odor, leaving feet feeling refreshed and revitalized. Whether at home or traveling, the waterless stick balm forms a protective layer to lock in moisture and maintain healthier heels with ease.

Vera Oh, Co-Founder of VOESH New York, shared, “We created the Solemate collection with the goal of enhancing our customers’ foot health. Since they’re on their feet all day, we wanted to provide a product that brings comfort, confidence, and convenience. Our lavender formula offers a calming, rejuvenating experience that fits seamlessly into any wellness routine.”

With the addition of Solemate Heel Repair Balm Lavender, VOESH New York continues to lead the way in at-home foot care, providing high-quality, dermatologist-tested, vegan, and cruelty-free products so you can feel good about what goes on your skin.
