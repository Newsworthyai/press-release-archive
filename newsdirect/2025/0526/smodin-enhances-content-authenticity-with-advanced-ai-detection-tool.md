# Smodin Enhances Content Authenticity with Advanced AI Detection Tool

Smodin, a leading provider of AI detection technology, is responding to this critical need with an advanced solution designed to help users identify whether content was written by a human or generated by AI.

With AI now being used to produce essays, articles, marketing content, and even computer code, the line between machine-generated and human-authored content is becoming harder to define.
