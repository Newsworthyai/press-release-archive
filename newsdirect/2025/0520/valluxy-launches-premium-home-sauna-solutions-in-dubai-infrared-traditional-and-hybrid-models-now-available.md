# Valluxy Launches Premium Home Sauna Solutions in Dubai Infrared Traditional and Hybrid Models Now Available

In today’s fast-paced and demanding lifestyle, prioritizing health and wellness has never been more important. Valluxy, a luxury wellness brand based in Dubai, proudly announces the launch of its exclusive collection of in-home saunas, providing customers with premium options including infrared, traditional, and hybrid sauna models. This new line of wellness solutions is designed for individuals who value self-care, comfort, and long-term health benefits—all from the convenience of their own home.

Saunas have been used for centuries to promote relaxation and enhance physical well-being. Today, modern science supports what traditional cultures have long known—regular sauna use supports detoxification, improves blood circulation, relieves joint and muscle pain, and helps reduce stress. Valluxy’s diverse sauna collection brings this therapeutic power into contemporary homes across the UAE.

The hybrid sauna model stands out for its innovative blend of infrared heat and traditional sauna stones. This dual functionality allows users to enjoy the deep-penetrating benefits of infrared therapy along with the soothing steam experience of a traditional sauna. The result is a personalized and highly effective wellness session that suits a wide range of preferences.

For those drawn to cutting-edge technology, Valluxy’s infrared saunas are engineered to directly heat the body rather than the surrounding air. This method delivers more focused and efficient results. Infrared therapy has gained widespread popularity for its ability to promote detoxification, relieve pain, support weight management, and improve skin tone. These saunas offer a sleek, modern design and a calming environment, perfect for winding down after a long day.

On the other hand, Valluxy’s traditional sauna models cater to those who appreciate a classic and authentic experience. These saunas use natural stones and heat to generate steam, replicating the time-honored ritual of relaxation. The heat encourages sweating, which helps cleanse the body of toxins while improving circulation and promoting restful sleep.

To mark the launch of this premium collection, Valluxy is offering a limited-time 10% discount on all indoor prebuilt sauna models. This special offer makes it the ideal time for homeowners to invest in their health and transform their living space into a personal wellness sanctuary.
