Lindsay Ashley, chief financial officer of Centre for Neuro Skills, has been named chair of the American Heart Association’s 2025 Kern County Heart and Stroke Walk. The annual event is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 11, at California State University, Bakersfield.

“The Kern County Heart and Stroke Walk is an opportunity to celebrate heart disease and stroke survivors, raise lifesaving funds for the American Heart Association and encourage a healthy lifestyle,” said Ashley. “By bringing the community together to raise awareness and funds to fight heart disease and stroke, we’re making strides to ensure our loved ones can live longer, healthier lives.”

Ashley will lead a team of Kern County-area executives to recruit companies and organizations to take part in the Heart and Stroke Walk. The leadership team and supporting organizations will raise funds for the American Heart Association while leading action-oriented conversations about employee health, corporate engagement, community health and community transformation. The American Heart Association is the world’s leading non-profit dedicated to a world of healthier lives for all.

In addition to Ashley, the 2025 Kern County Heart and Stroke Walk executive leadership team includes:

* David Harrington, Centre for Neuro Skills
* Didra Cantu, MPA-HCM, Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital
* George Jenkins, Dignity Health, Bakersfield Memorial Hospital
* Ken Keller, Dignity Health, Bakersfield Memorial Hospital

"The Heart and Stroke Walk is a fantastic chance for Kern County to come together as a united community, standing strong against heart disease and stroke," said Kelley Berry, executive director of the American Heart Association, Kern County. "We are immensely grateful for Lindsay's steadfast expertise, passion, and dedication to our mission. Leaders like her are crucial in our ongoing efforts to save lives and provide hope to families affected by heart disease and stroke."

Funds raised go toward the American Heart Association’s work to advance lifesaving research, education and health for everyone. In Kern County, the Association has expanded access to CPR skills, connected local heart and stroke patients to the latest science-based treatments through its hospital programs and supported community members managing high blood pressure with tools and resources for better blood pressure control. Heart disease and stroke are largely preventable and how you eat, move and manage stress impacts your well-being, physically and mentally. Participants in the Heart and Stroke Walk gain access to resources, tools and activities to support both mental and physical well-being for employers and employees.

Participants can register for the event at BakersfieldHeartWalk.com. Registrants can also create personal fundraising pages, download the Heart Walk mobile app and encourage family and friends to join. Companies interested in participating can contact Kelley Berry at Kelley.berry@heart.org.

Centre for Neuro Skills, with seven locations across California and Texas, will be participating in American Heart Association’s local heart walk events across both states. Dr. Matt Ashley, Chief Medical Officer of Centre for Neuro Skills, currently serves as Board President on the Central Texas American Heart Association’s Board of Directors and will transition to Board Chair this July. As a former Heart Walk Chair in Austin, Texas, Dr. Matt Ashley remains committed to participating in and supporting the Central Texas Heart Walks.
