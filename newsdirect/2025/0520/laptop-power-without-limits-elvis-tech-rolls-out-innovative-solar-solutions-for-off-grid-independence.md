# Laptop Power Without Limits Elvis Tech Rolls Out Innovative Solar Solutions for Off-Grid Independence

As Nigeria continues to face systemic electricity supply challenges, technology company Elvis Tech has announced the launch of a new line of solar-powered solutions aimed at providing reliable alternatives for individuals and small businesses. The newly available devices include solar laptop power banks, high-quality laptop power bank, and portable solar generators, specifically designed for off-grid and low-power environments.

The move follows growing concerns over the impact of erratic grid power on productivity, education, and small-scale enterprise across the country. According to recent energy access reports, millions of Nigerians lack dependable electricity, with outages lasting hours or days in many urban and rural areas.

In response, Elvis Tech’s solar-powered offerings are engineered to provide a stable source of power for essential digital and household tools. The company’s solutions require no fuel, emit no noise, and are equipped with lithium battery technology and smart charging systems to meet the evolving energy needs of users.

“The inability to access electricity continues to undermine development across sectors,” said Elvis Ogbonna, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Elvis Tech. “Our goal is to offer practical, scalable tools that allow people to stay connected, work remotely, and operate their businesses—regardless of the grid.”

The company’s latest line of products includes long-lasting backup batteries compatible with most laptops, designed for maximum power efficiency and portability. Also available are solar-rechargeable models that provide power independence for users in remote or underserved areas—particularly beneficial for students, remote workers, and field professionals.

In addition, Elvis Tech has introduced a compact, silent solar generator with energy storage capacities ranging from 510Wh to 1.9kWh. They are capable of powering key devices such as fans, routers, lighting systems, and other low-voltage appliances, offering a clean and practical alternative to standard fuel-powered generators.

The rollout is part of its strategy to advance energy access through distributed, user-owned solutions. The company reports strong early demand for its pay-on-delivery model, which allows customers to verify product quality before purchase—an increasingly important trust factor in the Nigerian e-commerce landscape.
