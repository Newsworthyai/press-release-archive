# ZenaTech’s (Nasdaq: ZENA) DaaS Model, Strategic Acquisitions Drive 92% Revenue Growth in Q1

The commercial and military drone sectors are entering a high-growth phase, driven by rapid tech innovation and expanding use across industries. The global commercial drone market hit $30.02 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a 10.6% CAGR through 2030, per Grand View Research. Meanwhile, military drone spending is expected to more than double from $24.25 billion in 2025 to $56.69 billion by 2033, growing at 11.2% CAGR, according to Straits Research.

With drones transforming agriculture, logistics, public safety, and defense, investors are scanning the skies for breakout players. ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is an AI-driven drone and software company that is making strategic moves that position it as a rising force in this rapidly evolving sector.

Diversified Drone Applications Fuel GrowthZenaTech has built a multi-vertical drone business through its subsidiary ZenaDrone, with solutions tailored for agriculture, infrastructure inspection, inventory management, public safety, and defense. The company’s AI-powered drones — including the ZenaDrone 1000 and its IQ Nano and IQ Square models — serve both indoor and outdoor use cases, enabling everything from 3D mapping and barcode scanning to power line inspections and real-time surveillance.

A key differentiator is ZenaTech’s embrace of a Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) model. Much like SaaS platforms or ride-hailing services, the company enables clients to access drones on a subscription or pay-per-use basis — no hardware purchases, pilots, or maintenance required. This recurring-revenue model lowers adoption barriers while providing scalable upside across multiple sectors and geographies.

Poised to Capture Agricultural Sector Growth in EuropeIn early May, ZenaTech announced the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, a strategic move that places it near critical logistics infrastructure and opens access to high-growth EU markets.

Europe’s agricultural drone market is projected to grow from $4.6 billion in 2023 to over $43 billion by 2032, a staggering 28.6% CAGR. Farmers across the continent are adopting drone technologies for seeding, spraying, monitoring, and data collection. ZenaTech is targeting this growth with specialized DaaS offerings for precision agriculture, renewable energy, and construction.

According to CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D., “our AI-powered drone solutions are designed to boost crop yields while reducing operational costs and provide smart, data-driven insights.” With favorable regulatory tailwinds and a continental focus on sustainability, ZenaTech is well-positioned to benefit from rising demand in this space.

Launching Drone-Based Cleaning Services in DubaiOne of the company’s most strategically significant initiatives is its recent expansion into Dubai, where it is launching a drone-based exterior building cleaning service. Leveraging the IQ Square, a large-format drone equipped with tethered water and power lines, ZenaTech aims to tap into a fast-growing niche.

Dubai’s high-rise skyline, frequent sandstorms, and mandated cleaning standards create a natural use case for drone-enabled washing services. The global drone cleaning market is expected to triple from $4.36 billion in 2023 to $13.2 billion by 2030. As a first mover in this region, ZenaTech is looking to establish an early foothold in an emerging sector of urban infrastructure management.

Advancing Defense and Proprietary InnovationZenaTech is also developing its presence in defense, with its IQ Nano drone swarms designed for autonomous surveillance, RFID and barcode scanning, and battlefield logistics. These lightweight drones, available in compact 10x10 and 20x20-inch formats, are being tested for military and commercial use and are in the process of obtaining Blue UAS certification, enabling sales to U.S. government agencies.

Vertical integration is another strength. Through its Taiwan-based Spider Vision Sensors subsidiary, ZenaTech has developed proprietary cameras that align with U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) compliance requirements. Internal control over hardware development supports faster iteration and greater cost control across its product lines.

Revenue Growth and Aggressive ScalingZenaTech reported $1.13 million in Q1 2025 revenue, a 92% year-over-year increase. Much of this momentum stems from the DaaS segment, bolstered by a disciplined acquisition strategy. Recent purchases include Oregon’s Weddle Surveying and Florida’s KJM Land Surveying, both of which enhance its geospatial data and infrastructure services.

In the enterprise software space, ZenaTech also acquired UK-based Othership, a SaaS workplace platform. The company has opened a drone testing facility in Turkey and expanded hiring in the UAE, Taiwan, and the United States to support R&D and manufacturing needs.

While operating expenses rose meaningfully in the quarter, the company has signaled a long-term growth focus. Management also noted it is evaluating over 20 potential acquisitions within the next year, underscoring its ambitions to scale rapidly through both organic and inorganic strategies.

Bottom LineAs the global drone market accelerates, ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is carving out a role as a nimble and diversified competitor. Its DaaS model enables recurring revenue and ease of customer adoption, while its international expansion, particularly into Europe and Dubai, offers near-term growth catalysts.

With a strong product pipeline, proprietary innovations, strategic acquisitions, and accelerating revenue, ZenaTech may offer investors an intriguing early-stage opportunity in the broader drone revolution.
