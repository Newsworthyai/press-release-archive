# Peru present in the Metaverse of Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai

Through a virtual tour with a video game format, Peru will showcase its cultural wealth and diversity in the 2025 edition of the Universal Expo held in Osaka-Kansai, Japan. This innovative experience marks a milestone in the history of Universal Expositions, by incorporating a metaverse with more than 150 countries involved.

The digital version of the Peru Pavilion will allow visitors to explore museum exhibits, traditional textiles, gastronomy, archaeological pieces, and interact with users from around the world. Among the emblematic elements that can be appreciated are the mask of the Lord of Sicán, the mantle of the Paracas culture, Nasca ceramics, jewels of the Lord of Sipán, and a space dedicated to the Archaeological Zone of Caral. All these elements have been digitized using photogrammetry, a technique that allows generating high-precision 3D models from photographs.

Under the slogan "Infinite Possibilities," the virtual pavilion invites users to discover the many facets of Peru: from its ancient cultural heritage and unique biodiversity to its innovative spirit and the warmth of its people. The proposal seeks to be a window to the past, present, and future of the country.

Access to the metaverse will be available through the "Virtual Expo" application, compatible with smartphones (iOS and Android), computers (Windows and Mac), and virtual reality devices such as Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3. This platform will be active during the six-month duration of the Expo, which ends on October 13, 2025.

An immersive experience from anywhere in the world

Inspired by the real island of Yumeshima, the metaverse of Expo 2025 recreates a digital archipelago that evokes the Japanese spirit. Upon entering, visitors will be able to create their avatar, be greeted by digital residents, and embark on an interactive journey that connects global users.

In this dynamic universe, participants will be able to explore, learn, and share their visions about the future of society, using interaction tools such as voice messages, chats, emojis, virtual dances, and more.
