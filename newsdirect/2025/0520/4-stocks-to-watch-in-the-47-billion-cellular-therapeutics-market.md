# 4 Stocks To Watch In The $47 Billion Cellular Therapeutics Market

Cell-based therapeutics have come a long way from simply experimental treatments confined in labs to their current mainstream commercial success. In the past year alone, the FDA approved seven new cell therapies, bringing the total number of gene and cell therapies approved in the US to 43, with the largest segment of these products being umbilical cord blood derivatives.

Unlike other treatments, cell-based therapies use modified or healthy cells to treat or prevent disease, often by replacing damaged or malfunctioning cells. This makes cell-based therapies uniquely suited for various conditions like cancer treatments, autoimmune disorders, and tissue regeneration.

Thanks to the rapidly advancing pace of innovation and cell therapy’s potential to transform across disease areas with significant unmet needs, market researchers project that the global cell therapy market could grow from about $7.43 billion in 2025 and reach around $47.72 billion by 2034, representing an impressive CAGR of 22.96% over the period.

As such, a number of key players in the market have been generating considerable investor interest as they continue increasing market share. For instance:

Adia Nutrition Inc. (OTCQB:ADIA) is on a mission to revolutionize healthcare and supplementation through innovative partnerships. The company operates two distinct divisions: Adia Labs, a supplement division providing premium, organic supplements, and Adia Med, its medical division responsible for establishing clinics that specialize in leading-edge stem cell therapies, most notably Umbilical Cord Stem Cells (UCB-SC) and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (aHSCT) for treatments like Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

Adia has recently been generating significant investor interest following an exciting start to the year with the announcement of several major corporate milestones.

In May, the company announced that it had successfully uplisted from the OTC Pink Sheets to the OTCQB Venture Market, effectively enhancing its visibility and liquidity. The process was achieved in an unprecedented six weeks from the filing date of April 2nd, alongside the completion of SEC Rule 15c2-11 compliance. The OTCQB Venture Market and 15c2-11 compliance elevate Adia's ability to showcase its pioneering umbilical cord stem cell therapies and premium nutritional products to a wider investor base, potentially unlocking more shareholder value.

The uplisting follows the successful completion of its independent audit, a crucial milestone that positioned the company for uplisting to the OTCQB. Earlier, Adia had announced a transformative overhaul of its share structure, including the retirement of approximately 15 million shares, reducing the outstanding common stock from about 95.9 million shares to 80.4 million shares, and the cancellation of a commitment agreement requiring the issuance of 10 million additional shares.

Furthermore, the company recently revealed that Adia Labs had secured FDA registration for Adia Vita, one of its top-tier products featuring umbilical cord stem cells with a minimum of 100 million viable cells and 3 trillion exosomes per unit, in a move that would expand the reach of its regenerative treatments. By offering a superior product at a reduced price, Adia Med intends to differentiate itself from existing alternatives, thereby driving rapid client growth and making these therapies more accessible.

At the beginning of the year, Adia set out an ambitious strategic expansion plan for Adia Med satellite locations across the United States. This initiative aimed to make Adia Med's innovative treatments more accessible by partnering with premier medical spas dedicated to anti-aging, wellness, and body repair. In line with this plan, the company announced the opening of its first satellite location in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. This was in partnership with Keep Glowing Medical Spa and renowned physician Dr. Michael Ellis, thus blending cutting-edge stem cell therapies with an established wellness hub.

It is also important to note that Adia is in the process of registering with the State of Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), a crucial initiative designed to secure approval for accepting private insurance for the company’s stem cell therapies. Until now, Adia Med's operations have depended solely on out-of-pocket payments from patients. However, that approval could be a game changer since collaborating with private insurers would lift the financial barriers that currently restrict patient access.

Unsurprisingly, several organizations and healthcare entities from various countries have reached out to Adia Med over recent months, expressing enthusiasm for establishing clinics that offer its cutting-edge treatments, including therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and umbilical cord blood stem cell (UCB-SC) therapies utilizing Adia Labs' premier product, Adia Vita.

Fate Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FATE) is focused on developing a first-in-class pipeline of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cellular immunotherapies. The company’s proprietary iPSC product platform is uniquely designed to facilitate the manufacture of engineered cell products, which can be stored in inventory for off-the-shelf availability and can be administered in combination with other therapies. This therefore allows it to overcome numerous limitations associated with patient- and donor-sourced cell therapies.

FATE recently announced that the FDA had granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to its lead product, FT819, illustrating the potential of cell-based therapies. FT819 is an investigational, off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell therapy that is currently in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of active moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including lupus nephritis (LN).

What the RMAT designation means is that the FDA recognizes the potential of off-the-shelf CAR T-cell therapy to address significant unmet needs and will enable increased dialogue with the FDA throughout the development process.

The RMAT designation was established to expedite the development and review of regenerative medicine therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. The designation includes all Breakthrough Therapy designation features, such as early interactions with the FDA, including discussions on potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints that may support accelerated approval and satisfy post-approval requirements, and potential priority review of a product’s biologics license application.

Pluri Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUR) is a leading biotechnology company leveraging its proprietary platform to create cell-based solutions that will revolutionize everything from the way we treat illness to the way we eat. Pluri’s 3D cell expansion platforms can expand a single cell into billions of distinct cells quickly and reliably, in a highly cost-effective process that can be applied to various types of cells.

The company recently achieved a significant milestone after the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a patent for its immune cell expansion technologies. The patent covers mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which play a crucial role in the body's defense against infection and support tissue repair.

Pluri’s placental allogeneic MAIT cell platform facilitates the development of unconventional immune T cells that could be instrumental in treating solid tumors. This is important considering that despite revolutionary progress in blood cancers, equivalent success has yet to be duplicated in solid tumor malignancies, which present unique challenges.

Pluri’s MAIT cells, which are isolated from human placentas, a source rich in highly potent allogeneic immune cells often overlooked in traditional therapies, offer substantial benefits compared to conventional T cells. Unlike conventional T cells typically collected from peripheral blood, Pluri’s MAIT cells demonstrate a lower alloreactivity profile. This characteristic not only minimizes their likelihood of inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)—a significant advantage over other potential allogeneic products—but also suggests that they may persist in the body for a longer duration, enhancing their therapeutic efficacy.

Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) is building one of the leading horizontal platforms for cell programming and biosecurity. This cell programming platform enables the growth of biotechnology across diverse markets, from food to fragrance to pharmaceuticals.

The company recently reported its first-quarter earnings, with total revenue coming in at $48 million, up from $38 million in the comparable prior-year period. This reflected a 27% increase primarily due to $7 million of non-cash revenue from deferred revenue relating to the mutual termination of a customer agreement. Excluding the $7 million non-cash deferred revenue release, first-quarter cell engineering revenue was $31 million, up from $28 million in the prior-year period.

During the earnings call, management reiterated that biotechnology remained a critical emerging technology area in the US and Ginkgo was well positioned to provide biosecurity and R&D services, as illustrated by its 28 US government projects across cell engineering and biosecurity with roughly $180 million of contracted backlog and unfunded potential backlog.

In addition, the company noted that it had made significant progress on cost cutting while still serving its customers. Gingko revealed that it was on track for a $205 million reduction in its annual run rate between the first quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of this year. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance as of the end of the period were $517 million.
