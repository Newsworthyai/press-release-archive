# Minneapolis Public Housing Authority and Comcast Announce Technology Partnership

The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) and Comcast announced they have partnered to provide a WiFi connection to Xfinity's next generation network in several of the Minneapolis Public Housing buildings in the city. This is Comcast’s second collaboration with a Minnesota-based housing agency to provide pre-installed, already on connectivity to the Xfinity network for their residents.

Residential units will be equipped to connect to Xfinity’s superior WiFi network. With Xfinity’s network readily available, residents will not need to schedule a technician to set up services, wait for their modem to arrive or go to the Xfinity store to collect their equipment. To activate service, residents will only need to call or use the Xfinity App. Current and new residents moving into WiFi ready units can connect to the Internet within five minutes of collecting their keys, making it much easier to get all their devices up and running.

"Connecting public housing to the internet is about more than technology, we’re providing opportunity,” said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “This partnership between the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority and Comcast will empower our residents with the tools they need to succeed. Together, we’re building a more connected and prosperous community."

“Internet access is not a luxury, it is a core need in today’s world,” said Abdi Warsame, Executive Director/CEO of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority. “MPHA residents need fast, affordable, reliable internet to access healthcare and educational services, stay connected with friends and family, and keep up to date with what’s happening in their community. This partnership equips MPHA residents with everything they need to stay connected. I am thankful to Comcast for this major investment.”

"Installing our Xfinity WiFi in public housing units is a transformative step toward ensuring digital opportunity for all residents,” said Kalyn Hove, regional senior vice president, Comcast Midwest. “This partnership with Minneapolis Public Housing Authority will provide essential connectivity, enabling access to educational resources, job opportunities, healthcare services and community engagement. We are committed to empowering residents to thrive in today's interconnected world."

The Xfinity network will be installed in phases. Completion of the first three buildings just occurred, and plans are to connect additional buildings with WiFi ready by the end of 2026.
