IotaComm, Inc. ("IotaComm") a wireless communications and Internet of Things (IoT) solution provider, and Tellus Networked Sensor Solutions, Inc. ("TELLUS") are proud to announce a new strategic partnership aimed at advancing environmental intelligence through integrated indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring solutions.

Under this collaboration, TELLUS will leverage IotaComm’s robust LoRaWAN® network to enable wireless connectivity for its suite of indoor and outdoor air quality sensors. In parallel, IotaComm will integrate TELLUS’ cutting-edge sensor hardware and analytics platforms— including the AirView Analytics system—into its flagship Delphi360™ environmental monitoring and analytics platform. Together, the solution delivers hyperlocal environmental intelligence, powered by TELLUS’s real-time calibration engine, rich visualizations, and intuitive prediction models—enabling decision-makers to act on meaningful air quality insights, not just data.

Together, IotaComm and TELLUS will offer a comprehensive environmental data solution designed to support commercial and institutional customers in sectors such as K-12 education, manufacturing, and smart cities. By combining real-time indoor and outdoor air quality data, the partnership empowers organizations to make informed decisions that promote health, safety, and sustainability.

“This collaboration represents a major step forward in delivering holistic air quality insights that our customers increasingly demand,” said Terrence DeFranco, Chairman and CEO of IotaComm. “By integrating TELLUS’ innovative hardware and analytics into Delphi360, we’re elevating our environmental intelligence capabilities and reinforcing our commitment to cleaner, healthier communities.”

“We are thrilled to partner with IotaComm to expand the reach and impact of our sensor technologies,” said Carl Luft, President and CEO of TELLUS. “Together, we can offer a unified platform that brings powerful data and actionable insights to the forefront of environmental management. This partnership aligns with our mission to make environmental data more accessible and actionable for communities, schools, and organizations striving for healthier spaces.”

The partnership will also include joint development efforts, co-marketing opportunities, and ongoing technical collaboration to enhance product performance and customer experience. While a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) sets the framework for cooperation, both companies intend to formalize the partnership with a definitive agreement in the near future.
