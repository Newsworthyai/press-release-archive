More than 300 Jewish students and allies from universities across the globe, community leaders, influencers, and officials gathered in Midtown Manhattan this past weekend for the Combat Antisemitism Movement’s “Rise & Respond: Global Student Summit Against Antisemitism.”

The event provided a platform for students to share their personal experiences and confront the troubling rise in antisemitic incidents taking place at higher education institutions in North America and beyond.

Summit attendees discussed strategies to counter antisemitism and advocate for meaningful change, a challenge that has escalated to a terrifying degree since Hamas’ October 7th attack on Israel. The Antisemitism Research Center by CAM has documented 742 antisemitic incidents on American campuses in 2024, marking a 120.8% increase from the 336 reported in 2023.

The summit was particularly timely and relevant, given the ongoing antisemitism crisis at Columbia University and the historic federal action being led by the new Trump administration to hold Columbia and other schools accountable for their failures to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination, harassment, and even violence.

The summit recognized and honored Michael Kaminsky, a junior at DePaul University, with CAM’s Student Activist Award. Kaminsky was physically assaulted on his campus by masked assailants in broad daylight last year, while a safety officer employed by the university stood mere feet away – and did nothing.

Since his horrifying experience, Kaminsky has amplified his advocacy for the Jewish community, and he urged others in attendance to stand up to hate and remember their people’s legacy of resilience and strength in the face of adversity.

“That day, I understood the hardships my family had endured [under Nazi and Soviet oppression] and decided I must use the strength they passed down to me,” Kaminsky said. “Instead of hiding, I spoke out…History will remember those who stood up to fight for our civil rights and will hold those accountable who were complacent in the face of atrocities, for we are not Jews with trembling knees.”

U.S. Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24) expressed strong support for federal action against campus antisemitism and emphasized the critical importance of standing up against hatred, displaying a wristband given to her by Holocaust survivor Helen Sperling that reads, “Thou Shall Not Be a Bystander.”

Other featured speakers at the Rise & Respond summit included Jewish community and business leaders, activists, and local and global officials who discussed the rising threat of antisemitism, the critical need to confront it, and the challenges faced by the Jewish people. Their remarks highlighted the urgency of standing united against hate, with each speaker offering personal reflections on the ongoing struggle for safety, equality, and justice for Jewish students.

“We’ve gotten to this point [of rising antisemitism] because people don’t understand Israel, the Jewish people, and the threat of terrorism, not just to Jews but to everyone and to our way of life. That’s why the work of fighting hate and advocating for our community is more crucial than ever” – Sheryl Sandberg, Former Chief Operating Officer of Meta Platforms

“When your universities refuse to protect you, make them answer to you. When student governments push anti-Israel resolutions, challenge them. Fight them. When they try to erase the truth or the facts, remind them that we are here…. The Jewish people have never backed down from a fight, and we will not start now” – Ambassador Danny Danon, Israel’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations

“The Mayor Eric Adams administration protects the right to free speech and protects the right to democracy, but when that speech goes to hate, when that speech crosses the line, when that speech and protests start to shut down our city, as the deputy mayor for public safety, I will make sure that everybody is held accountable” – Kaz Daughtry, Deputy Mayor of New York City for Public Safety

“You were born for this moment. You carry thousands of years of survival, resilience, and beauty in your blood. You are part of a story that will never be erased. And your voice – your one voice – can make all the difference” – Montana Tucker, social media influencer and pro-Israel activist

“We talk often about a better tomorrow. But that tomorrow will never come – unless we act today. Every day we delay, hatred finds new ground. But look around you. Yes, there is strength in numbers. But there is extraordinary power in individual action. Every post you share, every story you tell, every myth you calmly correct – matters. These are not small acts. They are the seeds of transformation.” – Igor Tulchinsky, philanthropist and CEO of WorldQuant

At the summit, CAM launched the FACE Antisemitism Initiative, which unites students, faculty, and lawmakers to combat antisemitism through advocacy, education, and action. CAM also unveiled the HEAT Map & Advocacy Platform, which is designed to systematically identify and expose the professors, administrators, and academic influencers responsible for promoting antisemitism and anti-Israel rhetoric and disrupt their ability to indoctrinate and intimidate.

“The Rise & Respond summit represented a crucial advancement in the global effort to combat antisemitism,” said CAM CEO Sacha Roytman. “By equipping students, faculty, and leaders with the tools to take meaningful action, we underscored the vital role of unity and resilience in the face of escalating hate. As participants departed the summit, they were more committed than ever to advocating for the Jewish people and standing together to create a safer campus reality for all.”
