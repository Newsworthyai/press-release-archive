# NAVEX Offers New York Retail Worker Safety Act Training

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management solutions, has released its online interactive training program designed to help New York retailers comply with the newly enacted Retail Worker Safety Act.

New York retailers face mounting challenges in adapting to the new law, which requires them to develop and implement workplace violence prevention policies while ensuring employees receive proper training. With the Retail Worker Safety Act's effective date of June 2, 2025, fast approaching, organizations need a streamlined solution that ensures compliance with minimal disruption to daily operations.

“With the compliance deadline approaching, retailers across New York are feeling the pressure to prepare. Many businesses are still working to understand what they need to do, which is why our workplace violence prevention training is ready now,” said Dr. Jen Farthing, general manager of training at NAVEX. "We offer an engaging course for learners that helps businesses stay on track. Our customers have told us compliance can feel overwhelming, but with the right learning tools, it doesn’t have to be. For retailers racing against the clock, finding a solution that simplifies compliance is both practical and meaningful.”

The Retail Worker Safety Act mandates that retail businesses with 10 or more employees implement comprehensive workplace violence prevention policies and provide interactive training upon hire and annually thereafter. Employers with fewer than 50 retail associates must conduct training upon hire and then every two years.

The New York Workplace Violence Prevention course is designed to meet and exceed these regulatory requirements, offering:

1. Interactive Training – Engaging content covering de-escalation techniques, active shooter protocols, emergency procedures, and the proper use of safety devices such as silent response buttons
2. Customizable Content – Ability to easily customize information unique to their business, such as specific site procedures, emergency information and resources, including relevant policies and procedures directly inside the course, as the Act requires
3. Tailored Content for Supervisors – Additional training focused on managing emergencies and addressing security concerns to equip store leaders with the skills needed to handle potential threats
4. Comprehensive Compliance Tracking – Features that enable retailers to monitor training completion, maintain accurate records, and easily generate compliance reports

To further simplify compliance efforts, the NAVEX One platform streamlines training administration by tracking employee progress, automating compliance reminders, and generating reports for seamless adherence to the law. By implementing NAVEX’s training solutions, New York retailers can meet regulatory mandates and foster a culture of safety and preparedness. This proactive approach safeguards store associates while enhancing overall operational resilience.
