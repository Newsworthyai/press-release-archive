# VOESH New York Launches the Ultimate 2-in-1 Exfoliating Body Wash

VOESH New York is thrilled to unveil the newest addition to its vegan body care lineup: the Exfoliating Body Wash. Combining the power of cleansing and exfoliation, this 2-in-1 scrub-to-suds formula is designed to gently smooth and soothe dry, rough patches while leaving skin feeling softer, clearer, and hydrated. Say goodbye to complicated shower routines and hello to the simplicity of beautiful, healthy skin in one step.

Packed with active ingredients like pure sugar crystals, plant-derived AHAs, and a nourishing botanical oil blend, this microbiome-friendly Exfoliating Body Wash delivers a luxurious, skin-loving experience. The dual-action, 99+% natural-origin formula is perfect for those seeking a gentle exfoliation and cleanse that never strips skin’s moisture. The mild, plant-derived surfactants produce a rich lather, while the added oils hydrate for a refreshed feel.

“Our goal has always been to create products that not only deliver high-quality skincare but also provide an experience,” said Vera Oh, Co-Founder of VOESH New York. “With our Exfoliating Body Wash, we’ve combined captivating scents and a multitasking formula that simplifies your shower routine without feeling rushed.”

The Exfoliating Body Wash is available in four skin-friendly, finely crafted fragrances to create an elevated sensory moment:

* Fig & Amber: A warm, inviting blend of sweet fig and amber that creates a cozy ambiance.
* Black Tea & Rosé: A rich, smoky tea scent balanced with the light, fresh aroma of rosé to create an upscale atmosphere.
* Neroli & Patchouli: A captivating blend of citrusy neroli and deep, earthy patchouli that balances freshness and sensual depth.
* Hinoki & Lavanda: A calming, earthy scent of hinoki wood, blended with the soft, floral aroma of lavender, to create a peaceful, nature-inspired escape.
