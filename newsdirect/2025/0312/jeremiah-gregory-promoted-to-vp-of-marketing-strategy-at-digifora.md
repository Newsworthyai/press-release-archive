# Jeremiah Gregory Promoted to VP of Marketing Strategy at digifora

On February 25th, digifora announced that Jeremiah Gregory had been made Vice President of Marketing Strategy. The promotion came on the heels of a strong and sustained performance, in which he helped guide many of digifora’s clients and partners to achieve and surpass many of their goals. The new position serves as an acknowledgment of past successes as well as a way to empower Gregory to continue his leadership role within the rapidly scaling full-service growth-marketing agency.

Founder and president Justin Brackett emphasized that the move was meant as a genuine sign of gratitude and a thank you from the entire team at digifora, saying, “This is just as much a thank you for past efforts as a nod to future outcomes. It is a way for us to say ‘thank you’ for all the work he is doing and has done as we’ve grown.”

Growth is an understatement. Digifora made waves in 2024 when it announced that it had hit its seven-year benchmarks in less than half that time. Since then, it has continued to build its team and suite of services into a combined offering that can address any marketing and communications concern for organizations in both for-profit and non-profit environments.

Brackett pointed out that throughout that growth, Gregory has consistently shown up with a can-do attitude. “He is always willing to go above and beyond,” he said. “He embodies our flywheel of Trust & Education, leads with integrity, and always looks for ways to elevate our clients and team. His dedication and impact at digifora speak for themselves, and this promotion reflects the value he brings every day.”

Jeremiah currently resides in Pfafftown, North Carolina, where he lives with his wife Erin and their three daughters. He previously served as Senior Director of Growth Marketing at digifora. Before that role, he had spent the better part of two decades accumulating expertise as an advertising, analytics, and digital marketing expert. During that time, he developed and executed omnichannel campaigns for major organizations including Media General, Hearst Television, Flow Automotive, and Reynolds American.

Once at digifora, he served the agency’s clients in a variety of contexts and competencies. His main bread and butter has been media buying. He has leveraged this key marketing channel for clients through branded relationships including Disney, Mountain, Google, and Pandora, using it to serve a number of high-profile clients, including Arc of Indiana, Convey of Hope, and Vanderbloemen.

In addition, Gregory has helped with platform development by making sure digifora maintains partnerships in the technology space that can help drive change for its clients. He has also helped develop dashboards, analytics, reporting, and any other data or communications-related needs to ensure clear and effective service.

Gregory is particularly satisfied with his work alongside digifora’s non-profit partners. “I am thankful that I have been able to help multiple non-profits connecting people in need to valuable resources that provide hope,” he said, adding that one of those non-profits is the Villages in Indiana. “One of my favorite success metrics in recent years has been the simple yet powerful fact that we were able to help grow the number of parents registering to be foster parents year over year from 2023 to 2024.”

It is this heart-felt love for the impact of his work, alongside his can-do attitude and nose for successful outcomes that has made Gregory a central and integral part of digifora’s success, and will doubtless keep him in that catalytic position moving forward.
