# ZQuip Showcases Electrification Solution for Construction Equipment at Bauma 2025

ZQuip, a leading provider of electrification solutions for construction, and part of Moog Construction, will be showcasing its latest technology at the Bauma 2025 trade fair in Munich, Germany. ZQuip will have two locations at Bauma. First, at the Moog Construction booth, ZQuip will have a converted CAT 308 and CASE CX210-ZQ. ZQuip will also be present at the Case Construction booth, where visitors can see the CASE WX155-ZQ machine.

ZQuip is collaborating with Case to develop modular electric construction machines that offer a variety of benefits, including reduced emissions, lower operating costs, and improved performance. The ZQuip system is designed to easily integrate into existing construction equipment, making it a cost-effective way to electrify a fleet. The ZQuip system works across a variety of equipment types and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Bauma is the world’s leading trade fair for construction machinery, building material machines, mining machines, construction vehicles, and construction equipment. The event takes place every three years in Munich, Germany.

“ZQuip is transforming construction with our modular energy system, and we're excited to share this innovation with the world at Bauma 2025,” said Chris LaFleur, managing director for ZQuip. “We're demonstrating how this adaptable technology can meet the diverse needs of modern construction projects, offering unparalleled flexibility, efficiency and sustainability. We believe that ZQuip is the fastest, most productive, and most cost-effective way for construction to transition to zero-emission."

Calling for an Innovative Approach to Zero-Emissions

Creating a zero-emission construction site requires developing a fleet of zero-emissions machines that can work cohesively to create value. This means going beyond the electrification of one machine at a time and instead converting a large number of machines and applications simultaneously so that energy and performance are optimized across an entire site. ZQuip's approach gives customers zero-emissions machines with the necessary battery capacity for the job, allowing for optimized energy use and cost savings. The energy modules are also able to be used off-machine as mobile chargers, gensets, and mobile energy storage (ESS).

The ZQuip System

The ZQuip system is a modular, scalable solution that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any construction site. The system includes:

Energy Modules: ZQuip's energy modules are the heart of the system. These modules are available in a variety of energy types and capacities to meet the power needs of different types of equipment. The modules can be quickly and easily swapped out, allowing for continuous operation of equipment.

Conversion Kits: ZQuip offers conversion kits that make it easy to convert existing diesel-powered equipment to electric power. The kits include all of the necessary components, including motors, electronics, cooling, and controllers.

Digital App: The ZQuip digital app provides real-time visibility into the performance of the ZQuip system. The app allows users to monitor energy usage, track equipment location, and receive alerts if there are any problems with the system.
