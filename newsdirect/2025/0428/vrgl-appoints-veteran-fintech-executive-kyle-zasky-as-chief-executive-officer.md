# VRGL Appoints Veteran Fintech Executive Kyle Zasky as Chief Executive Officer

VRGL, the leading Client Acquisition and Investment Proposal Management solution, today announced the appointment of respected fintech executive Kyle Zasky as Chief Executive Officer. With more than 30 years of experience driving innovation, enterprise growth, and strategic transformation across the financial technology sector, Zasky will lead VRGL into its next phase of expansion.

Zasky will focus on the continued acceleration of VRGL’s growth, its enterprise offerings, and scaling the platform’s capabilities to meet rising demand from advisors and institutions.

“VRGL has built a remarkable foundation — transforming the way wealth managers evaluate client portfolios and deliver compelling proposals,” Zasky said. “As the platform continues to evolve, I’m excited to help expand our reach, enhance our solutions, and further empower firms to grow faster and more effectively.”

Zasky was most recently a Managing Director at J.P. Morgan Neovest following its acquisition of LayerOne Financial, where he served as CEO. At LayerOne, Zasky scaled the company into one of the industry’s most comprehensive investment management platforms for hedge funds. His earlier roles include nearly a decade as Operating Partner at SenaHill Partners and serving as Founder and President of EdgeTrade, a pioneer in electronic trading, acquired by Knight Capital in 2008.

“VRGL is at an inflection point with significant momentum and a clear opportunity to scale,” said Adam Checchi, Managing Partner at Checchi Capital Advisors and VRGL Board Member. “We are delivering real value to fast-growing and tech-enabled RIAs, RIA/broker-dealers, aggregators, boutique UHNW firms, and national wealth management platforms. We are thrilled to welcome Kyle as CEO. His track record of scaling fintech businesses, building enterprise relationships, and leading with innovation makes him the ideal leader for VRGL’s next chapter.”

Since its founding in 2021, VRGL has emerged as a market leader, helping firms streamline client acquisition and investment proposal workflows. With Zasky as CEO, the company is poised to broaden its impact and deliver even greater value to the wealth management industry.
