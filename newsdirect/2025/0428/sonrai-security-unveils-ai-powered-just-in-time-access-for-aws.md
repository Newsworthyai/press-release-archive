# Sonrai Security Unveils AI-Powered Just-in-Time Access for AWS

Sonrai Security, a leader in cloud identity and access management, today announced the launch of Just-in-Time (JIT) Access, a powerful new capability within the Sonrai Cloud Permissions Firewall for AWS. The solution eliminates standing privileges in production environments while preserving operational agility—thanks in part to seamless integration with Amazon Bedrock for AI-powered session summaries of privileged user activities.

Sonrai’s JIT Access enables temporary, on-demand permissions without proxies, jump boxes, or complex deployments. Teams gain access only when needed and only for as long as necessary—aligned to zero-trust principles and security best practices. Every session is fully auditable with AI-generated summaries built using Amazon Bedrock, providing instant clarity on what occurred during elevated access without requiring screen recordings or manual log reviews. Any anomalous activity is also highlighted.

“Standing access is one of the biggest unresolved risks in cloud security,” said Brendan Hannigan, CEO and co-founder of Sonrai Security. “With JIT and AI-powered visibility, we’re eliminating that risk—without slowing down developers. And with Bedrock, we delivered this powerful solution rapidly.”

Unlike traditional PAM tools, which often rely on manual reviews or clunky infrastructure, Sonrai’s JIT solution is cloud-native, cost-effective, and deploys in hours—not months. With Amazon Bedrock, Sonrai’s engineering team was able to deliver rich, AI-driven session summaries in a matter of weeks, with no additional vendor overhead, security reviews, or infrastructure complexity.

Why Amazon Bedrock?

* Security-first: Built-in data privacy and security aligned with AWS best practices
* Frictionless integration: Cloud Permissions Firewall is AWS-native—Bedrock just worked
* Faster time to market: Delivered in weeks, not months
* Flexible and cost-effective: AI models tailored to security needs without runaway cost

“Session summaries are critical for audits, investigations, and compliance,” said Matt Carle, Head of Product at Sonrai Security. “But nobody wants to sift through raw logs. Bedrock lets us generate intelligent, human-readable insights from every privileged session—so teams get the context they need without extra effort.”

JIT Access is now available for AWS customers using the Sonrai Cloud Permissions Firewall. Azure and GCP support will follow.
