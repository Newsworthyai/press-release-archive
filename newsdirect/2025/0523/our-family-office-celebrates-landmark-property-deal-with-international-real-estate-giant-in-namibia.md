# Our Family Office Celebrates Landmark Property Deal with International Real Estate Giant in Namibia

Our Family Office (Pty) Ltd (FSP50677), a fast-growing family office headquartered in Somerset West, Cape Town, has secured a landmark intermediary contract within the real estate sector in Namibia, adding an impressive R1.2 billion to its Assets Under Management (AUM) in property. This milestone represents a remarkable trajectory of growth since the firm’s inception in June 2022.

The company has swiftly established itself as a dynamic force in Southern Africa’s CAT I wealth and property management landscape. In April 2024, the company announced a pivotal partnership with Covest Wealth Group, Namibia, marking a turning point that would accelerate strategic investment opportunities and cross-border collaborations. That partnership laid the foundation for the company’s latest and most significant venture to date.

"This is more than just a transaction—it’s a validation of the trust we've built, the strategies we've refined, and the vision we share with our partners. Our Family Office’s latest venture is a signal to the market that we are ready to play at scale." said Pieter de Klerk, CEO of Covest Wealth Group.

“Modernising the way you work with financial partners, a blend of tradition and innovation, bringing the genuine banking experience back to life, right here in South Africa. Today, we surpassed the R1.2 billion AUM in properties threshold, a key objective in our strategic plan. This accomplishment is the result of a combination of successful client acquisitions, the implementation of our strategic relationship with Covest Wealth Group based in Namibia and the dedication of our professional team. We are now focused on continuing this momentum and further expanding our AUM in the coming years in both South Africa and Namibia.” added Kenne de Kock, Executive director of Our Family Office.

This deal strengthens the company’s position in the high-growth property sector and paves the way for further expansion from South Africa, across to Namibia and beyond. The development is poised to support not only capital growth but also sustainable residential and commercial infrastructure within the immediate expansion path of Namibia’s capital city, Windhoek.

This accomplishment stands as a beacon of encouragement to Our Family Office’s existing clients and strategic partners, reaffirming the firm’s commitment to delivering exceptional service and returns with integrity, innovation, and a long-term outlook.
