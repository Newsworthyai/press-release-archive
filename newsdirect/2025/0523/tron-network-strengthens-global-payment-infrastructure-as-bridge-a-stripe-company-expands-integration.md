Geneva, Switzerland, May 23, 2025 –  TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), has announced the expansion of a strategic integration from Bridge, a leading stablecoin orchestration platform and a Stripe company. This development further solidifies TRON’s role as a preferred settlement layer for stablecoins, driven by its scalability, affordability, and consistent network performance.

The TRON network has established itself as a dominant force in the greater blockchain landscape, hosting nearly one-third of the global stablecoin supply, including over $77 billion in USDT—more than half of its total circulation. USDT on TRON has demonstrated consistent growth as demand for fast and secure digital dollar infrastructure increases globally. The network also processes a daily average of $20 billion in USDT transfers and leads in active user engagement, with over 2.5 million daily active users.

Bridge serves hundreds of developers in emerging markets who rely on TRON to execute payments and get access to US dollars and treasuries through stablecoins. The expanded support of Bridge’s cross-border API further enhances the scale, speed, and efficiency for developers to support stablecoin transactions on TRON.

“Whether developers are scaling payment applications or fine-tuning DeFi projects, these updates unlock new possibilities,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO. “Strengthening our integration is more than just a routine improvement, we’re giving developers the flexibility to build without limits and creating pathways for innovation.”

Several infrastructure and developer-focused enhancements aimed at streamlining stablecoin payments will be introduced as part of the integration’s expansion:

* End-to-end USDT.trx support across payment routes: Bridge now offers full interoperability for USDT.trx across all current and future payment routes, allowing developers to enable seamless cross-chain movement of stablecoins for both businesses and users.
* Fiat on/off-ramps for USDT.trx: Developers can now integrate direct fiat conversions for USDT.trx, bridging the gap between crypto and everyday spending.
* Memoless wallet support: Transactions on TRON no longer require memos, enabling broader wallet compatibility and simplifying the onramp experience for users.
* Native infrastructure for deposits and withdrawals: TRON is the first blockchain supported by Bridge’s proprietary deposit and withdrawal infrastructure. This will facilitate unlimited deposit addresses and increase the overall speed, reliability, and performance on TRON.

These feature enhancements will allow both TRON and Bridge to better serve the growing ecosystem of developers building financial applications in emerging markets. With improved wallet infrastructure, smoother cross-chain transfers, and native fiat on/off-ramps, developers can create fast and seamless payment experiences on one of the most dominant networks for stablecoins.
