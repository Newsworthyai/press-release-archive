# Targeting the Skies: 4 Drone Stocks With Breakout Potential

Drones have evolved from niche gadgets into critical infrastructure across defense, industry, and commerce. As the technology matures, its applications are expanding rapidly—redefining how businesses operate, governments defend, and data is gathered in real time. The global drone-powered solutions market is projected to grow from $17.9 billion in 2024 to $47.5 billion by 2030, according to ResearchAndMarkets.com, driven by demand in sectors like agriculture, logistics, construction, and national security. In the U.S. alone, the Department of Defense has redirected $50 billion toward advanced technologies, including drone systems and counter-drone measures, underscoring the strategic priority placed on aerial innovation.

With that in mind, here’s a closer look at four drone-focused companies that stand out in this rapidly accelerating market.

ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is emerging as a serious contender in the commercial drone space, driven by its Drone as a Service model, which allows enterprise clients to deploy drones without managing hardware, pilots, or compliance. That offering helped push Q1 2025 revenue to 1.13 million dollars, a 92 percent year-over-year increase. Growth was powered by both acquisitions and organic expansion in the U.S. and U.K. CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D., said the results reflect “strong customer demand across sectors including agriculture, renewable energy, and infrastructure inspection,” and confirmed the company plans to pursue more than 20 acquisitions in the next 12 months to deepen its market footprint.

The company is rapidly expanding its geographic reach. It recently launched a European headquarters in Dublin to support agricultural and industrial clients across the continent. According to Passley, ZenaTech’s drones are designed “to boost crop yields while reducing operational costs” by delivering real-time aerial insights. The company also opened a regional hub in Dubai focused on drone-enabled building cleaning. Its IQ Square drone, which operates tethered to ground-based water and power systems, is designed to clean high-rise buildings without human labor. ZenaTech is now securing permits from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and building a regional team of drone pilots and sales professionals.

ZenaTech is also advancing a broad product roadmap. Its flagship ZenaDrone 1000, a heavy-lift, gas-powered platform, is targeted at logistics and defense customers. The company’s smaller IQ Nano drone is built for autonomous indoor flight in warehouses, stadiums, and data centers. Through its Taiwan-based Spider Vision Sensors subsidiary, ZenaTech is also integrating advanced AI and hyperspectral imaging into its drones to support precision agriculture and industrial inspection. Passley said these investments are “intended to grow the company over the long term” by enhancing software, sensors, and manufacturing capacity.

With surging top-line growth, expanding global operations, and a robust hardware and software pipeline, ZenaTech is positioning itself as a scalable platform in the rapidly maturing drone economy.

AgEagle Aerial Systems (NYSE: UAVS) is showing signs of a meaningful financial turnaround. For Q1 2025, the company reported net income of $7.06 million — a sharp reversal from the $6.32 million loss in Q1 2024 — driven largely by cost reductions and a gain related to warrant liabilities. Operating losses narrowed by 58%, and gross margin expanded to 58.5% from 50.2% year over year, thanks to disciplined expense management and a focus on higher-margin drone hardware. “This pivotal milestone is a clear validation of the strategic decisions we have made to streamline operations, sharpen our commercial focus, and prioritize higher-margin product lines,” said CEO Bill Irby.

While total revenue dipped slightly to $3.65 million due to seasonal SaaS softness, drone sales surged 98% to $2.23 million — underscoring the company’s pivot toward core hardware and sensor offerings. AgEagle also ended the quarter with $3.78 million in cash, a modest increase from year-end 2024.

Strategically, AgEagle is building partnerships to extend its global reach. In India, it recently formed a manufacturing and licensing alliance with Vyom Drones to bring its eBee X surveying drone to one of the world’s fastest-growing agtech markets. With over 345 million acres of arable land and increasing government support for precision farming, India represents a major growth opportunity.

In parallel, AgEagle announced a new collaboration with Ascent AeroSystems to integrate its RedEdge-P multispectral camera into Ascent’s rugged Spirit UAV. The joint solution targets high-value agricultural use cases, offering advanced data capture in demanding conditions.

With improving margins, a leaner cost structure, and a focused expansion strategy, AgEagle appears well-positioned to scale its presence in the global agricultural and public-sector drone markets.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: KTOS) is a technology company focused on defense, national security, and commercial markets. The company invests heavily in internally funded research and development to deliver affordable, reliable, and rapidly deployable mission-critical systems. Kratos is recognized for designing products that enable fast, large-scale, low-cost manufacturing, providing a competitive advantage to prime contractors and government customers.

In March 2025, Kratos was added to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, reflecting its financial stability, market position, and growth. CEO Eric DeMarco stated this milestone validates their strategy of delivering disruptive defense technologies that support warfighters with practical capabilities.

Kratos recently received a sole source award valued at approximately thirty million dollars to produce air defense system hardware. This contract highlights Kratos’ leadership in manufacturing military-grade hardware for air defense, hypersonics, propulsion, and other national security systems, with production at a secure company facility.

The company is expanding deployment of its automated truck platooning technology in Ohio and Indiana, in partnership with state transportation departments and logistics firms. Originally developed for the military, this autonomous driving system addresses critical logistics challenges such as truck driver shortages and safety, improving supply chain resilience and operational efficiency in commercial sectors.

Financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed revenues of three hundred and two point six million dollars, representing over nine percent growth compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by unmanned systems and government solutions, including defense rocket systems, microwave products, and C5ISR technologies. The book-to-bill ratio stood at 1.2, with backlog increasing to approximately one point five billion dollars. Adjusted earnings per share were twelve cents.

Mr. DeMarco expressed confidence in the company’s outlook given the clarity in defense funding and potential increases in the national security budget. Planned expansion of Israeli facilities will support scaling of air defense and missile production. Key growth areas include hypersonics, propulsion, microwave electronics, and space and satellite programs.

Kratos’ U.S.-based supply chain and military-spec hardware and software expertise position it well to capitalize on renewed defense industrial base investments. The company is focused on increasing market share and margins by leveraging its unique capabilities and strategic industry opportunities.

EHang (Nasdaq: EH) is a global leader in urban air mobility (UAM), specializing in autonomous, eco-friendly eVTOL aircraft. In 2024, EHang achieved record revenues of RMB456.2 million (US$62.5 million), up 288.5% year-over-year, alongside delivering 216 EH216-S units, a 315% increase. The company posted its first full year of non-GAAP profitability and positive operating cash flow, signaling strong financial momentum.

EHang secured critical regulatory milestones, including the world’s first type, production, and airworthiness certificates for pilotless eVTOLs from China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).
