# Market Alert: Actelis Networks on a Roll - Secures Orange County Smart City Win Following Military Base Contracts

Actelis Networks (NASDAQ: ASNS)*, a leader in cyber-hardened networking solutions, has secured a significant new order to modernize Orange County, California's intelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructure, continuing the company's impressive momentum across multiple high-growth sectors.

This latest win, announced today, builds upon Actelis' recent $140,000 order for U.S. military base modernization projects and follows strong full-year 2024 financial results that saw revenue increase by 38% and gross margins more than double.

Orange County, California's third most populous county with over 3 million residents, joins Washington D.C., Seattle, and Ventura County in selecting Actelis' advanced networking technology for critical infrastructure upgrades. The order, placed through Actelis' long-standing partner Western Systems, will enhance traffic management across one of the nation's most heavily trafficked transportation networks.

Actelis' hybrid-fiber technology delivers fiber-grade performance over existing infrastructure, providing both significant cost savings and dramatically accelerated project timelines—a combination that appears to be driving the company's recent string of contract wins across multiple infrastructure sectors.

The Orange County contract comes just days after Actelis announced new orders to deliver its advanced GigaLine 800 (GL800) networking solution for U.S. military base modernization. These military orders will support Army installations with secure, high-speed connectivity for barracks, information centers, and other critical facilities. With Department of Defense-certified security including JITC FIPS certification, Actelis has positioned itself as a trusted provider for mission-critical defense networking applications.

In late March, Actelis also announced an order from one of North America's largest railway groups to support Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation. This growing diversification across transportation, defense, and critical infrastructure sectors suggests Actelis' technology is gaining traction in markets where security and rapid deployment are paramount.

The company's strong commercial momentum follows impressive financial results for fiscal year 2024, with revenue growing 38% to reach $7.8 million and gross margin expanding to 55% from 34% in the prior year. Actelis also successfully reduced operating expenses by 13% while shrinking its loss per share by 67% to $0.85.

Following these results, Litchfield Hills Research's Theodore O'Neill reiterated his $5 price target and Buy rating on Actelis Networks, noting the company is "moving in the right direction – up and to the right" when viewed on a rolling four-quarter basis. The analyst highlighted that Actelis shares are trading at an 85% to 93% discount on sales measures compared to industry peers.

With the global smart cities market projected to reach $300 billion by 2032 and the ITS segment expected to hit $65.33 billion, Actelis appears to be establishing a strong competitive position in rapidly growing markets for secure, rapidly deployable networking infrastructure.
