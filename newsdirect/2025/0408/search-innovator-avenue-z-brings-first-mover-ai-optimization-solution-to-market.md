# Search Innovator Avenue Z Brings First-Mover AI Optimization Solution to Market

Avenue Z, the leading marketing and communications agency pioneering AI optimization, today announces the launch of the industry’s first comprehensive AI Optimization solution—built for first-mover brands and businesses looking to lead in the new era of digital marketing.

Recently ranked #1 in Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Agencies by Gemini, Clutch, and others across the U.S. and globally, Avenue Z continues to redefine the space it helped create. With a 30-year heritage rooted in search and digital marketing—tracing back to founder Jeffrey Herzog, the original pioneer of SEO and founder of iCrossing—the agency brings unmatched experience to this new frontier.

This next-generation solution goes far beyond traditional SEO, combining high-impact PR, LLM technical optimization, mass-scale content production, and strategic communications into one unified, market-first offering.

Designed for AI-native platforms like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot, and GROK, the solution empowers brands to lead in AI-driven environments. “It’s all about building authority and it’s a zero-sum game,” said Jeffrey Herzog, CEO of Avenue Z. “Authority is no longer just earned — it’s architected. You are either visible or not; there aren’t pages of results to sort through. AI has changed the game, and we’ve built a solution that helps brands and businesses win it.”

“Our solution is built from the ground up for how AI platforms actually work, how consumer behavior has changed - and we’re already seeing early signs of success across visibility, trust, and conversion metrics. The brands that move now will be the leaders in this next era of discoverability.”

A New Standard in AI OptimizationAvenue Z’s AI Optimization (AIO) Solution—also known as LLM Optimization (LLMO) or Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)—is purpose-built for the post-Google era, where platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity are reshaping how consumers discover and engage with information. The framework is engineered to align with how large language models interpret, prioritize, and surface content, from metadata to media signals.

Avenue Z’s AIO solution is anchored in three core pillars:

* High-Impact Media Placement – Securing trusted media coverage that LLMs recognize and rank.
* Strategic Content Development – Crafting Q&A and long-tail content designed for AI comprehension and citation.
* Technical LLM Optimization – Structuring content with schema, metadata, and formatting for AI parsing.

For brands looking to understand where they stand in this new landscape, Avenue Z offers a complimentary AI Share of Voice Audit—a snapshot of how often your brand is being cited across AI platforms.

Avenue Z is the leading marketing and communications agency pioneering AI optimization driving influence across all channels—from ChatGPT to The Wall Street Journal to TikTok. With 30 years of leadership in search and digital marketing, we apply strategic communications, high-impact PR, performance media, and AI optimization to help companies build reputation and grow revenue through our proprietary, technology-driven approach. We are the agency for influence. Visit: AvenueZ.com
