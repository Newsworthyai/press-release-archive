# NAVEX Releases New Supply Chain Due Diligence Course

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, announces its supply chain due diligence course to introduce learners to critical supply chain concepts, including due diligence, forced labour, and occupational health and safety. Users will also be educated on responsible sourcing, risk assessment, and the significance of reporting to help organisations ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate supply chain risk.

Organisations rely on their supply chains to accomplish important goals. Employees – and supply chain partners – need to understand the importance of this complex network of suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, and how to help maintain the highest ethical and legal standards within it. This course will provide an overview of supply chain due diligence laws and regulations from around the globe including German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, UK Modern Slavery Act, France’s Duty of Vigilance Law, and EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

The NAVEX supply chain due diligence course:

1. Explores guidelines for supply chain due diligence to help ensure responsible sourcing.
2. Educates on illegal and unethical exploitation, including ways organisations can protect human dignity.
3. Explains the importance of respecting labour rights of all workers in the supply chain.
4. Reviews health and safety principles that protect workers in the supply chain.

“Employees and supply chain partners who understand supply chain due diligence have a better chance of spotting issues and empowering their organisations to resolve them,” explains Jen Farthing, General Manager of Training Content at NAVEX. “By participating in the course experience, learners recognise the critical role they play in supply chain compliance and become motivated to follow guidelines and organisational policies and procedures.”

The course is available today and can be accessed in English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and Swedish. For more information on the NAVEX supply chain due diligence training modules, please visit the course webpage.
