Over the years, legacy memecoin– Dogecoin (DOGE) has delivered one of the highest return on investment, especially for early backers. Despite trading roughly 63% from its all-time high of $0.73, DOGE price still maintains well over 480X price gain. While the growth can be attributed to many factors, its role as a pioneering memecoin stands out.

Like Dogecoin, this presale gem– Cutoshi (CUTO) is a pioneering hybrid memecoin based on the Ethereum (ETH) network. While it is also setting new standards for new emerging memecoins to adopt, it has continued to garner massive interest from savvy traders who also bought into Dogecoin early enough because of its prospective outlook.

Like Dogecoin, Cutoshi Aims to Deliver Exponential Gains for Early Backers One of the most fascinating things about Cutoshi (CUTO) is its unified hybrid ecosystem which combines the communal nature of memecoins with the lucrativeness of decentralized finance (DeFi). Notably, Cutoshi was inspired by the popular Chinese Lucky cat associated with good fortune as well as Satoshi Nakamoto’s core blockchain principles of decentralization, privacy and monetary freedom. These collectively form the basis on which the Cutoshi ecosystem is built to thrive.

Meanwhile, Cutoshi aims to bring DeFi to the masses as such, the Cutoshi ecosystem housed lucrative DeFi tools like a DEX protocol, and different farming mechanisms alongside a dedicated Academy that intends to bridge the knowledge gap in the crypto market.

Another important aspect of Cutoshi is its native currency–the $CUTO token, which facilitates transactions within the ecosystem as well as Cutoshi DEX's buy-and-burn mechanisms. While this ensures Cutoshi’s self-sustainable, it also positions the CUTO token among the best crypto coins to buy. Now selling at a modest price of $0.031, the CUTO token has already delivered over 100% ROI to early backers who purchased at $0.015.

Dogecoin Price Faces Extended Consolidation Amidst Weekly DeclineFollowing the recent downturn in the crypto market, Dogecoin (DOGE) was not spared as it also slipped below its monthly resistance around $0.33. Now trading within a weekly price range of $0.33 and $0.27, DOGE price reflects nearly 18% decline in the past week and over 28% in the past month.

This negative price outlook has shrinked DOGE token’s year-to-date price gain to only about 240%. For context, DOGE price has previously reached a yearly peak of $0.46; however, failure to hold strong above the $0.40 price mark has led to a series of downtrend including the most recent one, which pushed DOGE price to a two-month low.

Meanwhile, despite the recent downtrend, token holders and market analysts still maintain great optimism for a potential bullish reversal. According to a recent X post, crypto analyst Solberg Invest, DOGE price is trading above a solid support zone. If maintained, Solberg claimed that the top altcoin’s nest bull wave could send it to as high as $0.60.

Ethereum Price Trajectory suggests Progressive DowntrendThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has continued on a downward slope following a new wave of downtrend in the past week. Notably, ETH price plunged to a weekly low of $2,449 from an entry price of $3,180. This resulted in over 12% decline in the past week, further compounding the monthly decline which now stands at over 21%.

Meanwhile, Ethereum price has been trading below the resistance level around $3,600 a week into January. Ever since, ETH price has been registering new lows week in week out, with the past week registering the highest decline so far.

Currently trading within a weekly price range of $3,183 and $2,825, ETH price appears to be trading above the crucial support zone around $2,400. Failure to hold strong above this level could result in an extended downturn. Meanwhile, Ethereum token’s technical analysis including short and long term SMAs and EMAs points at a strong sell, which suggests that the current trend may persist for some time.

Can Cutoshi Hit the $1 Price Mark Ahead on Dogecoin?Unlike Cutoshi, Dogecoin and most existing memecoins do not hold so much potential for everyday people. Cutoshi particularly sits at the intersection of memecoin and DeFi, allowing it to offer several lucrative potentials than most traditional memecoins. This, coupled with its presale status positions Cutoshi for explosive growth during and post-ICO journey, while ranking it among the best crypto to buy now.
