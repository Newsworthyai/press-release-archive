NEW YORK – May 22, 2025 – Turnkey, the secure, flexible, and scalable wallet infrastructure provider for digital asset operations, today announced full compatibility between its policy engine and the TRON blockchain. This integration equips fintech and payment providers with the tools needed to confidently build on TRON, the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Turnkey's TRON policy engine enables builders to expand their crypto offerings with confidence, while upholding the high security standards expected by both users and regulators.

For developers in the TRON ecosystem, it offers an all-in-one solution to create a fully whitelabeled (custodial or non-custodial) wallet solution for their product, allowing end users to retain full control of their private keys.

“For payment processors, banks, and fintech companies, the ability to participate safely in this ecosystem is no longer optional — it's a competitive necessity,” said Bryce Ferguson, CEO of Turnkey. “As digital assets become increasingly integrated into mainstream payment flows, robust transaction automation will be the foundation that enables an everyday user to confidently engage with blockchain networks.”

“Turnkey’s integration with the TRON network reflects a growing trend of infrastructure providers enabling more secure and compliant access to blockchain systems,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO. “This unlocks greater flexibility for developers and institutions building on TRON, and represents an important step toward scalable, enterprise-grade applications within the network.”

Turnkey is a secure, flexible, and scalable key management infrastructure for teams looking to integrate embedded wallets into their application or streamline their digital asset operations with transaction automation. Ensuring that users have a seamless and protected product experience while transacting with crypto is critical, and stronger risk management is essential when assessing how to store, access, and generate private keys. Their policy engine is the foundation for flexible controls and permissions within every organization built on Turnkey.

The TRON transaction parser adds additional support, providing detailed insights into existing transaction structures and breaking down complex onchain data into clear, actionable information. The TRON policy engine is built for high performance and includes transaction parsing for more granular control over policies, breaking down complex onchain data into clear, actionable insights. This enables developers to build secure authentication flows, streamline internal treasury operations, and create millions of embedded wallets for their product — all through one powerful API.
