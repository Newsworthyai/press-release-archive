The day began with an inspiring keynote from Aaron Kwittken, Founder and Global CEO of PRophet. In his session, “Empowering Your Team: How to Upskill for the Age of AI in Communications,” Kwittken urged communications professionals to future-proof their careers by embracing a new Human-led, AI-fed model of working. He introduced the concept of the “Communications Engineer” - a hybrid talent fluent in both data and storytelling - and challenged teams to replace instinct with insight. Kwittken highlighted the importance of not only leveraging generative AI, but also harnessing predictive and prescriptive AI to forecast media outcomes, test messaging, and track performance in real time. His actionable frameworks and call for industry-wide upskilling set a dynamic tone for the summit.

Erynn Baird, Head of Marketing at Opal, joined by Jessica Padula, VP of Marketing & Sustainability at Nespresso, demonstrated how the Opal platform is revolutionizing campaign planning for leading brands. In their session, “From Siloed to Synchronized: Connecting Teams for Campaign Planning,” Baird emphasized that marketing is inherently visual, experiential, and strategic—far beyond what traditional project management tools can support. Opal’s holistic platform provides high-level storytelling visibility, enabling teams to track progress, align on campaign direction, and unify previously siloed departments. The discussion addressed the critical need for a single source of truth in marketing, warning that a lack of alignment and visibility can erode credibility with decision-makers.

Edelman: The Rise of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

Mirza Germovic, SVP, Global AI & Product at Edelman, introduced attendees to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), a cutting-edge approach to brand visibility in the era of AI-powered search. As consumers increasingly turn to AI platforms like ChatGPT and Copilot, GEO is emerging as a vital complement to traditional SEO. Germovic revealed Edelman’s new GEO solution, designed to help brands not only remain discoverable but also shape how they are represented in AI-generated results—a communications challenge as much as a technical one.

OpenAI: ChatGPT’s Enterprise Revolution

The summit concluded with a forward-looking session from Erica Vlahinos, GTM Director at OpenAI, who spotlighted the extraordinary impact of ChatGPT across the enterprise landscape. With 92% of Fortune 500 companies now leveraging OpenAI tools and 78% of their employees actively using ChatGPT, the platform has become a cornerstone of modern business productivity. Vlahinos shared compelling data: employees using ChatGPT complete 12% more tasks, finish work 25% faster, and deliver 40% higher-quality output.

She also introduced attendees to Canvas, a new feature enabling live editing and real-time collaboration within ChatGPT. The platform’s chat capabilities now support deep research, content drafting, editing, social media post creation, and even image generation. Advanced analytics provide actionable recommendations for future marketing campaigns. As Vlahinos emphasized, “The companies winning today are those empowering their teams with AI to work smarter, not harder.”

The Tech Demo Summit concluded with a shared vision: the future of communications is collaborative, data-driven, and powered by both human creativity and AI innovation.
