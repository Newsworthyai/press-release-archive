As Bitcoin’s rally precedes $100,000 the crypto market is building a bullish momentum again. Notably, the meme coin sector has seen a high influx, as Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by 25% in the last four sessions. However, Dogecoin's upside is limited because of its large capitalization; that’s why traders are seeking potential meme coins that can profit from significant growth opportunities, as DOGE did in its early days.

Meanwhile, a newcomer has become the center of attention due to its outstanding presale performance. This creative memeFi token, Cutoshi (CUTO) has become viral because of its utility-driven ecosystem.

Cutoshi Pulls Large Players With Exponential Price Rally Potential

Dogecoin and Cutoshi are gaining traction in the ongoing crypto bull run. Dogecoin’s explosive potential and Cutoshi’s innovative DeFi solutions are capturing significant attention. Inspired by the Chinese Lucky Cat and Satoshi Nakamoto’s principles, Cutoshi aims to empower people with financial freedom through its decentralized exchange (DEX), yield farming, group quests, utility-focused NFTs and more.

Cutoshi emphasizes decentralization, giving investors full control over their assets. Its standout feature, the Cutoshi multichain DEX, enables seamless on-chain swapping of digital assets.

With the farming now in full swing almost 4,000 members have joined where they can harvest and compete for CUTO. This will continue to help increase the community growth and the presale success. Buyers can complete fun quests to rise through the leaderboard where they can also earn prizes.

The project’s limited token supply could create strong demand, potentially driving the CUTO token price to $1 by early 2025.

Cutoshi’s growth is already evident, with over $1,600,000 in revenue during its fourth presale stage. Its native $CUTO token, now priced at $0.031, reflects a 106% increase from its initial stage one price. Cutoshi is also poised to bring Ethereum-based meme coins back into the spotlight. With its expanding utility and rising interest, Cutoshi shows strong potential to outpace its competitors in the long term.

Dogecoin Price Prediction For 2025

Dogecoin's price is gaining significant momentum, jumping nearly 21.38% in the last 7 days and building on its recent upward trend. Currently priced at $0.383, DOGE has reached its highest level since December 18, when the broader market faced a steep downturn.

The rally is brought to life by whales, who are showing renewed interest now. On January 3, whales bought 1.08 billion DOGE for $413 million. Adding to the excitement, DOGE even received an unexpected and too-good-to-be-true trigger from Donald Trump's rule for a new agency called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.

Despite the development that the technical analysis has exclusively ruled, the Dogecoin recovery should hit the price level of $0.72, or an 87% increase from the current price that it knew before. If the meme coin perseveres in its current rage, the next target could very well be $1.20, which is an even bigger target.

In a recent thread on X, Alex Thorn of Galaxy Research shared an optimistic outlook. He believes Dogecoin will climb over 170% this year, reaching the $1 mark for the first time and pushing its market cap to $100 billion.
