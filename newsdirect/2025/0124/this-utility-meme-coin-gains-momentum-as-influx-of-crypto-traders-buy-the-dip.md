As the crypto market saw a downturn in the last weeks of 2024, crypto enthusiasts are not discouraged. Buyers are taking advantage of lower prices to accumulate tokens ahead of the expected 2025 bull run. Notably, the inauguration of the crypto-friendly Donald Trump is pushing prices even higher.

In this context, a new utility meme coin is attracting a huge amount of buyers to its presale and here’s why.

Crypto Investors Buy The DipIn the last weeks of 2024, the crypto markets have seen a significant downturn. Bitcoin’s price fell below the $100,000 mark after reaching an all-time high of $108,268 on December 17. However, market indicators suggest that traders are not discouraged by this price shift.

The market downturn started shortly after Bitcoin reached its ATH. By December 20, over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated. A bulk of these liquidations, or $856.66 million, were long-term positions. These were traders that did not account for the short-term volatility of the crypto sector.

Currently, Bitcoin is slightly above the $100k mark, trading at $106,473.90. With this, indicators are showing that traders are using this dip to buy up the tokens. For instance, Bitcoin’s technical indicators are still very strong. Key weekly moving averages are all significantly below Bitcoin’s current price, indicating strong momentum.

At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is at a comfortable 68. This suggests that Bitcoin is still not in an overbought territory. Strong technicals reveal that traders are still very bullish on the crypto market. This is also why the new crypto project Cutoshi, is showing a strong performance.

Cutoshi Breaks New Milestone In Presale InvestmentsAs traders are gearing up for the 2025 bull market and buying the dip, many are looking at Cutoshi (CUTO). This memeFi token recently started trending again after another milestone on its presale, having raised over $1.6 million in presale investments.

Buyers are attracted to Cutoshi’s blend of memes and DeFi. This token hopes to use its meme coin appeal to attract more people into the DeFi space, revealing the benefits of decentralization. Taking its symbol from the Chinese Lucky Cat, Cutoshi is a playful token that hopes to bring luck to traders' portfolios. At the same time, it takes its name and inspiration from legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi.

Just like Satoshi, Cutoshi puts decentralization and user control first. Its multichain DEX hopes to make trading more accessible than ever. It features self-custody, low fees and an intuitive interface. Thanks to this blend of features, it aims to make Satoshi’s vision of a decentralized financial system accessible to everyone.

Cutoshi also places a key emphasis on education, which is crucial for bringing new traders into the market. It is building a dedicated learning platform to offer an engaging and gamified way for users to learn about DeFi. The platform will also boost engagement with various types of rewards, including community missions and token farming.

With more and more people entering the crypto market, Cutoshi hopes to educate a whole new generation of traders about DeFi. By using memes, it wants to transform their viral potential into tangible gains for the DeFi space. With traders concerned about decentralization more than ever, it may have a real potential to achieve its mission.
