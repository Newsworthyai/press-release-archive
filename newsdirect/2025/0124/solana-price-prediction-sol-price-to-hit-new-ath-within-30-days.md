# Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To Hit New ATH Within 30 Days

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/290600866/Tjn389zh.jpeg)

Solana (SOL) has attracted significant interest in the past and continues to lead the market with its highly scalable and efficient ecosystem. In 2021 alone, SOL provided a return of over 10,000%. Though facing bearish pressure in most of 2024, Solana is gearing up for another great year.

Although SOL has been a star performer since its inception, it has already seen a significant price rise, and its large capitalization hinders its parabolic upside. Similar to SOL’s early potential, a new ERC-20 utility memecoin has seen significant capital influx and is already over half way through its presale. Its unique approach in the meme coin sector and utility-based model distinguish it from its peers.

Solana Trendline Breakout: New ATH Soon?After the top formation on 22nd November last year, Solana has been trading in a declining channel pattern with lower low and lower high bearish formation. On Friday, it broke out from the upper trendline of the channel and has seen good follow-through on the breakout. In the last seven days, Solana has surged 18.40%, taking the price above the $220 level.

According to market predictions, Solana (SOL) may find strong resistance between $230 and $250. If this hurdle is crossed, it can move higher, with the remaining upper openings being the next targets. Some investors are hopeful that Solana might reach $280 before the conclusion of the first quarter of 2025. Therefore, the possible price jump from its current trading limits may be higher. Further, indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) show that bearishness has been normalized and that a transitional stage of bullishness is foreseen.

Solana has successfully figured out the vital problems, like transaction cost and blockchain scalability, which remain the biggest troublemakers for its challengers. It uses its distinct Proof of History (PoH) consensus to allow the network to achieve thousands of transactions simultaneously with minimum charges, thus making it a perfect venue for DeFi and NFTs. The boost of these applications has brought up the market of Solana, which is mainly driven by its technology and developing ecosystem.

While hitting a new ATH in 30 days is possible, the $300 target is quite ambitious; it’s not entirely out of reach. Strong fundamentals, a thriving ecosystem, and supportive technical signals highlight Solana’s potential for growth. Still, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable.
