Healthy food options to kick off the new year

If you are looking to make meal prep a breeze Bush’s Sidekicks are Mia’s go-to for quick and delicious bowls. The bowl possibilities are endless and convenient! These pre-seasoned, slow-simmered beans come in four flavors inspired by a variety of cuisines like Taco Fiesta, Southwest Zest and Rustic Tuscany, adding a flavorful kick to my weeknight meals. The whole family can easily customize their grain bowls, salads, and taco nights with Bush’s Sidekicks. Packed with plant-based protein and fiber, Bush’s Sidekicks add a nutritious kick to make satisfying bowls.

If you are looking for ways to incorporate fresh fruit into your diet during the course of the year and look for items that are versatile and delicious and that is where Pears come in. Pears are most known for their fall harvest, yet with more than 10 different varietals, fresh USA Pears are available year-round. They can easily be added to a salad, enjoyed as a grab-and-go snack, or baked into your favorite dish, and I love that they are flavorful and fiber-rich fruit. One medium-size pear provides 21% of the recommended daily fiber value. Fresh pears are healthy, convenient, and tasty — they check all the boxes!
