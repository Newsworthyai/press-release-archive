# Solana's Network Growth: The Rise and Fall of Its Meme Coins Compared to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Emerging Tokens Like Cutoshi

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/135993204/Hb9XhIlS.jpeg)

The Solana (SOL) network saw an overwhelming surge in memecoin activity in 2024 due to platforms like Pump.fun, which made it easy for memecoins to be created and launched.

High-profile endorsements such as the U.S. President Donal Trump’s launch of the $TRUMP coin further helped fuel Solana’s network growth, though an endorsement of the $LIBRA token by Argentine President Javier Milei did the opposite, as $LIBRA fell into a scandal and caused a 25% drop in Solana’s token value.

However, as Solana’s network continues to be challenged, memecoins from other networks such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant volatility but have maintained a presence in the crypto market.

Amid this turbulence in the memecoin sector, new entrants like Cutoshi ($CUTO) are redefining the space by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities and is predicted to be the next memefi coin projected for 100x growth.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Signs of Fatigue or Revival?The recent collapse of the Libra token, which triggered $99 million in trader losses and scandalized Argentine President Javier Milei, has intensified scrutiny on memecoins.

Following the $LIBRA controversy, venture capitalist Nic Carter declared that the "Memecoins are unquestionably over," arguing that memecoins' main appeal—fair launches without insider advantages—has lost credibility.

Despite its enduring status as the original memecoin, Dogecoin is showing signs of stagnation. Trading at $0.23—down 66% from its all-time high of $0.73 in 2021—DOGE has seen a 34% increase in active addresses, reaching 6.57 million monthly.

Dogecoin's charts are showing signs of decline, with a "death cross" pattern indicating a potential drop. Meanwhile, some analysts think the market might change because of possible ETF news from Grayscale and Bitwise.

On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is seeing a big jump in activity from large traders, with their holdings increasing by over 90%. This suggests they're betting on a price recovery. If SHIB can break through the $0.00001660 mark, some predict a significant price increase.

Cutoshi Presale Progress: Investor Confidence and Market PotentialCutoshi’s ecosystem is uniquely focused on its community, and plans to release its own multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX), which would make it easy for users to seamlessly swap assets across various blockchains while maintaining privacy and security.

Each transaction will have a 0.25% fee, with 80% of it distributed to liquidity providers and the remaining 20% used for token burns and buybacks, which will further help reinforce the token’s value. Some traders are predicting Cutoshi could outperform Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in Growth in 2025 and may bring back investor confidence in Ethereum based tokens.

Beyond the DEX, Cutoshi will introduce "Cutoshi Quests and Farming," a gamified yield farming initiative that enhances community engagement through missions, achievements, and rewards. Participants will earn “Cutopoints,” which can be redeemed for various ecosystem benefits, fostering both interaction and passive income opportunities.

Additionally, Cutoshi plans to launch a collection of 8,000 exclusive NFTs designed to reward early adopters and active community members. Early participants have benefited from limited-time bonuses, such as a 35% increase on deposits during promotional periods.

Currently, Cutoshi is in Stage 5 of its presale, pricing each $CUTO token at $0.045. The presale has advanced through multiple stages, with the token price increasing from an initial $0.015 to $0.045 in Stage 5, reflecting a near 200% surge.

The project has already raised over $2.1 million, signaling strong trader confidence. With 55% of the total 440 million token supply allocated to the presale, Cutoshi ensures significant community ownership from the outset, positioning itself as a compelling long-term investment opportunity.
