# Sea Tow Foundation™ Releases Second Video in the "Sober Skipper™: Why It Matters" Series Featuring Professional Bass Angler, Mike Iaconelli

The Sea Tow Foundation™, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting boating safety, has launched the latest video in its "Sober Skipper™: Why It Matters" series, featuring professional bass angler Mike Iaconelli. In this newest release, Iaconelli shares why designating a Sober Skipper is essential for safe and enjoyable fishing trips, and boating in general.

The "Sober Skipper: Why It Matters" video series is part of the Sea Tow Foundation’s ongoing effort to combat BUI. The campaign specifically targets men ages 24-50, the group identified by U.S. Coast Guard statistics as being most at risk for BUI-related incidents. The new video sheds light on how BUI is often overlooked in the fishing community and why responsible boating is just as crucial as responsible driving. Iaconelli emphasizes that boaters must be prepared for all aspects of their trip, from navigation and safety to awareness and responsible decision-making.

“We’re excited to bring an angler’s perspective to the conversation," said Gail R. Kulp, Executive Director of the Sea Tow Foundation. “Mike Iaconelli’s message highlights how being a Sober Skipper allows him to go out and be successful at catching fish while ensuring the safety of everyone else on the water.”

The Sea Tow Foundation has also created an Industry Toolkit to help businesses and organizations share the video series with their customers and members. This resource includes sample social media captions, an image library, email templates and newsletter copy—making it easy for industry professionals to spread the "Sober Skipper: Why It Matters" message and promote safer boating practices.
