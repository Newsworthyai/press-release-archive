# Pepe Coin's Dominance Challenged: Cardano and XRP Investors Explore New MemeFi Opportunities with Cutoshi

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/319327683/hjepRtaX.png)

The meme coin market has taken a turn in recent years with tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) triggering speculative trading in the crypto space. Nevertheless, in 2023, Pepe Coin (PEPE) burst onto the scene with force, fueled by meme culture and community-driven hype. At its peak, PEPE had over a $3.94 billion market capitalization, indicating that meme coins had now grown beyond jokes to standard financial assets.

The Path Ahead For PEPE:According to The Block, network growth has stabilized in Pepe, as the active address ratio remains about flat, and the price has witnessed a great 39.56% decrease in the last month.

Extra scope for new-age useful utility outside the field of Pepe seems an inviting target for investors. In Cardano (ADA) and XRP communities, these may be values directed toward real long-term aspects and decentralized innovations.

The Cardano ecosystem has drawn one closer to decentralization and achieved a correspondingly increased Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi applications by 22.4%, crossing the $383.7 million mark. Meanwhile, XRP had some stability challenges that required urgent 2.3.0 version updates on XRPL node operators to improve their infrastructure's resilience.

With all of this in mind, holders of ADA and XRP seem to be scouting for a new project-fusing meme appeal with the actual utility niche that Cutoshi (CUTO) aims to fill. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely entirely on hype, Cutoshi includes DeFi functionality, cross-chain compatibility, and community incentives to set the stage for sustainable long-term adoption.

Let us examine just how Pepe's stagnation can be a hotbed for any trader and how Cutoshi is set to fill the next big gap in the MemeFi sector.

Cutoshi: Multi-Chain DEX That Will Change Crypto’s FutureCutoshi's primary innovation, among others, consists of a multi-chain DEX, through which seamless asset drop can take place between different blockchain networks. Cutoshi’s DEX offers its users more privacy, reduced fees, and improved liquidity as compared to centralized exchanges which are hindered by certain constraints that they must comply with. It eliminates many of the bottlenecks seen in traditional DeFi platforms by creating a connection between disparate blockchain ecosystems.

Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) believe Cutoshi is truly decentralised, true to Satoshi Nakamoto’s mission of monetary freedom for everyone. As of Feb 2025, large players and institutional traders are hoarding Bitcoin, which has made a stumbling block for retail traders to enter the crypto market.

Cutoshi is the solution — a community-driven ecosystem where wealth generation is not a privilege for an elite but accessible to all. Cutoshi’s branding is heavily influenced by the Lucky Cat, which represents prosperity and good fortune in Asian cultures. This motif goes beyond aesthetics, reinforcing the project’s mission to bring wealth and success to its community.

Gamified experiences are also at the heart of Cutoshi's growth strategy! Its ecosystem allows the user to participate through quests, farming rewards, and NFT-driven challenges, making them incentives while keeping the members as active participants. CUTO tokens bring utility, which has been a longstanding pain point for many traders who have wished to enter the meme coin market but stepped back due to the utility issue.

Cutoshi's presale is in Stage 5 of 6 now, with a token price of $0.045. As the presale continues the price is intended to rise, giving early buyers the competitive edge over late joiners. Cutoshi is doing better than many established meme tokens, with its presale already surpassed $2 million as of Feb. 26, 2025.

The project managed to raise over $900,000 through its presale, before going viral on X (formerly Twitter). Not only did it send Cutoshi higher on the #1 trending charts but it also opened the floodgates to MemeFi's ecosystem to a more international and diverse audience, bringing the focus back to what the crypto ecosystem has stood for since Nakamoto’s Bitcoin launch in 2009. The MemeFi sector is growing exponentially, with a 12.76% uptick in the last 24 hours, making it a “lucky” time for new investors to join the Cutoshi bull run.
