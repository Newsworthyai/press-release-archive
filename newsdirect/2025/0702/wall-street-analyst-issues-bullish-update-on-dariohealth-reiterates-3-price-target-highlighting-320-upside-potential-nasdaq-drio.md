# Wall Street Analyst Issues Bullish Update on DarioHealth, Reiterates $3 Price Target Highlighting 320% Upside Potential (NASDAQ: DRIO)

Wall Street analyst Theodore O'Neill of Litchfield Hills Research has reiterated his Buy rating and $3 price target on DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO)*, highlighting what he sees as significant upside potential of approximately 320% from current trading levels around $0.71.

The analyst's updated note comes as recently IPO’d competitor Hinge Health (NYSE: HNGE) currently trades at a $3.53 billion market cap following its successful public debut, creating what O'Neill describes as a stark "valuation gap" with DarioHealth, which has a market capitalization of approximately $31 million despite comparable growth metrics and superior gross margins.

GLP-1 Success Validates Platform's Value PropositionThe research update particularly emphasized DarioHealth's recent clinical findings presented at the American Diabetes Association's 85th Annual Scientific Sessions. A landmark study of 715 GLP-1 users revealed that patients who discontinued their medication maintained stable outcomes with no significant weight or glucose rebound for at least six months when using Dario's platform.

The analyst's report highlights DarioHealth's study findings that demonstrated users who discontinued GLP-1 medication while continuing to use the platform maintained stable outcomes without significant weight or glucose rebound for at least six months. O'Neill points to these clinical results as a key differentiator for the company's value proposition in the expanding GLP-1 market.

This clinical validation comes at a critical time as the GLP-1 market for weight loss medications is projected to reach $100 billion by 2030, with employers increasingly struggling to manage the high costs of these drugs while ensuring sustainable patient outcomes.

Strategic Partnerships Expand Addressable MarketThe analyst also highlighted DarioHealth's recent strategic commercial agreement with GreenKey Health announced on June 26, which targets the $150 billion sleep apnea market affecting over 29 million Americans. The collaboration integrates behavioral health, sleep, and cardiometabolic care to deliver a comprehensive solution for employers and health plans seeking to reduce healthcare costs.

O'Neill's analysis emphasizes the strategic benefits of DarioHealth's partnership with GreenKey Health, noting how the collaboration combines their respective strengths to create a comprehensive, data-driven solution designed to improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and boost productivity for employers and health plans.

Dramatic Valuation Discount Compared to PeersThe most compelling aspect of the analyst's thesis is the dramatic valuation contrast between DarioHealth and its peers. Using a discounted future earnings model and comparative peer analysis, O'Neill calculates a fair value of $3 per share.

According to the report, If DarioHealth were to trade at this target, its Market Cap/Sales multiple would be approximately 2.2x, which would still be below the peer average of 2.38x, according to the analyst's calculations. This suggests the company remains significantly undervalued even at the target price, especially considering its high growth profile and improving gross margins.

The company's B2B2C gross margins now exceed 80%, higher than many competitors, while operating expenses have declined significantly, positioning the company on a path to operational cash flow breakeven by the end of 2025.

Financial Outlook Supports Bullish ThesisO'Neill forecasts DarioHealth could reach $35.9 million in revenue for 2025, growing to $66.1 million in 2026, with the company expected to achieve GAAP profitability during 2026.

DarioHealth's AI-driven platform serves five chronic conditions through a single interface, diabetes, hypertension, weight management, musculoskeletal pain, and behavioral health, giving it one of the most comprehensive offerings in the industry and positioning it to capitalize on employer and payer trends toward vendor consolidation.

As digital health platforms continue to gain traction and the GLP-1 market expands, O'Neill believes DarioHealth remains positioned for potential significant share price appreciation as the market recognizes its comparable business metrics relative to recently validated competitors.
