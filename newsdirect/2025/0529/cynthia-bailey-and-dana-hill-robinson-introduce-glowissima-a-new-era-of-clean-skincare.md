# Cynthia Bailey and Dana Hill-Robinson Introduce Glowissima, A New Era of Clean Skincare

Born from a shared belief that beauty evolves, Glowissima today announced its launch as the newest clean skincare brand to watch. Created by model, entrepreneur, and Real Housewives of Atlanta star Cynthia Bailey and beauty veteran and Cocotique founder Dana Hill-Robinson, Glowissima captures the first light of New Zealand’s sunrise in every formula, harnessing clean ingredients from the country’s pristine natural sources to empower individuals to glow naturally, confidently, and at every age.

Crafted with sustainability and efficacy in mind, Glowissima’s formulas are powered by indigenous super-ingredients sourced from New Zealand—including Manuka Honey to hydrate and brighten, and Kiwi Seed Oil to boost collagen, protect against environmental stressors, and naturally brighten the skin for a more radiant complexion.

"After nearly three decades in the industry, I’ve seen how transformative beauty can be when it's inclusive and intentional,” said Dana Hill-Robinson, Co-Founder of Glowissima. “With Glowissima, Cynthia and I wanted to create a brand that speaks to women who’ve evolved and who want skincare that honors their journey, not just their appearance."

“After years in front of the camera, beauty has always been part of my story,” said Cynthia Bailey, Co-Founder of Glowissima. “Glowissima was born from a shared vision Dana and I had: to create a brand that uplifts people, simplifies skincare, and delivers real results using the best that nature has to offer.”

Glowissima’s debut collection, crafted for all skin types and tones, includes two signature products:

* Miracle Elixir Face Oil ($64) – A luxurious blend of 10 natural and organic oils like sea buckthorn, rosehip, and marula, this antioxidant-rich elixir deeply hydrates, soothes, and improves skin clarity while reducing the appearance of dark spots.
* Ultimate Radiance Face Cream ($46) – A multitasking moisturizer that targets hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and skin texture, leaving skin with a visibly brighter, lit-from-within glow.

Infused with a philosophy of affirmation and empowerment, Glowissima goes beyond skincare to foster a movement celebrating beauty without age limits or societal pressures. Glowissima is now available to shop at www.glowissima.com and will be available to shop via Amazon soon.
