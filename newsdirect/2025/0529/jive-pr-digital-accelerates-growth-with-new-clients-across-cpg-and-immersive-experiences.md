# Jive PR + Digital Accelerates Growth with New Clients Across CPG and Immersive Experiences

Jive PR + Digital, an award-winning public relations and digital marketing agency with a 15-year track record of growing iconic brands, proudly announces new client accounts and multiple culture-driving campaigns. Fueling this growth is Jive’s unique approach to combining storytelling with Performance PR, cultural relevancy and digital authority.

The Jive Effect

Traditional PR and storytelling remain essential, but the landscape is evolving fast. Jive PR + Digital leads this evolution with Performance PR—blending proven storytelling with data-driven insights, SEO, and AI-powered search to deliver measurable visibility, engagement, and conversions. Additionally, when it comes to social media and influencer marketing, most brands struggle to connect because their content lacks cultural relevance. Jive uses advanced tools and algorithms to spot emerging trends and conversations early, ensuring every campaign is timely, authentic, and resonant. This “Jive Effect” approach drives real business results: building obsessed communities, increasing sales, and strengthening both brand equity and digital authority.

New Clients

Recent signings include Benestar Brands’ Mac’s Pork Rinds (Influencer Marketing), a high-growth CPG brand with a loyal fan base and strong retail footprint. Other new clients include Splitsville (Performance PR and Influencers), a leading entertainment brand; Herbal Magic (Organic Social Media and UGC), a legacy wellness company focused on health and nutrition; and a jewelry ecommerce brand; Caitlyn Minimalist (Organic Social Media, UGC, and Influencers). The new partnerships align with Jive’s focus on integrated campaigns that increase revenue, drive AI Search, SEO, and shape culture.

“Our latest client additions reflect what we’re seeing across the industry: demand for storytelling that fuels discovery and drives search,” said Lindsay Nahmiache, co-founder and CEO of Jive PR + Digital. “Whether it’s a heritage brand looking to reconnect with audiences or an experiential brand tapping into current cultural moments. We’re excited to amplify their stories and drive impactful conversations.”

Key Achievements

* Jive PR + Digital secured over 200 media placements for the Edelman Fossil Park & Museum of Rowan University’s grand opening, including The New York Times, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, NBC, and a front-page feature in USA Today. The museum was also mentioned on Late Night with Seth Meyers and the Joe Rogan podcast.
* Activate’s Austin launch with Jive PR + Digital achieved a 640% ROI on their influencer campaign. Through strategic partnership selection and whitelisting, Jive amplified performance, aligning every move with business goals and delivering clear, measurable results.
* Jive PR + Digital’s campaign for Mac’s Pork Rinds is lifting brand recall across the Southwest and driving measurable sales growth. By encouraging consumers to get creative with pork rinds in recipes—not just as a snack—Jive is fueling in-store purchases, sparking viral moments, and building a passionate community, especially among keto and low-carb enthusiasts.

These results show why marketing teams need to level up with Performance PR, cultural relevance, and digital authority if they want to move the needle. It’s about ensuring that every piece of coverage, campaign, and story works harder—not just to generate awareness but to drive measurable results across the full funnel.
