# Troy University Selects TheLinkU to Maximize NIL Opportunities for Trojan Student-Athletes

TheLinkU, the premier NIL platform focused on simplifying and enhancing opportunities for college athletes and institutions, has announced a new partnership with Trojans Together Collective and Troy University. The partnership will help maximize Troy’s NIL opportunities for student-athletes across all 16 sports programs. Troy Athletics will have complete access to TheLinkU’s full suite of services, including national brand partnerships that provide tremendous cost savings, general manager and revenue sharing modeling software, NIL marketplace, personalized merchandise shop, tools to help student-athletes build and grow their personal brands, and financial seminars and wealth advisors, among other resources.

Troy Athletics is grateful to co-founders Chuck Carson and Jason Jones for establishing the Trojans Together Collective to support Troy University student-athletes. For the past two and a half years, Trojans Together has truly embodied their mission to Build Communities, Empower Players and Win Together. This partnership will allow for all aspects of the Trojans Together collective and its operations to be run by TheLinkU.

“I’m very excited about this milestone in NIL at Troy University,” said Chuck Carson, co-founder and president of Trojans Together Collective. “It’s been an honor to be involved with the founding and operating of Trojans Together Collective and I know this new partnership is the right next step. I look forward to supporting the Collective and our new partnership with TheLinkU as we seek to lead the way in NIL in the Sun Belt Conference and beyond.”

“It makes us feel great knowing that we are transitioning our operations to experienced and capable leaders with LinkU,” said Jason Jones, co-founder and vice president of Trojans Together Collective.

TheLinkU also fosters sustainable revenue generation for universities through more than 30 strategic business partnerships, including the recently announced Victory Campus initiative from Victory Snacks. With these partnerships, TheLinkU significantly decreases the need for donor contributions and creates long-term financial opportunities, enabling athletic departments to achieve NIL success while maintaining financial stability.

“As a former student-athlete, it’s my goal, and the goal of TheLinkU, to equip student-athletes and athletic departments with the tools they need to maximize success,” said Austin Elrod, founder and president of TheLinkU. “I have been in the shoes of these student-athletes, and I have worked shoulder-to-shoulder with numerous athletic directors across the country to help build championship-level NIL programs. That is why we can offer solutions that no one else can within the NIL space."

“We are proud to partner with TheLinkU and view them as a key piece in The Trojans Together Collective’s future success in revenue generation and NIL opportunities,” said Brent Jones, director of athletics at Troy University. “With TheLinkU’s offering, we are prepared to support our teams in their pursuit of championships.”

“With TheLinkU’s help, our student-athletes will be able to maximize their personal brands, and we will be able to amplify and diversify the NIL offerings available to them,” said Gerad Parker, head football coach at Troy University. “This helps create an edge for us in recruiting. By creating an environment that’s attractive to high school recruits and possible transfer students, we can compete with anyone, anywhere.”

TheLinkU works with colleges and athletic programs nationwide to simplify the NIL space while protecting the interests of athletes, institutions, and the business community. To learn more, visit www.thelinku.com
