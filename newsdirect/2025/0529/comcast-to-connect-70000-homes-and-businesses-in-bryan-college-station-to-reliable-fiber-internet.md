# Comcast to Connect 70,000 Homes and Businesses in Bryan-College Station to Reliable, Fiber Internet

Comcast will connect 70,000 new homes and businesses in Bryan-College Station to fast, secure and reliable, fiber Internet.

The multiphase project includes building a new technology hub that will act as “the brain” of the network, supporting all Xfinity and Comcast Business services. Comcast will also install more than 1,000 miles of fiber lines – enough to span the distance from the Brazos Valley to Universal Studios in Florida. The tech leader also plans to open an interactive Xfinity retail store, which will be announced later.

"Bryan-College Station is a hotbed for innovative technology, and this investment by Comcast will help our region stay competitive,” College Station Mayor John Nichols said. “Reliable broadband access is essential for our growing community, from the tens of thousands of Aggie students who call College Station home to our creative business community. Investing in strong connectivity ensures everyone has the advanced resources they need to thrive in a digital world."

Expanding reliable high-speed Internet in Bryan will open doors for students, businesses and families. It will enhance opportunities and improve quality of life.”
