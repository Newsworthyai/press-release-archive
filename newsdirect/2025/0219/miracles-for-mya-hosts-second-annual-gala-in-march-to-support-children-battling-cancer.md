About Mya: Started by Mya’s Parents, Miracles for Mya is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded after Mya's courageous battle with stage IV Neuroblastoma. Mya was a typical 4-year-old who loved pink, princesses, and all things Disney. Mya’s (and her family’s) life changed on January 11, 2011, when they heard the words “Mya has cancer.” Mya was diagnosed with stage IV Neuroblastoma and was high-risk from the beginning. As scary as cancer was, nothing was going to change who this kid was.

She was always known for her smile, kindness, generosity, and bravery. Mya fought long and hard over the next 6 years, never once believing that she couldn’t conquer cancer. Throughout her years, Mya left a lasting impression on all whom she encountered. Learn more at miraclesformya.org.
