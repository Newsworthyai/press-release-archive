# Jord BioScience Secures Series B Funding to Revolutionize Microbial Solutions for Agriculture

Jord BioScience, a leading science and analytics company providing customizable microbial solutions for agriculture, announced the closing of its Series B round. This funding round will accelerate Jord BioScience's development and commercialization of innovative microbial technologies to deliver next-generation crop inputs.

Lead investor Silver Blue LLC, a Maryland-based firm focusing on agrifoodtech, was joined by Discovery Capital Funding, a matching equity investment program for University of Minnesota, Minnesota’s Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Direct Investment, and existing investors.

“This funding round marks a significant milestone for Jord BioScience, validating our partnership approach and the true potential of our microbial solutions to transform agriculture,” said Dr. Keri Carstens, president and CEO, Jord BioScience. “With this investment, we're poised to scale our operations to help biologicals and crop inputs companies accelerate product discovery and innovation for farmers worldwide.”

Founded on over 30 years of deep microbial science for agriculture by Jord BioScience’s Chief Science Officer Dr. Linda Kinkel, the company currently is partnering with leading agribusinesses to fast-track biological solutions by leveraging its expansive microbial bank of more than 6,500 microbial isolates. Collected from diverse global soils, these isolates enhance, protect, or promote distinct modes of action in major crops, including corn, soybeans, canola, and wheat as well as some specialty crops.
