# ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA)  well positioned to capitalize on $200 billion AI drone market

If you missed out on last year’s AI-fueled rally that drove valuations of companies like Nvidia to well over trillions of dollars, 2025 promises to be an equally promising year for AI-focused companies.

Analysts believe that AI will continue to be one of the major investment themes for the year thanks to rapid advancements in generative AI, which has prompted a wave of hype around its potential applications.

One such application that appears to be attracting significant investor interest on the backdrop of those advancements is drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

That is because a recent research report revealed that the global AI in drone technology market is expected to grow to be worth around $206.9 billion by 2033, up from $12.5 billion in 2023, representing a CAGR of 32.4%.

One company that appears well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity is ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA), a technology company specializing in AI drone solutions and enterprise SaaS solutions for mission-critical business applications.

The company’s flagship product, the ZenaDrone 1000, is an autonomous drone product incorporating AI, sensors, and purpose-built attachments, along with compact and rugged hardware engineered for industrial use.

Unlike traditional drones, which require manual control, AI algorithms enable the drone to perform complex tasks independently, such as navigating through challenging environments and avoiding obstacles without human intervention. This capability is crucial in sectors like agriculture, where AI-powered drones can monitor crop monitoring and optimize resource use, leading to higher yields and reduced waste.

The potential market here is substantial, as illustrated by the recent entry of tech giants like Intel into the sector. Last year, Intel introduced a new line of AI-powered drones specifically designed for the agriculture sector.

The drones are equipped with advanced AI algorithms that can analyze crop health in real-time, optimize irrigation systems, and predict yields with greater accuracy. The company reported a 15% increase in sales within its drone division, largely driven by the adoption of these AI-enabled drones by large agricultural enterprises, reaffirming the increasing demand.

Apart from the agricultural sector, increasing global conflicts have also accelerated the demand for AI-enabled drones, which bodes well for companies like ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA).

In December last year, the company completed paid trials with both the US Air Force and US Naval Research using its drones for carrying critical cargo and earlier this month signed a lease to open a Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone testing facility in Turkey, which will serve as a product testing site for its ZenaDrone 1000 model drones designed for the US Defense Branches and NATO.

“Having a testing facility in Turkey will accelerate the development of our US Defense and NATO models of the ZenaDrone 1000. Importantly, it will help to advance our AI drone swarm solutions and the Drone Command Center hub at the heart of missions. Turkey is a favorable European location for experimental drone testing and known for its defense industry innovation and we are grateful to be collaborating there,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.

The company will test defense drone applications including ISRT (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting), logistics and transportation, and other applications over wide distances beyond an operator’s line of sight.

Securing defense contracts could be a major catalyst for the ZENA’s stock, going by recent events in the sector. For instance, Palladyne AI shares soared more than 200% since announcing that its artificial intelligence software worked successfully for the first time tracking a moving target.

The company reported the Palladyne Pilot AI platform used on a flight of a third-party small drone "demonstrated the ability to identify and prioritize terrestrial targets of interest and then interface with the drone’s autopilot software to follow the prioritized target autonomously.

Zena has made significant strides towards complying with the strict department of defense requirements to enable its drones to be used in the military. So far the company has signed Blue Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) compliant partner agreements for its supply chain in order to sell its ZenaDrone 1000 AI drone solutions to US Defense branches and to NATO forces.

Previously, ZENA received U.S. FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) approval for visual line-of-sight commercial use, including testing and evaluation for its ZenaDrone 1000 product for use in land surveying, inspection, monitoring, and tracking applications according to FAA specifications.

Ultimately, the demand for AI-enabled drones in both the agriculture and defense sectors is only set to rise and investors looking to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunity should consider adding ZENA to their watchlist. More importantly, US and European government policy shifts favoring strategic suppliers from Chinese companies that previously dominated further reaffirm the company’s future growth prospects.

Furthermore, the company has over 100 enterprise software customers using its branded solutions in government and industrial sectors and is already generating revenue with about $1.8 million in recurring sales.
