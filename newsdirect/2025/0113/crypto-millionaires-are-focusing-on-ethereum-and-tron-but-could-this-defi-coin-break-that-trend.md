The latest changes in the regulatory environment are proving to be a great boost for crypto. However, some tokens will benefit more than others. Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX), thanks to their robust ecosystem and widespread adoption, are among the biggest potential gainers. Crypto millionaires love these tokens, which are at the heart of the expected growth of the DeFi space. However, a new contender on the scene is emerging, Cutoshi (CUTO).

Ethereum Is The Backbone of DeFiEthereum (ETH) is often called the backbone of DeFi, dominating the space by total value locked (TVL). As the platform for smart contracts, it still holds more than 50% of all the TVL on blockchain platforms. Now, as the US is gearing up for more favorable crypto regulation, Ethereum stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries.

The token is currently trading at $3,925, reaching a multi-year high after last month’s rally. Despite this, Ethereum has underperformed in the last year, seeing lower gains than Bitcoin. Chains like Solana have overtaken its volume, and falling fee revenue is putting pressure on its scarcity.

Still, crypto millionaires are accumulating the token, seeing these setbacks as temporary. Experts put Ethereum’s monthly target at $4,280. A 3-month target for the token is near $4,900, which would put it near its all-time high of $4,891.70 in November 2021.

These predictions, just like the current market rally, bet on favorable crypto regulations in the US boosting the DeFi space. The launch of layer-2 solutions also helps fix some of Ethereum’s issues with scalability.

Tron Is A Cost-Efficient AlternativeWhile layer 2 solutions are Ethereum’s answer to its scalability issues, other alternative chains opted for a new approach. For one, Tron is a high-performance chain that supports fast transactions and low fees.

What is more, Tron has an extensive ecosystem, with a lot of users, especially in Asia. It features its own versions of popular DeFi apps like sun.io and JustLend. Moreover, because it is EMV-compatible, it is a good choice for users who want a more accessible alternative to Ethereum.

During the latest rally, Tron saw some significant gains, reaching an ATH in early December of $0.41. Even after dipping to its current level of $0.29, Tron still has a 178% year-to-date price increase.

Its expansive ecosystem and accessible infrastructure are making analysts bullish. Predictions for the next 30 days put Tron at an average of $0.29, the same as its current price. In three months, Tron is set to reach an average level of $0.35.

Cutoshi Is The Next DeFi ContenderCrypto millionaires like Tron and Ethereum, but a new token is getting their attention. The memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) has recently gone viral on X after reaching $1 million in presale investments with the project now having raised over $1.57 million.

The project's success is its ability to blend a meme coin with DeFi functionality. Cutoshi, is building a DeFi ecosystem, complete with a multichain DEX, a learning platform and token farming. The project wants to educate users about the importance of self-custody and decentralization while also offering the tools needed to put these theories into practice.

This token offers the best of both worlds as it has all the virality and fun of a memecoin but at the same time it has the long term growth potential of a utility coin. Cutoshi continues to attract the attention of retail traders that want accessible investments with the potential to grow 10 to 50 fold over the next 2 months.
