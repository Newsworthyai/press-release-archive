The bull market is bringing more traders into the crypto market than ever. One of them is Dogecoin, which has recently gained significant traction. Now, these traders are wondering what are the next big moves for memecoin.

To gain more insights about its potential moves, we asked Elon Musk’s Grok AI, which gave its predictions based on recent trends and analysis, as well as Doge’s historical patterns. Moreover, we asked Grok about another crypto asset, Cutoshi, which has recently been gaining momentum.

Elon Musk's Grok AI Price Prediction For DOGEDogecoin (DOGE) has been making big gains last year, and traders wonder if this trend will continue. Grok AI, a language model developed by Elon Musk’s company, has revealed its prediction.

For one, Grok pointed out that DOGE has experienced significant bullish momentum thanks to the spotlight on Elon Musk. The billionaire CEO is one of Doge’s biggest supporters and will play an important role in the upcoming Trump administration.

Grok also pointed out that predictions range from the conservative $0.30 to $0.80 range to the more optimistic $0.50 and $1.50. At the current price of $0.3823, the optimistic scenario would mean a major gain for Doge.

Still, when prompted to give the most likely scenario, Grok identified the $0.30 and $0.80 range as the most likely for Doge in 2025. This is due to a combination of community support, market trends, and Dogecoin’s unlimited supply.

However, Grok also suggested that Doge could reach a high of $1.00 to $1.20 at some point in 2025. The AI model explained that the high historical volatility for Dogecoin means that these levels are not unreasonable.

These findings, based on numerous sources from the web and Grok’s AI reasoning, suggest that Doge may be set for new all-time highs. However, the high volatility may wipe out the traders that hold for too long.

Grok Sees Major Gains For CutoshiWhile Dogecoin gears for more stable gains, another project is rapidly gaining traction. MemeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) already secured $1.47 million in investments, seeking to combine memecoins with DeFi utility. It combines the Chinese lucky cat symbol while taking inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto. As such, the project wants to create a complete DeFi ecosystem, with its own multichain DEX.

We asked Grok about this project, and it came up with very optimistic predictions for 2025. Cutoshi’s current presale price is $0.031. Grok gave a conservative prediction between $0.50 to $1.00, which assumes that Cutoshi gains traction in the DeFi space. A more optimistic scenario puts Cutoshi beyond $2.00 or even $2.50, assuming that the token secures listings on major exchanges.

When asked about which out of Dogecoin and Cutoshi is a better investment, Grok gave a nuanced perspective. It suggested that Dogecoin, with its established presence, may be better for more conservative investors. However, for those willing to take more risk for greater returns, Cutoshi is the clear winner.
