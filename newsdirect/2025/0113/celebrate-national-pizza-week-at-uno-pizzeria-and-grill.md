# Celebrate National Pizza Week at Uno Pizzeria and Grill

Starting January 13th, the iconic restaurant chain, Uno Pizzeria and Grill, will run a week-long series of fun pizza experiences and fantastic pizza deals to salute the world’s favorite food – pizza!

Dine-in experience – “Be your own pizza chef” with Make Your Own Pizza

For a special price, you can be a pizza chef and build your own pizza. All of the ingredients – your choice of deep dish or thin crust dough, cheese, sauce and your choice of up to 3 toppings will be brought to your table. You then can craft your masterpiece by filling in the sauce and cheese and then topping your pizza with your toppings. Either build it as a classic pizza or show your artistic side by designing your own pizza canvas creation. We will then cook your pizza and you can enjoy it at your table.

In addition to enjoying the fun of building your own pizza, you can upload a picture of your masterpiece to Facebook or Instagram to enter for a chance to win up to $500 in Unos gift cards. You must include the hashtag #UNOpizzachef with your picture to be entered.
