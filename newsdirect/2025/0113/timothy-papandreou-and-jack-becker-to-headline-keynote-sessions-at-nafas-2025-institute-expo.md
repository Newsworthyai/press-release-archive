Two influential thought leaders, Timothy Papandreou and Jack Becker, will take center stage at NAFA’s 2025 Institute & Expo (I&E), scheduled for April 28-30, 2025 in Long Beach, California. Papandreou, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, and Becker, a decorated military fighter pilot, will deliver keynotes that promise to inspire and equip fleet professionals with fresh perspectives on leadership and innovation.

“We are thrilled to welcome both Timothy Papandreou and Jack Becker as keynote speakers for I&E 2025,” said Bill Schankel, CAE, CEO of NAFA. “Timothy’s insights into AI and its impact on fleet operations will provide attendees with a clear view of the future of the industry, while Jack’s expertise in leadership and performance will offer invaluable lessons on how to build high-performing teams and drive success under pressure.
