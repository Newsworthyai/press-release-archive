In her new role, Webb, will be responsible for overseeing CareAbout’s daily operations and optimizing processes across the national umbrella entities, which fall within the MSO. She will also drive strategic initiatives around enhancing patient care, improving operational efficiencies and achieving long-term growth.

Prior to this appointment, Webb served as chief operating officer of Medical Specialists of the Palm Beaches (MSPB), a leading primary care-focused, multi-specialty physician group practice in South Florida. In this capacity, she headed day-to-day operations and was instrumental in optimizing MSPB’s performance and growth.

Robbins, with two decades of healthcare human resources expertise, will lead and manage CareAbout’s centralized human resources function, including benefits, recruitment, employee engagement and other key tasks critical to its talent and workforce.

Before joining CareAbout, Robbins spent five years serving as chief people officer at WellBe Senior Medical, a geriatric in-home healthcare provider, where he played a pivotal role in supporting Company’s growth by expanding the team from nine employees to 1,000+. His extensive experience includes establishing and enhancing HR frameworks for a range of entities, including start-ups, for-profit and non-profit companies and community-based healthcare organizations.

“Danielle and Scott both have extensive, proven track records in their respective niches within the healthcare services arena. They each have demonstrated exemplary leadership and operational expertise, making them excellent candidates for these positions,” said Dr. Nedal Shami, chief executive officer at CareAbout Health.

“As we grow CareAbout’s managed shared services (MSO) model, we need the right team in place to lead us to our goals of ensuring the delivery of the highest quality care while leveraging the benefits of unified, shared services across our medical group practices. Daneille and Scott round out that team, and we look to the contributions they will make in their new roles,” Dr. Shami stated.
