# Milemarker Appoints Kailash Duraiswami as Chief Technology Officer

Milemarker, a leading technology platform revolutionizing how advisory firms, IBDs, and RIAs operate and scale, announced today the appointment of Kailash Duraiswami as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Duraiswami brings a wealth of fintech expertise and leadership to his new role, where he will oversee the company’s technology strategy, development, and innovation.

“Kailash possesses a very unique and rare ability to distill very complex problems into precise deliveries that delight our customers and help us build at a more scalable pattern,” said Jud Mackrill, Co-Founder of Milemarker. “The mission to help advisors own their data and control their destiny is massive, but Kailash has already proven himself invaluable in helping us build our team and optimize for success. I’m thrilled to bring him in as a partner to help us deliver exponential value and accomplish this mission in an even stronger way.”

Previously, Duraiswami founded Pantenix, an artificial intelligence platform that automated manual data-entry processes for alternative investments. In 2021, just 18 months after its launch, Pantenix was acquired by Orion Advisor Solutions, where Duraiswami continued as a key architect on Orion’s data streaming platform. The platform was recognized with the 2023 WealthManagement.com Industry Award for “Disruptor.”

“Kailash’s experience as a founder, combined with his success scaling innovative technologies, makes him the perfect fit to lead Milemarker’s technology team,” said Kyle Van Pelt, CEO of Milemarker.

“His vision and expertise will help us deliver transformative solutions for advisory firms and empower them to take full control of their data and operations.”

Duraiswami graduated from Emory University with a degree in financial economics and has spent over a decade working as a software engineer, entrepreneur, and technology leader in the financial services industry.
