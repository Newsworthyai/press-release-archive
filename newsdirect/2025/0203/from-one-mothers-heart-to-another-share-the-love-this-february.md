# From One Mother’s Heart to Another: Share the Love This February

This February, in the spirit of love, Mother’s Milk Bank California, Human Milk Connection and the Sacramento Breastfeeding Coalition invite mothers to make a heart-warming difference in the lives of vulnerable babies by joining the “Share the Love” virtual milk drive. For many babies born prematurely or with critical medical conditions, breast milk isn’t just food—it’s medicine. While the need for donor breast milk continues to grow, ensuring a steady supply is essential to support fragile infants who rely on it.

Janel Silva, co-founder of Human Milk Connection, is dedicated to ensuring more babies have access to donor breast milk. “We believe every baby deserves the opportunity to receive human milk, and mothers with extra breast milk have the power to make that possible,” she said.

The “Share the Love” campaign is inspired by the idea that breastfeeding is a deeply personal act of love. “Donating breast milk takes that love even further by sharing it with babies who need it most,” Silva added.

Who:

Human Milk Connection, in collaboration with Mothers’ Milk Bank California and the Sacramento Breastfeeding Coalition, invites breastfeeding mothers to make a life-changing impact by donating their breast milk through the virtual milk drive this February.

When:

All throughout February 2025.

Why:

What makes this milk drive truly unique is its convenience. Mothers can participate without leaving their homes. Through the virtual milk drive, donors will receive pre-paid shipping kits and a courier will collect the milk at a time that works best for them. With just a little extra effort, mothers can give a medically fragile baby the greatest gift—a chance at life.
