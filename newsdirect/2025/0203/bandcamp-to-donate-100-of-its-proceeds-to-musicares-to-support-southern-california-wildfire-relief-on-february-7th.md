Bandcamp, the artist-first platform supporting independent music, is coming together with its music community to aid musicians affected by the Southern California wildfires. On February 7th, from midnight to midnight PST, 100% of Bandcamp’s proceeds will be donated to MusiCares. Offering preventive, emergency, and recovery programs, MusiCares is a safety net supporting the health and welfare of the music community.

Whether offering financial aid for mental health counseling, medical screenings, or housing assistance during times of hardship, MusiCares leads with compassion, inclusivity, and empowerment. Bandcamp is proud to partner with A2IM, Harman, Lagunitas, Roland, Shure, Victrola, and WIN for this initiative. Their generous contributions amplify the fundraiser’s reach and maximize impact. Together, these organizations stand united with Bandcamp in supporting the creative community during this challenging time.

“Los Angeles is the hub of the music industry, and the wildfires have impacted every part of it, from musicians to producers to recording studios. Bandcamp is proud to do our part to directly support musicians in LA, rallying the power of our community and music to help them rebuild,” said Dan Melnick, General Manager of Bandcamp.

“This initiative is a testament to the power of collaboration in supporting the music community when it’s needed most,” said Bryan Biniak, President of Songtradr. “At Songtradr, we believe in the vital role that platforms like Bandcamp play in ensuring artists can continue to create and thrive, especially in challenging times. We are incredibly grateful to our partners—MusiCares, A2IM, WIN, and the many organizations coming together—to maximize our collective impact. This moment exemplifies what’s possible when the industry unites to support the artists who shape our culture and bring music to the world.”

“We are deeply appreciative of the significant support from the Bandcamp community and their partners. This generosity will help us continue providing vital resources and assistance to music people in need, and we are truly grateful for the community’s commitment to making a difference,” said Laura Segura, Executive Director at MusiCares.

“At A2IM, we deeply believe in the transformative power of independent music to inspire, unite, and drive meaningful change—especially during challenging times,” said Dr. Richard James Burgess, President and CEO of A2IM. “This initiative exemplifies the strength and resilience of our community—artists, labels, and fans coming together with a shared mission to make a tangible impact. Partnering with Bandcamp and sister organizations like the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN) enables us to extend critical support and relief to those affected by the Southern California wildfires.”

Bandcamp has long championed the healing power of music, making it simple for fans to support artists so they can continue creating. This mission comes to life through initiatives like Bandcamp Fridays, where the platform shares its revenue directly with artists, generating over $131 million for independent musicians and labels to date. Bandcamp fosters a profound connection between artists and their supporters while empowering the creative community.
