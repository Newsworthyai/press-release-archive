# PJ Fitzpatrick Expands Home Improvement Services with Acquisition of Bathroom Buddy Remodeling

In an industry-defining move, PJ Fitzpatrick, recognized as one of the nation’s premier home-improvement companies, has expanded its footprint by acquiring Bathroom Buddy Remodeling—a Long Island stalwart known for premium bathroom renovations and trusted service. The partnership is set to transform the regional market and elevate service standards across Long Island.

PJ Fitzpatrick’s acquisition unites two brands sharing an unwavering commitment to quality, ethics, and community impact. Historically a one-dimensional leader in bath construction, Bathroom Buddy’s loyal Long Island clientele will now benefit from PJ Fitzpatrick’s comprehensive portfolio—including roofing, windows, doors, siding, trim, and gutter installation—backed by industry-leading warranties and unmatched craftsmanship.

“Joining forces with PJ Fitzpatrick wasn’t just a strategic decision; it was a natural progression toward greater service excellence. Our long-held reputation in Long Island will now be complemented by a broader array of home improvement solutions that our customers can rely on,” said John Huxtable, President of Operations and Co-Founder of Bathroom Buddy Remodeling.

James Freeman, CEO of PJ Fitzpatrick, noted:

“When PJ Fitzpatrick enters a new market, customers win. Our acquisition reinforces our commitment to exceptional service and top-quality workmanship, deepening the trusted relationship with homeowners on Long Island.”

A Shared Origin and Vision

Years ago, industry events brought together the visionary leadership of PJ Fitzpatrick and Bathroom Buddy Remodeling. Through casual conversations, CEO James Freeman discovered that the team behind Bathroom Buddy—led by John Huxtable & Alex Keyles—embodied the same core values of dedication, trust, and customer-first service that have driven PJ Fitzpatrick for over 45 years. This shared origin laid the groundwork for a natural alliance that broadens their service offering.

Strategic Expansion with Purpose

With PJ Fitzpatrick’s robust resources, the combined entity is poised to deliver comprehensive home improvement solutions with unmatched quality. Paul Sweeney, COO of PJ Fitzpatrick, explained,

“We’re taking the branding prowess of Bathroom Buddy in Long Island and Queens and complementing it with our sales, marketing strategies, and resources.”

The newly formed partnership is already integrating operations, with expanded service bookings available to Long Island homeowners.
