# Claim Launches in 10 U.S. Cities

Viral social shopping platform Claim today announces its expansion into 10 cities around the country, after a 15-month incubation and growth period beginning at Harvard University and eventually serving students across more than 90 campuses in the U.S. The Claim app, which has helped college students get paid to eat and shop while enabling brands to accelerate and reduce the cost of customer acquisition, will now be available to all consumers with the app in these cities.

Sam Obletz, CEO and co-founder of Claim, says: “With the increasing expense of digital advertising and saturation of traditional channels, the cost of customer acquisition has gone through the roof. Claim offers an alternative. Since our initial launch, we have been able to help industry-leading brands drive new customer traffic to their locations and build high lifetime value relationships—all while saving students millions of dollars. We’ve been called the most exciting emerging marketing channel out there, which we appreciate because we’re doing something totally new. We directly reapply our partners’ customer acquisition and media budgets to the wallets of high-value customers looking to eat out and shop. And now, we’re bringing this formula, which has proven highly successful in college and university settings, to Gen Z and young professionals at large.”

Claim is now “Dropping” in the following cities:

* Atlanta
* Austin
* Boston
* Chicago
* Dallas-Fort Worth
* Houston
* Los Angeles
* New York
* Philadelphia
* Washington, D.C.

Claim’s Head of Marketing, Luke deWilde, notes: “Up until now, Claim users needed to have an email ending in .edu to join. Starting today, anyone in these eligible cities can join Claim and start getting paid to eat and shop—no college email required. If you’re already a Claim user in one of our core cities, you’ll automatically remain enrolled. Drops will be curated based on these cities, and we’ll be following up with several new features that make Claim the perfect way for both residents and visitors to make the most of these towns.”

Adds Sam Obletz: “We built Claim to help people discover great brands in a new, better way while enabling brands to find important new customers. Over the past year, we’ve seen the magic that happens when Claimers get out into the real world and visit great businesses like Blank Street Coffee, Gong cha, Chip City, and many others. Being rewarded for trying something new is powerful and habit-forming. And it’s become a reliable recipe for helping to introduce brands to their best customers, and for bringing those customers back repeatedly.”

By expanding beyond campuses and into cities, Claim is available to many more people while helping brands connect with new customers, all at scale. For the first time, anyone in these cities, both residents and visitors, can join Claim. When a Claimer invites a friend, both will receive $10 Claims to brands of their choice. Claim is live in the city.
