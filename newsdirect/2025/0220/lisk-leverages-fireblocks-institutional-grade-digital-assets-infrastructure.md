# Lisk Leverages Fireblocks’ Institutional-Grade Digital Assets Infrastructure

Lisk, a Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain designed to empower Web3 builders in high-growth markets, today announces its integration with Fireblocks, an enterprise platform to manage digital asset operations and build innovative businesses on blockchain, to provide institutions with robust, scalable infrastructure for managing digital assets securely on the Lisk Network.

Through this integration, Fireblocks will enable institutions to securely store and manage LSK tokens alongside other digital assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), providing a comprehensive solution for asset custody, tokenization, and decentralized finance activities. Fireblocks' industry-leading Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology ensures the highest level of security and its platform offers a compliant environment for digital asset management in accordance with regulatory requirements.

By working with Fireblocks, Lisk aims to attract increased institutional engagement with its rapidly growing ecosystem, which is focused on high-growth markets and has seen significant momentum as more enterprises seek reliable blockchain solutions for their Web3 products and services. With Fireblocks’ support, institutions can engage in DeFi activities, from earning yield to trading, and interact seamlessly across multiple blockchains with Lisk at the forefront.

With approximately $103 billion in total market capitalization between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, institutional interest in crypto is rising, with organizations increasingly diving deeper into Web3. For instance, DeFi activity on the Fireblocks platform surged to $60 billion in total transactions last year. With more global regulatory clarity on the horizon, another wave of institutional activity is expected. This makes it the perfect time for Lisk to integrate with Fireblocks, providing institutions with the secure and reliable infrastructure necessary to engage in the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance and Web3.

“Institutions are more interested in crypto than ever, and they are looking for a safe and trusted platform to dive into the world of digital assets,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “That’s why we chose to utilize Fireblocks—because we believe they will help onboard more institutions into the Lisk ecosystem and provide the institutional-grade security and compliance that organizations need to thrive.”

Key Benefits of the Fireblocks and Lisk Integration:

* Institutional Web3 Wallet Solutions: Fireblocks provides a robust infrastructure for institutions to manage digital assets on the Lisk Network, ensuring a streamlined, secure, and compliant experience.
* Digital Asset Custody: Institutions can securely store LSK and other assets without needing individual private key management, mitigating risk and enhancing security.

* Improved Security & Compliance: Fireblocks offers best-in-class security features, including leveraging Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to safeguard institutional assets, as well as compliance integrations to meet evolving regulatory compliance requirements.
