Unit Network, a unique, decentralized financial ecosystem enabling trade of real-world and digital assets through tokenization, today announced the successful closing of $18 million in capital investment. This round was led by industry leaders such as the Blockchain Founders Fund and Outlier Ventures, alongside notable entrepreneurs including Cristina Venture (White Star Capital), Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar (Rootstock), Joshua Seims (Metastable Capital), Richard Wang (Draper Dragon Fund), Thomas Hessler (Zanox), Yuval Rooz (DigitalAsset.com). Other investors also include world-renowned poker players Alec Torelli and Huck Seed, and musician Oliver Tree. Already serving a global community of 50,000 active users, Unit Network has been built on its own blockchain to eliminate barriers in traditional finance, enabling businesses, creators, and communities to seamlessly launch and manage tokenized assets.

This funding will enable Unit Network to scale its blockchain infrastructure, integrate with additional blockchain ecosystems, and expand tokenization efforts in key industries such as real estate, gaming, and digital commerce.

“With tens of millions of businesses, creators, and communities looking to participate in the digital economy, the need for accessible and equitable financial tools has never been greater,” said Michael Healy, co-founder & CEO of Unit Network. “As our ecosystem continues to grow, we are seeing firsthand how a strong, engaged community fosters creativity, strengthens economic collaboration, and opens new pathways for economic participation. This investment moves us closer to a world where financial access is open, ownership is shared, and economic opportunities are available to us all.”

Unit Network is built on three core pillars: (1) financial inclusion through a cooperative economic model, (2) a seamless crowdfunding platform for easy capital raising, and (3) a decentralized ownership exchange that empowers businesses and communities. Unit also provides a crowdfunding platform that allows anyone to raise capital with ease while building on new ventures. Lastly, Unit enables businesses of all sizes to turn their customers, employees, and supporters into co-owners through a decentralized ownership exchange.

“By giving communities direct avenues to support and invest in the ventures they believe in, we’re establishing a new blueprint for economic growth,” added Kat Miroshnikova, co-founder of Unit Network. “When individuals evolve from mere consumers into true stakeholders, we open the door to an economy where shared success is not just an aspiration but a tangible outcome.”

“Technology should empower people, not limit them. Our investors understand and are excited that Unit Network is focused on removing barriers to finance,” said Healy. “By making tokenization as simple and accessible as possible, Unit is unlocking new opportunities for users to take control of their economies and drive meaningful change in the financial industry.”
