# 60 Years, One Big Cheers: TGI Fridays Celebrates Its Anniversary Around the World

TGI Fridays, the iconic American restaurant-bar chain that pioneered the singles bar concept and inspired Hollywood movies and industry copycats, is celebrating its 60th anniversary by reigniting the bold, celebratory spirit that made it a cultural phenomenon.

Founded in 1965 as a place where everyone can gather, connect and celebrate, TGI Fridays is marking six decades with an around-the-world “cheers.”

On March 15, Fridays locations across the UK, Australia, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas will celebrate the milestone successively in their time zone, in their unique way, creating a wave of celebrations lasting more than 24 hours. As the sun rises in one part of the world and sets in another, customers and team members, no matter their language, culture or city, will honor 60 years of unforgettable moments, indulgent food and legendary cocktails.

The celebration doesn’t stop there. Fridays will keep the party going all month with exclusive promotions that embrace its iconic past and invite guests to join in the fun.

60th Anniversary Specials: Playfulness, Indulgence and That Fridays Feeling

Two for $19.65 – Honoring the year TGI Fridays was founded, guests can enjoy two meals for an unbeatable price of $19.65. The curated menu includes classics like the Half Rack of Ribs (a staple from its original menu), Cheeseburgers, Chicken Caesar Salad, Boneless Wings & Fries, and Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta.

"Spring of Nineteen Six-Tea Five" – Fridays reintroduces its famous Long Island Iced Tea with a retro twist. Served in a limited-edition collector’s cup featuring Fridays’ iconic branding and flair, this cocktail is a tribute to the brand’s rule-breaking mixology.

#ShareYourFlair Challenge – Fridays invites guests to share their “flair” by posting social media pictures that express their unique personality, energy and fun, with the hashtag #ShareYourFlair.

Year-Long Celebration – The 60th-anniversary fun won’t stop in March. Fridays will keep the party going with activities and promotions throughout the year.

Charting a New Course While Celebrating a Bold Legacy

In 1965, Fridays didn’t just open a restaurant — it created a movement. As the world’s first singles bar, it redefined social dining, creating a place where flair, freedom and celebration were welcomed and encouraged. Its bold approach to food, drinks and service set the stage for the casual dining category and left an indelible mark on restaurants worldwide.

"Fridays is doubling down on what made us great in the first place: innovative food and drinks and team members that make it all come to life. As we enter our 60th year, we're refreshing the guest experience to reflect our brand’s timeless promise of indulgence, connection and celebration," says returning brand CEO Ray Blanchette.

"Looking ahead, we’ll continue our disruptive approach to the casual dining space, reimagining what it means to gather and celebrate, while staying true to the bold, inclusive spirit that’s been in our DNA since day one."

After opening its first international restaurant in Birmingham, England, Fridays has grown to nearly 400 locations across 41 countries, from the Americas to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. While each location reflects local tastes, the brand’s famous Americana DNA remains the same — delicious American classics, iconic cocktails and an unmistakably lively atmosphere.

As it enters its next chapter, Fridays remains where fun comes first, every visit is a celebration and everyone belongs.
