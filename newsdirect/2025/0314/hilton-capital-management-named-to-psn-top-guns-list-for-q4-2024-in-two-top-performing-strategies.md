# Hilton Capital Management Named to PSN Top Guns List for Q4 2024 in Two Top-Performing Strategies

Hilton Capital Management (“Hilton Capital”) announced today it has been named to the celebrated PSN Top Guns List for Q4 2024, earning recognition for outstanding performance in two investment strategies: Small & Mid Cap Opportunities (SMCO) and Dividend & Yield (DIVYS).

“The final quarter of 2024 was defined by both volatility and resilience, success in these markets required relentless effort, rigorous research, and disciplined execution,” says PSN Product Manager Nick Williams. “PSN Top Guns recognizes the top managers and teams whose expertise continues to drive the growth of SMAs amid today’s complex and rapidly evolving market conditions.”

Details on Hilton’s PSN Top Guns winning strategies follow:

SMCO Strategy Recognized Across Multiple Categories

Hilton Capital’s Small & Mid Cap Opportunities strategy earned multiple awards for Q4 2024, including the prestigious 6-Star designation in the Small-Mid Cap Universe, along with 1-Star and 2-Star honors in the Mid Value and Small-Mid Value Universes, highlighting its consistent outperformance across multiple periods.

DIVYS Strategy Earns Top Recognition

The Hilton Capital Dividend & Yield strategy was awarded with Manager of the Decade in the Global Equity Universe, recognizing its sustained excellence and long-term outperformance.

“This recognition underscores Hilton Capital’s commitment to disciplined investment management and long-term performance,” said Craig O’Neill, CEO of Hilton Capital Management.

“We believe that earning PSN Top Guns honors across multiple categories reflects the strength of our strategies and our team’s dedication to delivering consistent results for clients,” he added.

Through a combination of PSN’s proprietary performance screens, the PSN Top Guns awards products in six proprietary categories in over 75 universes based on continued performance over time. See below for award info and methodology.

* Firms earn a 1-Star ranking for achieving a top-ten quarterly return in their respective strategy.
* Firms earn a 2-Star ranking for achieving a top-ten return over the one-year period in their strategy.
* Firms earn a 6-Star ranking if they had an r-squared of 0.80 or greater relative to the style benchmark for the recent five-year period. Moreover, the strategy’s returns exceeded the style benchmark for the three latest three-year rolling periods. Products are then selected which have a standard deviation for the five-year period equal to or less than the median standard deviation for the peer group. The top ten information ratios for the latest five-year period then become the 6 Star Top Guns.
* Manager of the Decade is awarded to the strategies that have an r-squared of 0.80 or greater relative to the style benchmark for the latest 10-year period. Moreover, the strategy’s returns were greater than the style benchmark for the latest 10-year period, and its standard deviation was less than the style benchmark for the latest 10-year period. At this point, the top ten performers for the latest 10-year period become the PSN Top Guns Manager of the Decade.
