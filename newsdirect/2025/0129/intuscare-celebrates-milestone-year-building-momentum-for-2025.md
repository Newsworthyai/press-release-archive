# IntusCare Celebrates Milestone Year Building Momentum for 2025

IntusCare, a technology leader in the PACE market, celebrated a transformative year in its offerings for PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), underscoring its commitment to supporting value-based care (VBC) models that serve complex senior populations. The company looks to build on the significant momentum in 2025.

IntusCare starts the year with additional funding, having recently announced the company raised $11.5 million in a strategic follow-on financing round, bringing total funding to over $27 million. This infusion of capital will fuel the launch of CareHub, a comprehensive care management platform, and support the expansion of IntusCare’s existing suite of Revenue Integrity, Population Health, and Utilization Management solutions. Additionally, the company plans to accelerate its artificial intelligence research, aiming to enhance user experiences for healthcare providers and staff.

Notably in 2024, the company announced the launch of two new products and one new service, all specifically designed for PACE.

* CareHub: The first PACE-specific EMR and practice management system for workflows to manage the VBC model, revolutionizing how interdisciplinary care teams, quality, and compliance managers care for older adults with complex healthcare needs.
* Intus Revenue Integrity System (IRIS): The first real-time, data-driven risk adjustment system designed specifically for PACE and VBC organizations. IRIS is designed to support PACE and VBC clinical, financial, compliance, and leadership teams to optimize workflows for consistent risk adjustment results.
* Delegated Utilization Management (UM) Service for PACE: The availability of fractionally-staffed Integrated Care Services (ICS) clinicians and nurses who optimize utilization management for organizations.

“This year has been exciting in terms of building a foundation and the momentum to better serve our customers through technology and the expertise we bring to the industry,” said Robbie Felton, CEO and co-founder of IntusCare. “Initially when we started this company during college, we began as a data provider for PACE programs for better care decisions empowered by population health analytics. Now, we’ve grown in scope with delegated services, risk adjustment, and an EMR and practice management system, providing more value to our clients who are empowered to provide even better care for their complex, senior patients.”

Much of IntusCare’s growth in scope took place within the last year, propelled by deep partnerships with their customers who shared their needs with the company. The vision for CareHub emerged when customers shared pain points such as reducing staff documentation and administrative burden, integrating disparate data systems, and enabling actionable workflows for interdisciplinary care teams.

“Ultimately, we want to be the place where all value-based care organizations that manage risk for complex care come to do their work. CareHub is a key foundation of the ultimate operating system that we're looking to build for the space and community,” said Evan Jackson, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer for IntusCare.

Strategic Partnerships Over the last year, IntusCare grew its strategic partnerships, including the addition of new PACE programs as clients along with alliances with other technology companies to improve offerings to customers.

IntusCare now serves 70+ PACE organizations across the country, adding 33 new partners in 2024, an increase of ~90% over 2023. This growth is driven by our commitment to both grow alongside our existing partners and expand throughout PACE with the aligned goal of empowering high quality participant care.

In addition, IntusCare is breaking down industry silos by prioritizing data access and interoperability through strategic partnerships with leading technology companies. This approach ensures the delivery of impactful, integrated solutions that better serve its customers.

An example of how IntusCare is prioritizing interoperability with PACE organizations is through its collaboration with MedVision for seamless data integration, improved care coordination, regulatory and compliance support, and operational and financial efficiencies. Another partnership with Grane Rx will allow their pharmacy solutions to integrate with CareHub supporting medication safety, streamlined workflows, and advanced ePrescribing within the platform for PACE.

Thought Leadership Education Providing software solutions is not enough within the complex healthcare environment, including some of the intricacies of PACE. IntusCare used its expertise and connections to support thought leadership educational opportunities to benefit the PACE ecosystem.

Chief Population Health Officer Laura Ferrara, an experienced PACE leader, presented at several PACE organization conferences and meetings throughout the year, including a PACE Basics workshop at the National PACE Association’s annual conference in October.

In November, IntusCare hosted a virtual conversation on “PACE and the Future of Healthcare Data Interoperability” with leading guests within healthcare and the PACE community. IntusCare CEO Robbie Felton moderated the discussion with Shawn Bloom, CEO and president of the National PACE Association (NPA); Dr. David Feinberg, Chairman of Oracle Health; and Stephanie Rock, Vice President of Product & Client Delivery at IntusCare.

Team Growth In order to expand its software and services options, IntusCare strategically grew its team, including the addition of key leadership positions.

1. Bharath Kakarla joined as the Senior Vice President of Engineering to lead the technology team, collaborating closely with product and design counterparts to ensure that IntusCare's products and services align seamlessly with customer needs.
2. Stephanie Rock joined as Senior Vice President of Product and Client Delivery, leading the product and design teams to ensure the company meets the needs of IntusCare’s current and future partners.
