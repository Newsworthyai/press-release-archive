# SchoolHouse Connection and University of Michigan's Poverty Solutions Launch Comprehensive Data Profiles on Child and Youth Homelessness

SchoolHouse Connection, in partnership with the University of Michigan's Poverty Solutions initiative, today announced the launch of new, updated interactive data profiles examining child and youth homelessness across the United States. These profiles organize and analyze federal data over a four-year period.

"Child and youth homelessness is largely invisible in our communities and in our schools," said Barbara Duffield, Executive Director of SchoolHouse Connection. "These data profiles help shine a light on these students, the harmful impact of homelessness on their school attendance and achievement, and where progress can be made."

The interactive dashboard allows users to explore homelessness trends across multiple geographic areas - from national and state levels to local communities, U.S. Congressional districts, and state legislative districts. New features help school districts assess whether they may be under-identifying students experiencing homelessness and highlight districts that are categorized as "severely underfunded" - those that have identified students experiencing homelessness but do not receive McKinney-Vento subgrants to serve them. Users can also compare educational outcomes between homeless students and their housed peers through critical indicators such as chronic absenteeism and graduation rates.
