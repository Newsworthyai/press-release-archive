Amid the market-wide turbulence, Cutoshi (CUTO) is showing surprising resilience, prompting veteran traders to rotate funds into the viral presale. With most meme coins range bound and struggling to sustain momentum, Cutoshi presents a compelling opportunity that could see it scale the crypto ranks and outpace other meme majors such as Shiba Inu (SHIB). Read on to discover what makes this newcomer stand out and why it could become this year’s most unexpected success story.

Shiba Inu Consolidates Below Critical Support Shiba Inu faced significant disruption over the last week as the SHIB price breached below the $0.000020 mark after a barrage of sell-offs. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu trades for $0.0000188, following a 5% rebound from lower support levels. As Shiba Inu is stabilizing, market participants are taking a step back, adopting a more cautious stance toward meme coins which are notoriously susceptible to volatility. This is also reflected by the 36% drop in the Shiba Inu volume, with about $340 million worth of SHIB traded across exchanges in the last 24 hours.

Despite the slump, large investors are still overwhelmingly bullish on SHIB’s long-term prospects. According to Lookonchain data, yesterday, a large whale accumulated over 257 billion SHIB tokens, worth approximately $4.6 million.

While Shiba Inu might flip the trend in the coming months and potentially conquer new heights, it’s safe to say that the point of diminishing returns has been reached. With its $11 billion market cap, it’s simply unrealistic to expect a repeat of Shiba Inu’s legendary millionaire maker run of 2021. Cutoshi, on the other hand, bears all of the hallmarks of a gem in the making, as it boasts a magnitudes lower valuation, coupled with real-world utility to ensure unparalleled longevity in the hype-driven meme coin market.

Cutoshi, The Luckiest Cat On The BlockchainCutoshi brings a breath of fresh air with its unique approach that merges meme culture with a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem, bringing forward the first-ever MemeFi platform in the crypto space. The flagship feature is CUTO DEX. This is a decentralized exchange set to be released very soon and will allow for seamless cross-chain transactions across all major blockchains. Traders will enjoy near-instantaneous speeds and some of the lowest fees on the market as Cutoshi brings forward a true alternative to single-chain DEXs such as Uniswap and Raydium, which have been dominating the space so far.

The project draws inspiration from the teachings of Satoshi Nakamoto, prioritizing privacy and decentralization above all. This means that users don’t have to compromise sensitive information when engaging with the ecosystem. As a non-custodial platform, Cutoshi ensures that intermediaries are removed from the equation, with users retaining complete sovereignty over their funds.

Community members will have the opportunity to earn income from multiple avenues through the Cutoshi Farming initiative. During and after the presale, users can participate in fun events and complete various missions aimed at boosting Cutoshi’s online presence. For their efforts, they will receive Cuto points that can later be redeemed for tokens once the presale wraps up. To further gamify the experience, participants can track their performance on a leaderboard and win daily prizes at the Lucky Cat Shrine. In addition to this, post-launch, investors will be able to tap into a passive income stream by staking their $CUTO and helping support the platform.

Stage 4 of the Cutoshi presale is selling out as demand is growing exponentially. Early buyers have the chance to load up on $CUTO at just $0.031 per token. This makes the ideal time to get involved before the next inevitable surge that could send the price into the stratosphere once the presale wraps up and listings on major exchanges are finalized.
