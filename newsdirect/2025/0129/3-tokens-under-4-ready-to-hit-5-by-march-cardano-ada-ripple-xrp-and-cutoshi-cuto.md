Following Donald Trump’s inauguration, the crypto market appears to be preparing for another rally. Thus, this article will uncover why Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and Cutoshi (CUTO) are the top three in our list of the altcoins positioned for the best surge in the following bull run and their potential returns.

Cardano (ADA) Rises To Crucial Resistance, Will It Break Out?During the November 2024 rally, the ADA price surged remarkably, and Cardano gained over 300% within a month. Despite the momentum, ADA faced significant resistance from the $1.24 price level, which terminated the uptrend, and Cardano reversed, plunging over 30% in the next three weeks.

Due to this decrease in demand, the price slowed down, and ADA traded sideways for over a month. Cardano has recovered significantly in the previous four days and has moved above the 50-day SMA. In the last 24 hours, ADA has surged by 7.43% and is trading at $1.12 but is facing rejection from the immediate resistance at $1.15, from where it has reversed multiple times.

If ADA continues to gain demand, the price can move past this resistance level, and with sufficient momentum, Cardano can surpass the $1.24 resistance level to resume the rally. However, if the ADA price is rejected again, support levels exist at $1.05 and $1.02 to break the fall.

Ripple (XRP) Continues Rally After ConsolidationRipple performed tremendously in the recent rally, with the price rising by over 400% after breaking from a critical resistance trendline. However, when the price reached $2.9, Ripple lost the upward thrust and started to trade in a symmetric triangle pattern. It continued to trade in this pattern for over a month and slowly consolidated into a tight range-bound price action.

Ripple moved above the upper trendline of this triangle last week, has gained over 35% this week, and currently trades at $3.32. The price is only 14.39% below the ATH, which Ripple established over seven years ago, and is steadily rising.

The MACD oscillator is rising fast, showing increasing bullish sentiment for Ripple. The price has become overbought due to increasing demand, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 77.3. Ripple may reach a new ATH soon if this bullish pressure continues to push the price with similar momentum.
