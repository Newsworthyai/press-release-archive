Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a leader in traumatic brain injury and stroke rehabilitation services, has been accredited by the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (BHCOE) for demonstrating a commitment to the standards of excellence for applied behavior analysis services.

The BHCOE Accreditation® distinguishes applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy providers that demonstrate continuous improvement in applied behavior analysis and dedication.

Three of CNS’ locations in Bakersfield and Los Angeles, California, and Irving, Texas have earned this accreditation and have been approved as training sites for behavior analysis students.

Since 1980, Centre for Neuro Skills has treated thousands of people whose brain injury deficits include complex behavior challenges. Behavior analysts and therapists are trained in behavior skills, crisis prevention and management, and implementation of comprehensive, interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs.

As an accredited training site, students and interns can learn from board-certified behavior analysts to help treat behavior problems.

“We are thrilled that our behavior department and treatment program has been recognized as a standard of excellence,” said Chris Persel, Regional Director of Clinical Services and Director of Behavior Programming. “This accreditation opens up more opportunities for behavior analysis students and demonstrates the importance of providing behavioral analysis services to individuals facing a brain injury."
