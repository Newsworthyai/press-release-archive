# Vymo Partners with Exavalu, a Digital Transformation Leader in Insurance

Vymo, a leading multi-channel distribution management platform powered by AI for the global insurance industry, has announced a strategic partnership with Exavalu, a leading global digital advisory and systems integration consulting firm for insurance clients. Exavalu will collaborate with Vymo to accelerate innovation and address strategic challenges facing the insurance sector. Together, they will use Vymo’s machine learning and AI-driven technology and Exavalu’s deep systems integration and advisory capabilities to streamline agent recruitment and onboarding compliance, optimize lead management processes, encourage internal adoption, and create more effective use of digital distribution management capabilities to improve carriers’ sales and distribution operational efficiencies.

“We’re excited to be partnering with Exavalu, whose superior strategic insurance advisory services help carriers and brokers accelerate core, digital and data modernization. While AI and machine learning gain traction in the insurance industry, many carriers still use legacy or outdated onboarding processes,” notes Anthony Iuffredo, Vymo VP Head of Sales Americas. “Companies expanding into new states need to recruit agents as quickly as possible, so the demand for onboarding is very high. Through Vymo’s new partnership with Exavalu, manual onboarding processes can be reduced from two to three months to just a week.”

Notes Anthony Iuffredo, “We’ll also work with Exavalu to help insurers optimize their ‘lead to close’ processes, which can be difficult to manage on daily basis. Vymo’s significant AI capabilities combined with Exavalu’s successful strategic advisory solutions in this area will ensure that managing leads across both captive and independent agents, which can run into the thousands, will be seamlessly accomplished. This will provide agents the tools they need to be far more successful and drive additional business from their channels.”

Saurav Basu, President and Founder of Exavalu, observes: “A persistent challenge in the insurance industry is low adoption of the digital onboarding and compliance management solutions essential to lowering friction with agents while completing strategic core modernization efforts. Exavalu has chosen to partner with Vymo because they offer a complete distribution management solution specifically tailored to enhance agent onboarding, compliance and lead management activities that complement our carrier client’s digital transformation efforts. We’re excited to harness Vymo’s deep AI capabilities to help our customers realize a much higher return on their substantial system modernization and automation efforts.”

Vymo’s platform offers deep, AI-enabled guidance, with access to data points within a firm’s entire book of business and visibility into what is and isn’t effective. Vymo’s analysis guides actions that lead to better decisions, identifies new opportunities, and drives sales growth and customer retention. “This partnership is designed to ensure that Vymo is embedded in as many of Exavalu’s strategic solutions as possible. We look forward to bringing these improved services to our mutual customers and improving the way they do business,” adds Anthony Iuffredo.
