# Lia27 Announces Reg CF Investment Opportunity to Scale the Future of AI

Lia27, the AI company behind Lia, the world’s first emotionally intelligent and task-driven AI assistant, has opened its first Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) investment opportunity, giving retail investors the chance to participate for the first time.

By seamlessly integrating high-level task management with real-time emotional understanding, Lia redefines how people interact with technology – creating an AI that helps and truly connects.

Lia27 has already gained significant momentum, with 90% month-over-month user retention, and over 1 million social media followers. Lia27 has also raised $2 million in prior funding, positioning itself for rapid growth as it expands into new markets and enhances its technology.

The company is launching this Reg CF investment opportunity to build on this success, inviting investors to be part of the next evolution of AI. Funds raised will go toward:

* Expanding Lia’s capabilities, including deeper integration with fine-tuned Gemini 2.0, Dall-E 3, Whisper, and GPT models.
* Scaling user adoption through strategic marketing and international expansion into non-English-speaking markets.
* Advancing AI research and development, with a focus on emotional intelligence and quantum computing integration.

“Our funding campaign isn’t just about raising capital.” Lia27 CEO Jean-Francois Comeau said, “It’s about unleashing a tidal wave of growth by welcoming fearless innovators into our inner circle. Together, we’re turbocharging Lia’s mission to become the world’s most human-like AI, connecting with millions in ways no one’s ever seen before.”

Lia27’s Reg CF investment opportunity is now open. More information can be found at https://invest.lia27.ai/
