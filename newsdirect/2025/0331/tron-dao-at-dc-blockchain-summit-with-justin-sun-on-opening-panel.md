Geneva, Switzerland, March 31 2025 - TRON DAO the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), demonstrated its industry leadership at the DC Blockchain Summit 2025 as a Gold Tier Sponsor. Hosted by The Digital Chamber, the event brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators to help shape the future of blockchain policy and regulation.

T3 FCU Headlines Main Stage

The opening panel, moderated by Kristopher Klaich, Director of Policy at The Digital Chamber, brought together key figures from the pioneering collaboration: Justin Sun (Founder, TRON), Paolo Ardoino (CEO, Tether), Ari Redbord (Global Head of Policy, TRM Labs) and David Feder (Law Enforcement Relations Counsel, TRON). The panelists discussed the unit's successful model for combating cryptocurrency-related financial crime and the successful freezing of $9 million connected to the recent Bybit hack, the largest cryptocurrency theft in history.

“Collaborating with law enforcement organizations around the world to identify and combat illicit activity on the blockchain remains a key objective of our initiative” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON.

“The collaboration across our companies is fundamental," said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Blockchain is the worst tool to be used by criminals because every transaction can be tracked. We want to ensure every person that enters our system can use it in the safest way possible.”

Publicly launched in September 2024, T3 FCU has frozen over $150 million in criminal assets across five continents by combining TRM Labs' blockchain intelligence capabilities with TRON and Tether's capacity to identify and disrupt criminal activity worldwide. Wednesday’s panel provided critical context on the scale of USDT on the TRON blockchain, which hosts a significant portion of USDT's over $144 billion market capitalization.

TRON VIP Lounge

TRON DAO established a significant presence at the summit hosting TRON Lounge, a dedicated networking hub where attendees engaged in discussions about recent advancements in blockchain technology.

Key industry leaders and TRON DAO collaborators were present, including Adrian Wall, Director at the Digital Sovereignty Alliance (DSA).
