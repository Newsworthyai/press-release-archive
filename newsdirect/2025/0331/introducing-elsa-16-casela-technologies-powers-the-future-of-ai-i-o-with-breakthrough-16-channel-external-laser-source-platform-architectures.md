# Introducing ELSA-16: Casela Technologies Powers the Future of AI I/O with Breakthrough 16 Channel External Laser Source Platform Architectures

Casela Technologies (Casela), a leading innovator in high-power semiconductor laser solutions, today announced the launch of ELSA-16, a next-generation, pluggable 16-channel External Laser Source (ELS) platform designed to unlock new levels of performance, flexibility, and scalability in Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) and silicon photonics-based systems powering AI workloads.

Engineered for the rapidly evolving demands of AI infrastructure, the ELSA-16 integrates 16 high-power Distributed Feedback (DFB) lasers with advanced control electronics in a compact, thermally optimized form factor. With optional TEC (Thermoelectric Cooler) integration for enhanced wavelength stability, the platform is fully customizable to target specific power, wavelength, and efficiency requirements. ELSA-16 modules utilize polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber outputs and an OSFP electrical interface with CMIS-based firmware for seamless integration.

“The ELSA-16 represents a quantum leap in flexible and scalable external laser sources,” said Milind Gokhale, Co-Founder and CTO of Casela. “From powering high-bandwidth chiplet I/O to enabling dense wavelength division multiplexing, ELSA-16 is the ideal solution for next-generation optical networks.”

Key features of the ELSA-16 platform include:

1. Customizable Power Profiles: Supports Casela’s 200–300 mW class lasers with fiber-coupled output powers ranging from 150–200 mW per channel.
2. Broad Wavelength Support: Available in 1310nm and CWDM-4 options for DR/FR links, and CW-WDM/DWDM variants for ring-based silicon modulators.
3. Comb Source Capability: Enables up to 128 optical channels via 16 x 8-comb source configurations, with >12mW per wavelength per fiber on a 200 GHz grid.
4. DWDM Scalability: Future-ready for tighter wavelength spacing and dynamic control to support evolving CPO architectures.

At OFC 2025, Casela will showcase a 16-wavelength version of ELSA-16, each powering dense comb sources to demonstrate the platform’s potential to support 128+ channels in a compact, pluggable form—redefining the limits of scalability in AI and HPC systems. Visit the company in meeting room 6549 to preview Casela’s entire ELSA-16 product family.

On Sunday, March 30, Casela’s CTO Milind Gokhale joined a panel of industry leaders during the “High Power and Multi-Wavelength Laser Light Sources” workshop at OFC 2025. In a forward-looking discussion, the group explored how innovation in laser architecture, integration and performance will drive the next generation of optical interconnects for AI/ML. Topics included multi-wavelength roadmaps, serial and parallel interface demands, high-efficiency packaging and the scalability required for future systems.

As AI and high-performance computing continue to demand ultra-efficient and high-bandwidth I/O, Casela’s ELSA-16 platform delivers industry-leading wall plug efficiency, precise wavelength control, and unparalleled scalability. With support for high-density, parallel optical links, ELSA-16 offers a clear path toward more compact, power-efficient, and cost-effective optical interconnects at the silicon level.
