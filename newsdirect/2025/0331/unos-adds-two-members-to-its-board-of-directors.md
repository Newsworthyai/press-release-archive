# UNOS adds two members to its board of directors

Today, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved two new board members, bringing the board complement to nine.

Melina Davis and Mark Johnson will begin their terms on April 1, 2025, serving until September 30, 2028. They were approved by a full board vote on March 24.

“I’m pleased to welcome Melina and Mark to the UNOS Board of Directors,” said Sue Dunn, chair of the UNOS board of directors. “They each have an incredible background that exemplifies UNOS’ strategic priorities and work to help save and improve lives.”

Davis and Johnson bring decades of executive leadership to the UNOS Board of Directors, both within and outside of healthcare. Davis is the CEO and executive vice president of the Medical Society of Viriginia and Johnson is the former CEO of Averhealth and BetterMed Urgent Care.

“I’m honored to join the UNOS Board of Directors. UNOS is an organization that’s committed to enhancing the lives and health of individuals. Together, with my fellow board members, I will advocate for innovative solutions, enhance donor awareness, and strive to improve the overall donation and transplant system,” said Davis. “By collaborating, we can advance our goal to give hope and a second chance to many individuals and their families. I look forward to engaging with the community and harnessing our collective expertise to drive meaningful change.”

“It’s an honor to be appointed to the UNOS Board of Directors, and for the opportunity to work with UNOS’ CEO Maureen McBride and the UNOS team as they pursue strategic initiatives to provide critical, high-value organ sharing and transplant services,” said Johnson. “As the complex organ transplantation system undergoes change, UNOS’ breadth and depth of know-how, and its extensive relationships with transplant hospitals and other stakeholders, point to a bright future for UNOS and for the many patients who rely on critical organ donations. I look forward to contributing strategic, financial and capital deployment support to UNOS as it advances its mission.”
