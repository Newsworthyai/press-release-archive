# Market Alert: Palatin's Disruptive Obesity Drug Combination Shows Groundbreaking Weight Loss Results in Phase 2 Topline Data (NYSE: PTN)

Palatin Technologies* has unveiled compelling topline results from its Phase 2 study showing that patients receiving its obesity drug bremelanotide in combination with tirzepatide achieved a 4.4% weight reduction compared to just 1.6% for placebo—a highly statistically significant difference (p<0.0001). The eight-week trial demonstrated that combining these two mechanisms creates a synergistic effect, with 40% of patients in the combination group achieving at least 5% weight loss compared to 27% with tirzepatide alone.

The economic potential of anti-obesity drugs is enormous, with the market expected to reach US$100 billion by 2030. As obesity rates continue to climb globally, with the number of obese individuals worldwide projected to increase from 980 million to nearly 2 billion from 2022 to 2035, innovative treatment approaches like Palatin's are positioning themselves in this rapidly expanding market.

Perhaps most intriguing for the obesity treatment landscape, Palatin's data revealed that its drug effectively halted the rapid weight regain typically seen after stopping GLP-1/GIP therapy. This addresses one of the most significant challenges facing current obesity treatments, where patients often regain substantial weight after discontinuation.

Palatin is advancing development of next-generation long-acting injectable and oral versions of its obesity compounds, with investigational new drug applications planned for late 2025 and clinical data expected in early 2026. The company is one of just two developing therapies targeting this specific biological pathway for obesity.

This announcement follows recent positive news from Palatin's ulcerative colitis program and FDA orphan drug designation for its oral obesity compound for rare genetic obesity disorders, demonstrating the company's momentum across multiple therapeutic areas with significant unmet needs.
