# Concord Introduces AI Copilot Revolutionary Contract Review Technology with Instant Plain-Language Insights

Concord, the leading contract management software platform trusted by over 1,500 companies and 1 million users worldwide, proudly announces the launch of AI Copilot, a groundbreaking assistant that revolutionizes contract review with instant, accurate insights delivered through simple, plain-language questions.

Unparalleled Speed and Accuracy with Intelligent Contract Analysis

AI Copilot transforms the traditionally time-consuming process of contract review by enabling users to ask natural language questions and receive immediate, actionable answers. This innovative approach eliminates the need for complex searches through dense legal documents, delivering insights 2x faster than traditional methods while proactively identifying risks and opportunities that could impact business performance.

AI Copilot Key Features Include:

Instant Contract Intelligence: Ask any question about clauses, terms, or deadlines and get immediate responses

Proactive Risk Identification: Surface potential compliance issues, data privacy concerns, and other red flags before they become costly problems

Smart Contract Summarization: Generate clear, concise summaries of complex agreements in seconds

Universal Accessibility: Make contract data accessible to any team member, regardless of legal expertise

Integrated Workflow: Built directly into Concord's document view for seamless user experience

Why Choose AI Copilot for Contract Management?

AI Copilot addresses the critical challenge facing every team that touches contracts—Legal, Procurement, Finance, and Sales Operations—who are being asked to move faster and do more with less. Traditional contract lifecycle management (CLM) software creates bottlenecks where key clauses are hard to find, risks are difficult to assess, and critical deadlines are easily missed.

"I spent six months in contract hell trying to renegotiate 500 vendor agreements—one month just looking for the contracts, another month reading them one by one, then four months sending thousands of Word documents back and forth," says Matt Lhoumeau, CEO and Co-founder of Concord. "That's when I realized contract management was badly broken. AI Copilot changes everything. Instead of digging through filing cabinets or endless email chains, you just ask 'What are the payment terms?' and get an instant answer. It's that simple."

Advanced Analytics and Comprehensive Contract Understanding

AI Copilot goes beyond basic contract review to provide sophisticated analysis capabilities. Users can quickly identify payment amounts and due dates, flag terms related to data privacy and intellectual property, and understand termination provisions with complete context. Whether reviewing vendor agreements, customer contracts, or upcoming renewals, the AI delivers actionable insights that accelerate decision-making and improve business outcomes.

"For us, contracts aren't legal documents—they're business processes that enable relationships," adds Lhoumeau. "Ninety-five percent of companies still manage contracts manually, which is where finance was 30 years ago. AI Copilot doesn't replace lawyers; it democratizes legal knowledge so that anyone can understand what's in their contracts. This frees up legal teams to focus on truly complex matters where their expertise adds real value."

Comprehensive Support and Immediate Availability

AI Copilot is available today in every document within Concord's platform. The solution requires no complex setup or learning curve—users simply open any contract and start asking questions to immediately unlock valuable insights from their agreements.

Concord provides comprehensive implementation support, training resources, and ongoing customer success guidance to ensure maximum value from the AI Copilot investment.
