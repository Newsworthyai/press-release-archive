HELLA GmbH & Co. KGaA ("FORVIA HELLA") is continuing its program to further increase its brand awareness in certain categories including brake systems. Building on its Original Equipment competency and rich history with high-performance vehicles, HELLA has turned its full attention to the 2025 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC).

Not only will HELLA sponsor the 2025 PPIHC Time Attack 1 Division but will also hand out the 2025 HELLA Hype Award and the HELLA Heritage Award, both of which are designed to celebrate and recognize the teams and drivers that go the extra mile.

Hoping for victory in The Race to the Clouds and getting his hands on the HELLA Time Attack 1 trophy will be HELLA-sponsored Robb Holland in his Rotek Racing-prepared 2022 992 Porsche 911 GT3 RS Cup car. Sporting a special HELLA livery to commemorate the partnership, the 911 has received minimal upgrades for the climb to the 14,115ft summit except for JRZ active dampers to cope with the bumpy conditions on the public street course. The team has also equipped the GT3 RS with a Starlink datalink to livestream his attempt in the 103rd running of the PPIHC on June 22. As such, Holland should be the first driver to transmit his attempt live for fans to watch.

With a racing career dating back to 2011, Robb cut his teeth in touring car racing but turned his attention to Pikes Peak in 2016, setting a front-wheel drive record at his first attempt. Holland will be hoping his extensive experience and additional time spent on a racing simulator in preparation for the race will pay dividends this year as he aims to claim the HELLA Time Attack 1 class winner’s trophy.

The second Rotek-prepared car is the HELLA-sponsored 2023 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport, which will be driven by veteran Clint Vahsholtz. The car won both the 2025 Pirelli GT America and GT4 America road racing championships, so brings an impressive pedigree. With its HELLA livery, Vahsholtz will be hoping to claim the Pikes Peak GT4 Trophy by Yokohama.

Vahsholtz got his competitive start in Stock Cars and has been competing at Pikes Peak since 1992. Initially he rode motorcycles but switched to cars in 1996. With 24 class wins, predominantly in Super Stock and Open Wheel, Vahsholtz is one of the most successful racers on the Hill Climb and will be looking to add another trophy to the cabinet this year.

"The entire team at HELLA is excited to partner with the legendary Pikes Peak International Hill Climb," said Robert Tinson, Vice President at HELLA. “As HELLA celebrates more than 125 years of engineering excellence, we’re happy to share the same spirit of innovation, performance, and endurance exemplified by the 103rd running of The Race to the Clouds. In common with the organizers, drivers and teams, our company has pushed the limits of what’s possible from lighting and electronics to braking and beyond.”

HELLA Sponsorship & Awards

As a continuation of the brand’s awareness campaign, HELLA is the title sponsor the 2025 PPIHC Time Attack 1 Division Award. Trophies will be provided to the podium finishers in a class that includes close-bodied modified and specialized production-based two- and four-wheel drive vehicles. Eligibility is restricted to original configuration for air/fuel delivery, number of cylinders, and number of drive wheels, among the requirements. As such, the class will see a variety of machines but is dominated by Porsche models ranging from Robb’s GT3 RS Cup to the GT3 RS, GT2 RS Clubsport and 911 Turbo S. There will also be a Subaru Impreza WRX STI, BMW M2 CS Racing, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo and more.

For its special honors, the HELLA Hype Award will allow Pikes Peak fans to nominate their favorite driver, with final online voting happening at Fan Fest on Friday June 20. The driver with the most public votes will receive the special award from HELLA Vice President, Rob Tinson as well as a $2000 reward.

The HELLA Heritage Award plus $2000 cash reward will also be presented by Tinson to the driver on the 2025 PPIHC with the most finishes during their competitive career in the historic race. All trophies and awards will be handed out during the PPIHC trophy ceremony.
