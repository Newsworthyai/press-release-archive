# Stallard Kane Exposes Real-Life Workplace Safety Fails to Raise Awareness Across UK Businesses

Leading risk and compliance specialists Stallard Kane have revealed shocking real-life workplace safety oversights to highlight the often-overlooked dangers in everyday work environments. From melting plastic bags on electric hobs to duct-taped hammers still in use, the company's health and safety team has encountered firsthand how minor neglect can escalate into major incidents.

The incidents, observed during routine workplace assessments, are being shared as part of Stallard Kane’s campaign to raise awareness around the importance of maintaining safety protocols—even in seemingly low-risk environments like offices and break rooms.

Everyday Oversights, Major Risks

Among the real examples shared:

* Plastic Shopping Bags on Active Hob: An employee unknowingly activated an electric hob by placing shopping bags on the counter, narrowly avoiding a fire.
* Toaster Knife Hazard: An employee attempted to retrieve toast using a metal knife—while the appliance remained plugged in.
* Frayed Carpet Trip Risk: A loose carpet edge was left unaddressed, creating a serious trip hazard.
* Overflowing Bins in Kitchens: Poor hygiene and food waste led to risks of contamination and pest infestation.
* Improper Tool Use: A kitchen knife was used in place of a box cutter, increasing risk of personal injury.
* Makeshift Repairs: A broken hammer held together with duct tape was discovered in active use, posing danger to workers.

“These are not just one-off mistakes,” said a spokesperson at Stallard Kane. “They are signs of deeper issues—lack of awareness, poor training, and cultures that overlook ‘small’ safety risks. Our job is to help employers see how these everyday scenarios can quickly become dangerous.”

Preventable Problems, Practical Solutions

Stallard Kane advocates for proactive risk assessments, employee safety training, and clear reporting procedures to address small hazards before they cause harm.

“Most of these incidents are entirely preventable,” the Nathan Jones added. “It all comes down to embedding a strong safety culture and making practical changes—like having the right tools, maintaining clean environments, and empowering staff to speak up.”
