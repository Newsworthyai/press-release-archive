# TGI Fridays Is Pouring It on Strong with Bold New Menu

TGI Fridays®, the iconic American bar and grill, is bringing flavor and fun in a big way with a bold new menu. Launching nationwide today, the revamped offerings elevate the guest experience with boozy, saucy indulgences that lean into Fridays’ flavor-first, irreverent spirit.

The menu upgrade is the latest chapter in TGI Fridays’ ongoing comeback story—one that’s already gained traction among loyal followers and industry insiders.

“Our guests told us they wanted more flavor and more fun. We delivered,” says TGI Fridays CEO Ray Blanchette. “This new menu is playful, shareable and full of energy—exactly the vibe people come to Fridays for. It’s just the beginning of our strategy to bring bold, vibrant flavors from our global footprint to our U.S. consumers.”

At the center of the culinary upgrade: a crowd-pleasing favorite reintroduced with a twist—mozzarella sticks “sauced” with three bold Fridays flavors: FRANKS RedHot© Buffalo, Garlic Parmesan and legendary, Fridays-only Whiskey Glaze. Guests can also opt for the Original with all three sauces on the side. When it comes to cheese sticks and cocktails, Fridays isn’t following trends—they’re setting them.

“Fridays is where mozzarella sticks went from just another bar snack to a must-have,” says Blanchette. “We kept our classics and layered on big flavors, so whether you’re in the mood for something familiar or feeling adventurous, our menu hits the spot.”

And the drinks? Just as bold. The brand that introduced the singles bar concept put its cocktail heritage front and center with seven new drinks crafted to pack a punch. Signature beverages come with two-ounce pours, from Jack’s New Fashioned to the mega-sized eLITe—a riff on the Long Island Iced Tea Fridays invented in 1965—and the energy-fueled Turbo Toro. It’s a celebration in true Fridays fashion.

Also new: the Big Queso Energy Burger, layered with roasted jalapeños, pico de gallo, cheddar and poblano queso, plus more queso for dipping (over a quarter pound of cheese!). Housemade Loaded Tots, amped-up tater tots with bacon, green onion and a new dip-everything-in-it TGI Sauce, round out the new offerings.

Prioritizing guest experience, the new menu also features upgraded ingredients and simplified builds for faster service and greater consistency—part of a company-wide commitment to flavor, execution and giving guests what they crave most.

Guests can experience the new menu at Fridays’ participating U.S. locations or head to @tgifridays to follow the social fun.
