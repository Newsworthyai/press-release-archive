# Smart Garage Doors, Smarter Savings: Genie and HomeSphere Announce New Partnership

HomeSphere, the leading platform connecting building product manufacturers to mid-market homebuilders, has announced a new strategic partnership with The Genie Company, a longtime innovator in smart, dependable and easy-to-install garage door openers.

Through the collaboration, more than 2,700 builders in HomeSphere’s U.S. network can now claim exclusive rebates on the most popular Genie Pro Series models, including both Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi options.

“We’re thrilled to partner with HomeSphere to make it even easier for builders to choose Genie,” said Steve Janas, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at The Genie Company. “At Genie, we’re always looking for ways to support our builder partners with innovative tools and added value.”

Genie has been a trusted name in garage door openers since pioneering the first radio-controlled garage door opener over 70 years ago. Its Wi-Fi models integrate easily with leading smart home platforms and support voice control for added convenience.

"Genie has long been a go-to for builders and homeowners,” said Greg Schwarzer, President and CEO of HomeSphere. “This partnership gives our builders a chance to offer next-generation functionality while driving savings through our platform.”
