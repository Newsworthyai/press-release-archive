# IotaComm® Launches Investment Campaign to Expand Nation’s First IoT-Dedicated Wireless Network

IotaComm, Inc. ("IotaComm"), a wireless communications and Internet of Things (IoT) solution provider and the builder of America’s first wireless network dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), is excited to announce the official launch of its Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) investment campaign. This offering gives investors a chance to own a stake in a company leading the transformation of smart infrastructure across the U.S.

With exclusive rights to nationwide FCC-licensed spectrum, IotaComm’s low-cost, low-power wide area network connectivity aggregates data into a robust IoT platform to enable real-time monitoring of air quality, energy usage, and infrastructure health—critical for schools, hospitals, manufacturers, and even whole cities embracing smart technologies.

Funds raised will accelerate the rollout of IotaComm’s proprietary Delphi360™ platform, expand nationwide deployments, and scale operations to meet growing demand across the $1.5 trillion smart infrastructure market.

Investment perks include 25% bonus shares for early participants until May 30, 2025. After that, investors can still get up to 25% more bonus shares depending on the amount they invest. This stacks up to a potential 50% bonus shares.

“Our innovation is key to bringing the vision of smart buildings and cities to reality,” said Terrence DeFranco, CEO of IotaComm. “This raise allows us to bring in everyday investors who believe in our mission to modernize critical systems and improve lives with intelligent, wireless technology.”

Early investors and industry insiders are taking notice. With brands like Crayola and GigNet already leveraging IotaComm’s platform to improve manufacturing environments, the company’s real-world traction is driving both interest and momentum.
