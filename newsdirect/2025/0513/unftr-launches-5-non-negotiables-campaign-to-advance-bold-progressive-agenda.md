# UNFTR Launches ‘5 Non-Negotiables’ Campaign to Advance Bold Progressive Agenda

UNFTR (UNFTR.com), known for its incisive analysis of American politics and unwavering commitment to progressive values, today announced the launch of its “5 Non-Negotiables” campaign. This new action aims to galvanize support for a transformative progressive agenda, directly confronting what the podcast views as the Democratic establishment’s fundamental inability to deliver meaningful change.

The 5 Non-Negotiables—Housing First, Civilian Labor Corps, Medicare for All, Election Integrity, and Climate Action—represent a progressive alternative to the compromised politics that have dominated the corporate-bought duopoly for decades.

“The Democratic establishment has consistently been dismissive of progressive priorities in the name of pragmatism and moderation,” said Max, host of UNFTR. “And to what end? Americans are confronting a housing crisis, shareholder-run healthcare system, corporate capture of elections and legislative processes, and a largely forgotten climate emergency, among other critical issues. The 5 Non-Negotiables reject that approach entirely. This isn’t about moving the Overton window slightly—it’s about a bold progressive vision that refuses to compromise on the fundamentals of what makes a just society.”

The campaign is the capstone of UNFTR’s podcast series exploring essential progressive priorities, now condensed into comprehensive policy proposals backed by research and historical context:

* Housing First: Recognizing stable shelter as a human right and economic necessity, with evidence showing 85–90% of participants remain housed after the first year and savings of $10,000–$20,000 per person annually.
* Civilian Labor Corps: Responding to AI disruption threatening millions of jobs and vagaries of our capitalist boom-and-bust cycles thrusting workers into precarity by creating guaranteed meaningful work focused on climate resilience, care work, and community development.
* Medicare for All: Transforming a healthcare system that consumes 18% of the American economy while delivering poorer outcomes than other developed nations.
* Election Integrity: Reclaiming democracy from special interests through constitutional reform that addresses the corrupting influence of money in politics.
* Climate Action: Establishing a Climate Trust that ensures those who have contributed most to the crisis help fund solutions, generating substantial resources for resilience and adaptation.

“When the Democratic establishment tells progressives to moderate our demands or ‘not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,’ they’re repeating the failed formula that has led to our current crises,” added Max. “The 5 Non-Negotiables give progressives a platform that doesn’t just react to the right, but articulates a positive vision for transforming society. Simply being anti-Trump isn’t enough, as evidenced by the Democratic Party’s incredibly poor standing with the American public.”

The campaign provides progressives with practical tools for organizing at the grassroots level, independent of party structures. The website (UNFTR.com/5nn) includes downloadable policy briefs, social media posts, and email templates for contacting representatives. UNFTR’s goal is to empower Americans exhausted of being pushed aside as the wealthy gain disproportionately more power.
