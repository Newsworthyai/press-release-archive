# Comcast Breaks Ground in the Rural Area of Riverdale and Celebrates One Year Servicing Caruthers

Today, Comcast in partnership with the County of Fresno, hosted a groundbreaking ceremony in Caruthers, Calif., to kick off its new rural broadband expansion project in the neighboring town of Riverdale. The project will bring Comcast’s reliable, high-speed, symmetrical Xfinity broadband network to over 160 previously unserved locations in Riverdale and is expected to be completed by 2026. Comcast also celebrated the one year anniversary of servicing the town of Caruthers.

The planned expansion adds to Comcast’s more than $4 billion in technology and infrastructure investments across California in the past three years. This expansion is made possible by a $1 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private funding by Comcast.

Additionally, Comcast gifted a laptop computer to all eighth graders in Caruthers and announced a $10,000 contribution to the Caruthers Unified Education Fund to help create greater digital opportunity and provide digital literacy resources that enable students, individuals, and families to access high speed Internet and more fully participate in the digital economy.

“We deeply appreciate Comcast's holistic approach to our community," said Orin Hirschkorn, Superintendent of the Caruthers Unified School District. "Bringing the infrastructure and technology is indeed significant. However, Comcast goes further by asking, 'What more can we do?' Their substantial financial contribution will provide support for various needs, and our students and community are immensely grateful for it.”

"We are thrilled and proud that Comcast is extending its services to our rural area of Riverdale and commemorating its year-long service in Caruthers," said Buddy Mendes, Chairman of the Board of Supervisors from District 4. "This significant investment in our technology infrastructure will boost economic growth, support current businesses, attract new ones, and enhance our residents’ quality of life. We are thankful to Comcast and the CPUC and eagerly anticipate collaborating to bring this project to life.
