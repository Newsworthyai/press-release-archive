# Players Health and MaxU Partner to Power the Next Generation of Mentally Resilient Athletes

In a bold move to redefine athlete development, Players Health and MaxU today announced a strategic partnership to bring elite-level mental skills training to youth athletes across North America.

Unveiled during Mental Health Awareness Month, this strategic alliance is both timely and purpose-driven. As mental health emerges as a cornerstone of athletic excellence and personal growth, Players Health and MaxU unite around a shared mission: to empower the whole athlete with transformative mindset tools that go beyond the game. Both organizations are anchored in a bold belief—mental health and performance are vital to athlete safety, now and into the future.

This partnership integrates MaxU’s groundbreaking mental performance platform directly into the Players Health ecosystem—empowering young athletes with the focus, confidence, and resilience needed to thrive in sports, school, and life.

“This is more than a partnership—it’s a movement,” said Dan Greco, Co-Founder of MaxU. “Together, we’re scaling access to proven mental skills training that helps athletes navigate pressure, unlock peak performance, and build habits that last a lifetime.”

With a reach spanning teams, schools, and youth organizations, the impact is immediate and scalable—creating a new blueprint for how mental wellness and performance are taught, measured, and mastered in youth sports.

“Over the last several years since joining Players Health, I've been focused on creating an environment where every young athlete feels supported in every part of their journey,” said Kyle Lubrano, Chief Athlete Safety Officer of Players Health. “Mental resilience is the foundation for everything else — confidence, physical performance, and long-term success. Partnering with MaxU allows us to deliver real, lasting change for athletes and families everywhere. This allows us to provide kids with the tools to believe in themselves, thrive under pressure, and carry those skills through every stage of life.”

Two missions. One movement. Grounded in purpose and fueled by innovation, this alliance between Players Health and MaxU reflects a shared belief: supporting the whole athlete—physically, mentally, and emotionally—is not just the future of youth sports. It’s the standard.

Players Health is a sports technology company providing digital risk management services, reporting tools and insurance products to sports organizations to empower them to stay ahead of their ever-changing safety and compliance responsibilities. Working towards establishing the safest environment for athletes, Players Health views the health and safety of athletes as a priority in today's sports landscape.
