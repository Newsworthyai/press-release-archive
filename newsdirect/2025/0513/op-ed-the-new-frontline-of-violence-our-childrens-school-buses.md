# OP-ED: The New Frontline of Violence — Our Children’s School Buses

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/444377831/DfAr7zFW.jpg)

Hate, violence, and apathy are no longer confined to faraway headlines—they are riding alongside our children on school buses. What used to be a symbol of safety and routine is now increasingly becoming a site of trauma and unchecked aggression. Just last month in Georgia, a 7-year-old child was beaten by seven other students, some as young as five. Shockingly, the bus driver stood by, failing to intervene.

In March 2025, a 16-year-old girl from South Plantation High School in Broward County, Florida, was brutally attacked by fellow students on a school bus. The incident was recorded and shared on social media, raising concerns about student safety and the role of bystanders during such events.

In March 2025, an 11-year-old boy in Bryan, Texas, was assaulted by three fellow students on a school bus. The attack left him with extensive bruises and injuries. The incident was recorded on a student’s cell phone and later shared on social media. Local authorities and the school district are investigating the incident.

Those stories have made national headlines.

Now, it’s happening here—right in our own backyard.

In Broward County, my client, a 15-year-old middle school student was viciously attacked on a school bus in Davie. At least 20 students witnessed the assault. Not one stepped in. No one tried to stop it. Many simply recorded it on their phones. We’ve become a society of spectators—watching suffering unfold in real time, more concerned with content than compassion.

This is not just bullying. It is violence. It is negligence. And it is deeply concerning.

As the 2024–2025 school year comes to a close, we must confront the reality: school buses are no longer safe spaces. Parents send their children off in the morning expecting they’ll return home unharmed. But these recent events are shaking that faith to its core.

We are calling on school districts, parents, and students to take immediate action. Awareness is the first step. Every parent should know what’s happening on their child’s bus. Demand accountability from schools and transportation departments. Advocate for trained monitors or better surveillance on buses. Talk to your kids about what they see—and what they don’t say.

We also urge students to bring back the values that were once so ingrained in us: “See something, say something.” “Do the right thing.” It’s time to trade viral videos for genuine values. Let’s encourage young people to be good Samaritans, not passive bystanders.

The violence on our school buses is a reflection of broader cultural decay—but it’s not irreversible. Let’s make 2025–2026 the year we turn things around. A year where silence is no longer mistaken for neutrality. A year where doing nothing is no longer acceptable. A year where our children feel safe again.

This issue isn’t just happening “somewhere else.” It’s here. It’s now. And it demands our attention.
