# Avrio Acquires TokenSphere to Deliver Tokenized Real-World Assets To The Market

In a strategic move to transform the future of fund management and real-world asset tokenization, Avrio Worldwide PBC (Avrio), a leading financial technology and data group, has acquired TokenSphere, a pioneering digital platform built by Consilience Group Ltd (Consilience) to automate fund management and unlock the full potential of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

This acquisition marks a major milestone in the evolution of digital financial market infrastructure, as institutional and private capital markets increasingly shift towards tokenization to enhance liquidity, transparency, and efficiency. With the U.S. private capital market surpassing $3.4 trillion in assets under management, and the tokenization market projected to exceed $10 trillion by 2030, TokenSphere’s cutting-edge technology positions Avrio at the forefront of this emerging financial transformation.

TokenSphere, developed by Consilience, is a one-of-a-kind platform designed to automate fund management and simplify the tokenization of RWAs. By integrating smart contracts, automated compliance, and streamlined investor onboarding, TokenSphere eliminates the complexity of fund administration while enabling frictionless digital asset issuance and trading.

As part of the transaction, Consilience receives an equity stake in Avrio. Avrio will establish an operating company to deploy the TokenSphere software and IP through market channels and integration with its core ATS technology platform, AvrioT. The Consilience technology team and CEO Kevin Monserrat will join Avrio to deliver the platform’s transition and go-to-market.

Kevin Monserrat, CEO of Consilience commented, "TokenSphere was built to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the new digital asset economy. The financial world is at an inflection point, and Avrio is perfectly positioned to lead the charge in transforming how private capital markets operate. This acquisition ensures that our technology will continue to evolve and scale within a world-class financial infrastructure ecosystem."

Avrio Worldwide Expands Its Capability for the Future of Digital Market Infrastructure

Avrio Worldwide is an innovator in digital financial market infrastructure, providing a core technology stack that enables institutional investors to efficiently deploy capital, and now, in a world rapidly tokenizing RWAs, through integrating TokenSphere into the Avrio core stack. Avrio aims to accelerate the mass adoption of digital assets across capital markets, unlocking unprecedented liquidity and investment opportunities for all segments of investors.

Lawrence Wintermeyer, CEO of Avrio said, "Tokenization is the future of financial markets, and with TokenSphere, Avrio is taking a decisive step in making RWA tokenization accessible, scalable, compliant, and secure. This acquisition strengthens our ability to provide best-in-class solutions to institutional investors navigating the shift towards new digital financial market infrastructure."

The Future of Digital Financial Market Infrastructure is Here

With over $838.5 billion in private equity deal activity in 2024, and the RWA tokenization market on track to exceed $2 trillion in the coming years, the need for institutional-grade digital financial market infrastructure has never been greater.

The integration of TokenSphere into Avrio’s core AvrioT platform will drive new efficiencies, improve liquidity, and greatly enhanced investment opportunities across global markets for all segments of investors.

This is just the beginning. The Avrio TokenSphere team is committed to pushing the boundaries of financial innovation, ushering in a new era of tokenized private capital markets where efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and security are the norm.
