# Uno Pizzeria and Grill Introduces The “Shenanigan Shake”

To celebrate the month of March and the festivities associated with it, Uno Pizzeria and Grill is introducing the Shenanigan Shake. The Shenanigan Shake will come in two versions – a boozy version and a non-alcohol version. Both versions will capture the minty creaminess of a traditional green mint milkshake often seen in March at various food establishments.

The “Boozy” Shenanigan Shake will feature Stoli Vanil Vodka and Crème de Menthe blended into a creamy green “adult” milkshake. It will be topped with whipped cream, a cherry and a chocolate gold coin (for a kiss of luck). The non-alcohol Shenanigan Shake will combine velvety ice cream with a burst of refreshing mint flavor. It will also be topped with whipped cream, a cherry and a chocolate gold coin but with an added drizzle of chocolate. Both will offer a cool burst of fun for celebrating St. Patrick’s Day all month long.

Edgar Cruz, Director of Beverage for the restaurant chain, boasted that the Shenanigan Shake will resonate with adults and kids alike. “No matter your age, all can enjoy our newest offering, the Shenanigan Shake. Whether you have enjoyed other mint shakes in the past or are new to the product, we know that you’ll will be thrilled with our new refreshing and creamy green mint milkshake.”

Both the boozy and non-alcohol versions are currently available in most Uno Pizzeria and Grill locations in the US and will be available through the end of the month on March.
