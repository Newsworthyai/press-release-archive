# Lisk Incubation Hub Completes First African Cohort, Opens Applications for Batch 2 with Up to $200,000 in Grants

Lisk, the Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain committed to advancing Web3 adoption in high-growth markets, is proud to announce the successful completion of the first cohort of the Lisk Blockchain Incubation Hub. Powered by CV Labs, the Lisk Blockchain Incubation Hub is a six-month program designed for African startups eager to build on the Lisk protocol. After an impactful six-month program, the incubator has helped 23 startups refine their ideas, develop go-to-market strategies, and access valuable financial support.

Applications for Batch 2 of the Lisk Incubation Hub are now open, offering exciting new opportunities for Web3 builders in Africa. The program will provide up to $20,000 per project in grants by graduation, as well as ongoing mentorship, a structured curriculum, and a robust network to help startups succeed. Startups will also benefit from continued support from Lisk and the chance to secure up to $100,000 in additional funding to scale their ventures. This new cohort is set to begin on May 19, 2025, with applications closing on April 12, 2025.

“The first inning of blockchain technology was cryptocurrency, and African nations are among the fastest adopters of such digital value,” said Brenton Naicker, Principal & Head of Growth at CV VC. “Beyond crypto, Africa is proving how the technology itself is driving necessary change, addressing inefficiencies and financial exclusion. These brilliant innovators showcase how blockchain fosters trust, streamlines processes, and unlocks new economic opportunities across the continent.”

The first cohort has already made a significant impact across Africa, with standout graduates driving real change in sectors such as agriculture, finance, and entertainment. These innovators are harnessing the power of blockchain to tackle pressing challenges within their communities and industries. With $196,000 in grants awarded at various stages of the program, startups have gained strong market traction, onboarding over 26,000 users, tokenizing $1.8 million in assets, and processing more than 20,000 blockchain transactions.

The Lisk Blockchain Incubation Hub is at the heart of Lisk's mission to support founders in high-growth markets who often face significant challenges in securing early-stage funding. To help overcome these obstacles, they need access to grants, investment pathways, and an ecosystem prioritizing long-term growth. By connecting builders with the right resources and support, Lisk enables them to turn their ideas into impactful projects and thrive in the Web3 space.

“For a long time, Web3 companies have not prioritized builders in high-growth markets like Africa, limiting their access to capital, mentorship, and support despite the abundance of talent,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “This is now changing with the launch of more incubation hubs and grant programs. I’m more confident than ever that Africa and other high-growth markets will drive innovation and scale blockchain solutions, benefiting their communities and the world at large.”
