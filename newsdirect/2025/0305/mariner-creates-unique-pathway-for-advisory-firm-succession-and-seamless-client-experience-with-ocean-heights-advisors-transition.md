# Mariner Creates Unique Pathway for Advisory Firm Succession and Seamless Client Experience with Ocean Heights Advisors Transition

Mariner, a privately held national financial services firm, today announced a strategic transition that underscores its commitment to providing financial advisors with a clear and seamless succession pathway. Ocean Heights Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif.-based wealth management firm with $730 million in assets under advisement, will transition from the Mariner Independent platform fully to Mariner, exemplifying the firm’s approach to long-term business continuity and client service.

“Transitioning Ocean Heights represents a pivotal milestone in our growth journey and clearly signals to our independent partners that exciting opportunities lie ahead,” said Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner. “This shift improves team collaboration, provides expanded benefits to associates and reinforces our commitment to delivering best-in-class financial advisory services.”

Mariner offers advisors the ability to maintain their independence and receive operational support through its Mariner Independent offering. Then, well in advance of a planned transition, advisors can integrate fully into Mariner, ensuring the future seamless transfer of client relationships and allowing advisors to continue to serve their clients. The Ocean Heights transition highlights this strategy in action, showcasing how advisors can evolve their practice while securing the founder’s legacy, providing ownership opportunities to the next generation and ensuring long-term, uninterrupted service and added resources for clients under one roof.

Ocean Heights first partnered with Mariner’s independent platform in 2022, which allowed the firm to maintain its independence while leveraging Mariner’s extensive operational, compliance and marketing support. Over the past three years, this partnership has enabled Ocean Heights to scale its offerings and expand its client services, nearly doubling its assets under advisement in the process. Now, as the firm transitions completely into Mariner, it will benefit from expanded growth channels and more robust infrastructure, while clients gain increased security and long-term continuity.

“Our partnership with Mariner has been instrumental in accelerating our growth,” said Kevin Barlow, managing partner of Ocean Heights Advisors. “After three years of successfully working together, fully integrating with Mariner is a natural evolution and will allow our team to provide even greater value to our clients while devoting more time to the personal relationships that have always been our hallmark.”

All members of Ocean Heights team, including Founders Kevin O’Grady and Nella Webster, will continue in their roles as part of a long-term, multi-generational succession plan. Current Ocean Heights partners Kevin Barlow, Danielle Bronner and Kara Devar will become shareholders in Mariner. Barlow will lead Mariner’s expanded Newport Beach footprint.

The agreement was signed in December of 2024, with the transition becoming effective on April 1, 2025.
