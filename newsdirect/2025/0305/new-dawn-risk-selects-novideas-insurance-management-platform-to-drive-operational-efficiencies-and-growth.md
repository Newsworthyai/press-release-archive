# New Dawn Risk selects Novidea’s insurance management platform to drive operational efficiencies and growth

Novidea announces that New Dawn Risk has selected its cloud-native, data-driven insurance management platform to streamline operations, drive sustainable growth across the business, and better serve its customers. New Dawn Risk has also invested in Docomotion’s (a Novidea company) document generation solution to further enhance operational efficiency and deliver an improved client experience.

New Dawn Risk is an independent specialist Lloyd’s insurance broker, focusing on professional and financial lines and cyber. They work with retail and wholesale insurance brokers in the United States and internationally to provide expert solutions for complex and unique risks.

Adopting Novidea's insurance management platform marks a major step forward for the broker. Its end-to-end capabilities will enable New Dawn Risk to optimise every aspect of the broking lifecycle, from initial inquiry to quotation, policy issuance, risk management, and claims handling. The addition of Docomotion streamlines its documentation processes, ensuring seamless document generation and reducing manual effort.

This investment in technology aligns with the specialist broker’s commitment to embracing digital solutions in the London Market, positioning the firm to prepare for Lloyd’s Blueprint Two and other future market initiatives. Coupled with 360-degree reporting on their clients and real-time analytics across the business, New Dawn Risk is primed to deliver greater value.

Connie Dyson, New Dawn Risk's COO, said: “Partnering with Novidea reflects our dedication to innovation and client-centric service. The Novidea insurance management platform, combined with Docomotion, will transform the way we do business, providing invaluable insights, automating critical processes, and ensuring we can more effectively comply with market digital transformation initiatives such as Lloyd’s Blueprint Two and CDR.”

“Our current systems have been curtailing our growth, as they are not fully integrated, slowing down processes and requiring rekeying. Novidea’s platform, alongside Docomotion’s document automation, will not only drive efficiencies but also enable us to report across the business for the first time and pursue growth opportunities from client-data insights.”

Jeff Heine, Chief Revenue Officer at Novidea, stated: “We are very excited to partner with New Dawn Risk on their journey to drive informed decision-making, operational efficiencies, and an unparalleled client experience. Integrating Docomotion into their toolkit will further underscore their commitment to delivering value and innovation to their clients. It is great to see London Market brokers of all shapes and sizes benefiting from the Novidea insurance management platform.”
