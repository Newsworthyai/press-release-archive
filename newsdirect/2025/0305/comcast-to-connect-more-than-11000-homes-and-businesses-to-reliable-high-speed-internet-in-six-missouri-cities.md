# Comcast to Connect More Than 11,000 Homes and Businesses to Reliable, High-Speed Internet in Six Missouri Cities

Comcast is connecting more than 11,000 new homes and businesses in six Missouri communities to reliable, high-speed, symmetrical Internet by expanding its network in the region. The expansion of its network will enhance digital infrastructure, promote economic growth, and position residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The network expansion in Concordia, Harrisonville, Higginsville, Lexington, Napoleon, and Wellington will bring Internet, mobile, entertainment, and security services from Xfinity and Comcast Business to residents and businesses for the first time.

“We are thrilled to welcome Comcast into our local communities,” said Kurtis Gregory, Missouri State Senator District 21. “This expansion ensures residents in these areas will have access to reliable, high-speed Internet. I am excited for the opportunities it will create for education, business, agriculture, and personal growth. Together, we are building a more connected and prosperous future for all and look forward to the positive impact it will have in the coming years.”

This multi-million-dollar expansion into six communities will double Comcast’s existing footprint in Missouri. The new project — which will span more than 300 miles and is planned to be completed by 2027 — brings the company’s total investment in technology and infrastructure in Missouri to nearly $100 million over the past three years.

“Reliable high-speed Internet is essential in today’s digital economy and Comcast is committed to connecting more Missouri families and businesses to the moments that matter most,” said Jennifer Dameron, director, External Affairs, Comcast Midwest Region. “The communities we'll be reaching with this expansion have been eager for better connectivity and choice for a long time, and we're happy to partner with them and meet their needs.”

A Network You Can Trust to be Reliable, Fast and Secure

Comcast’s state-of-the-art network is built to enable residents and businesses to thrive in today’s constantly connected world. These six cities join the 64 million homes and businesses across the country to have access to a network that is trusted by essential community organizations like hospitals, schools, transportation systems and first responders, and federal agencies like the Department of Defense and FEMA. It delivers multi-gigabit Internet speeds, 99.9 percent reliability and security built in from the ground up to keep customers safe from cyber threats.

Introducing Xfinity for Consumers

Comcast’s residential services are marketed under the Xfinity brand, and consumers in these six cities will be able to take advantage of Xfinity’s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and home security. With multi-gigabit Internet speeds, powerful WiFi that reaches every corner of the home, and super-responsive connections with low lag available with its plan, customers have a great experience using their connected devices to stream their favorite sports and entertainment content, video chat with coworkers and friends, learn from home or simply surf the web.

What it Means for the Local Community

Comcast’s commitment to communities goes beyond building the network and aims to increase economic mobility for the local community and its residents.

Lift Zones provide free Internet connectivity and access to hundreds of hours of educational and digital skills content to help families and site coordinators navigate online learning.
