# Direxion Announces Reverse Split of KORU

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable ETFs, has announced it will execute a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Direxion Daily MSCI South Korea Bull 3X Shares (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of this split, except with respect to the redemption of fractional shares, as outlined below.

After the close of the markets on February 7, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows:

Fund Name

Reverse Split Ratio

Approximate decrease in total number of outstanding shares

Direxion Daily MSCI South Korea Bull 3X Shares

1 for 10

90%

Please note the CUSIP change, effective February 10, 2025:

Fund Name

Ticker

Current CUSIP

New CUSIP

Direxion Daily MSCI South Korea Bull 3X Shares

KORU

25459Y520

25461A387

As a result of the reverse split, every ten shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately ten-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) on a split-adjusted basis on February 10, 2025.

The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-ten reverse split anticipated for the Fund:

The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners.

Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split

As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NYSE Arca. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

“Odd Lot” Unit

Also, as a result of the reverse splits, the Fund may have outstanding one aggregation of less than 50,000 shares to make a creation unit, or an “odd lot unit.” Thus, the Fund will provide one authorized participant with a one-time opportunity to redeem the odd lot unit at the split-adjusted NAV or the NAV on such date the authorized participant seeks to redeem the odd lot unit.
