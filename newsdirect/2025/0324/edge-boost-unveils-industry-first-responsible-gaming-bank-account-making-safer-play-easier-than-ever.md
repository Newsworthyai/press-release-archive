# EDGE Boost Unveils Industry-First Responsible Gaming Bank Account, Making Safer Play Easier Than Ever

EDGE Boost by EDGE Markets, the first banking-as-a-service solution designed to promote responsible gaming in the U.S., announced its official launch today, with an established and quickly growing customer base and a $17.2 million seed funding round. The EDGE Boost debit card, which has been live in stealth mode for three months, has already processed $300 million in transactions and is reshaping how bettors manage their finances in the gaming ecosystem.

EDGE Boost successfully closed a seed funding round of $17.2 million in late 2024. Bullpen Capital led the funding round with participation from Step Stone Group, Suro Capital, Impulsum Ventures, Mantis VC, Indicator Ventures, and other strategics. In addition, EDGE Markets has raised $32 million in debt to capitalize their financial platform.

The legal U.S. gaming market has struggled to find a responsible gaming solution that is both easily adopted by users and independent from operators. Sportsbooks, iGaming operators and brick-and-mortar casinos have implemented measures to encourage safer betting habits, but their influence is limited to activity happening within their online platform or physical property.

EDGE Boost redefines responsible gaming with a dedicated debit card and bank account, allowing bettors to separate their gaming transactions from everyday finances. By providing a clear, consolidated view of their betting bankroll, EDGE Boost empowers users to make more informed financial decisions. The EDGE Boost bank account is FDIC-insured up to $250,000*, providing financial security, while all user data is safeguarded on a private, encrypted platform. EDGE Boost users are already using the card for transactions across all major digital gaming platforms, without any fees or integration required for operators.

"EDGE Boost is revolutionizing responsible gaming, giving players the power to take full control of their betting finances like never before. Our innovative card and platform provide the tools needed to engage with gaming safely and sustainably. Operators can only see part of the picture when it comes to a bettor’s financial habits — EDGE Boost changes that by acting as an independent, all-encompassing solution to bridge this critical gap," said Seni Thomas, Founder and CEO of EDGE Boost. "With our team’s deep expertise across the betting industry and beyond, we're excited to deliver a responsible gaming solution that is already making an impact with bettors everywhere."

Key features of EDGE Boost include the following:

1. Personalized Spending Limit Suggestions – EDGE Boost will assess users’ cash flow and recommend tailored betting limits for each user to put into place for themselves.
2. Financial Transparency – A separate bank account allows for a clear overview of betting expenses, helping bettors stay in control of their gaming budgets.
3. Cashback Incentives – EDGE Boost rewards users with cash back for qualified spend with gaming merchants.
4. Frictionless, Instant Betting – Compatible with almost any gaming platform, allowing bettors to deploy funds instantly.
5. No Minimum Balances or Maintenance Costs – EDGE Boost has no usage costs and only generates revenue when customers use the card.
6. FDIC-Insured, Secure Platform – Accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000*, the first betting-only bank account to provide this level of security.

EDGE Boost is redefining the role of monetary management in gaming. The card and platform are available now for users nationwide. For more information, please visit www.edgeboost.bet.
