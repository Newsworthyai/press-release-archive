# BioLumic Launches World's First Commercial Light-Activated Seed Traits

BioLumic, the world’s only company programming seed traits with light, has launched its first commercial Trait Activation System at Gro Alliance’s seed production facility in Cuba City, Wisconsin. This milestone brings the BioLumic proprietary light-based Genetic Expression Trait (xTrait™) technology to the global seed industry, enabling new opportunities for enhanced crop performance.

With this launch, BioLumic delivers a breakthrough in crop science—introducing a novel, natural approach to trait innovation that is faster, more scalable, and more cost-effective than traditional biotech traits. For the first time, seed companies can integrate light-programmed traits that enhance genetic expression into elite inbreds and hybrids, unlocking a new frontier in crop improvement without the constraints of genetic modification.

Following third-party field validation and demonstration of trans-generational trait inheritance to hybrid progeny, BioLumic light-activated traits are now being integrated into a broad portfolio of partner inbred corn lines. Multiple seed companies are licensing this novel technology, with commercial hybrid traits anticipated for the 2026 planting season.

“This launch represents a major step forward for seed companies seeking a new category of traits – traits that enhance natural genetic expression rather than altering the genome,” said Steve Sibulkin, CEO of BioLumic. “We’re delivering an entirely new way to program crop traits and accelerate breeding cycles—traits that are fast, economical, and scalable.”

A New Model for Seed Innovation

The BioLumic xTrait™ platform uses UV light to regulate genetic expression—without genetic modification. This scalable, chemical-free approach enhances growth, vigor, composition, and resilience while eliminating the costly regulatory hurdles of GM traits.

Seed companies can license BioLumic Genetic Expression Traits that are matched to their genetics and integrated into parent lines. As the first commercial partner of BioLumic, Gro Alliance will execute the trait activation process. It offers a full suite of seed cleaning, treating, and packaging capabilities, allowing Gro Alliance to receive seed as bulk or cleaned seed.

Breeder Direct is commercializing xTraits for several inbred lines in its expanding portfolio, with commercial hybrid traits anticipated to become available later this year.

“We see this as a leap forward in seed innovation,” said Marc Neuman, Director of Sales and Product Development at Breeder Direct. “BioLumic’s technology enhances yield and beneficial characteristics in our latest germplasm, which unlocks new value for seed companies and farmers alike.”

Field Trials Confirm Significant Yield Gains and Trait Heritability

BioLumic light-activated traits have been validated across a diverse range of partner genetics in over 6,000 plots, consistently demonstrating:

• More than 20% avg yield gain in multiple untreated hybrid lines (trait pass-through from activated parent lines)

• +6.1 bushels per acre yield increase (+8.2%) in more than a dozen activated inbreds

• Increased establishment traits such as germination, seedling vigor, and uniformity

Unlike traditional GM and gene-editing approaches, the BioLumic’s platform bypasses long development and regulatory timelines and high costs, cutting trait commercialization time from 10+ years to just 3 years, while reducing costs by up to 90%.

Expanding the Future of Crop Innovation

While corn represents the first commercial launch, the xTrait Platform is already expanding into rice, ryegrass, and soybeans through funded partnerships. Beyond these crops, over 10 new traits are in the discovery phase, advancing the next frontier of light-activated xTraits. This expansion unlocks opportunities to enhance yield stability, stress resilience, and crop nutrition in markets that increasingly demand non-GM, climate-smart solutions.

“This technology is designed for speed, scalability, and impact,” added Sibulkin. “By unlocking new genetic expression potential, we’re ensuring a future where adaptable, high-performing traits are not just widely accessible but ready to tackle today’s challenges—without waiting a decade for solutions.”

Founded in 2013, BioLumic is a New Zealand and U.S.-based agricultural biotech company that programs plants and seeds with light to unlock growth, quality and health. The company's Light Signal Recipe™ platform combines biological data, plant science, and genetic marker knowledge to mediate genetic expression with a one-time application of light signals. BioLumic's Light Treatments are scalable and require no chemical application, genetic modification, facility expansion or large input costs. Programming Plants with Light.
