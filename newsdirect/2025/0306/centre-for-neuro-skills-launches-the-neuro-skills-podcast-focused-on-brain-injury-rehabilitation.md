The Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS) has launched the “Neuro Skills Podcast,” a new series that delves into the latest trends, research and inspiring stories behind the transformative power of brain injury rehabilitation.

Debuting on YouTube and Spotify on Monday, March 3, in recognition of Brain Injury Awareness Month, this weekly video series features real-life recovery stories and expert insights on cutting-edge brain injury therapies. The podcast aims to deepen understanding of brain injury rehabilitation and its life-changing possibilities.

Hosted by CNS CEO and President David Harrington—a licensed occupational therapist and Certified Brain Injury Specialist with more than 30 years of experience—the podcast will feature conversations with industry leaders, brain injury survivors and experts in post-acute rehabilitation. Notable guests include CNS founder Dr. Mark Ashley and key figures in neurorehabilitation, who will share their expertise and personal experiences.

“Brain injury rehabilitation is a journey of resilience, innovation and hope. Through the ‘Neuro Skills Podcast,’ we aim to shed light on groundbreaking therapies, share real recovery stories and provide valuable insights from experts in the field,” says David Harrington, President and CEO of Centre for Neuro Skills and podcast host. “Our goal is to empower patients, families and healthcare professionals with the knowledge and inspiration they need to navigate the path to healing.”

Episodes:

Episode 1 (available now): A Place of Healing: The Story of CNS

When Dr. Mark Ashley’s brother, Steve, became disabled after a devastating event in 1972, conventional rehabilitation therapy gave no hope for recovery. Dr. Ashley, Founder of CNS, made it his mission to find a way for Steve to regain his independence through post-acute rehabilitative care. His recovery became the model for CNS’ ongoing philosophy of practice and our belief that patients don’t plateau, and every brain injury survivor deserves a place to heal and regain independence.

Episode 2 (March 10, 2025): Heart Health is Brain Health Pt. 1

Most people don’t know that strokes are brain injuries. This episode explores the connection between heart health and brain health – an often-overlooked aspect of stroke prevention and recovery. Tune in as David Harrington, President and Chief Executive Officer of CNS, and Chris Persel, Regional Director of Clinical Services, Director of Behavior Programming at CNS, dive into key statistics, discuss stroke prevention methods, and explain treatment options that help stroke survivors rebuild their lives and regain independence.

Episode 3 (March 17, 2025): Heart Health is Brain Health Pt. 2

Recovery from a brain injury is a lifelong personal journey. David Harrington, President and Chief Executive Officer of CNS, and Chris Persel, Regional Director of Clinical Services, Director of Behavior Programming at CNS, continue their discussion on the importance of engaging patients in rehabilitation through individualized treatments and enriched environments.

Episode 4 (March 24): Resilience and Renewal After a Brain Injury

How do emotions impact recovery? David Harrington, President and Chief Executive Officer of CNS, and Dr. Gary Seale, Regional Director of Clinical Services at CNS, talk about the significant role that positive emotions play in patient recovery. This episode explores the benefits of being in a positive emotional state: ability to process information quickly and accurately, boost to the immune system, and there’s a less likely chance to trigger the flight or fight response that can lead to risk factors for stroke.

Episode 5 (March 31): A Doctor Becomes the Patient: Stroke Survivor Story

An unexpected stroke not only impacted Dr. Petersen’s motor skills, but it also changed the way he views the patient experience. A loving father with a background in pediatric emergency medicine, Dr. Petersen overcame physical, emotional, and cognitive deficits during his stroke rehabilitation journey, finding a renewed sense of purpose when he returned to work. In this episode, Dr. Petersen shares his journey from physician to patient and sheds light on the transformative power of rehabilitation.

Produced in collaboration with the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its “Live Fierce campaign,” the “Neuro Skills Podcast” reflects CNS’s commitment to advancing neurorehabilitation and heart health. Through this partnership, CNS and the AHA aim to provide critical information to stroke patients and the broader community, reinforcing the connection between brain health and cardiovascular well-being.
