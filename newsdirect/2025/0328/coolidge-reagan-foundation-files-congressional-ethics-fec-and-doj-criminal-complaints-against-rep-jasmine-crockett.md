# Coolidge Reagan Foundation Files Congressional Ethics, FEC, and DOJ Criminal Complaints Against Rep. Jasmine Crockett

The Coolidge Reagan Foundation (CRF), a First Amendment watchdog, has filed a series of complaints against Representative Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), alleging serious ethical and legal violations, including voter intimidation, fraudulent campaign contributions, and misconduct in office. The complaints, simultaneously submitted to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), and the Department of Justice (DOJ), expose Rep. Crockett’s alleged illegal activities and efforts to undermine fair elections and democratic processes.

“Rep. Crockett’s reckless rhetoric and open encouragement of political violence are not only unacceptable but dangerously irresponsible, stated Shaun McCutcheon, Chairman of the Coolidge Reagan Foundation. “While I am an advocate for Free Speech, the fact is no Member of Congress should be inciting attacks on American voters. You can’t call on your supporters to attack people any more than you can yell fire in a crowded theater. Her actions must be condemned and investigated.”

“This is a blatant abuse of power and a direct assault on free and fair elections,” Dan Backer, Counsel to CRF added. “From voter intimidation to potentially fraudulent campaign financing, Rep. Crockett’s conduct raises serious legal and ethical concerns. The American people deserve accountability, and Crockett must answer for her unethical, potentially criminal, and just plain dirty acts.”

The complaint filed with the Department of Justice highlights Rep. Crockett’s alarming rhetoric and online activity, which appear to violate the Federal Voting Rights Act prohibiting voter intimidation. On March 9, 2025, Crockett circulated an animated video through social media depicting a cartoon version of herself and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brutally attacking a Republican voter. This video, broadcast to hundreds of thousands of her followers, not only condones but seemingly encourages political violence against Republicans. Her public statements, including referring to "full-on combat," further demonstrate a pattern of incitement that places American voters at risk.

CRF is calling on the DOJ to investigate these actions under 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b) and other applicable federal statutes.

CRF's complaint to the FEC details an apparent scheme in which Rep. Crockett’s campaign committee, ‘Jasmine for US’, accepted and falsely reported contributions processed through ActBlue. The filing reveals that an elderly retiree, Mr. Randy Best of Plano, Texas, was listed as making over 2,500 contributions totaling more than $21,000 – including more than 50 to Crockett (transactions that Mr. Best’s wife denies ever occurred).

The sheer volume and pattern of these donations suggest an elaborate money-laundering scheme orchestrated through ActBlue to funnel illegal contributions to Democratic candidates, including Rep. Crockett.

CRF demands an immediate FEC investigation into these violations of 52 U.S.C. § 30122, which prohibits accepting contributions in the name of, or with the funds of, another.

In addition to potential criminal and campaign finance violations, CRF has also filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, asserting that Rep. Crockett has engaged in behavior that fails to reflect creditably on the U.S. House of Representatives. Her public threats against Republican officials, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and former President Donald Trump (paired with the incendiary video) constitute a clear violation of House Rule XXIII, which mandates ethical conduct by Members. Furthermore, her acceptance of potentially fraudulent contributions through ActBlue raises serious concerns about her fitness for office and adherence to congressional financial disclosure requirements.

Shaun McCutcheon further emphasized the seriousness of the complaints stating “Congresswoman Crockett’s actions are a disgrace to the office she holds. Inciting violence against political opponents and engaging in fraudulent campaign finance practices are violations that cannot be ignored. CRF will not stand idly by while elected officials break the law and erode trust in our institutions.”

Dan Backer added “We have seen a disturbing trend where ActBlue is used as a willing conduit for a potentially 8 or 9 figure sum of illegal campaign money laundering, and Rep. Crockett’s campaign is just one example. The FEC must investigate this apparent scheme to launder funds in the names of unsuspecting donors. Additionally, her rhetoric and public statements demand a full review by the DOJ for potential voter intimidation violations.”

CRF calls for swift action to hold Rep. Crockett accountable and protect the integrity of our democratic process. The news of these complaints was first reported by Fred Lucas in the Daily Signal.
