# Direxion Adds Boeing & Exxon Mobil to Single Stock Daily Leveraged & Inverse ETF Lineup

Direxion, a leading provider of ETFs for tactical traders, and a pioneer in Single Stock Daily Leveraged & Inverse ETFs, expanded its suite of high-powered trading tools with the launch of four new funds tracking the performance of The Boeing Company (BA) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). These funds provide traders with amplified, or inverse, exposure to BA or XOM via the Direxion Daily BA Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: BOEU) and Direxion Daily BA Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: BOED), or the Direxion Daily XOM Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: XOMX) and Direxion Daily XOM Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: XOMZ).

“Active traders thrive on the catalysts these two headline-heavy stocks provide, to include recent tariff-related news,” said Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion. “For Boeing, it may be regulatory announcements, airline orders and production issues, while for Exxon it could be crude oil prices, associated demand fluidity and geopolitical moves. These ETF pairs provide the focused exposure active traders seek to express their short-term convictions on both."

Designed for active traders, Direxion’s pairs of Single Stock Leveraged & Inverse ETFs are built for short-term trading − not long-term investing. These ground-breaking trading tools are intended for experienced traders with a high risk tolerance. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these products track the price of a single stock rather than an index, offering no diversification benefits.

All Direxion leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center, where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if leveraged and inverse ETFs – including single stock ETFs – are right for you.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in BA or XOM.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in a Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund's investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning.

Leverage Risk – The Bull Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. A total loss may occur in a single day. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund’s correlation with BA or XOM and may increase the volatility of the Bull Fund.

Daily Correlation Risk - A number of factors may affect the Bull Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with BA or XOM and therefore achieve its daily leveraged investment objective. The Bull Fund’s exposure to BA or XOM is impacted by BA or XOM’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bull Fund will be perfectly exposed to BA or XOM at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bull Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to BA or XOM increases on days when BA or XOM is volatile near the close of the trading day.

Daily Inverse Correlation Risk - A number of factors may affect the Bear Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of inverse correlation with BA or XOM and therefore achieve its daily inverse investment objective. The Bear Fund’s exposure to BA or XOM is impacted by BA or XOM’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bear Fund will be perfectly exposed to BA or XOM at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bear Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to BA or XOM increases on days when BA or XOM is volatile near the close of the trading day.

The Boeing Company Investing Risk - Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The Boeing Company faces risks associated with commercial airlines, including demand for commercial aircraft and related services and commercial airlines sales contract terms; adverse government regulations; regulatory compliance costs; supply chain and manufacturing disruptions; litigation and government inquires and investigations; changes in U.S. government defense spending or priorities; among other risks.

Aerospace and Defense Industry Risk - The aerospace and defense industry can be significantly affected by government regulation and spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services.

Industrials Sector Risk - Stock prices of issuers in the industrials sector are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for industrials sector products in general.

Exxon Mobil Corporation Investing Risk – Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. Exxon Mobil Corporation faces risks associated with supply and demand of commodities, political instability and the potential for significant changes in the regulatory environment; general economic conditions and the related impact on demand; ability to maintain and grow production of oil and gas products; the inherent risks and hazards associated with the crude oil and natural gas industries; among other risks.

Oil and Gas Industry Risk - Companies in the oil and gas industries are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or services and for energy products in general.

Energy Sector Risk - Energy sector securities may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, global supply and demand, and capital expenditures on the exploration and production of energy sources.

Additional risks of each Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, and Cash Transaction Risk. Additionally, for the Direxion Daily BA Bear 1X Shares and Direxion Daily XOM Bear 1X Shares, Shorting or Inverse Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of a Fund.
