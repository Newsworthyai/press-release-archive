# Silexion Therapeutics Collaborates with Multi Billion Dollar Clinical Development Player, Advancing Revolutionary Cancer Treatment Toward Clinical Trials

Silexion Therapeutics' (NASDAQ: SLXN)* groundbreaking RNAi therapy showing 70-80% tumor reduction takes major step forward with global manufacturing collaboration; Wall Street analysts reportedly maintain $5 price target representing potential 500% upside as company targets $470B precision medicine market

Game-Changing Partnership AnnouncementIn a strategic move that significantly advances its revolutionary cancer treatment pipeline, Silexion Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SLXN) announced today a collaboration with global therapeutics giant Catalent to optimize and manufacture its breakthrough KRAS-targeting therapy SIL204. This partnership represents a critical acceleration toward human clinical trials, expected to begin in the first half of 2026.

The collaboration will leverage Catalent's state-of-the-art Limoges, France facility—a European center of excellence for complex biologics formulation—to optimize both systemic and intratumoral delivery formulations of SIL204, supporting Silexion's innovative dual-route strategy targeting both primary tumors and metastases.

"Our collaboration with Catalent represents a significant advancement in our SIL204 development program," said Ilan Hadar, Chairman and CEO of Silexion Therapeutics. "Catalent's expertise in complex formulation development will be instrumental as we work toward our goal of initiating human clinical trials in the first half of 2026."

Disrupting the "Undruggable": Silexion's Breakthrough Approach to KRAS MutationsSilexion's technology stands at the frontier of precision oncology, targeting KRAS mutations—long considered the "holy grail" of cancer targets and present in over 90% of pancreatic cancers. While competitors have developed small molecule inhibitors that target only specific KRAS mutations (primarily G12C, found in just 1-2% of pancreatic cancers), Silexion's RNA interference approach silences multiple KRAS mutations at the genetic level.

Recent preclinical data revealed SIL204's remarkable efficacy across multiple pancreatic cancer models:

* 70% reduction in tumor burden in AsPC-1 models (KRAS G12D mutation)
* Significant dose-dependent tumor reduction in Panc-1 models (KRAS G12D mutation)
* 80% tumor reduction in BxPC-3 models

Most critically, for the first time, Silexion demonstrated SIL204's ability to reduce metastatic spread to secondary organs—a game-changing advancement that could transform treatment paradigms for aggressive pancreatic cancer.

Dual-Route Strategy: A Comprehensive Attack on CancerSilexion recently unveiled its expanded development plan for SIL204, integrating both systemic administration for targeting metastatic progression and intratumoral delivery for attacking primary tumors—a comprehensive approach unique in KRAS-targeted therapies.

The orthotopic models used in Silexion's breakthrough studies better represent human pancreatic cancer biology by allowing tumors to develop in their native environment. This stands in contrast to subcutaneous xenograft models, where tumors grow beneath the skin rather than in the organ of origin.

This expanded approach is supported by SIL204's demonstrated ability to maintain therapeutic levels for over 56 days from a single administration—an unprecedented achievement in RNAi therapeutics.

Massive Market Opportunity in Precision OncologyThe partnership with Catalent positions Silexion advantageously within the rapidly growing precision medicine market, projected to surge from $102 billion in 2024 to $470 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 16.5%. Within this broader market, KRAS-driven cancers represent a substantial unmet need, with the market for KRAS inhibitors expected to grow at an impressive 36% CAGR, reaching $10 billion by 2032.

Recent years have seen unprecedented consolidation in precision oncology, with big pharma aggressively seeking innovative assets:

* Pfizer's landmark $43 billion acquisition of Seagen in 2023
* AbbVie's $10.1 billion purchase of Immunogen
* Numerous other multi-billion dollar transactions for targeted oncology assets

With major pharmaceutical companies collectively holding over $170 billion in cash reserves, according to reports, the M&A environment remains highly favorable for innovative companies developing breakthrough cancer therapeutics.

Wall Street's Bullish Outlook: Over 500% Potential UpsideWall Street analysts appear to recognize Silexion's potential, with Maxim Group maintaining a Buy rating and a $5 price target—representing a remarkable premium of over ~500% from today's pre market price . This seemingly bullish stance reflects confidence in Silexion's differentiated technology, promising preclinical data, and clear strategic roadmap.

Silexion's partnership with Catalent adds credibility to its development roadmap, which includes toxicology and pharmacodynamic studies throughout 2025, regulatory submissions to the Israel Ministry of Health in H2 2025 and the European Union in H1 2026, and the initiation of human clinical trials in 2026.

A Potential Industry Game-Changer to WatchSilexion Therapeutics stands at a pivotal moment in its development journey. With groundbreaking preclinical data demonstrating efficacy against both primary tumors and metastases, a clear strategic roadmap to clinical trials, and now a global manufacturing partnership with Catalent, the company is positioned at the intersection of high unmet medical need and significant market opportunity.

As pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest malignancies with a dismal five-year survival rate below 13%, Silexion's innovative approach targeting multiple KRAS mutations could represent a transformative advancement in treatment paradigms—potentially reshaping the landscape for one of oncology's most challenging diseases.

For investors seeking exposure to next-generation precision oncology, Silexion represents a unique opportunity to participate in the development of a potentially disruptive technology addressing one of medicine's most significant challenges.
