# BridgeFT and iCapital® Launch New Portfolio Data Management Solution for Wealth Managers

BridgeFT, a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company, and iCapital[1], the global fintech platform driving the world’s alternative investment marketplace for the wealth and asset management industries, announced today a first-of-its-kind partnership to deliver a comprehensive data solution across all asset classes for the wealth management industry, including RIAs, wealth management firms and TAMPs.

As financial advisors navigate increasingly complex and diversified portfolios across a wide spectrum of public securities, private market investments, structured investments and annuities, and direct, off-platform investments—accessing, standardizing, and analyzing comprehensive data has become a significant challenge. This partnership directly addresses that challenge with a unified, scalable, and intelligent solution designed to empower advisors by providing a complete view of client portfolios across asset classes and spanning thousands of positions on and off iCapital’s platform.

“Increased appetite for alternative investments is driving demand for a comprehensive view of client investments. iCapital is at the forefront of creating a standardized industry framework that optimizes the entire alternative investing experience, and we are thrilled to be partnering with the iCapital team on this data initiative,” said Dave Hagen, BridgeFT’s Chief Commercial Officer. “Our work together emphasizes our commitment to being a true technology enabler for advisors, making it easier for them to gain access to critical total wealth data to further enable differentiation and accelerate growth.”

iCapital’s Alternative Data Management service leverages machine learning and AI to provide timely and accurate data retrieval, transformation, validation, and delivery to any downstream reporting system. Combined with BridgeFT’s ability to consolidate custodial and transactional data across public market platforms, the new solution is designed to give advisors unprecedented insight into portfolio performance, risk, liquidity, and allocation strategy.

“Our partnership with BridgeFT reflects our commitment to providing innovative data solutions and an enhanced advisor and client experience,” said Dan Vene, Co-Founder and Co-Head of iCapital Solutions. “By continually evolving our data solutions, we strive to enable advisors to work more efficiently, access real-time data, make smarter decisions, and deliver superior service with a focus on what truly matters – guiding clients toward their financial goals with confidence and clarity.”

iCapital is the latest partner to be added to BridgeFT's WealthTech API Marketplace, which offers the wealth market direct access to a curated group of partners reshaping wealth management technology with API-first data and application services that are pre-integrated with BridgeFT’s WealthTech API infrastructure. BridgeFT’s Marketplace aims to accelerate, simplify, and reduce the cost of wealth management application development and maintenance.
