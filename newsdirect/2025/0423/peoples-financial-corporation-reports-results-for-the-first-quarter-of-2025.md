# PEOPLES FINANCIAL CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

Peoples Financial Corporation (the “Company”)(OTCQX Best Market: PFBX), parent of The Peoples Bank (the “Bank”), announced earnings for the first quarter ending March 31, 2025.

First Quarter Earnings

Net income for the first quarter of 2025 decreased $1,105,000 to $1,310,000 compared to net income of $2,415,000 for the first quarter of 2024. The earnings per weighted average common share for the first quarter of 2025 were $0.28 compared to earnings per weighted average common share of $0.52 for the first quarter of 2024. Per share figures are based on weighted average common shares outstanding of 4,617,466 and 4,661,686 for the first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The decrease in net income for the first quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of $1,025,000 to $5,668,000 for the first quarter of 2025 compared with $6,693,000 for the first quarter of 2024. Total interest income decreased by $1,370,000 to $7,559,000 for the first quarter of 2025 as compared with $8,929,000 for the first quarter of 2024 due to lower interest income on securities caused by a decrease in balances and yields. Total interest expense decreased by $345,000 to $1,891,000 for the first quarter of 2025 as compared with $2,236,000 for the first quarter of 2024 due to lower interest rates paid on deposit accounts and lower borrowing costs.

Return on average assets for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, decreased 0.50% to 0.62% compared to 1.12% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company’s efficiency ratio increased 13% to 77% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to 64% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Asset Quality

“The Bank’s leadership remains committed to maintaining high-quality assets. We are closely monitoring economic conditions and staying vigilant for any potential changes in interest rates,” said Chevis C. Swetman, chairman and chief executive officer of the Company and the Bank.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity increased by $4,454,000 from $90,001,000 at December 31, 2024, to $94,455,000 at March 31, 2025. The improvement in shareholders’ equity was mainly due to quarterly earnings of $1,310,000 through March 31, 2025. The Company also experienced a decrease of $3,144,000 in unrealized losses on securities in 2025. The Company reported $34,862,000 and $38,006,000 in unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. These unrealized losses are presented in accumulated other comprehensive income for the respective periods. The cause of the unrealized losses has primarily resulted from higher interest rates that have impacted the current market value of available for sale securities. The unrealized losses are not related to any credit deterioration within the portfolio. The Company has maintained strong liquidity and continues to do so; therefore, the Company does not foresee a sale of any affected securities that would cause the realization of these losses by the Company as part of net income in the near future.

The Bank’s leverage ratio has not been impacted by these unrealized losses on available for sale securities due to an optout election previously made by the Bank in accordance with current regulatory capital requirements and therefore remained strong at 13.32% as of March 31, 2025.

Liquidity

The Company maintains a well-capitalized balance sheet which includes strong capital and liquidity. The Bank provides a full range of banking, financial and trust services in our local markets. The majority of the Bank’s deposits are fully FDIC insured. The Company evaluates on an ongoing and continuous basis its financial health by preparing for various moderate to severe economic scenarios.

As interest rates have increased and the cost of attracting new deposits and replacing deposit attrition has increased, the Bank experienced an increase in its cost of funds during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025 total deposits have increased $31,261,000 to $751,991,000 from $720,730,000 as of December 31, 2024. This is mainly due to an influx of public fund tax deposits during the first and last quarters of 2025 and 2024 that were slowly allocated by the public accountholders throughout the year.
