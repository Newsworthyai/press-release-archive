# Rothsay Consulting Integrates AI to Advance Wealth Management & Investment Strategies

Rothsay Consulting, a leading wealth advisory firm with offices in Hong Kong and Luxembourg, has announced the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its financial services and investment operations. This forward-thinking move marks a significant step toward smarter, faster, and more customized wealth solutions for its global clientele.

Earlier this week in Singapore, Rothsay’s leadership held meetings with top-tier AI firms to explore how intelligent technologies can enhance core offerings such as financial planning, investment strategies, and retirement solutions. These discussions are part of Rothsay’s preparation for active participation in the upcoming AI Asian Summit, May 27–29, 2025, where the firm aims to explore new collaboration opportunities.

"Integrating AI into our business is not just a trend — it’s a long-term commitment to efficiency, accuracy, and client-first innovation," said Archie Campbell, Head of Private Clients. “Our goal is to deliver solutions that adapt to changing markets while safeguarding our clients’ futures.”

To support this shift, Rothsay has welcomed several AI and data analytics specialists to its IT department. These experts will drive the firm’s transition from traditional financial models to AI-powered decision-making — improving analysis, reducing costs, and boosting overall service delivery.

"We believe AI can help us personalize wealth strategies at scale, especially in emerging markets," added James Kelly, Head of Emerging Markets. “This technology will sharpen our risk analysis and deepen our investment insights.”

According to an internal source, the company began planning this transformation in 2024. Since then, AI integration has become a top strategic priority — with efforts already showing promising improvements in client portfolio performance and service efficiency.

Founded in 2007, Rothsay Consulting is known for its high-quality wealth management services, including financial planning, investment portfolios, tax consulting, private trust solutions, and family wealth transfer. With a seasoned executive team and a bold vision, the firm remains committed to helping clients preserve their capital and pursue wise, long-term growth.
