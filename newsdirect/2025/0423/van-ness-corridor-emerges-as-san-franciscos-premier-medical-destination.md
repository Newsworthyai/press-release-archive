# Van Ness Corridor Emerges as San Francisco’s Premier Medical Destination

The Van Ness corridor has become one of San Francisco’s most dynamic medical and healthcare destination, anchored by the world-class Sutter Health’s California Pacific Medical Center and supported by an expanding ecosystem of medical office spaces and care providers.

A highlight of this transformation is the 45,000 square feet of premium medical office space currently available at 939 Ellis St., making it the largest contiguous medical space on the market in San Francisco today. Strategically located just steps away from Sutter’s Van Ness campus, 939 Ellis offers an unparalleled opportunity for medical groups, specialty clinics, and healthcare innovators looking to establish a presence in the city’s fastest-growing healthcare hub.

Ellis’ central location provides convenience for patients commuting from East Bay, the Peninsula, and Marin County. Connectivity to the Van Ness Corridor has never been better with the 2022 launch of the Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit, a 1.96-mile route running north-south featuring dedicated center bus lanes and nine stations.

“The synergy between the neighborhood’s thriving healthcare community and access to transportation is reshaping the Van Ness corridor into a one-stop destination for high-quality patient care,” said Kurt Hackett, Vice President of Asset Management with Rethink Healthcare Real Estate, a private investment group that owns 939 Ellis St. “Whether it’s primary care, outpatient specialties, diagnostics, or wellness services, everything patients and providers need is increasingly concentrated in this central, transit oriented neighborhood.”

The building, which is already about half occupied by Kaiser Permanente, comes to market amid a notable resurgence in San Francisco’s economy as the city positions itself for a boom in AI investments. The increase in business is being further fueled by the return-to-office trend and a growing belief that San Francisco is on the right track, according to recent surveys. Recently elected Mayor Daniel Lurie has spearheaded many new efforts that are working to bring businesses and visitors back to the world class downtown. As demand for centrally located, modern medical space continues to rise, the Van Ness corridor stands out as a focus for San Francisco’s healthcare future.

“We could not be more bullish on this location,” said Jonathan Winer, President of Rethink Healthcare Real Estate. “Not only is San Francisco’s reemergence as a hotbed of business activity a catalyst for those looking to treat patients locally, but the ease of transit has made the Van Ness Corridor a convenient destination for doctors and patients, alike, who are coming from the outskirts of the city or the suburbs.”

939 Ellis St. offers flexible, build-ready medical office suites that can accommodate a range of specialties. It boasts a scenic rooftop terrace and available parking.
