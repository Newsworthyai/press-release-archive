![](https://public.newsdirect.com/595893443/0DN1VYbh.png)

Solana is the home to popular memecoins like Dogwifhat, Bonk, Slerf and many more. Riding high on the high transaction volumes due to the memecoin rush, Solana reached an ATH in January and is already down 30%.

Several of the popular memecoins have lost steam lately, one of them being Bonk. New tokens like Cutoshi ($CUTO), still in their presale, are emerging as strong contenders to their memecoin predecessors on the Ethereum blockchain.

Let’s figure out what makes Cutoshi score over other memecoins like Bonk and why Cutoshi is positioned to be the next titan of the memecoins.

Bonk Losing on Market Cap as well as CommunityThe BONK token saw its initial price drive up, but as the hype faded, Bonk lost its charm among the crypto traders for lack of any substantial utility. Also, there are enough dog memecoins in the market contesting for the same novelty factor DOGE, SHIB, and BABY DOGE enjoyed once.

Bonk has been facing bearish pressure and has lost $1 billion in market cap in a short span of time. On a daily frame, the BONK token has fallen below the 20 EMA and 50 EMA lines, reinforcing the bearish mood. Bonk has been continuously losing volume and traction in its community.

Cutoshi: A Playful Memecoin With Financial Use CasesCutoshi has a unique standing among the league of current memecoins that survive on hype and FOMO. Cutoshi is a practical alternative. Its presale is one of the safest, given it is a community-supported investment using a case-driven memecoin on Solana.

It is inspired by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the Chinese Lucky Cat, which represents good fortune.

Cutoshi’s ecosystem highlights: Cutoshi’s ecosystem is replete with a multi-chain DEX where you can swap tokens at a small fee of 0.25%. You can also engage in yield farming and contribute to liquidity pools to earn transaction fees as $CUTO token rewards.

NFTs and Education: Cutoshi also houses a learning academy where learners can read advanced resources in exchange for $CUTO tokens.

Tokenomics: The total supply of $CUTO tokens is 440 million. The supply is designed to be deflationary via 7% strategic burns.

Why Should You Invest in Cutoshi Presale and Give Bonk a Goodbye? Successful presales like Hyperliquid have shown strong community-driven growth. Cutoshi follows a similar approach with 55% of its supply allocated to presale.The Hyperliquid token jumped by 140% right after its presale.

Cutoshi has a whopping 55% token supply dedicated to its presale and 10% for farming rewards. $CUTO is highly undervalued, given its utility-driven approach to memecoins. Cutoshi, all in all, is a people’s token.

With the developments of the Cutoshi Wallet and DEX way ahead of schedule, the team has decided to fast-track the presale. Instead of 10 stages there will now only be 6, which means that only 2 stages remain before the launch.
