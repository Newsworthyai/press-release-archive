# Revenue Management Solutions and Norton Creative Partner Transform Restaurant Menus

Hospitality experts Revenue Management Solutions (RMS) and Norton Creative are redefining menu strategy through a powerful partnership of experience, technology and know-how. Combining RMS’ menu analysis with remote eye-tracking technology and Norton’s menu design, the two industry leaders are helping restaurants optimize their menus for consumer engagement and profitability.

RMS’ advanced eye-tracking software analyzes how consumers interact with digital menus, capturing gaze patterns and time spent on menu sections. Heat maps reveal what grabs potential diners’ attention. Norton Creative uses the information to design engaging menus that strategically showcase the most profitable items. With rapid testing available, menu information can be ready in as little as a week, ensuring maximum impact.

“Restaurant brands need a menu that does more than list items — it has to guide the guest experience and influence purchasing behavior,” said RMS VP of Consulting for North America Justin Pridon. “With today’s consumers dining out less, an optimized menu can be the difference between lost sales and long-term loyalty.”

According to a recent RMS survey, half of respondents dine out less frequently than before COVID-19. Additionally, younger generations and families have increased their reliance on digital ordering, underscoring the need for menus that function effectively across all platforms.

“Restaurant brands are focused on how to get the most sales and profit out of their existing menu without changing customer favorites,” said Norton Creative Chief Client Officer Sara Harding Lou. “We use data to inform design that supports a restaurant company’s business objectives, whether it’s focused on improving margins, increasing profitability or bringing the brand promise to life.”

Four leading restaurant brands are currently testing Norton and RMS-designed menus. The teams are onboarding many more, demonstrating how strategic menu evolution can boost profitability without relying solely on price increases.

“With this data-driven approach, brands are seeing a real impact,” Pridon added. “By integrating technology with smart design, we’re helping restaurants turn their menus into powerful revenue drivers.”
