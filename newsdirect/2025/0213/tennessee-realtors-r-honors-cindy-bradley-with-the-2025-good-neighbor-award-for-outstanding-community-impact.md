# Tennessee REALTORS® Honors Cindy Bradley with the 2025 Good Neighbor Award for Outstanding Community Impact

Tennessee REALTORS®, the state chapter of the National Association of REALTORS®, proudly announces Cindy Bradley, broker and owner of Signature Homes Real Estate in Knoxville, as the recipient of its 5th Annual Good Neighbor Award. This prestigious honor recognizes REALTORS® who excel in their profession and make a profound difference in their communities through volunteer service. The award includes a $5,000 grant to support the recipient’s preferred philanthropic organization.

Bradley was recognized for her tireless work with Sacred Grounds Hospice House, a Knoxville-based nonprofit she founded in 2017. Inspired by her personal experience with hospice care during her husband’s illness and passing, she established Sacred Grounds to provide compassionate, expert care for individuals facing life-limiting illnesses and to offer vital support to their families. To date, the organization has assisted over 600 families. Bradley currently serves as President of the Board of Directors.

“I’m deeply honored to receive this year’s Good Neighbor Award and grateful for the grant, which will directly support Sacred Grounds Hospice House in providing compassionate end-of-life care to those in need,” said Bradley. “This recognition is not just for me but for the incredible team and volunteers who make our mission possible. Together, we’re ensuring that individuals and their families receive dignity, comfort, and support during life’s most difficult moments.”

Tennessee REALTORS® President Will Sliger praised Bradley’s commitment to her community, stating: “Cindy Bradley exemplifies the heart of a REALTOR—dedicated not only to serving clients but also to strengthening communities. Her work with Sacred Grounds Hospice House is a testament to the impact that real estate professionals can have beyond the industry. We are proud to recognize her as this year’s Good Neighbor Award recipient and to support her mission of care and compassion.”

The $5,000 grant from Tennessee REALTORS® will help Sacred Grounds Hospice House expand its services, ensuring more families receive the compassionate care they deserve.
