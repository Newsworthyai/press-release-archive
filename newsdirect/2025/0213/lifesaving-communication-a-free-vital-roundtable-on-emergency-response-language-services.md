In critical moments when lives are on the line, clear and immediate communication can mean the difference between chaos and resolution. The American Translators Association (ATA) invites professionals across emergency response, crisis management, law enforcement, the media, health care, education, and the language services industry to a groundbreaking event: Best Practices in Emergency Response Language Services.

This event is already drawing nationwide attention. Considering the recent onslaught of global crises such as floods, wildfires, epidemics, terrorism, mass shootings, airline crashes, and beyond, the majority of us at home, work, or play may need to respond to an unexpected crisis at any time.

Three Essential Perspectives, One Transformative Discussion

This 90-minute, high-impact event approaches emergency response language services from three unique but interconnected vantage points:

* Providers of emergency language and communications services – the trained professionals delivering real-time interpreting, translation, and general communication assistance during high-stakes situations.
* Recipients of these services – individuals and communities relying on linguists to navigate crisis and emergency situations.
* Essential players bridging the gap – first responders, law enforcement, dispatchers, teachers, and even astronauts who depend on linguists and other professional communicators for seamless, lifesaving connection.

Meet the Experts Shaping the Future of Emergency Language Access

Our distinguished panel brings together professionals who have stood on the front lines of crisis communication:

* Rhode Thomas, a seasoned interpreter and cultural mediator who interpreted on the ground during Hurricane Helene as well as for the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement after a school shooting, will share firsthand insights on bridging language barriers in emergency medical, legal, and social service settings.
* Aaron Kubey, a FEMA employee and certified Deaf Interpreter, will discuss how accessibility measures are transforming disaster response, including real-world applications of ASL in crisis situations.
* Sergeant Clarence E. Stokes III, a 32-year veteran of the Pennsylvania Capitol Police and active shooter instructor, will explore crisis response tactics and how language professionals can assist in high-risk law enforcement encounters.
* Anh Pham, an interpreter for President Obama during his 2016 Vietnam visit, will discuss the intense preparation and political stakes involved in high-profile, international language services.
* Marjorie "Ocho" Kouns, a multilingual enhanced 911 (e911) Dispatcher in Atlanta, will reveal the challenges behind emergency calls and the urgency of accurate communication in 911 dispatch.
* Chantal Kamgne, an expert in localization and community language equity, will discuss the impact of cultural awareness in emergency translations and crisis communication.
* Liliana Trujillo, a bilingual medical professional, will speak to the critical need for linguistically and culturally sensitive communication in patient care and emergency health scenarios.
* Moderated by Bridget Hylak, CT, CI, MTC, a globally recognized language industry expert and communications strategist.

Key Discussion Points:

* What are the fundamental factors that ensure effective language access in emergency response services?
* How can first responders, law enforcement, educators, health care providers, and the media collaborate with linguists and other professional communicators to improve accuracy and efficiency in crisis communication?
* What role does cultural sensitivity play in building trust and ensuring compliance with diverse communities?
* How do professional interpreters and translators handle high-pressure situations—such as natural disasters, active shooter incidents, or international crises—while maintaining composure and clarity?
* When is technology a help or a hindrance in emergency translation and interpreting?

A Rare Opportunity to Learn, Prepare, and Connect

Panelists will not focus solely on AI or language technology, though emerging tools will be addressed. Instead, this roundtable will tap into the depth of each participant’s experience, highlighting the techniques, connection, demeanor, preparation, composure, and human expertise it takes to handle these life-or-death situations well, regardless of the methods used.

Attendees will leave with actionable insights on:

* Best practices for emergency language services in law enforcement, medical, educational, and corporate disaster response - and beyond.
* Practical strategies for handling high-pressure, high-stakes encounters with confidence.
* Regulatory and ethical considerations in high-stakes response scenarios.
