# Ethereum is Losing The Gas Fee Battle, Users Look for Alternatives As Cutoshi Presale Gains Massive Hype

Ethereum has the biggest DeFi ecosystem in the blockchain space, yet it breathes heavily whenever there’s congestion. However, memecoins like Cutoshi ($CUTO), which is still in its presale, might invert the sober sentiment on the ERC-20 blockchain from that of a tussle to that of fun and hustle.

Why Ethereum is Losing The Gas Fee Battle Ethereum can process 10-15 transactions per second, which causes transactions to become expensive. Though gas fees have come down by 90% after the Dencun upgrade last year, the vision of scalability and cost efficiency is far from achievable.

On the other hand, leadership tussles in the Ethereum Foundation are causing investors to lose confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. The Pectra upgrade is the only silver lining in alleviating gas fee issues. Ethereum users mostly use L2s to transact with Ethereum, but with the onset of sub-ecosystems like that of Cutoshi’s ($CUTO), things might take a U-turn.

Cutoshi: The People’s Coin With Financial Incentives Born and brought up on Ethereum, Cutoshi derives its name from the world-famous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the Chinese Golden Cat for Goodluck. Like Bitcoin, Cutoshi is an innovation trying to change how memecoins are perceived.

The $CUTO token is designed to be deflationary, with 7% strategic burns in place and a supply of 440 million tokens. Over time, the token will become more valuable as it gets scarcer. On the other hand, Ethereum has no cap on its supply. It is an inflationary token. The project only has 2 more stages left in the presale before the project launches onto the market.

Community-wise, Cutoshi has a win-win case scenario. As a community, you get 55% of the token supply plus 10% of the supply, which is reserved for yield farming rewards. Even the heavily successful Hyperliquid presale had an allocation of 31%.

The presale is a big opportunity for traders to benefit in never-seen ways from a memecoin. While you dwell in Cutoshi’s adorable memes, you can access 8,000 NFTs reserved for early investors. The presale allows users to buy $CUTO tokens for as little as $0.031.

Moreover, Cutoshi’s financial incentives range from yield farming opportunities to quests. The ecosystem has multi-chain DEX, where users can swap tokens for 0.25% fees. This fee goes to the users who contribute to the DEXs’ liquidity pools.

Make Heed Before $CUTO is out of Your Means. Cutoshi's motto is simple: be fun while providing the community with enough earning opportunities. The company has a clear roadmap: beginning with the presale and audits, yield farming incentives will start immediately, followed by the DEX launch and buyback program. By 2031, Cutoshi aims to establish an online store and engage in many meaningful partnerships.

Away from all the hype-driven, illiquid memecoins, Cutoshi’s long-term plans make it a far better contender than any other memecoin on ver-saturated chains like Solana.
