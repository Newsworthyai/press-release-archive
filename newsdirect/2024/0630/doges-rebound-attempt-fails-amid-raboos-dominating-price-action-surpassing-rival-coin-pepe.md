# DOGE’s Rebound Attempt Fails, Amid Raboo’s Dominating Price Action Surpassing Rival Coin Pepe

The cryptocurrency market is expanding, but so is the volatility. On one hand we have Dogecoin on a bullish trend, on the other hand we have Pepe on a bearish trend. Raboo, a new AI meme coin has appeared with loads of amazing features. Raboo is still in its presale and has raised over $1.6 million, which is very impressive. Analysts expect the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to grow 233% during presale and 100x on launch day. Keep reading to find out more.

DOGE attempts to validate bullish patternDogecoin is presently trading in a bullish wave. But the coin may not be able to maintain the pattern to start meaningful price climb, if investors do not take control. The dynamics around DOGE are being keenly watched by the market. This is because changes in its price could have an impact on the altcoin market as a whole.

The distribution of Dogecoin's supply among its holders is showing a noticeable shift, which could lead to additional declines in the meme coin's price that'll be presented on a daily chart.

The shift in ownership of DOGE mid- and long-term investors to short-term holders raises questions over the stability of the altcoin price. The amount of DOGE held by short-term holders has increased significantly over the last month. It has increased from 10.5 billion DOGE to 13.4 billion DOGE. This noteworthy expansion emphasizes the growing tendency toward short-term trading activity, which may increase market volatility.

Pepe: bulls struggle to recover from downward trendPepe is down by 27% from its all time high in May this year, however, some traders think the coin could become victorious, especially if Bitcoin’s BTC/USD performance picks up.

A recent deal was released by Binance, for cryptocurrency users who want to earn PEPE coins simply by buying and holding PEPE for increased interest rates. Users can get rewards if they send at least $0.01 using Binance Pay for the first time. With this promotion, cryptocurrency users can win up to 100 million PEPE coins.

The price of PEPE coins has been dropping lately. PEPE saw a 7.84% decrease in value following the announcement of Binance Pay's offer. Investors are switching to Raboo since the PEPE coin price prediction does not yet present any advantages.

Satoshi, a popular crypto analyst, detailed in a tweet the wave patterns he observed on the Pepe chart and predicted a wave of 3 candles. He also suggested that there might be a mirror wave 2 retracement before the green candle happens. The altcoin price still has a chance of going bullish and even breaking it all time high. But only patient enough investors will witness this.

Raboo grabs investors attention with 100x potential Raboo ($RABT) is a popular new meme coin that is making waves in the market as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), demonstrating why ICOs are fantastic avenues for making investments. Raboo's initial coin offering (ICO) offers investors the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge initiatives from the very beginning.

By incorporating artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and content creation, Raboo sets itself apart from other meme coins. Raboo stands out in the competitive meme coin market thanks to its AI-driven strategy, which also highlights the company's potential for significant expansion and influence in the cryptocurrency field.

By taking part in the Raboo presale, investors will become a part of a ground-breaking initiative that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to reimagine the meme coin genre, providing a special fusion of community, technology, and entertainment. Raboo’s presale is now underway, with tokens available at $0.0048, analysts say $RABT can easily explode 100x by the time it hits the markets this year.

Conclusion Between the rise of Dogecoin and Pepe's price, Raboo is standing out as the best crypto to invest in this year. Meme coins are now making noise, becoming the money makers of the crypto market. Raboo is very affordable, giving the opportunity for anyone to join in. Small risk for a great reward. Even though it is yet to launch, Raboo has aimed to be a top 20 coin and it is currently on the right path.
