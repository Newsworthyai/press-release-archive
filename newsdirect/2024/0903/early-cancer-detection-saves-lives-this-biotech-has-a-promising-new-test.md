Bill Caragol, CFO of Mainz BioMed (NASDAQ: MYNZ), was recently a guest on Benzingaâ€™s All-Access.

Mainz BioMed, maker of clinical laboratory tests, says it is committed to saving lives and reducing healthcare costs through early disease detection and prevention. For cancer and chronic conditions, patients can now live longer, healthier lives thanks to advances in diagnostic technology.

Genetic and genomic tests are at the forefront of this progress. By revealing patients' unique genetic profiles, these tests can allow doctors to tailor treatments more effectively, ushering in an era of personalized medicine.

Caragol spoke about promising data from recent trials.
