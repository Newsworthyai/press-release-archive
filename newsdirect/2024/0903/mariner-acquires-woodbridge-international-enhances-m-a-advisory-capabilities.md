# Mariner Acquires Woodbridge International, Enhances M&A Advisory Capabilities

Mariner, a national wealth advisory firm, today announced its acquisition of New Haven, Conn.-based Woodbridge International, a leading middle-market mergers and acquisitions firm. This acquisition significantly bolsters Mariner’s position as a comprehensive financial advisory firm, deepening its expertise in sell-side M&A advisory services.

Woodbridge, which is known for its innovative approach to sell-side M&A transactions and its extensive experience across a wide range of industries, brings over 30 years of expertise and a team of seasoned professionals to Mariner. The acquisition will enable Mariner to offer enhanced M&A advisory services to its clients, leveraging Woodbridge’s global reach and industry-specific knowledge.

“The integration of Woodbridge International into the Mariner family marks a transformative step in our mission to deliver comprehensive, client-focused financial services,” said Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner. “Woodbridge’s impressive history of successful transactions and its commitment to client-centric solutions align seamlessly with our core values. This acquisition enables us to broaden our service offerings, empowering our clients to navigate the complexities of M&A with greater confidence and precision.”

Woodbridge has built a reputation for delivering exceptional results for its clients, focusing on maximizing value through innovative marketing strategies and a deep understanding of market dynamics. With offices in New Haven, CT and Cape Town, South Africa, Woodbridge is equipped with a global database of 8,400 private equity groups and 410,000 strategic companies. Woodbridge casts one of the widest nets in the industry, quickly identifying the greatest number of buyers.

"For our team, joining forces with Mariner opens up incredible avenues for growth," said Robert Koenig, CEO of Woodbridge International. "We now have a clear path to potentially double our business within the next few years. By expanding our offerings, we can cultivate idle leads and provide more value to clients than ever before. This is an exciting time for Woodbridge, especially as we aim to capture the anticipated wave of baby boomer business exits."

Both Mariner and Woodbridge are united by a shared commitment to making a meaningful impact on the clients they serve. This cultural alignment is at the heart of the acquisition, enabling Mariner to enhance its service offerings at a time when 35% of financial advisors are expected to retire over the next decade and $17 trillion in small businesses are projected to be sold in the next 20 years. This acquisition strengthens Mariner’s ability to support its 1,200 business owner clients, particularly during key business transitions.

The acquisition was finalized on August 30, 2024, and the integration of Woodbridge’s team and operations into Mariner’s existing structure is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Woodbridge International will maintain its current offices and continue to operate under its established brand for a period of time, ensuring continuity for its clients and employees.
