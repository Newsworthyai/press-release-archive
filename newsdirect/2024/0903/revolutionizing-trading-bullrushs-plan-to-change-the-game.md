Traders eager to sharpen their skills now have the chance to do so while competing for cash prizes with a new trading platform that blends the excitement of fantasy sports with trading. With its gamified, interactive environment offering multi-asset trading competitions, trivia tournaments and other challenges, BullRush is changing the game for traders of all levels.

Launched in beta on July 10, the platform has already attracted over 13,700 traders from more than 150 countries. Those participating in this testing phase can contribute to the platform’s development by exploring BullRush’s cutting-edge features, which include live market simulation, advanced strategy testing and interactive dashboards that let you monitor your performance, track rankings and analyze your competitors.

Even during the beta phase, testers can win real prizes in competitions, as well as earn XP and climb the leaderboard. Participants will also be able to talk with other traders through the BullRush Discord channel, sharing strategies and getting feedback. BullRush plans to release an in-platform chat in the future to make communication even easier.

The full version, which launches on September 9, will include daily, weekly and monthly trading competitions in asset classes like forex, crypto, futures and CFDs. Some of these will be free to take part in, while others will require an entry fee, with prizes depending on the entry fee and the number of participants. It will also offer free-to-enter trivia competitions, where traders can win cash prizes and XP, as well as trading challenges that give them a chance to win double the entry fee.

To help traders hone their skills, the company also plans to launch BullRush Academy, which will be available to all BullRush traders. This will include a library of trading courses and videos, as well as expert trade analysis of your past trades. Traders will also have the opportunity to fine-tune their strategy in practice arenas and free-to-enter trading games.

Trade, Compete, WinTrading competitions are not exactly new, with some prop firms and brokers running their own versions of them, so what makes BullRush different?

The primary concern many have with most trading games is that they are single-round contests with limited rules, where the winner is the trader with the highest percentage return. What this means is that anyone could catch a lucky trade and get a huge return that wins them the game.

To ensure that only the best traders win, BullRush has developed multi-round tournaments, similar to the format used in sporting events such as sports World Cups or the Olympics. In BullRush tournaments, traders progress through anywhere from 2 to 12 rounds until a winner emerges.

For example, in the first BullRush competition held in July, a total of 5,246 participants were divided into four groups for the first round. After a week of trading, the top 25 traders from each group advanced to the Championship Round, where the top 100 traders competed to be crowned the first BullRush Tournament Champion.

To help promote the official launch of Bullrush on September 9, the company is running a multi-asset trading competition where 100 traders will share a total prize pool of $10,000. If you think you’ve got what it takes to take home the prize, you can sign up for it here.

Whether you trade FX, indices, metals or crypto, BullRush offers an excellent environment to test strategies, learn from others and enjoy the thrill of a gamified trading competition.
