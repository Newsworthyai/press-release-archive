# Warren Buffett Sued by Shareholder Who Was Arrested at 2023 Shareholders’ Meeting for Raising Bill Gates/Jeffrey Epstein Issue

--News Direct--

National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) has filed a federal lawsuit in Omaha against Berkshire Hathaway and its Chairman, Warren Buffett. The lawsuit, seeking monetary damages, stems from actions taken by the company during last year's shareholders’ meeting where NLPC Chairman Peter Flaherty raised the issue of the reputational risk to the company posed by Buffett holding the posts of both Chairman and CEO. Flaherty cited Buffett’s strong public identification with Bill Gates, and Gates relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

Flaherty had his microphone cut, was ejected from the arena and was arrested. Charges against Flaherty were quickly dropped by the local prosecutor.

Flaherty is scheduled again to speak tomorrow at the Berkshire shareholder’s meeting in support of NLPC's proposal that Berkshire disclose the risks of its investments in China.
