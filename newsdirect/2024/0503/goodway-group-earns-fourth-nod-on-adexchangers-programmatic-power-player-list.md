# Goodway Group Earns Fourth Nod on AdExchanger’s Programmatic Power Player List

--News Direct--

Goodway Group, a leading independent digital marketing agency, has been recognized as one of AdExchanger's 2024 Programmatic Power Players, solidifying its position as a top agency and strategic partner in the ad tech industry. The prestigious accolade highlights Goodway Group's exceptional digital media expertise, comprehensive offerings and proven track record of delivering results for clients worldwide.

Selected from a competitive pool of submissions, Goodway Group stood out for its innovative solutions, advanced capabilities and documented case studies highlighting funnel impact and revenue growth. AdExchanger's editors rigorously evaluated each entry, considering the strength and breadth of offerings, talent and new business wins.

"We’re honored to be named among AdExchanger's 2024 Programmatic Power Players," said Stephani Estes, Chief Media Officer at Goodway Group. "This recognition underscores our commitment to buying excellence for our client's media investment to drive measurable, bottom-line impact. We're proud to be recognized for our efforts in pushing the boundaries of programmatic advertising and delivering value in an ever-evolving digital landscape."

As reported by Statista, programmatic buying methods account for 82% of all digital spending worldwide. This figure is projected to climb even higher, reaching 89% by 2029, highlighting the growing importance and dominance of programmatic advertising in the entire industry. There’s often a misconception that programmatic advertising is simply display ads. Some of the fastest-growing channels, retail media, social media and CTV, rely heavily on programmatic buying.

In addition to Goodway Group’s Programmatic Power Player recognition, Goodway Group's CEO, Jay Friedman, is a leading advocate for transparency and integrity in advertising. His bylines and commentary regularly appear in top industry publications such as Digiday, The Drum and MediaPost. Moreover, he's actively democratizing programmatic buying best practices, ensuring they're accessible to all marketers. His and Dr. Augustine Fou’s recent groundbreaking research on programmatic waste, for example, culminated in our "Once and For All" white paper, an acclaimed resource that offers practical solutions to minimize ad waste and maximize results.

"At its core, programmatic advertising is simply an automated, data-driven approach to delivering brand messages to consumers," said Friedman. "Marketing is the true growth engine for organizations. Embracing creativity within a scientific approach is important because doing programmatic – or any marketing – well requires this balanced methodology.”
