# Resource Mining Corp delivers high-grade copper-gold grades at Mpanda

--News Direct--

Resource Mining Corporation Ltd (ASX:RMI) director Trevor Matthews joins Proactive to discuss high-grade copper-gold results from ongoing exploration at the Mpanda Project in Tanzania. Significant findings include rock chip samples with up to 6.97% copper and 17.97 g/t gold, and 6.93% copper with 6.54 g/t gold, collected from the Kabungu copper anomaly. Additionally, channel sampling at the Stalike anomaly showed promising results, including 1 metre at 2.3% copper, part of a 5-metre section averaging 1.13% copper. Two auger drill holes at Ndogo anomaly also indicated mineralised copper values, with samples including 1 metre at 0.20% and 0.21% copper. This supports the potential significant resource, as the copper anomaly extends over 5 kilometres along strike. Matthews highlights the positive impact of these results on defining further exploration and exploitation opportunities within the extensive tenement package. He expressed confidence in developing significant copper-gold projects in the near future, driven by robust copper and gold markets. Further exploration plans include more drilling and detailed geological mapping, particularly in the Mpanda Ndogo anomaly. This ongoing work aims to refine the understanding of the mineralisation and prepare for future resource development. The results so far affirm the presence of copper-gold mineralisation linked to the soil anomalies previously identified.
