# 23 years after the September 11 attacks, the anniversary of 9/11 has become an inspiring symbol of unity in a deeply polarized America

Over the past 23 years, the 9/11 Day nonprofit has successfully transformed the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks into the largest annual day of service in American history, now recognized under federal law.

But it’s accomplished far more than that.

9/11 Day has turned the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance into a remarkable symbol, and practical expression, of national unity in America.

For 9/11 this year, more than 30 million Americans are expected to participate in the 9/11 Day observance. Some will volunteer through local non-profits, faith-based groups, or their employers. Some will make donations to charities of their choice, and many others will simply spend part of the day in remembrance of those lost, engaging in their own expressions of service and kindnesses.

They will be joined by thousands of corporations, nonprofits, schools, elected officials, and others that will remember and pay tribute by recreating, in some measure, the extraordinary spirit of compassion and service that arose in the nation in the days and weeks following the 9/11 tragedy.

“There’s no better way for all Americans to honor those killed and injured on 9/11, and the many who rose in service in response to the attacks, than for all of us and our governmental leaders to put aside our differences for at least a day and join together in unity to help others in need,” said David Paine, president and co-founder of 9/11 Day.

Jay Winuk, executive vice president and 9/11 Day co-founder, lost his younger brother Glenn Winuk in the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center. Glenn, an attorney and volunteer firefighter and EMT, was killed in the line of duty when the World Trade Center South Tower collapsed.

“Like so many first responders, Glenn dedicated his life in service to others,” Winuk said. “That kind of compassion and dedication is inspirational to many. When we engage in good deeds and acts of service, it demonstrates the best in us, brings us together as human beings, and represents an ideal way to mark the anniversary of 9/11, now and in the future.”

9/11 Day: America’s “Day of Doing Good;” Meal Packs Staged in 21 U.S. Cities

This September 11, more than 30,000 volunteers are expected to take part in 9/11 Day’s annual signature service projects, known as “Meal Packs for 9/11 Day,” which have expanded in 2024 to 21 cities across America.

At these large-scale projects, volunteers will collectively assemble more than eight million non-perishable, shelf-stable meals for Americans at risk of hunger. All of the meals will be donated to local Feeding America-affiliated food banks serving these communities in observance of September’s “Hunger Action Month.”

These service events are supported in part by a federal grant from AmeriCorps, the federal agency that oversees the nation’s volunteer service initiatives.

More than 500 corporations are participating in this year’s 9/11 Day Meal Pack across the nation. Together with many other employers that also mark 9/11 through volunteerism, 9/11 Day has evolved to become the largest single day of corporate volunteer engagement in America.

9/11 Day’s Meal Pack projects will be held this year in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Nashville, New York City, Philadelphia (in partnership with the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles), Phoenix, San Jose, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa and Washington, DC.

Teaching 9/11 to a New Generation, Through Service

With nearly 100 million Americans having been born since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, 9/11 Day has continued to provide students with meaningful and inspiring ways to learn not just about the 9/11 tragedy, but about the spirit of unity that arose in America, and throughout the world, in response to the attacks.

“This year we are delivering a brand new set of free educator lessons and activities, aimed at giving teachers the tools they need to inspire service in their classrooms and communities on September 11,” Paine said. These new materials are now available free of charge at 911day.org/teachers.

With grant funding from AmeriCorps, 9/11 Day is also supporting service activities for college-age students. In partnership with 11 college campuses across the country, students will pack nearly one million meals for those in need in their local communities. 2024 grantees include Boise State University, Illinois State University, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Monroe College, Morgan State University, Otterbein University, Capital University, Denison University, Ohio Wesleyan University, SUNY Oneonta, The Ohio State University, University of New England, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of South Dakota, and UNG - University of North Georgia.

Also with funding from AmeriCorps, 9/11 Day is providing more than $200,000 in grants supporting three outstanding organizations — Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the National Youth Leadership Council, and the Young Men's Service League - YMSL. Together, these organizations will involve over 3,200 youths across 60 events nationwide.  AmeriCorps funding also is being provided through 9/11 Day to several 9/11-related organizations, including the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, World Cares Center, and Voices Center for Resilience. Close to $100,000 is being allocated to support service, remembrance and disaster preparedness projects of these organizations.

The 9/11 Day nonprofit, founded in 2002, led the successful efforts in 2009 to formally establish September 11 under federal law as an annually recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance as part of the bi-partisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. September 11 is now the largest annual day of charitable engagement in U.S. history. For more information, contact 9/11 Day at info@911day.org.
