# Kite Hill PR Releases PR Playbook for Retail Media Networks

Kite Hill PR, an award-winning, agile tech PR agency with deep expertise in serving adtech and media clients, today announced the launch of “The PR Playbook for Retail Media Networks,” a comprehensive guide that outlines effective communications strategies for new players in the category, including an overview of communications channels and tactics for leveraging earned media.

The retail media network (RMN) industry is booming. According to eMarketer, US omnichannel retail media ad spend will total nearly $60 billion in 2024, a growth of 28.6% YoY. As more and more retailers navigate how a media network may fit into their business goals and strategy, Kite Hill PR’s playbook was created to help brands create and execute a PR strategy aimed at driving awareness of new players in retail media.

“With ten-plus years of experience in creating and leading innovative public relations campaigns for adtech, marketing and media businesses, we are sought after media relations experts in this category and look forward to supporting both established and new players in the space as they carve out their niche and unique growth path ,” said Tiffany Guarnaccia, CEO and founder of Kite Hill PR. “The playbook was designed with the modern marketer in mind, and is another resource to help brands leverage communications to navigate competitive and rapidly evolving landscapes.

The playbook outlines four crucial steps to developing an external communications plan, including:

1. Addressing your go-to-market and launch strategy
2. Leveraging always-on communications
3. Prioritizing and developing thought leadership content, and
4. Leveling up earned media and owned events

Kite Hill PR launched in 2013 as an adtech PR specialist agency and has since expanded its practice areas to include media & entertainment, climate tech, enterprise tech, and more. Kite Hill PR’s deep understanding of the current landscape has given the agency the expertise to help brands create the external communications elements needed for developing overarching sales and marketing plans when introducing an RMN.

The PR Playbook for Retail Media Networks is part of a growing list of resources Kite Hill PR has developed to help brands navigate and execute communications strategies. Earlier this year, the agency released its first e-book, “Mapping Your Career Constellation,” as a modern-day guide to mentorship.
