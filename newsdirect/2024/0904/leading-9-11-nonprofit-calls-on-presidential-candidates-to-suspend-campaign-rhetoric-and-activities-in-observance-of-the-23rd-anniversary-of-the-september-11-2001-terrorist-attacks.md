# Leading 9/11 Nonprofit Calls on Presidential Candidates to Suspend Campaign Rhetoric and Activities in Observance of the 23rd Anniversary of the September 11, 2001, Terrorist Attacks

9/11 Day, the respected nonprofit that founded and organizes the federally recognized September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, has written to the campaigns of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, requesting that they voluntarily suspend for September 11 all political advertising and campaign-related social and traditional media activities, in favor of nonpartisan expressions of service, unity and prayer. Responses to the request remain pending.

“9/11 Day,” as the national observance is commonly known, has grown into the nation’s largest annual day of charitable engagement, with more than 30 million Americans participating each year.

9/11 Day originally established the “9/11 Campaign Moratorium” in 2004 to honor the 9/11 victims and their families, first responders, recovery workers, members of our military, and others who rose in service in response to the attacks. Since then, the 9/11 Campaign Moratorium has been widely supported by all major political parties and many candidates.

“In the weeks immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, our nation found its footing in great measure because of the extraordinary spirit of unity that brought us all together as Americans,” said David Paine, president and co-founder of 9/11 Day. “We weren’t Red States or Blue States. We were the United States, and we were all Americans. As we once again approach the anniversary of 9/11, we respectfully request that candidates running for elected office remember this remarkable moment of national unity, and pledge to observe the traditional moratorium on campaign-related activities for 9/11.”

“Of this we ask our political leaders and candidates, especially those running for president: ‘Please demonstrate, at least on this one day, that you will join with millions of Americans in unity by putting politics aside and coming together as Americans,” said Jay S. Winuk, co-founder and executive vice president of 9/11 Day. Winuk’s brother Glenn J. Winuk, an attorney and volunteer firefighter and EMT, died in the line of duty in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

“Together, let’s honor those lost and injured on 9/11, and those who rose in service, by doing good deeds on this day. Let’s focus not on political and other differences but rather on our common humanity. Leave those battles for another day.”

In 2009, the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama formally recognized September 11 as an annual National Day of Service and Remembrance under federal law as part of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.

Dear President Trump:

In observance of the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the federally-recognized September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance (“9/11 Day”), we respectfully request that your campaign, consistent with well-established tradition, voluntarily pause all political advertising, and limit other campaign- or partisan-related appearances and social and traditional media activities on September 11, 2024, between the hours of 6:00 a.m., and 9:00 p.m.

As you may know, this Campaign Moratorium for 9/11 was originally established in 2004 by our nonprofit with widespread support from the 9/11 community. Since then, virtually all major U.S. presidential candidates, including you, have respectfully observed this important tradition, as have many other candidates seeking public office at the federal, state and local levels.

In lieu of traditional campaign activities on September 11, we encourage you and your campaign staff to engage in activities of a non-partisan nature that promote national unity and allow the Americans to remember and pay tribute on 9/11 without political distraction. These activities can include volunteering, prayer, supporting charities, and/or other forms of service and remembrance of your own choosing that honor the 9/11 victims, rescue and recovery workers, and members of our military who rose in service in response to the attacks on our nation, while helping to bring our country together again.

We would greatly appreciate it if a member of your staff can let us know of your plans to observe the 9/11 Campaign Moratorium this year. Your staff can reach us at the email addresses below, or by calling us at 949-233-0050.

Thank you for helping America keep the promise to "Never Forget."

Best wishes,

David Paine
