As companies seek fresh strategies to improve investor relations, fintech firm TiiCKER brings a new way to drive long-term value with its innovative shareholder perk platform. Offering companies tailored perk and loyalty programs, TiiCKER’s platform promises to be a powerful tool to foster deeper connections between companies and their investors.

A recent survey carried out on behalf of TiiCKER reveals the untapped potential of shareholder perks and how they can deepen brand loyalty and encourage proxy voting.

The Power Of Shareholder PerksThe age of apps and e-commerce has made loyalty programs a staple in the retail space, driving customer engagement and boosting sales. Recognizing that investors are also consumers, TiiCKER has taken this concept and applied it to the stock market.

The study, conducted by market research firm The Harris Poll, surveyed 2,073 adults and more than 950 individual investors. It found that 78% of retail investors are more likely to buy stock in a company that offers shareholder perks than a company that doesn’t. However, not many investors are even aware of such loyalty programs, with only 35% saying they knew of any publicly traded companies offering perks or product discounts to their shareholders.

Another of the study’s key findings is that shareholder perks do much more than just attract new investors – they also encourage long-term investment. Of the investors surveyed, 4 in 10 said they would hold shares longer if they qualified for any shareholder perk. Furthermore, nearly half of respondents said they would hold shares longer if perks improved based on how long they have been shareholders. This can help companies in multiple ways – research carried out by FCLT Global found that companies with a significant long-term shareholder base tend to see positive outcomes, such as higher returns on invested capital and greater allocation toward value-creating investments like R&D.

Proxy Voting Participation: A Key Metric Of EngagementIn addition to attracting long-term investors, shareholder perks can also play a big role in increasing proxy voting participation. In TiiCKER’s survey, 76% of investors said they would be more likely to vote their proxy if they received shareholder perks or product discounts. This is a win-win situation, as increased participation benefits companies and helps them capture information more efficiently while giving investors a say in company decisions. A significant 73% of respondents further said that receiving a shareholder perk would make them more confident in the company’s management team.

Unlocking New Avenues For Investor EngagementThe study findings come at a time when retail investor participation in the market has been seeing growth. Despite economic uncertainties, consumer confidence seems relatively strong, and many individuals continue to look to the stock market to reach their financial goals. TiiCKER’s survey reveals that nearly half of adults in the United States own shares in a publicly traded company, with a significant portion of these investors actively seeking new stocks to purchase.

Even more interesting is that non-investors could be drawn to invest in companies that offer perks. The research indicates that half of non-investors would be likely to buy stock if it was a brand they love or if they received a shareholder perk.

TiiCKER is redefining what it means to be a shareholder and helping transform the relationship between investors and the companies they invest in through tangible perks and exclusive rewards. The company’s approach to shareholder loyalty is not just limited to Fortune 500 consumer brands. Whether it's engaging B2B or B2C audiences, TiiCKER can tailor programs for companies of all sizes – from massive household names to microcap entities like Kolibri Global Energy, Inc (NASDAQ: KGEI). These programs are designed to strengthen the bond between the company and its investors, regardless of industry size or focus, ultimately driving both brand loyalty and shareholder value.
