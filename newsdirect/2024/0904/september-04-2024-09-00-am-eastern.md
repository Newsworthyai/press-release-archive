Dr. Ann Childress and Shane Schaffer, Chairman & CEO of Cingulate (NASDAQ: CING), were recently guests on Benzinga’s All Access.

Cingulate is a biotechnology company developing drugs for a range of underserved conditions. The company has developed a proprietary technology called Precision Timed Release™ (PTR™). The technology allows a single pill to contain multiple doses of a drug, relieving the pill burden many people with chronic conditions suffer.

Cingulate says it will be submitting a New Drug Application within a year.
