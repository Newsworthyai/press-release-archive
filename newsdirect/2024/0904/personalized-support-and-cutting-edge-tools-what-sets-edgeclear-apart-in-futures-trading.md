Futures trading is a journey, not just a destination. That’s why choosing a platform on which to trade is just as important as choosing a business partner, as this relationship will play a significant role in your trading journey. One futures broker that seems to stand out from the pack is EdgeClear. We had the pleasure of getting to know EdgeClear recently. Its seasoned management team cares about unleashing every trader’s potential with precision and a personalized touch.

Take their customer reviews, for example. EdgeClear has over 200 reviews on Google and has managed to maintain a five-star rating over a four-year period. With reviewers ranging from novices to advanced traders, high satisfaction is a common thread throughout. Customer reviews are one way for traders to learn about the experiences of their peers. One feature that seemed to take many users by surprise is that EdgeClear assigns a personal broker to every trader, whom they get to know on a first-name basis.

Customers applaud EdgeClear for the team’s knowledge of the industry, reflecting the technical and practical trading experience that the company brings to the table. Customers also praise the education that the EdgeClear team is able to provide on the process, while also addressing any questions that arise.

EdgeClear offers traders a couple of ways to engage with the team, including an online contact form, live online chat or phone support. Customer service is typically responsive, fast and professional.

EdgeClear’s pricing includes features such as high transparency, letting traders know of important developments such as CME market data fee increases, and doing so with zero hidden fees.

EdgeClear’s Platinum offering is a trading service that gives members access to products that are tailored to their individual needs. With features such as competitive commissions, CME membership consultations, access to a VPN or assistance with Direct Market Access while maintaining rapid execution, Platinum has achieved its own subset of positive reviews on the EdgeClear website.

On the regulation side, EdgeClear is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA).

EdgeProX Execution Platform The EdgeProX execution platform gives traders a glimpse into the future of trading. EdgeProX offers features like advanced order flow tools, footprint charts, heat maps and much, much more. Traders have access to a detailed view of market structure and liquidity, paving the way for them to spot opportunities that might otherwise have been overlooked. EdgeProX offers unique customization, allowing you to mold the platform to fit your unique trading style and preferences, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness in your trading operations.

EdgeWatch Analytical Tool Technical analysis is paramount for any futures trader, allowing them to identify trends and respond in a timely way.
