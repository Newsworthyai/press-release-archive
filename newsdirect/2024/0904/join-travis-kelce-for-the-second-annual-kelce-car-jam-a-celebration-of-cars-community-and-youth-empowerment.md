# Join Travis Kelce for the Second Annual "Kelce Car Jam" - A Celebration of Cars, Community, and Youth Empowerment.

Gear up for an exhilarating evening filled with cars, community, and camaraderie at the 2nd Annual Kelce Car Jam taking place on Saturday, October 5, 2024, from 5-8pm CT. This year’s event, held on Walnut Street in downtown Kansas City, promises to be a thrilling block party that perfectly sets the stage for the Chiefs' Monday Night Football game.

Join three-time Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chief teammates as they showcase some of the city’s coolest vintage and luxury cars, including select vehicles from their personal collections. This vibrant event is not just a car show; it's a celebration of community spirit, designed to bring together fans from all walks of life.

Adding to the excitement, the talented kids from Operation Breakthrough Ignition Lab will be joining us to show off some of their automotive work. Operation Breakthrough's Ignition Lab is a state-of-the-art STEM workspace that Travis Kelce helped open and has significantly supported. This lab is designed to provide real-world learning opportunities in STEM for high school students, preparing them for future careers and life. They'll present their impressive automotive projects and offer a taste of culinary delight from their newly refurbished food truck. This initiative, supported by the Eighty-Seven & Running Foundation, underscores Travis Kelce’s commitment to empowering youth through education and opportunity.

The Kelce Car Jam offers fun for all ages with a variety of food, drinks, and activities from our partners: Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers, Travis Kelce’s Kitchen BBQ and Andy’s Frozen Custard. Attendees can choose between two ticket levels: General Admission or VIP. The VIP experience includes intimate access to an exclusive indoor space, complete with food and drinks. Tickets will go on sale starting Wednesday, September 4th and can be purchased at 87running.org.

Don’t miss out on this unique opportunity to experience the magic of Kelce Car Jam, where the love for cars meets the heart of the community. Secure your tickets now and be part of a night to remember!
