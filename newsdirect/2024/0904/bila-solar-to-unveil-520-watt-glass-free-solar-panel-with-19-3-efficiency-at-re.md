# Bila Solar to Unveil 520 Watt Glass-Free Solar Panel with 19.3% Efficiency at RE+

Bila Solar (Bila), the innovative manufacturer of ultralight solar solutions designed to transform and power the world, is set to introduce a groundbreaking new solar panel with a power output of 520 watts (W).

This innovative glass-free panel, weighing just 24.47 lbs and featuring 19.3% module efficiency, will be on display in Booth E10002 at RE+, North America’s largest clean energy event, scheduled for Sept. 10-12, 2024, in Anaheim, California. The product will be manufactured in Indiana, is certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and will be available for sale in early 2025.

“This latest product enables a wide range of installation methods for all types of commercial rooftops, including quick-bonding and removable mechanical mounting – plus it is pre-integrated with mounting hardware and brackets,” said Mick McDaniel, Bila’s VP & U.S. General Manager. “Customers have been asking us for lightweight PV panels that can be mechanically fastened to rooftops. This innovative new panel is a testament to our commitment to advancing solar technology and our dedication to making solar energy more accessible and efficient. With our new Indianapolis facility, we’re poised to bring this groundbreaking solution to market quickly, supporting both sustainable energy and the growth of local economies.”

Product Highlights include:

Lightweight design: Weighs just 24.47 lbs total or 0.825 psf, making it one of the lightest panels on the market.

Versatile installation: Supports multiple installation methods, including roof adhesive and removable mechanical mounting, offering flexibility for different projects.

Advanced materials: Patented composite material reduces light reflection and enables new assembly options, ensuring long-lasting performance.

Durable performance: Guarantees at least 84.8% of nominal output power after 25 years.

High power output: 520 W panel featuring 144 half-cut monocrystalline cells for efficient energy production.

Compact and sturdy: Measures 88.4 in x 48.31 in x 1.59 in and weighs 24.47 lbs, (2246 mm x 1227.8 mm x 40.5 mm and weighs 11.1 kg), with a composite frame and IP68-rated junction box for enhanced durability.
