# Saison Technology Launches HULFT Managed Integration Service Availability in AWS Marketplace

Saison Technology International announced today that its HULFT Managed Integration Service (HMIS) is now available in AWS Marketplace (see listing), a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

HMIS is a fully hosted and managed data integration solution. It provides instant connectivity between employees and the data sources they need to be more productive. In many cases, Saison Technology customers do not have the staff or the budget to manage all their integration projects. Still, they have urgent needs such as improving a business process or boosting topline revenue. For a flat monthly fee, Saison Technology’s professional services team will design, deploy, and manage your data integration needs on a single modern platform with complete enterprise security.

AWS customers will now have access to HMIS, built on the cloud-based HULFT Integration Platform, directly within AWS Marketplace. The HMIS platform provides AWS customers with the ability to solve even the most complex integration challenges without sacrificing ease of use, speed, or agility. Key benefits of the service include:

1. Total customer control and visibility. Even though HMIS is outsourced, Saison Technology provides full visibility via the Global Administrator Console used by business and IT professionals.
2. A foundation to reduce complexity and spur innovation. HMIS provides a path to solve your integration needs today, and we provide the infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with other enterprise systems. No matter what data source and no matter how old it is, our framework makes future projects more doable and more efficient.
3. Simple and predictable billing. Saison Technology provides complete transparency with a mutually agreed-upon monthly price and initial setup fees.

“We are extremely excited about the progression of our relationship with AWS,” said Masa Maruyama, CEO of Saison Technology International. “Our company’s goal is to automate data movement and data integration for our customers, no matter what the resources or staff they have. We believe having HMIS in AWS Marketplace allows us to reach more of AWS’s customers and offer a frictionless experience for managed data integration services.”

Use Cases

Saison Technology customers typically have data located in the most modern SaaS applications and databases that are over 10 years old. The HULFT Managed Integration Service can connect to a wide variety of data stores and data providers whether local, on premises, or in the cloud. Data sources range from text files to Excel spreadsheets, databases, message queues, email servers, FTP servers, web services, ERP, CRM, cloud stores, applications and big data lakes as well as visualizing the data.

A Trusted Team

With more than three decades of helping global companies solve the most complex data integration challenges, the HULFT Professional Services team leverages its best practices through engagements with line-of-business professionals and technical staff. They locate key data sources and transform them into a format that can be consumed by the applications customers choose.
