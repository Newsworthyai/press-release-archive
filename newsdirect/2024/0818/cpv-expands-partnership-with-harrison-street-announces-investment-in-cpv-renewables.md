Competitive Power Ventures Group (“CPV Group”), a leading developer, owner, and operator of utility-scale renewable and low emission electric generation, and Harrison Street, one of the leading investment management firms exclusively focused on alternative real assets with approximately $55 billion in assets under management, today announced that the firms intend to expand their strategic partnership, with Harrison Street executing an agreement to acquire one-third of CPV Renewable Power, LP (“CPV Renewables”), a CPV Group affiliate.

Through this investment, Harrison Street will support and accelerate CPV Renewables’ growing renewable energy development business, which comprises nine operating and under construction projects. Together, these projects total over 700 MW-ac of wind and solar capacity, sufficient to power over 570,000 households. CPV Renewables has also identified a near-term pipeline totaling ~4 GW-ac and consisting of more than 15 wind, solar, and co-located battery storage projects.

“We have a longstanding relationship with Harrison Street and this next step shows the strong commitment from all sides to drive decarbonization efforts forward. This partnership will accelerate the buildout of our 4 GW pipeline of renewable development projects,” said Sean Finnerty, President of CPV Renewables. “By bringing together OPC, CPV Renewables, and Harrison Street, we have successfully formed one of the most formidable renewables businesses in the country. All parties worked seamlessly throughout the execution of this process, and we look forward to building on our partnership for years to come.”

“Our investment in CPV Renewables represents a significant opportunity for Harrison Street to expand our relationship with a trusted partner and support a premier renewable energy platform that can quickly scale within the U.S. power markets”, Carolyn Arida, Senior Managing Director at Harrison Street, added. “Backed by Harrison Street’s industry-leading renewables expertise and CPV’s 25-years of unprecedented success, CPV Renewables is well positioned to capitalize on sector tailwinds and address increasing energy demands across the U.S.”
