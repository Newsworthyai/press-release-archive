American Dream proudly announces the opening of The PAW Patrol Hero Academy, a vibrant and immersive play environment that brings the beloved PAW Patrol series to life inside Nickelodeon Universe, the largest indoor theme park in the Western Hemisphere. This state-of-the-art attraction promises to captivate and inspire young heroes with a variety of interactive experiences and themed adventures.

“Children of all ages love PAW Patrol, and now they can unleash their inner pup by recreating rescue missions from Adventure Bay at American Dream,” said Bryan Gaus, Senior Vice President and General Manager of American Dream. “Through The PAW Patrol Hero Academy, families will create lasting memories as kids interact with Chase, Marshall, Skye, and the entire pup team, learning valuable life skills along the way. This is yet another example of American Dream enhancing our property to provide guests with unique and memorable experiences.”

The academy complements the existing PAW Patrol-themed climbing structures and rescue-play activities already inside the theme park. It features numerous slides, obstacles, interactive play panels and puzzles. Additionally, it introduces new and unique themed zones that recreate this special setting.

Key Features:

• Skye’s Helicopter: This 3D-themed helicopter structure includes motorized rotor blades, offering an authentic and thrilling experience. Children can climb aboard and imagine soaring high above Adventure Bay.

• Fire Station and Police Station: Explore themed zones modeled after the PAW Patrol's headquarters. Climb the Fire Station Tower, slide down the Drop Slide with waterfall lighting, and peek through the colorful window panels that bring these iconic buildings to life.

• Liberty’s Addition: Children can join Liberty, the newest member of the PAW Patrol, on her daring adventures. Experience her special interactive features, including the Liberty Hero Academy Sensor Panel, which lights up and engages with sounds, adding a new layer of fun to the adventure.

The PAW Patrol Hero Academy is for everyone, with accessibility in mind. It includes ADA-compliant structures and transfer decks to ensure that every child can join in the fun. As they say in the show, “no job is too big and no pup is too small.”
