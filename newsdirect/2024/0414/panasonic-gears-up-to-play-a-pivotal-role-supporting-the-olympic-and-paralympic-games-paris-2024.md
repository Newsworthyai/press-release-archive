# PANASONIC GEARS UP TO PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE SUPPORTING
THE OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES PARIS 2024

--News Direct--

Panasonic Connect North America will supply state-of-the-art AV solutions, including professional displays, broadcast production equipment, and projection systems, for the Olympic Games Paris 2024 to be held in France from July 26 to August 11, and the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, scheduled from August 28 to September 8. As a Worldwide Olympic Partner, Worldwide Paralympic Partner, and charter member of The Olympic Partner (TOP) Program, Panasonic will collaborate closely with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Paris Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, and the Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) to provide robust support for event operations.

Aligned with a goal to make Paris 2024 a more sustainable event, Panasonic proposes innovative solutions to the industry’s ongoing labor shortage and the challenges of sophisticated visual expression. Panasonic’s IT/IP Platform KAIROS will deliver video content to large LED screens at almost all competition venues (26 in total), simplifying workflows and streamlining operations by producing content for up to three venues via a single Kairos Core. Additionally, remote cameras will be installed in 29 press rooms. By consolidating simultaneous interpretation at the Main Press Centre (MPC), translation services can be provided from remote locations, reducing the need for travel. These solutions will enhance operational efficiency, addressing hardware and software aspects compared to previous events.

Marking the largest-ever projector deployment in competition venues at the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Panasonic plans to install 130 laser projectors. Among them is the world’s smallest and lightest projector1, which boasts a 40% smaller2 body than previous models. Panasonic’s labor-saving projection technology reduces resource allocation for transport, storage, and installation, reducing the event’s carbon footprint. Furthermore, Panasonic’s recently unveiled Remotely Managed Service will allow operators to manage and monitor large-scale multi-projection systems via the cloud and address potential image misalignment caused by factors such as vibration without being present on the site. Together, these innovations will contribute to the event’s wish for sustainability.

Panasonic has provided AV equipment and services to the Olympic and Paralympic Games for over 30 years, starting from Barcelona 1992. Moreover, in October 2014, Panasonic made history as the first Japanese company to become a Worldwide Paralympic Partner of the International Paralympic Committee, contributing to peace and development in the international community and promoting Para Sport.

With a vision of “Sharing the Passion,” Panasonic helps to convey the drama, tension, and emotion of elite athletic competition to people worldwide through its sponsorship activities. Panasonic wholeheartedly supports the mission of the Paralympic Games to foster an inclusive society for people with disabilities by uplifting Para Sport. We remain dedicated to creating products and services that cater to everyone, including seniors and individuals with disabilities.

1 PT-RQ25K is the world's smallest and lightest among DLP® laser projectors with 16,000 lm brightness or more as of March 2024, according to Panasonic’s own research.

2 Based on a comparison of the approximate mass and external dimensions of the PT-RQ25K (20,000 lm) and PT-RQ22K (20,000 lm) projectors, excluding the projection lens.
