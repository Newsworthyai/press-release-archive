# Acarix announces shares are now being traded on the OTCQB under the ticker ACIXF

Acarix CEO Aamir Mahmood joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news the company has begun trading on the OTCQB Market in the United States, under the ticker symbol ACIXF. This listing complements its existing presence on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market in Stockholm. Mahmood expressed that with the US being Acarix's most important commercial market, this development allows for a broader investor base to participate in the companyâ€™s growth journey.

Acarix specializes in medical devices aimed at rapid assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) at the point of care. The company's flagship product, the CADScor System, is CE-approved and FDA DeNovo-cleared, offering a non-invasive solution to help healthcare providers rule out CAD in patients experiencing chest pain, potentially reducing the need for costly and invasive diagnostic procedures.

The company recently announced a significant reorder of single-use patches for the CADScor System by a primary care clinic in the New Orleans, Louisiana metropolitan area. These patches are integral to the system's operation in evaluating patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. Additionally, Acarix has received a multi-order for the CADScor System from Saving Grace Concierge, which will use it as a diagnostic aid for symptomatic patients in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metro areas. Looking ahead, Mahmood outlined the company's focus on top-line growth, reimbursement efforts with CMS and private payers, and initiating clinical trials. He emphasized the device's potential to save significant healthcare costs and drive commercial success in the US market.
