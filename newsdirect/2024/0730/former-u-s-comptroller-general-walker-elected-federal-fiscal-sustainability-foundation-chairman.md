# Former U.S. Comptroller General Walker Elected Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation Chairman

The Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation (FFSF), a non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to restoring fiscal sanity and sustainability in Washington, D.C., today announced the election of former U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker as its Chairman. Walker and the entire Board are committed to securing a sustainable financial future for America and all Americans by advocating for a Fiscal Responsibility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that is ratified by State Conventions of pledged delegates like the 21st Amendment.

The FFSF Board is comprised of esteemed leaders, including a former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former state Attorney General, distinguished economic scholars, political leaders, and other thought leaders. The foundation’s founder, David Biddulph, tirelessly works to preserve the American Dream for his granddaughters and future generations, free from the burden of a crippling national debt.

“FFSF is empowering citizens to shape our nation's financial future. We're advocating for a Fiscal Responsibility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,” explained David Biddulph. “Traditional attempts to control government growth and debt have failed, making our mission more critical than ever. We are thrilled to have Dave Walker serve as our Chairman in these essential efforts.”

Dave Walker is a seasoned public servant with a distinguished career spanning multiple presidential administrations from Reagan to the current Administration. He has received three Presidential appointments from Presidents Reagan, Bush (41), and Clinton with unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate each time. Walker has served as CEO of three federal agencies, two non-profits, and as a Partner and Global Managing Director for Arthur Andersen. His extensive board and advisory committee experience includes Social Security and Medicare, the United Nations, the Defense Business Board, and No Labels.

Article V of the Constitution provides a pathway for change through a Convention of States, initiated by two-thirds of the states and ratified by three-quarters of the states. Despite the support of more than 34 states beginning in 1979, Congress has failed to act. Consequently, FFSF is pursuing legal action against Congress to compel action and is seeking a legislative fix introduced in Congress last year (H.C.R. 24) to mandate that Congress fulfill its Article V obligations.

“The ticking federal debt bomb threatens our collective future. Failure to act will have serious adverse consequences for our economic security, national security, international standing, and domestic tranquility over time," Walker said. A Constitutional amendment is the only way to force current and future Congresses to restore fiscal sanity and sustainability."

"The federal government just passed $35 trillion in debt, up from $5.7 trillion in 2000 and less than $1 trillion in 1979. Washington has lost control of the nation’s finances. It’s time for a Fiscal Responsibility Constitutional Amendment," Walker continued.
