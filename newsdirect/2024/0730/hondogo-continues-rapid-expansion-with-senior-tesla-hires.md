# HondoGO continues Rapid Expansion with Senior Tesla Hires

HondoGO, an emerging leader in electric vehicle infrastructure, today announces several strategic hires as it continues its rapid buildout. This follows several recent announcements about its launch and expansion. HondoGO takes a unique approach to building its fast charger network through partnerships with site owners and capital providers.

The EV industry has expanded beyond a set of start-up companies and the market continues to grow and mature. The number of electric vehicles on the road is at record levels, but the needed infrastructure has not kept up with the industry’s growth and will be a headwind unless fixed.

“America’s energy infrastructure sorely lags behind the needs of the community, and we are ready to step in to bridge this gap,” said Shawn Matthews, CEO of HondoGO. “Drivers should not have to worry if they can get to where they need to go because of dated infrastructure. Our innovative approach allows us to bring convenient charging to drivers, profitably and sustainably. We are excited to welcome several new experienced team members who will drive the company’s potential to new heights.”

Among the new hires is a group of former Tesla Supercharger team members bringing vast expertise in fast charger technology and network expansion. This team played a crucial role in building Tesla's Supercharger network. Their knowledge and skills will be invaluable as HondoGO accelerates its growth and aims to set new standards in the industry.

“We could not be more excited to accelerate HondoGO’s growth story,” said Justin Lange, SVP of HondoGO and former Tesla Market Lead, Mid-Atlantic. “Our ability to bring together the best and brightest in the EV space and hit the ground running gives us a huge leg up. The team has national reach and experience across disciplines. We can’t wait to bring this product to consumers across the country.”

HondoGO is ready to accept the baton from Tesla as it steps back from its DC fast charger expansion. This new team allows for a smooth transition. By making the charging network its primary business and focusing squarely on building a profitable network, HondoGO’s growth directly aligns with sustainably driving tomorrow’s energy infrastructure, today.
