Robert Steele, CEO of Thumzup Media Corporation (NASDAQ: TZUP), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Thumzup offers people the ability to get paid to post about their favorite products on social media. By connecting brands to consumers through trusted friends, Thumzup has created a way to bypass the traditional model, allowing anyone to earn.

Mr. Steele spoke about his “flywheel” approach to marketing the platform. After a successful launch in Los Angeles, the company is launching in Miami.
