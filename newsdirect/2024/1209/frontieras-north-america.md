# Frontieras North America

Frontieras North America (“Frontieras”), a leader in energy technology innovation, today announced the company has secured a $150M equity investment commitment from GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (“GEM“) in the form of a Share Subscription Facility (SSF). The SSF will accelerate the company's growth strategy via acquisitions, partnerships, and organic initiatives. The agreement establishes a Share Subscription Facility granting Frontieras the option to call upon GEM to subscribe for Ordinary Shares up to a total value of USD $150 million upon a successful public listing for a thirty-six-month period, as and when needed. The funds provide Frontieras’ management team with the flexibility and capital runway required to complete project equity raises, consolidate debt and strengthen valuation as the company moves towards production and becoming publicly listed.

Frontieras’ technology extracts maximum value from coal and other hydrocarbons, including lignite, oil sands and waste plastics. Unique in the market for its innovation, Frontieras’ Solid Carbon Fractionation (SCF) is a significant leap-forward as a new energy-recovery technology that uses a continuous closed-loop refining approach. Frontieras SCF process splits coal and other feedstocks into gases, liquid hydrocarbon fuels and technical carbon at a much lower carbon footprint and far lower price than conventional refining. Moreover, its technical carbon is a suitable replacement fuel for coal plants that reduces the emissions profile to that of a similar sized natural gas plant. By deconstructing the coal to its core elements, Frontieras has the key components to produce net new products, including:

* Production of 2.3 barrels of liquid fuels from each ton of coal processed.
* Frontieras’ closed-loop process produces over 20 million-standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of hydrogen, used to treat the diesel to Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) finished fuel.
* Production of FASCarbon™, a metallurgical coke that serves as an injection replacement carbon for steel manufacturing or fuel for coal-fired plants that burns hotter and cleaner, with lower emissions.
* Production of sulfuric acid, a vital chemical commodity, and ammonium sulfate fertilizer, a high-value commodity, within the global agriculture market are two commodity products that result from Frontieras utilizing would-be waste products from Frontieras’ Solid Carbon Fractionation process.

Today, Frontieras North America is an independent company that was formerly a subsidiary of Frontier Applied Sciences (FAS), a privately held entity formed in 2010. FAS holds patents on five continents that cover more than 3.7 billion people including the United States and Canada. Frontieras North America currently controls the licensing rights to the USA and Canada. Specifically, the West Virginia Frontieras’ FASForm™ plant will process 7,500 tons of coal per day, or 2.7 million tons annually. This West Virginia facility will utilize approximately 0.5% of the United States’ annual coal production.

The combination of GEM’s equity commitment, Frontieras’ signed offtake agreements and futures contracts, as well as the anticipated high margin to service debt ratios provides the foundation for Frontieras raising $850 million to complete its initial FASForm™ plant in West Virginia. Frontieras is currently raising retail investment via its Reg. CF offering, while continuing to entertain equity interest at the commercial level and directly. Frontieras’ go-to-market finance strategy provides maximum flexibility to leverage structured finance and/or bond offerings to complete project funding.

“GEM’s commitment in Frontieras represents a significant milestone for the company and an opportunity for every level of today’s investment community,” shared Matthew McKean, Frontieras CEO and Co-Founder. “The rapidly changing political landscape is shining a focus on the importance of energy and the capital markets are recalibrating their investment strategy toward the commodities and industrial technologies that support this necessity market. Frontieras is excited to align with GEM to bring abundant, available, and affordable energy to the market.”

Market Opportunity

Frontieras’ patented technology transforms coal and other hydrocarbons into a thermal fuel that burns as clean as natural gas, while extracting valuable by-products like hydrogen, diesel, jet fuel, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and more.

* Market Potential: The annual global market for energy and chemicals exceeds USD 2.1 trillion, encompassing sectors like diesel, hydrogen, jet fuel, and more.
* Expansion Plan: The company is set to build a state-of-the-art facility in Mason County, West Virginia, with an investment of USD 850 million. This facility will create 200 full-time jobs and 2,000 construction jobs, boosting the local economy.
* Proven Track Record: With over USD 7 million raised from investors to date, Frontieras is already demonstrating strong investor confidence.
