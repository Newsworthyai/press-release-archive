New Era Helium, Inc. (“NEH,” “New Era Helium” or the “Company”), an exploration and production company sourcing helium produced in association with the production of natural gas reserves within the Permian Basin, is pleased to announce it has closed on its previously announced business combination with Roth CH V Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), and Roth CH Acquisition V. Co. (Nasdaq: ROCL; ROCLU and ROCLW) (the “Business Combination”), in which NEH merged with Roth CH V Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. The transaction was approved by ROCL’s stockholders on November 26, 2024.

With the transaction now complete, Holdings has changed its name to “New Era Helium, Inc.” . The combined company will operate under the new name, “New Era Helium, Inc.” and is set to begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols “NEHC” and “NEHCW” on December 9, 2024.

On December 6, 2024, NEH, Roth CH Acquisition V. Co., and ATW Partners Opportunities Management, LLC (“ATW”) entered into a series of financing transactions including an equity purchase agreement for $75 million, an advance of $10 million in senior secured notes of which $7 million was advanced at closing and up to an additional $3 million will be advanced subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and the issuance of warrants to purchase up to an additional $30 million in common stock.

The trading of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq represents a pivotal milestone in New Era Helium’s mission to establish itself as a leading consolidator of helium and natural gas production. With over 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico and 1.5 billion cubic feet of proved and probable helium reserves, NEH is well-positioned to drive growth in this critical sector, expected to see a surge in demand amid growth in data centers powering artificial intelligence.

Last month [read here], NEH announced a non-binding joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. (“Sharon AI”) to build a 90MW net-zero Tier 3 data center to be located within the Permian Basin. This joint venture combines Sharon AI’s expertise in high-performance computing with NEH’s extensive helium and natural gas reserves. The state-of-the-art facility will feature a liquid-cooled Tier 3 data center powered by sustainable energy, offsetting approximately 250,000 metric tons of CO2 annually through carbon capture technology.

NEH believes the Nasdaq listing will enhance its visibility and attract U.S. investors interested in energy infrastructure and sustainable innovation, further underscoring the value of its assets and forward-looking projects.

E. Will Gray II, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of New Era Helium, said: “Our Nasdaq listing marks a significant moment in our corporate journey, enhancing our public profile within the industry, and broadening our reach to institutional investors in the AI datacenter, and Helium markets.Thank you to all of our shareholders and partners whose unwavering support has been instrumental in driving our ongoing success.”
