Global hospitality technology company OYO reported a 16% increase in summer booking revenue (June to August) in the US compared to last year, according to STR, significantly outperforming the broader economy hotel segment that experienced a 2% decline, underlining its growing footprint in the world’s largest hotel market.

Nikhil Heda, Head of Business Development – OYO US said, “Our strong performance this summer demonstrates the growing preference for OYO's value proposition in the US market. By focusing on delivering quality accommodations at competitive prices, backed by our technology platform and online demand generation expertise, we’ve been able to capture increasing demand despite broader market headwinds.”

Texas emerged as the top-performing state, contributing 22% of OYO's overall summer booking revenue, followed by Oregon (18%), Florida (7%), and Louisiana (6%).

At the city level, Newport, Oregon, and Houston, Texas each contributed 5% to the overall summer booking revenue, while Seaside accounted for 4%. In an encouraging trend, destinations such as Houston, Port Allen, Rockford, Portland demonstrated exceptional growth, significantly surpassing market averages.

OYO enhances the guest experience through its technology-driven platform, offering seamless bookings, dynamic market-based pricing, AI-powered customer support, and flexible cancellation policies. The platform's integrated loyalty program further rewards customers while ensuring competitive rates.

The India-headquartered company’s impressive performance augurs well for its growth prospects in the US as it closes in on concluding its acquisition of G6 Hospitality, which owns the iconic Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands. Oravel Stays, the parent company of OYO, inked a deal with Blackstone Real Estate to buy G6 Hospitality, which has a franchise network of around 1,500 hotels across the US and Canada.

OYO has steadily expanded its footprint in the US since its launch in the region in 2019 and currently operates over 400 hotels across 35 states. In 2023, OYO added nearly 100 hotels to its US portfolio and aims to add ~250 hotels in 2024.
