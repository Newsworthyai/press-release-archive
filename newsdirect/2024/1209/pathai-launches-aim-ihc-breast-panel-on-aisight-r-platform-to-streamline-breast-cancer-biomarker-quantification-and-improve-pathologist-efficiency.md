# PathAI Launches AIM-IHC Breast Panel on AISight® Platform to Streamline Breast Cancer Biomarker Quantification and Improve Pathologist Efficiency

PathAI, a leader in AI-powered pathology solutions, today announced the launch of the AIM-IHC Breast Panel, a set pf advanced AI-assisted, algorithms designed to quantify critical breast cancer biomarkers—HER2, ER, PR, and Ki-67. Available now on the AISight® Image Management System (IMS), this comprehensive panel provides partners with accurate, consistent scoring, enhancing precision and streamlining workflow efficiency. Adding to the existing AIM-HER2 Breast solution, this consolidation of critical breast cancer biomarker algorithms into a single, pathologist-centric image management system directly addresses the need for standardized, reliable quantification assist tools to support pathologists.

PathAI’s AIM-IHC Breast Panel is designed to address key challenges in breast cancer biomarker quantification, particularly the need for precise and reproducible assessment. The panel provides accurate, consistent, zero-click scoring for HER2, ER, PR, and Ki-67 directly from routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. With automated tissue segmentation and detection of on-slide controls, the panel classifies areas of invasive versus non-invasive cancer and provides overlays to support algorithmic scoring. This breast cancer-centric panel is designed for a pathologist-assist workflow, allowing users to better differentiate regions of interest, improve the accuracy of invasive cancer segmentation, and streamline tedious scoring processes.

The AIM-IHC Breast Panel is the latest addition to PathAI's expanding suite of AI-powered solutions on the AISight® IMS. AISight serves as a central hub for managing pathology images, enabling seamless integration of various AI-driven tools for pathology labs. By centralizing workflows and offering a growing portfolio of applications, PathAI empowers pathologists and researchers to improve precision and efficiency, all within a unified, cloud-native platform. This continuous expansion of the AISight IMS and the full menu of AI applications available on the platform from PathAI as well as third-party vendors underscores PathAI’s commitment to providing comprehensive, reliable tools that enhance the field of pathology and ultimately, patient outcomes.

“We are committed to advancing precision pathology with cutting-edge AI technology, empowering pathologists with the tools to make more accurate, consistent, and efficient assessments,” said Andrew Beck, CEO of PathAI. “The AIM-IHC Breast Panel is the latest step in our mission to enhance AI-powered scoring for key breast cancer biomarkers.”

In addition, the AIM-IHC Breast Panel goes beyond HER2 by offering fast and accurate Ki-67 scoring, addressing the challenges of this emerging biomarker, which has traditionally been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Pathologists no longer need to spend significant time manually counting cells or rely on imprecise approximations. The panel’s automated features, such as classifying invasive cancer and generating percentage-based results for positive cancer cells, provide pathologists with the clarity needed to produce more accurate scoring.

The introduction of the AIM-IHC Breast Panel marks a significant step in PathAI’s ongoing mission to enable precision pathology and empower pathologists with the latest AI-driven technologies. This release highlights PathAI’s commitment to improving workflow efficiency, speed, and assessment accuracy. As the AISight® Image Management System continues to expand with new solutions, pathologists gain access to a comprehensive suite of tools that streamline their workflow, accelerating decision-making and reducing time spent on manual tasks. With each of our new advancements, pathologists are better equipped to deliver precise, actionable insights for cancer diagnostic research.
