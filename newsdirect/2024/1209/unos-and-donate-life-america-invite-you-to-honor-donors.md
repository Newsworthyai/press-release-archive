# UNOS and Donate Life America invite you to honor donors

The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and Donate Life America (DLA) invite the public to join the National Tree of Life virtual event to honor and remember this year’s organ, eye and tissue donors and their families.

The National Tree of Life ceremony will take place on December 16 at 6:30 p.m. ET. The annual event honors the legacy of donors in each state who gave the gift of life in 2024 and celebrates the tens of thousands of lives they saved. The event will be live streamed on Donate Life America’s Facebook page.

As part of this year’s ceremony, the winner of the annual Lisa Schaffner Community Advocate Award will be announced. The award recognizes those who go above and beyond to promote organ donation. The award is named after Lisa Schaffner, a powerful advocate of donation and transplant and former UNOS employee, who passed away in 2021.

The ceremony will feature speakers from DLA, UNOS and the organ donation and transplant community, including:

* Jan Flanders, a tissue recipient and family member of an organ donor
* Sam Dey, a heart recipient
* Samuel and Susan Kirton, a double lung recipient and a caregiver

Each year, the Tree of Life ceremony recognizes the lives and gifts of more than 20,000 organ donors – and tens of thousands of cornea and tissue donors – and their families, while also celebrating the lives of recipients across the country. Volunteers with connections to donation and transplant will honor donors from each state by hanging ornaments on the trees of life and lighting candles of remembrance.

“The Tree of Life event is a moving reminder of the tremendous loss, bravery and joy that organ donation and transplant bring, and the ripple effect it has on each of us,” said Maureen McBride, Ph.D., CEO of UNOS. “We are thankful for those who have given the gift of life and for their courageous families.”

“As we honor donors and donor families from this year during the National Tree of Life ceremony, we also recognize and celebrate the enduring legacy of lifesaving generosity of all donors and donor families who have given the gift of life in past years,” said David Fleming, DLA president and CEO. “We hope the Tree of Life ceremony helps provide community and solace.”
