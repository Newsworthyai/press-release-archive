# For the Second Year in a Row, Shareholder Calls for Microsoft Shareholders to Reject Reid Hoffman

The annual meeting for Microsoft Corporation is on Tuesday, and for the second year in a row, an investor is calling upon shareholders to oppose the re-election of tech entrepreneur and political agitator Reid Hoffman to the board of directors.

Earlier this year, National Legal and Policy Center sent a letter to Microsoft Corporation calling upon Hoffman to resign from the board, and if he refused, then for his fellow directors to call a special meeting to vote on his removal. The shareholder group wrote that he should not continue to serve on Microsoft’s board, after Hoffman wished for the death of former President Donald Trump just days before an attempted assassination on the now President-elect.

The letter, sent in July, followed NLPC’s plea last year in advance of the tech company’s 2023 annual meeting, which asked voting shareholders to oppose Hoffman’s re-election to a seat on the board. NLPC argued then (and argues now) that the former member of the “Paypal mafia” harbors an unhealthy obsession with the personal and political destruction of President-elect Trump, and that he displays an intolerance and temperament that is unbefitting for a director of a prestigious multinational corporation like Microsoft. NLPC also called into question Hoffman’s extremely poor judgment in his visit to Little Saint James island with multi-millionaire financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as his regular associations with him, many years after the pedophile was convicted for the abuse of underage girls. For these same reasons, NLPC demanded that Hoffman be removed as a member of the Defense Department’s Innovation Advisory Board

“Under any other circumstances, Reid Hoffman’s caustic rhetoric, his reckless conduct, and his preoccupation with the destruction of a political foe, would disqualify him from the privilege of serving on a corporate board,” said Paul Chesser, director of the Corporate Integrity Project for NLPC. “Corporate America seems to be coming to their senses finally on issues like DEI and the transgender delusion, so maybe shareholders will finally reject an extremist like Mr. Hoffman, because they should.”

NLPC released a satirical video in October that identified several of Hoffman’s sins and shortcomings that make him unqualified for Microsoft’s board of directors.
