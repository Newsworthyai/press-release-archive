Fresh capital is flooding into Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) as they both tease incoming breakouts that could see them reclaim crucial resistance levels.

Cutoshi, a new meme coin, is taking the market by storm with its unique premise that merges meme energy with DeFi utility. Over $1.3 million has been raised in the ongoing presale of the $CUTO token and demand is skyrocketing.

Ethereum Soaring Above $4,000After consolidating for weeks around the $3,500 mark, Ethereum (ETH) is now trading at $4,020.2, following an 8.5% weekly surge. As Ethereum is cooling off after the move, volume has dipped by 19.5%, with roughly $52.5 billion worth of ETH traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Ethereum inflows are rapidly increasing. On Thursday, BlackRock’s ETH ETF (ETHA) recorded an all-time high of $292 million in daily inflows, highlighting growing investor interest in Ethereum-related investment products.

Trader and analyst Pentoshi has shared a bullish chart reading on X in regards to Ethereum’s price action. On the macro level, Ethereum has already tapped into the supply zone at $4000 several times already. Between the ETF craze and the galvanized sentiment in the crypto markets, Ethereum’s reclaim of the $4,800 resistance could happen at any time.

Cardano Enters Reaccumulation ZoneOver the last month alone, Cardano experienced a 235% rally, becoming one of the best-performing cryptos. This latest surge saw Cardano triumphantly reenter the crypto top 10 with $41.7 billion in market cap. After peaking at $1.30 just a few days ago, Cardano (ADA) has retraced and is currently moving in a ranging channel, with its price fluctuating around the $1.19 mark. In the last 24 hours, Cardano experienced a 1.7% decrease while rebounding from the $1.14 support.

Analyst Ali Martinez points out that Cardano has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern. This means that a rebound from this level would confirm the bullish thesis for Cardano and send it soaring to new heights.

Both Ethereum and Cardano will undoubtedly experience significant gains, with Ethereum possibly reaching the prophesied $10,000 milestone. However, it's unlikely for both projects to experience the same price multipliers of the past. Crypto-enthusiasts looking for greater ROI should consider looking into low-cap, undervalued projects like Cutoshi, especially with the meme narrative dominating the market.

Cutoshi Spearheading The Meme Revolution 2.0Cutoshi sets itself apart from run-of-the-mill meme coins by leveraging the limitless potential of DeFi. The ecosystem brings disconnected blockchains together into one decentralized exchange, CUTO DEX. Investors can seamlessly swap between assets at near-instantaneous speed without having to circle between exchanges.

Just like the Japanese Lucky Cat brings good fortune to businesses, Cutoshi brings good fortune to its community through the Cutoshi Farm system. Once staking is available, holders of the $CUTO token will receive recurring rewards sustained by the revenue generated by the platform. Moreover, during and after the presale, individuals will have the opportunity to participate in special events and complete tasks to earn additional $CUTO tokens.

One of the project’s most interesting features is the Cutoshi Academy. This is a learning platform that aims to assist newcomers on their crypto journey. In the academy, they will find free resources that teach the basics of DeFi, trading and how to build a future-proof portfolio.

Stage 4 of the $CUTO presale is live and with the token selling for just $0.031, taking into account all that Cutoshi has to offer it has the potential to 10x.
