# Teambuilder Receives Patent for Predictive Staff Scheduling in Healthcare

TeamBuilder has been granted Patent No. 12148523 for its predictive staff scheduling technology. The patent covers TeamBuilder’s innovative approach of weaving patient volume, workflow and employee availability and characteristics into an easy-to-use interface that managers can use to make optimal scheduling decisions. This achievement underscores TeamBuilder’s commitment to leveraging data-driven solutions to improve staffing efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance patient care.

“Securing a patent for our predictive staff scheduling technology is a significant milestone for TeamBuilder, confirming the innovation behind our solution,” said David Howard, Founder and CEO of TeamBuilder. “Our technology addresses the complex staffing challenges healthcare providers face today, offering a smarter, more efficient way to manage workforce needs while improving both staff and patient outcomes.”

Staff scheduling in healthcare is inherently complex, with fluctuating patient demand, varying specialty needs, multiple locations, and diverse staff preferences. Despite this, many healthcare organizations continue to rely on staffing ratios and manual scheduling systems, such as paper or Excel-based methods, which often lead to overstaffing, administrative inefficiencies, and a lack of visibility into key operational metrics.

How TeamBuilder Works:

* Schedule Optimization: Develops the most efficient schedule by balancing patient demand, staff availability, workload, and clinic constraints, minimizing gaps in coverage.
* Staff Allocation: Focuses on analyzing staff availability and workload to predict the optimal number of staff needed for each shift, ensuring the right coverage in alignment with patient demand.
* Operational Visibility: Provides real-time insights into clinic operations, resource allocation, and clinic-to-clinic comparisons, enabling data-driven staffing adjustments and resource planning.
* Performance Tracking: Tracks key metrics such as resource cost per visit and peer benchmarking to evaluate and enhance operational efficiency.

“The shift toward data-driven predictive scheduling is no longer optional—it’s essential,” says Niel Oscarson, Research Director at KLAS. “Healthcare organizations that can accurately forecast staffing needs will see improvements in both operational efficiency and patient care quality. Our conversations with TeamBuilder customers indicate that Teambuilder is making a significant impact with its patented technology, creating new and significant efficiencies in workforce management. Additionally, TeamBuilder’s focus on the ambulatory care space addresses a critical area of need.”

TeamBuilder’s patented staff scheduling technology not only transforms workforce management but also drives tangible, measurable improvements. Healthcare organizations have seen an 11% improvement in access to care and payroll reductions of 9-14% through optimized staffing. The technology also enhances communication and reduces the time required to create and manage schedules, streamlining operations. These outcomes highlight TeamBuilder’s impact on improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing patient care.
