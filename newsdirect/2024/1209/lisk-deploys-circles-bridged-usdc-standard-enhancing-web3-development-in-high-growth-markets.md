# Lisk Deploys Circle’s Bridged USDC Standard, Enhancing Web3 Development in High-Growth Markets

Lisk, a leading Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to bringing Ethereum to emerging markets, is excited to announce its deployment and launch of the Circle’s Bridged USDC Standard. This collaboration empowers EVM blockchain and rollup teams to minimize liquidity fragmentation by providing a unified form of bridged USDC for their ecosystems.

Bridged USDC Standard is designed to address the challenge of liquidity fragmentation, which often occurs when multiple versions of USDC proliferate across different chains. By adopting this standard, developers on Lisk can enable immediate USDC availability for their users and easily implement bridged contracts for future upgrades. Developers can utilize a single contract address that will persist through potential future upgrades to native USDC, eliminating the need for code changes and providing a smooth transition if native USDC becomes available.

With this new integration, projects building on Lisk will now have seamless access to bridged USDC, facilitating a superior developer and user experience. Developers can utilize a single contract address that will persist through future upgrades to native USDC, eliminating the need for code changes and ensuring a smooth transition if a potential upgrade occurs.

“Stablecoins are one of the most important innovations in crypto and have become a lifeline for those in emerging markets,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “At Lisk, we want to elevate the utilization of stablecoins, empowering builders to create seamless and secure products that benefit their economies.”

Bridged USDC Standard is designed to address the challenge of liquidity fragmentation, which often occurs when multiple versions of USDC proliferate across different chains. By adopting this standard, developers on Lisk can provide bridged USDC availability for their users and easily implement bridged contracts for future upgrades.

This announcement is particularly significant as a recent Chainalysis report indicates that stablecoins account for approximately 43% of the total transaction volume in the Sub-Saharan African region, highlighting a substantial target market for Lisk.

Bridged USDC Standard is open-source and audited, based on the same secure ERC-20 contract code that has secured billions of dollars in liquidity. This integration not only standardizes the process for developers but also provides consistency if bridged USDC is upgraded to native USDC.
