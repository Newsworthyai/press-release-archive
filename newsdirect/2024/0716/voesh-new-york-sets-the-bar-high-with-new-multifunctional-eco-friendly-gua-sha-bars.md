# VOESH New York Sets the Bar High with New Multifunctional & Eco-Friendly Gua Sha Bars

VOESH New York, the leading clean and vegan body care and wellness brand, is thrilled to announce the launch of its new Gua Sha Cleansing and Shampoo Bars. These personal care bars are designed to elevate shower routines, combining the traditional practice of Gua Sha with modern skincare innovation for a better way to wash. Developed with 100% vegan and 97+% natural-origin ingredients, these bars offer a luxurious and sustainable self-care experience.

“Since our start, VOESH has been dedicated to making elevated & sustainable beauty accessible to everyone,” said Vera Oh, Co-Founder of VOESH New York. “Our solid beauty bars are the gateway to zero-plastic choices, helping us reduce carbon emissions while maximizing value and efficacy for our customers.”

The new lineup consists of the Gua Sha Cleansing Bar and Gua Sha Shampoo Bar. These revolutionary products combine the benefits of a lymphatic massage and satisfying cleanse in one compact bar. The Gua Sha Shampoo Bar offers a thorough hair wash and soothing scalp massage and features powerful ingredients like biotin, proprietary vegan probiotics, rosemary oil, and apricot seed powder. Its ergonomic shape stimulates hair follicles to promote healthy hair growth. The Gua Sha Cleansing Bar, with ingredients like niacinamide, proprietary vegan probiotics, rosemary oil, and charcoal powder, refreshes and revitalizes the skin and simultaneously relieves muscle tension.

"With the recent shift in consumers' mindsets toward clean beauty and the growth of the solid beauty bar industry, we aimed to create multifunctional products that offer a range of health benefits," said Oh. "Showering is a daily habit, and with these bars, we strive to simplify shower routines while making them more enjoyable. These bars not only wash but also provide a gentle massage, enhancing the overall shower experience. A happy body means a healthy life!" said Vera Oh
