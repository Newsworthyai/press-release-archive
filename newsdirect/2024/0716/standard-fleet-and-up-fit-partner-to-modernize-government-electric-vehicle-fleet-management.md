“Our collaboration with UP.FIT aims to equip police departments with the tools they need for a smoother, more cost-effective fleet management experience,” said David Hodge, Founder and CEO of Standard Fleet. “Integrating our software with UP.FIT’s customized Tesla vehicles means we can offer a system that improves operational efficiency while supporting environmental goals.”

"Our mission at UP.FIT is to simplify the adoption of electric fleets for first responders and fleet operators globally,” said James Hedland, Fleet Director at UP.FIT. “Standard Fleet software gives operators complete control of the access, charging, maintenance, and dispatching of their up-fitted EVs. Together we’re providing police departments and other city and county fleet operators with an electric vehicle management system proven to enhance performance and operational efficiency."

The partnership addresses a growing need for cost-effective and responsible deployment of EV fleets in public service by merging the expertise and capabilities of UP.FIT and Standard Fleet. This initiative is poised to redefine fleet management for government entities, enhancing both vehicle functionality and operational oversight.

Key Benefits of the Partnership:

* Improved Operational Efficiency: Standard Fleet’s software streamlines the management of charging, maintenance, and daily operations of EVs, reducing both time and costs for fleet managers.
* Tailored Vehicle Customizations: UP.FIT modifies Tesla vehicles to meet the specific needs of police and public safety operations, enhancing their reliability and suitability for work in the communities they serve.
* Environmental Impact: The shift towards EVs helps reduce emissions and air pollution, and aligns with local, state, and federal environmental objectives.

Sergeant Tony Abdalla from the South Pasadena Police Department, a client benefiting from this partnership, stated, “Adopting electric vehicles for police work presents a unique set of challenges along with opportunities to better serve our community with a cleaner, more reliable, and higher performance police fleet at lower costs over the long term. Standard Fleet technology gives us mobile access to all of our EVs to enhance our operations from dispatch, charging, maintenance, and analytics, to keyless access for officers coming on- and off-duty. Combining Standard Fleet software with the hardware and digital technology upgrades installed by UP.FIT puts our fleet at the forefront of sustainability and performance.”

This initiative underscores the potential of technology to improve public sector operations and promotes the adoption of sustainable practices in fleet management. As police departments and other city and county fleet operators increasingly turn to electric vehicles, Standard Fleet and UP.FIT provides scalable, impactful, and effective solutions for the challenges of modern fleet operations.
