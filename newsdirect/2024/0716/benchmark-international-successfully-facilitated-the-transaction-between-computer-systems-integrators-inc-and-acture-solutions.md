Benchmark International has successfully facilitated a transaction between Fishkill, NY-based Computer Systems Integrators, Inc. (“CSI”) and Albany, NY-based Acture Solutions (“Acture”). CSI is a trusted hybrid information technology (IT) services partner primarily for K-12 schools, providing IT solutions, security, and support for schools’ IT networks.

“CSI President Bob Knapp and his team built a great business in a reliable market niche with a strong customer set and high recurring revenues,” commented Benchmark Senior Transaction Director William Sullivan. “IT businesses like this are really a pleasure to bring to market because there is such a large, disaggregated buyer community, which drives a fairly clear path to partnership options for our clients. Ultimately, Acture Solutions proved to be the perfect fit among a very attractive field of highly motivated buyers. The Acture team was fantastic throughout the process, and we’re very pleased to have helped find CSI such a great partner.”

Founded in 1991, Computer Systems Integrators is a hybrid provider of multiple IT products and services (including integration / value-adding reselling relationships with Nimble and VMWare) and a variety of security and maintenance services. The company is additionally an authorized partner of Cisco, Microsoft, and Barracuda.
