Overcoming Challenges

Growing up in Halls Creek, Jamee Carey faced significant obstacles. The isolation of the region, coupled with socio-economic challenges common among Indigenous Australians, made the road to success a difficult one. Despite these hurdles, Jamee's perseverance and vision have enabled him to create opportunities for himself and his community.

Founding Gijaru Workgear

Driven by a deep commitment to giving back to his community, Jamee established Gijaru Workgear. The company offers starter-friendly work kits, including Crib Bags and Crib Kits, designed to provide new employees with the tools they need to feel confident and connected to their cultural roots on their first day. These kits go beyond practicality, embodying a blend of functionality and cultural heritage that empowers Indigenous workers across various industries.

Bridging Cultures

Gijaru Workgear aims to bridge the gap between Indigenous heritage and modern work environments. By integrating cultural elements into the workgear, the company fosters a sense of belonging and pride among Indigenous employees. Jamee’s vision is to ensure that every new starter feels a connection to their roots, enhancing their confidence and productivity.

Jamee Carey’s dedication to his community extends beyond business. He understands the importance of role models and strives to inspire others through his achievements. Gijaru Workgear is not only about providing practical support but also about fostering a sense of pride and cultural identity among Indigenous Australians entering the workforce.
