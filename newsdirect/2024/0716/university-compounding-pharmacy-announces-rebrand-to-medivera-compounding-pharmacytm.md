# University Compounding Pharmacy Announces Rebrand to MediVera Compounding Pharmacy™

University Compounding Pharmacy, a leader in personalized medicine since 1999, today announced it is rebranding as MediVera Compounding Pharmacy™. The rebrand comes at a time when the company is growing strongly due to the introduction of new product offerings, nationwide expansion, and the successful differentiation of its quality products and services.

Despite the name change, the company’s ownership and passionate team remain the same, ensuring continuity in the high-level service and exceptional care that healthcare providers and patients have relied on for more than two decades.

Over the past few years, the company has seen its revenue grow substantially. New product offerings, nationwide expansion, and strong market positioning through differentiated quality products and services, such as the Impressed Advantage program, have enabled the company to double its revenue from 2022 to 2023. Growth is anticipated to accelerate this year, with the company expecting to double revenue year-over-year once again.

“Differentiation is and will continue to be an important growth driver for our company. With the Impressed Advantage customer service program, we are making the prescription process easier, faster, and more convenient for both doctors and their patients,” said Bradley McCloskey, PharmD, CEO. “As we continue to launch more product offerings and expand into more states within the next few months, 2024 is poised to become a year of strong growth as we expand our footprint into 14 additional states.”
