On Jun. 11, Iteris Inc. (NASDAQ: ITI), a leading technology ecosystem for smart mobility infrastructure management, announced an exclusive agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEI) to bring the Sumitomo Pedestrian Detection sensor to the U.S. market. This collaboration aims to integrate SEI’s advanced radar technology into the Iteris ClearMobility Platform in order to save pedestrian lives and provide valuable data that enable additional improvements in mobility management.

Technology Integration And FeaturesThe Sumitomo Pedestrian Detection sensor uses cutting-edge radar technology to detect pedestrians with high accuracy. Since its launch in 2017, this sensor has helped reduce pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in various regions of Japan, particularly protecting vulnerable populations like the elderly. By incorporating this technology into the ClearMobility Platform’s ecosystem, Iteris will strengthen its industry-leading transportation safety solutions portfolio and gain access to more granular pedestrian data to improve its comprehensive mobility data set.

The sensor’s advanced features include its ability to operate effectively in all weather and lighting conditions, from sunshine to total darkness, thanks to its 24 GHz millimeter-wave radar technology. Proprietary algorithms also enable it to track pedestrians even when they are obscured by other vehicles, covering a wide detection area suitable for various intersection and midblock configurations.

The sensor will be integrated into Iteris’ Vantage PedSafe solution, including real-time analytics through Iteris’s ClearGuide software, which provides insights into pedestrian activity and helps identify unsafe areas.

A Pedestrian Safety SystemVantage PedSafe, a key component of Iteris’s comprehensive detection solutions, is designed to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) in diverse conditions, making it ideal for high-traffic areas such as intersections, school zones, university campuses, transportation hubs and entertainment venues.

This advanced system utilizes cutting-edge sensors and analytics to monitor pedestrian movements and optimize traffic signal timings, ensuring safer crossings. Vantage PedSafe can activate dynamic street lighting, LED beacons and message signs to alert drivers of pedestrians, enhancing visibility and awareness.

Finally, the system broadcasts safety warnings to connected vehicles and optimizes traffic operations by adjusting signal timing based on real-time pedestrian detection. By integrating these innovative features, Vantage PedSafe significantly reduces accidents while improving the overall flow of traffic, exemplifying Iteris’s commitment to pedestrian safety and modern transportation solutions.

Transportation Equality And Vision ZeroVision Zero is another leg of this push for enhanced pedestrian safety, aiming to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries partly through addressing issues with transportation equity in underserved communities. Vantage PedSafe looks at the higher pedestrian fatality rates in lower-income areas and helps agencies secure safety-related grants by demonstrating effective safety improvements.

In 2022, pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. reached the highest level in 40 years, with 7,508 deaths, 76% of which occurred in dark conditions. Additionally, the rate of fatalities was nearly double in lower-income areas. This underscores the critical need for advanced pedestrian detection solutions like those provided by Iteris. If implemented, thousands of lives could be saved each year, particularly in lower-income communities.

A Safer Future For PedestriansIteris is continuously monitoring, visualizing and optimizing mobility infrastructure to ensure that roads are safe, travel is efficient and communities can thrive. Various private-sector enterprises and thousands of public agencies already rely on its solutions, making it a trusted leader in smart mobility infrastructure management. Ultimately, this latest integration by Iteris, combined with its innovative in-house pedestrian safety technology, promises to create safer environments and reduce traffic fatalities across the U.S.
