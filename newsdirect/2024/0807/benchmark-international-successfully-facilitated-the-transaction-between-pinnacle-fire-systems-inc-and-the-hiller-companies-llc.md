“Pinnacle’s owners, Rick Shores and Bart Arthurs, came to Benchmark International after having built a great company in a consolidating segment but were unsure of what valuation to seek from the market. Benchmark International's strong transactional history in the sector allowed us to achieve an outcome well over initial client expectations. We believe that Hiller is the perfect home for this great business, and we’re exceedingly happy with the result for our great founder team.” - William Sullivan, Senior Transaction Director, Benchmark International
