# Frontieras Launches Investment Opportunity in a “Rockefeller Moment for Coal”

Frontieras has officially announced the launch of their Regulation CF investment opportunity. The company is commercializing its patented technology to transform coal into a thermal fuel that burns as clean as natural gas, while extracting valuable by-products like hydrogen, diesel, jet fuel, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and more. This is a unique opportunity for individual investors to join them in the early stages.

The company calls their innovation the “Rockefeller Moment” for coal, comparing it to John D. Rockefeller’s famed breakthrough innovation in oil-refining technology. While coal has traditionally simply been burned to create energy, Frontieras’ FASForm technology reforms coal into a fuel source that burns cleaner and more efficiently than natural gas, while extracting additional byproducts that are highly valued in global commodities markets.

Why invest in Frontieras?

* Market Potential: The global market for energy and chemicals exceeds $2.1 trillion, encompassing sectors like diesel, hydrogen, jet fuel, and more.
* Expansion Plan: The company is set to build a state-of-the-art facility in Mason County, West Virginia, with an investment of $850 million. This facility will create 200 full-time jobs and 2,000 construction jobs, boosting the local economy.
* Proven Track Record: With over $7 million raised from investors to date, Frontieras is already demonstrating strong investor confidence.

Matt McKean, Co-Founder & CEO of Frontieras, commented, “Our Reg CF offering is an exciting opportunity for investors to participate in a groundbreaking venture set to redefine the entire global coal industry. These opportunities in the energy sector are rare for individual investors –– they’re typically only available to large institutions. We’re thrilled to give the average investor an opportunity to invest in a major innovation in the global energy industry.”
