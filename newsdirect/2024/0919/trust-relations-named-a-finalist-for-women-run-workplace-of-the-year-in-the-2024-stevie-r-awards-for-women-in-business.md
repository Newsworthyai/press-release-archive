# TRUST RELATIONS NAMED A FINALIST FOR WOMEN-RUN WORKPLACE OF THE YEAR IN THE 2024 STEVIE® AWARDS FOR WOMEN IN BUSINESS

Trust Relations has been named a finalist in the 21st annual Stevie Awards for Women in Business for the third consecutive year. The agency was nominated in the category of “Women-Run Workplace of the Year - More than 10 Employees” for cultivating both a considerate company culture and outstanding performance during the 2024 award cycle.

Hailed as the world’s premier business awards, The Stevie Awards for Women in Business honor the world’s leading women executives, entrepreneurs, employees and the companies they run.

“Trust Relations was born from my desire to create the workplace that I’d always wished existed. It’s so rewarding to not only see that dream come true, but also to be recognized for the considerate culture we have successfully created,” said Trust Relations CEO & Founder April White. “There are so many amazing women in leadership roles now at Trust Relations, who all strive to make this agency the most respectful and collaborative place I have ever worked.”

White previously won a Silver Award in the category of “Maverick of the Year” in 2023 and a Gold Award for “Most Innovative Woman of the Year” in 2022, each in the Advertising, Marketing & Public Relations subcategory.

White’s previous awards have exemplified her longstanding efforts to improve agency culture and operations, and the communications industry at large, as well as her mission to replace public relations with “trust relations.” This year’s award recognizes the impact a trust-focused approach can have within the workplace, with Trust Relations’ exceptional focus on cultivating a “Considerate Culture” by emphasizing work-life balance, employee wellness, mentorship, and career excellence.

Entries were evaluated from the average scores provided by six juries, composed of more than 200 business professionals around the world. Final announcement of Gold, Silver, and Bronze Stevie Award placements will be revealed at the 21st annual awards dinner and presentations. The gala will be held in New York on November 8, 2024.

“I couldn’t be more proud of what the women leaders at Trust Relations have accomplished, and their continuous dedication to showing the world what a culture that puts people first can look like,” White said. “The honor of this prestigious award is just one example of what we can achieve together, with our shared commitment to team spirit, work-life balance, and kindness. We hope it will inspire other companies to take a similar approach, in an effort to create the considerate workplaces of the future.”
