# Luftgekühlt 10 celebrates Porsche Turbo Anniversary at Universal Studios Backlot

As the original Porsche icon, the 911 Turbo has become shorthand for high-performance and cutting edge technology. The cars have graced the bedroom wall of thousands of children around the world who grew up idolizing the signature flared fenders and Whale Tail spoiler. Fifty years later, the 930 model, introduced at the Paris Motor Show on October 3, 1974, not only established the 911 Turbo as a legendary vehicle but inserted its name into the vernacular.

In recognition of the importance of the 911 Turbo and to celebrate its birthday, Luftgekühlt 10 will showcase a number of landmark vehicles, including a collection of original and modified examples in true Luft style within the Universal Studios Backlot.

And in keeping with Luft tradition, the organizers have secured a number of significant racing examples, such as the 930-based Vasek Polak Racing Porsche 934, which claimed the 1976 Trans-Am Championship.

Chassis #0179 will be on display; one of two cars entered that year by the California Porsche dealer. It was driven by George Follmer and Hurley Haywood. Throughout the season, Follmer predominantly raced #0174 until a heavy crash saw him swap to #0179. The 934 dominated the Championship, allowing Follmer to win the title with Haywood in second. The team switched to a 935 for the 1977 season.

Luft 10 attendees will be able to enjoy the 911 Turbo exhibits as well as a plethora of significant air-cooled Porsches. We’ll reveal more featured cars in the weeks to come.

SUPPORTING EVENTS

A full itinerary was recently shared via the Luft newsletter, allowing fans to get their Luft fix in more ways than one. The fun starts on Thursday October 3 with the Luft pre-party at Gunther Werks in Huntington Beach, CA. It runs from 7-11pm and all are welcome.

Don’t party all night because you won’t want to miss the Rise & Shine pre-party at Race Service on Venice Blvd in Los Angeles. It takes place on October 4 from 9am-12pm and there will be plenty of coffee available.

You can then grab lunch before heading over to the Petersen Automotive Museum on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles to celebrate 50 years of the 911 Turbo with fellow enthusiasts. Cocktails and gourmet bites will be served but you’ll need tickets to attend, which are available from the Petersen HERE. The event takes place on Friday October 4 from 6-10pm.

Following Luft 10 itself – which takes place on Saturday October 5 at the Universal Studios Backlot in Universal City – enthusiasts can join the Mobil 1 Air-Cooled Caravan on October 6. The rally is celebrating its fourth year with a quintessential Los Angeles rally drive. Registered participants will meet at Hansen Dam Recreation Center at 7am and will end at Porsche Santa Clarita with a Cars & Coffee-style event. Registration info will follow shortly.

Porsche Santa Clarita is also hosting Porsche owners and enthusiasts at its Official After Luft Brunch on October 6 from 9am-12pm. Anybody wishing to join the event should please register at DOsorio@galpin.com.

LUFT 10 TICKETS

Although it’s only been a matter of weeks since tickets went on sale, the Early Access option has already sold out. Vehicle registration also closed once the show car capacity was reached. Fortunately, General Admission tickets are still available (at the time of writing) from luftgekuhlt.com/pages/luft-10. However, we’re duty-bound to remind enthusiasts that the last time we visited the Universal Studios Backlot for Luft 6, tickets sold out quickly and many people were disappointed. Don’t be that person who has to experience the event vicariously through other people’s Instagram accounts!
