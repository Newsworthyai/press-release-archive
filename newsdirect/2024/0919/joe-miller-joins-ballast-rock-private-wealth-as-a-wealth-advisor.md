Ballast Rock Private Wealth (“BRPW”), an independent registered investment advisor that provides holistic financial advice to its clients today announced the expansion of its team with the addition of Joe Miller, who joins the firm as a Wealth Advisor based in New Canaan, CT.

With a strong background serving high and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family office clients, Joe also brings considerable expertise in fixed income and alternative investments, having spent 20 years in High Yield and Distressed corporate credit including Bank Debt and Reorganized Equity. At BRPW, he will work with clients on comprehensive wealth management strategies, including tax mitigation, leveraging trusts, generational asset transfer and philanthropy, among others.

“Joe is a wonderful addition to our team,” said Ballast Rock Private Wealth CEO Andrew Mescon. “Given Joe’s institutional experience, his background and knowledge fit well with our focus on alternative investments. In his role as a financial advisor, Joe has demonstrated a deep understanding of his clients’ needs and has a track record of creating well-rounded plans that align with his client's goals and financial well-being.”

After leaving Morgan Stanley in 2009, Joe has had roles across sales, trading, and portfolio management in the High Yield and Distressed Corporate Credit asset class.

“I’m excited to join a firm that truly leads with alternatives, providing clients with investment opportunities typically available only to $100+ million clients,” Miller said. “In a commoditized world of investments, Ballast Rock provides alpha that other advisors and wealth managers simply can’t offer. I look forward to being part of one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing wealth management firms.”
