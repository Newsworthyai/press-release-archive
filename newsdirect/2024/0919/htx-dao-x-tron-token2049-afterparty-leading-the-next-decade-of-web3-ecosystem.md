Notable media partners were in attendance to cover the event, including Odaily, BlockBeats, Foresight News, TechFlow, MarsBit, Cointime, DeThings, PANews, Jinse Finance, ChainCatcher, MetaEra, BroadChain, Bitcoin.com, BeInCrypto, Blockopedia, and Monsterblockhk.

As the keynote speaker, Justin Sun highlighted the achievements of HTX and TRON while outlining a twin-engine strategy for future development in his video address titled "A New Decade: TRON x HTX Lead the Globe Web3 Ecosystem."

He emphasized that blockchain technology, once a nascent concept, has now become a transformative force in reshaping industries worldwide and lauded TRON and HTX for playing pivotal roles in this evolution. "TRON's journey began with an attempt at an in-depth exploration of the limitless possibilities of blockchain technology. We remained committed to the core values of openness, transparency, and decentralization. Furthermore, HTX, one of the most important partners of TRON, has made remarkable contributions to the growth of the blockchain industry since its inception. This year marked the 11th anniversary of HTX, showing its longevity in this industry, and that is truly an achievement to be proud of. HTX has remained at the forefront of the industry, owing to its commitment to longtermism, proactive compliance to changing regulations, and its unwavering focus on security and user experience,” Sun added.

Looking ahead to Web3's next decade, Sun believes blockchain technology and products need to focus on real-world applications, which requires enhanced interactivity, diversified use cases, AI-driven solutions, strengthened network systems, and broader acceptance. The upcoming decade will also witness closer collaborations between TRON and HTX.

The most recent collaboration between the two industry giants took place in August with SunPump. This meme coin issuance platform, launched on the robust TRON network and supported by HTX’s market resources, became a phenomenal Web3 application in just one month of its debut. SunPump boosted on-chain transaction volume, creating a positive feedback loop that benefitted both TRON and HTX.

"Our ultimate goal is to build an all-encompassing Web3 ecosystem that integrates payments, investments, and social interactions," said Justin Sun. "We will focus on driving the growth of the TRON ecosystem, drawing in more high-quality DApps and projects and enhancing the collaboration between TRON and HTX. Meanwhile, we will also tap into HTX's global influence and extensive resources. By integrating TRON’s cutting-edge technology with HTX's market strength, we can expand the global reach of our products and services with greater efficiency."

In addition to Justin Sun, the event is also attended by several distinguished guests from prominent projects and media, including Arif Khan, founder and CEO of Alethea AI, an AI infrastructure provider; Victor Yap, Regional Marketing Director for Asia Pacific at Tour Billion, a GameFi launchpad; Leo, co-founder of BitWave, a Bitcoin layer-2 solution; Sharon Sciammas, CMO of ChainGPT, an AI tool provider; and Larry Cermak, CEO of The Block, a crypto media outlet. They each delivered speeches, sharing their insights and future perspectives on the crypto industry. Their discussions covered a range of trending topics, such as, AI, DePIN, BTCFi, and GameFi.

It is worth mentioning that the event also captivated attendees with energetic performances and a variety of thrilling prize draws. The evening’s lucky winners took home a range of remarkable rewards, such as, 11 cold wallets, 2.2 billion $HTX, 5 $ETH, $2,000 in $MASA, and 2 Formula 1 tickets.

At TOKEN2049 in 2023, HTX marked its 10th anniversary with a rebranding, representing the first milestone in its journey into the next decade. Over the last year, HTX has achieved substantial growth, consistently leading the industry in terms of trading volume and liquidity, while regularly introducing innovative products and high-quality assets. According to CoinGecko data, HTX became the second-ranked exchange globally in early August, making steady progress toward its goal of securing a spot in the top three exchanges. Furthermore, the establishment of HTX DAO represents another milestone in HTX's efforts to build a decentralized ecosystem. To date, with the support of HTX, the liquidity pledges received by HTX DAO and the amount of $HTX repurchased and burned have reached a total of $51.5 million, effectively driving the growth of the decentralized community.

This year, participants from the HTX ecosystem remain active at TOKEN2049. In addition to the Afterparty hosted by TRON and co-hosted by HTX DAO, Edward, the Managing Partner of HTX Ventures, HTX’s global investment arm, will participate in a discussion hosted by Google Cloud on the theme “AI and Web3: Building a Trusted Digital Future.” HTX's global brand building has achieved initial success and is set to expand further.

As a pioneer in the crypto space, HTX has consistently spearheaded industry innovation and led the way in setting new trends over its 11-year history. Looking forward, HTX will continue to pursue its vision of achieving financial freedom for 8 billion people on earth. As Justin Sun stated, “With the joint efforts of HTX and TRON, we are confident that we can create a truly practical, convenient, and thriving Web3 ecosystem for users worldwide within the next decade.”
