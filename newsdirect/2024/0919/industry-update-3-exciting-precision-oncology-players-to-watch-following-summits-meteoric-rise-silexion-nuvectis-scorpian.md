# Industry Update: 3 Exciting Precision Oncology Players to Watch Following Summit’s Meteoric Rise: Silexion, Nuvectis, Scorpian

Summit Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SMMT) recently captured headlines with the release of its Phase 3 data for ivonescimab, a targeted NSCLC therapy that has generated substantial buzz. The results from its trial conducted in China showed a dramatic 49% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to Merck’s Keytruda, signaling a potentially disruptive force in NSCLC treatment. However, the news wasn’t without its concerns—since the trial data originates from China, there are questions about its applicability to broader, global populations. As noted by BMO Capital Markets’ Evan Seigerman: “Results may or may not be generalizable beyond the China-focused patient population initially assessed.” Despite this, Summit’s valuation has risen by over 100%, now approximating $19 billion. With such a high valuation, the company could see limited room for further significant gains, leading many in the industry to explore other emerging opportunities in precision oncology.

Alongside Summit, there are quite a few other players in the field. Some if these companies have even already shown promising initial results and could see similar success in the future if they were to report positive results. These emerging players are worth watching for those interested in following precision oncology drug candidates and pipelines. Among them are precision oncology innovators such as Silexion Therapeutics, Nuvectis Pharma, and Scorpion Therapeutics, which we discuss below.

Silexion Therapeutics: Disrupting the KRAS-Driven Cancer Space

Silexion Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SLXN) is another under-the-radar player in the precision oncology space, with a focus on KRAS-driven cancers—a notoriously difficult target in oncology. While current small-molecule KRAS inhibitors are making progress, they are often limited to specific mutations, such as KRAS G12C, which accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Silexion’s RNA interference (RNAi) approach offers a broader solution, targeting a wider spectrum of KRAS mutations, particularly in pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest and most treatment-resistant cancers.

At the heart of Silexion’s approach is its LODER™ platform, which delivers siRNA directly to the tumor site, silencing KRAS mutations at the genetic level. This localized delivery not only increases efficacy by concentrating the treatment in the tumor, but it also reduces systemic side effects. Silexion’s next-generation candidate, SIL-204, is an optimized siRNA formulation designed to target pan-KRAS G12x mutations, positioning it to treat a broader range of KRAS-driven cancers beyond pancreatic cancer, such as lung and colorectal cancers.

In Phase 2 trials for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, Silexion's LODER™ platform showed a 9.3-month improvement in overall survival when combined with standard chemotherapy. Additionally, the objective response rate (ORR) increased from 20% with chemotherapy alone to 55% with the combination, and in some cases, tumors that were initially non-resectable became operable after treatment with LODER™. These results are especially encouraging given the limited options available for pancreatic cancer patients. SIL-204, is expected to enter Phase 2/3 clinical trials in 2025-2026.

What makes Silexion particularly intriguing is its current market valuation. Valued at aproximatly just ~$9 million following its SPAC merger, the company’s valuation could be perceived as low when compared to some of its peers, especially given its innovative technology and promising clinical achievements. Some have wondered whether this low valuation has more to do with dynamics post-SPAC companies. If Silexion can report positive results in its later-stage trials, the company’s outlook could dramatically improve, reflecting the potential of its RNAi-based platform. Like NXP900, SIL-204 could potentially have vast applications across multiple KRAS-driven cancer types, making Silexion a company to watch closely as it advances through clinical development.

Nuvectis Pharma: Targeting NSCLC and Beyond by Inhibiting SRC/YES1 Kinases

Nuvectis Pharma (NASDAQ: NVCT) has been quietly making strides in the precision oncology sector, developing innovative therapies aimed at overcoming treatment resistance in hard-to-treat cancers. Its lead candidate, NXP900, targets NSCLC by inhibiting the SRC/YES1 kinases, which play critical roles in cancer cell survival and resistance to current therapies. This approach positions NXP900 as a potential game-changer in the treatment of NSCLC, particularly in patients who have developed resistance to EGFR and ALK inhibitors, such as AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso and Novartis’ Alecensa.

NXP900 is still in the early stages of clinical development, currently undergoing Phase 1 trials. However, preclinical studies have already shown that it has strong anti-tumor activity in resistant NSCLC models. Even more promising is its potential application beyond NSCLC. Like Summit's ivonescimab, NXP900 focuses on resistance, but it also has broader applications due to its ability to target multiple cancer types driven by SRC/YES1 pathways. This versatility makes it a promising asset not just for NSCLC but also for other difficult-to-treat cancers like squamous cell carcinomas.

In addition to NXP900, Nuvectis is advancing NXP800, another precision oncology candidate that is further along in the clinical development process. NXP800 is currently in Phase 1b trials, targeting ARID1a-mutated cancers such as ovarian and endometrial cancers. The early clinical data for NXP800 is promising, showing positive responses in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. With two strong candidates in the pipeline, Nuvectis is positioning itself as a formidable player in the precision oncology landscape. As Summit’s ivonescimab continues to gain attention, Nuvectis’ earlier-stage NXP900, with its NSCLC focus and beyond, could see similar success in the future if clinical results continue to trend positively.

Scorpion Therapeutics: Pioneering Mutant-Selective Therapies

Scorpion Therapeutics is redefining the frontier of precision oncology with its focus on delivering highly selective small molecules targeting validated and previously undruggable cancer mutations. Its lead candidate, STX-478, is a mutant-selective, allosteric PI3Kα inhibitor currently in Phase 1/2 trials for advanced solid tumors. Early data presented at the ESMO Congress 2024 highlighted its potential, with STX-478 demonstrating a 23% overall response rate in breast cancer and a 21% response rate across all tumor types, positioning it as a potentially best-in-class PI3Kα inhibitor.

STX-478 is notable for its ability to spare wild-type PI3Kα activity in normal tissues, avoiding the toxicities seen with previous PI3Kα inhibitors, such as hyperglycemia and rash. Tumor reductions were seen in 72% of patients treated with STX-478 as a monotherapy, with circulating tumor DNA levels dropping in 86% of patients. This mutant-selective precision could help overcome the limitations of existing PI3Kα inhibitors, which have struggled with dose-limiting toxicities.

In July 2024, Scorpion raised $150 million in a Series C financing round, co-led by Frazier Life Sciences and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The additional funding will support the advancement of STX-478 and other pipeline assets, positioning Scorpion for further clinical success. Scorpion’s pipeline includes a broad range of wholly-owned compounds that target both validated and novel cancer targets, positioning the company for future expansion into larger patient populations. As STX-478 progresses through clinical development, Scorpion is poised to become a significant player in the precision oncology space, making it another company worth watching closely.

Optimistic Outlook for Precision Oncology

The precision oncology space is experiencing a golden era of innovation, with companies like Summit Therapeutics, Nuvectis Pharma, Silexion Therapeutics, and Scorpion Therapeutics leading the charge. As the focus shifts towards targeted therapies that address resistance mechanisms, the market is increasingly favoring companies with novel approaches and broad applications. Summit’s meteoric rise has shown that there is tremendous potential for companies that can demonstrate efficacy in overcoming cancer resistance. While Summit has already captured much of the current attention, companies like Nuvectis, Silexion, and Scorpion, with their earlier-stage pipelines, offer exciting opportunities for the industry to keep a close eye on.

As these companies continue to report clinical data and advance through trials, the potential for breakthroughs in treating some of the most difficult cancers grows stronger. With targeted therapies offering the possibility of overcoming resistance without the need for chemotherapy, the future of cancer treatment looks brighter than ever. For those in the oncology space, keeping a close eye on emerging players like Nuvectis, Silexion, and Scorpion could lead to transformative developments as the field of precision oncology continues to evolve.
