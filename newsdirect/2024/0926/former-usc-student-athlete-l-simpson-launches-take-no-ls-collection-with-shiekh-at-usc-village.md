Current USC student, former USC football player and fashion entrepreneur L Simpson is rewriting the playbook for student-athletes with the exclusive launch of his highly anticipated streetwear collection, “Take No L’s”, at Shiekh at USC Village on Sept. 26. What began as a middle school project has evolved into a brand that embodies a mindset of relentless determination: no losses, only lessons – whether it’s on the court, field or in life. “Take No L’s” gained significant traction throughout Simpson’s high school basketball career at Sierra Canyon High School (Chatsworth, Calif.), where he captained his team to back-to-back California Open State Championships alongside notable teammates Scottie Pippen Jr., KJ Martin, Cassius Stanley and Christian Koloko. The brand’s momentum continued to increase when he joined USC’s renowned football program. Coached by USC head coach Lincoln Riley alongside former teammates and current NFL players, Caleb Williams, Jordan Addison and Brenden Rice, “Take No L’s” quickly became a regularly worn brand among his teammates and coaches.

“I’m thrilled for L,” said USC head coach Lincoln Riley. “It’s always great to watch our players achieve their dreams, both on and off of the field. Whether we’re on campus or around the city, our players and staff love wearing the brand. L is extremely bright and innovate, and I know he is going to be incredibly successful.”

“This launch is special,” says Simpson. “I shopped at Shiekh as a kid. Whenever Jordans would drop or when I wanted new athletic gear, I would always ask my parents to take me to Shiekh. It truly does feel like a full- circle moment. We’re not just selling clothes; we’re promoting a mindset of going after your dreams and never accepting defeat. That’s what Take No L’s stands for—no losses, just lessons.”

Take No L’s is a bold, confident and unapologetic premium streetwear brand featuring striking graphics and vibrant colors. The collection includes hoodies, cropped sweatshirts, t-shirts, sweatpants and hats, with prices ranging from $90 to $200. With significant attention from L’s influencer network, which boasts a combined reach of over 100 million followers, the brand is already generating buzz on social media.

Join Simpson on Sept. 26 from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. PT at Shiekh in USC Village for the official launch of the “Take No L’s” collection. Experience firsthand why “Take No L’s” is setting a new standard in streetwear. The event will include special appearances, exclusive products and live entertainment featuring stars like Storm Reid, Brenden Rice, Riri Simpson, Jazz Hill, Temi Ojoro, Tade Ojoro, Ceyair Wright, Amber Jasmine, Lboogz, and Saint Thomas. Don't miss this exciting celebration of fashion and culture!
