# DB Schenker collaborates with Microsoft
Cloud Logistics on low carbon
intercontinental transportation and
sustainable logistics

DB Schenker is collaborating with Microsoft Cloud Logistics for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), highlighting their collective ambition to comprehensively reduce the environmental footprint of their transportation practices. This pivotal effort also includes building best-in-class logistics warehouses and implementing alternative energy trucks. It signifies an important step towards reducing the carbon emissions associated with their logistics operations (Scope 3) compared to transportation associated with conventional fossil-based fuels and thus supports their overarching environmental sustainability goals.

Jochen Thewes, CEO of DB Schenker: “Microsoft and DB Schenker, that’s two global leaders united to reduce emissions in transportation and logistics. Our cooperation is expected to demonstrate that significant CO2e-savings are feasible already in today’s intercontinental supply chains. The upgrade of the Netherlands warehouse to BREEAM Excellent status and the Illinois, United States SuperHub receiving the LEED Platinum Certification are prime examples of our dedication to paving the way for more sustainable and innovative logistics solutions.”

Cliff Henson, CVP of Microsoft Cloud Supply Chain: “Microsoft Cloud Logistics is committed to leading the way in sustainable logistics. Our collaboration with DB Schenker has enabled the development of cutting-edge sustainable warehouses along with innovative fuel strategies across all modes of freight, exemplifying our dedication to setting industry standards in the logistics environmental sustainability arena. These efforts mark a significant step forward in our efforts to reduce our environmental impacts in line with Microsoft’s 2030 sustainability commitments.”

Sustainable Aviation and Maritime Fuels will be procured by DB Schenker and allocated to Microsoft Cloud Logistics’ inbound Air and Ocean shipments, and is anticipated to result in a reduction of at least 15.000 t of CO2e-emissions per year. In March 2024, DB Schenker also implemented the use of Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO or Renewable Diesel) for all ocean shipments traveling from California to Texas. In addition, DB Schenker has extended its environmental sustainability efforts with Microsoft Cloud to land transport in Europe and North America with HVO100 fueling stations and electric vehicles.

Furthermore, advanced logistics warehouses, designed to streamline operations and enhance network efficiency while minimizing environmental impact using renewable energies, are at the heart of DB Schenker and Microsoft Cloud’s collaborative efforts. DB Schenker and Microsoft Cloud Logistics’ facility in Illinois, United States achieved LEED Platinum-certification, which is the highest level of certification granted by the U.S. Green Building Council and demonstrates DB Schenker's leadership in environmental and community stewardship. In addition to the SuperHub in the United States, Microsoft Cloud Logistics’ Netherlands warehouse carries the BREEAM Certificate Level “Excellent,” thus ensuring these warehouses meet high standards of energy efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, and enhancing occupant well-being.
