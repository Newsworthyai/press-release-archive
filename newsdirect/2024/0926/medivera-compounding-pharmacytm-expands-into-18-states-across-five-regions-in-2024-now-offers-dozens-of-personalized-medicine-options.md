# MediVera Compounding Pharmacy™ Expands into 18 States Across Five Regions in 2024, Now Offers Dozens of Personalized Medicine Options

MediVera Compounding Pharmacy™, a leader in personalized medicine since 1999, announced today that it has officially been licensed to serve residents in 18 new states across the West, Southwest, Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast regions in 2024. The licenses allow MediVera to fill compounding prescriptions—including semaglutide and tirzepatide—throughout these states. This expansion broadens the company’s geographical reach, reflecting its commitment to providing personalized compounding services to prescribers and patients nationwide.

The new states include:

* West Region: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, Wyoming
* Southwest Region: Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma
* Southeast Region: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia
* Midwest Region: South Dakota
* Northeast Region: Connecticut, Maine

The licenses were issued between January 24, 2024, and August 13, 2024, by the respective State Boards of Pharmacy following rigorous application and compliance processes that require MediVera to meet or exceed governmental regulations and recommendations. MediVera is PCAB Accredited in both sterile and non-sterile compounding, certifying ethical and quality standards met by only 1% of compounding pharmacies nationwide. Prescribers and patients in these states are now welcome to use MediVera’s services, effective immediately.

“We are absolutely thrilled with the opportunity to do business in these new states,” said MediVera CEO Bradley McCloskey, PharmD. “MediVera has been dedicated to changing lives with the industry standard in personalized medicine since it was founded by my father over 20 years ago. Bringing that simple mission to states across the country—and now to these additional 18 states—is a dream come true.”

This growth coincides with an increased interest in compounded medications, including hormone replacement therapy and solutions for men’s and women’s health. MediVera has responded with an ongoing nationwide expansion effort, growing its footprint to include 37 states, with more licenses expected before the end of the year.
