Falls are the leading cause of injury and death among aging adults in America, including our nation’s 8.1 million veterans over 65. Due to chronic conditions and physical disabilities, they are actually more susceptible to falls than their non-veteran counterparts. With more than one in five veterans living alone in America, many are in unsafe situations.

Staying strong and healthy is the best way to prevent falls, but there are many other ways to decrease the risk. Making simple updates in the home, such as removing throw rugs, improving lighting, installing grab bars, using bed rails, widening hallways and doorways and adding ramps outside, can enhance safety and prevent common accidents. But even so, a fall may still occur. Unfortunately, constant physical monitoring and surveillance aren’t possible for a lot of people, and how quickly help comes could mean the difference between a non-fatal or fatal injury.

That’s where LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK), a leading provider of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communication devices and IoT technologies, is making a significant impact for those in these situations. Instead of relying on in-person monitoring, the company uses advanced technology to offer a comprehensive suite of products aimed at protecting users from falls both at home and on the go.

Confidence And Independence In A Compact Device LogicMark’s Freedom Alert Mini is a compact 4G LTE device that allows users to call for help with just the push of a button, ensuring help is always within reach wherever there is cellular service. The Freedom Alert Mini is equipped with LogicMark’s patented fall detection technology which uses accelerometer sensors that measure the user’s speed and orientation to detect a fall. When a fall has been detected, the device sends an alert to a 24/7 monitoring center, a loved one or 911. This can be life-saving if a user falls and is unable to dial an emergency contact due to an injury, loss of consciousness, or disorientation.

In addition to its fall detection capabilities, the device features GPS location services that can pinpoint the exact location of a fall and alert authorities and caregivers. It also includes geofencing capabilities, allowing caregivers to establish a virtual boundary for their loved ones. If the device user moves beyond this designated area, caregivers receive an immediate alert.

Guardian Alert 911 Plus is an additional on-the-go device in LogicMark’s product line. It is designed to enhance safety both inside and outside the home and features 4G LTE technology that enables users to connect directly to 911 with a single button press. Additionally, the device includes a two-way communication feature, allowing users to speak directly with 911 operators during emergencies. This functionality provides users with the confidence to live independently, knowing help is just a call away.

Veterans Can Feel Safe At Home70% of falls occur indoors. For veterans who spend considerable time at home, LogicMark’s Freedom Alert and Guardian Alert 911 offer reliable solutions to enhance safety and peace of mind. Both wearable medical devices use the customer’s landline to connect to emergency services. The Freedom Alert allows users to quickly connect with friends, family or 911 in an emergency. With the push of a button, the device can call up to four pre-programmed contacts or dial 911 directly. Emergency responders can pinpoint the location of a LogicMark device within a 600-foot radius of the base unit. The Guardian 911 connects directly to emergency services with a single button press. Ensuring users can easily call for help or notify a caregiver even during stressful or confusing moments. Both devices feature long-lasting batteries that last at least one month.

These devices give aging adults freedom and confidence, knowing help is a push of a button away. For caregivers and loved ones, the devices offer an added layer of monitoring and peace of mind when they cannot be present. Meanwhile, first responders receive crucial information that enables them to reach the scene quickly and efficiently.

Globally, the fall detection systems market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% from now through 2030. Driving that growth is the demand for solutions to ensure the aging adult population's safety and independence with devices that can aid in home health care. LogicMark’s products check off both boxes.

Aging adults over 65 make up half the nation’s veterans, and just like their non-veteran counterparts, they are at risk of falls. As the population ages, demand for devices that detect falls is projected to grow. LogicMark aims to capitalize on this growth, positioning its devices – from the Freedom Alert Mini to the Guardian Alert 911 Plus – as potential leaders in the market.
