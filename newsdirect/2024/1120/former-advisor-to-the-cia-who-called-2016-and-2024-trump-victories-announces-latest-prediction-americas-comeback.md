# Former Advisor to the CIA Who Called 2016 and 2024 Trump Victories Announces Latest Prediction: “America’s Comeback”

Washington D.C, November 20, 2024 — Jim Rickards, renowned economist, bestselling author, and former advisor to the CIA, Pentagon, and White House, is releasing his latest forecast for America’s future under a new Trump administration. Known for accurately predicting Trump’s 2016 and 2024 victories, the COVID-19 crisis, and Biden’s recent exit from the 2024 presidential race, Rickards now predicts what he calls “America’s Comeback” a vision for Trump’s first 100 days in office.

According to Rickards, Trump’s plans could initiate a seismic shift in America’s energy landscape, marking a departure from previous green energy policies to a more resilient and independent energy approach.

“With Trump returning to the White House, we’re on the brink of a pivotal shift,” Rickards stated. “America’s Comeback Blueprint lays out the strategies I believe are essential for stabilizing our economy, securing our energy resources, and reclaiming American independence.”

Key Elements of “America’s Comeback Blueprint”Energy Independence Through Nuclear Innovation

Rickards predicts that Trump’s plan will focus on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), advanced nuclear technology capable of producing reliable, pollution-free energy. This shift, Rickards says, could not only make the U.S. energy independent but also shield the economy from global energy disruptions.

Regulatory Overhaul to Enable Swift Energy Deployment

Rickards expects Trump to prioritize reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), aiming to fast-track the deployment of nuclear technologies. This shift, he says, could pave the way for SMRs to play a central role in American energy production, stabilizing the grid and lowering energy costs.
