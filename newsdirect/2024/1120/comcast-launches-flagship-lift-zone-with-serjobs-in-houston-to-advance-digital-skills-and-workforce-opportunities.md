# COMCAST LAUNCHES FLAGSHIP LIFT ZONE WITH SERJOBS IN HOUSTON TO ADVANCE DIGITAL SKILLS AND WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES

Comcast today unveiled its second Flagship Lift Zone in Houston’s East End that will help advance digital skills and opportunities for thousands of people. The Flagship Lift Zone, powered by Comcast Business, is located at SERJobs’ Workforce Resource and Training Center and includes a grant of more than $500,000 to fund a comprehensive technology makeover and expanded programming to teach digital and technical skills. Building on its legacy of the award-winning Lift Zones program, SERJobs is the first Flagship location in Texas and one of 54 Lift Zones across the Houston metro area.

“Lift Zones are about more than just providing free access to the Internet. They are about teaching people how to use the power of broadband to transform their lives and careers,” said Loren Hudson, SVP and Chief Diversity Officer, Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast. “The biggest barrier to getting online is not having the skills or the resources to do so. With this Flagship Lift Zone, SERJobs is poised to make an even more profound impact, bridging the digital divide and opening doors to unlimited possibilities for thousands of Houstonians.”

In addition to the existing free Wi-Fi, the Flagship Lift Zone’s facility and technology makeover includes:

* Renovations and design refresh in conference rooms, tech labs, training spaces, breakrooms and common areas.
* 48 new computers (38 desktops and10 laptops).
* Single and double occupancy privacy pods for either virtual or in-person meetings, trainings and job interviews.
* Upgraded audio and visual equipment in training and conference room areas.
* Additional seating with expanded Wi-Fi access throughout the facility.

Comcast has been a decade-long partner of SERJobs. Over that time, Comcast has donated more than 1,000 new laptops and provided tens of thousands of dollars in grants to support and expand digital skills training.

“The launch of the Comcast Lift Zone at SERJobs’ Workforce Resource and Training Center, is a game-changer for the Greater Houston community and the countless underserved individuals who will be served as a result,” SERJobs Chief Executive Officer Sheroo Mukhtiar said. “By providing access to essential digital literacy resources, this initiative not only empowers individuals to thrive in the digital age but also opens new doors for workforce development and economic opportunities. Together, we can transform lives and create a more inclusive and empowered community. We are so grateful to Comcast for the generosity and partnership!”

Over the last three years, Comcast Texas has made more than $3 million in cash and in-kind contributions to more than 60 Houston-area nonprofit organizations. These contributions support local community programs that help establish and promote the company’s Digital Equity Network in Texas. Comcast’s network of digital equity partners helps people acquire computers, provides digital skills trainings and offers opportunities for community members to explore and train for careers in tech-related fields. They can also develop the kinds of digital skills that can help them pursue better careers and even launch and grow their own businesses.

Comcast’s Lift Zones are part of Project UP, the company’s $1 billion commitment to advance digital opportunity and build a future of unlimited possibilities. Since its launch in 2020, Lift Zones have provided essential internet access for those in need outside the home, with more than 1,250 locations across the country. It also complements Comcast’s Internet Essentials program, which offers low-cost in-home broadband connectivity to qualifying households.
