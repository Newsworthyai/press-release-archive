Recently, Michael Saylor excited the crypto community with a new Bitcoin (BTC) tweet. Meanwhile, KangaMoon (KANG) announced a major partnership with RaidSharks. Many analysts hint that this Stage 5 presale star may become the next $0.5 meme coin in 2024. Another meme coin making headlines is Pepe (PEPE), recently listed on Coinbase.

Michael Saylor With a Bullish Bitcoin StatementBitcoin (BTC) has been making waves in the crypto market. Over the last week alone, the price of BTC increased from $63,785 to $64,431. The Bitcoin market cap surged from $1.26T to $1.28T during that time. The former CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, stated that Bitcoin is refreshing. Many Bitcoin traders commented on this tweet and agreed with this statement.

This Bitcoin news may cause a rally for this crypto. Regarding its technical analysis, over 15 technical indicators are now green. Additionally, the Bitcoin crypto is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Thus, experts in the crypto field predict a potential rise to $84,321 for Bitcoin before Q2 of 2024 ends.

KangaMoon (KANG): New Partnership With RaidSharks At the same time, KangaMoon (KANG) is a meme coin rapidly gaining popularity. It recently announced a significant collaboration with RaidSharks, which will help it cement its standing in the industry. With this development, KangaMoon players will experience thrilling raids and a $1,000 monthly pool.

This partnership will help increase community engagement in this upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. In KangaMoon's game, KANG will serve as the primary in-game currency. With KANG, you can buy in-game items and upgrade your characters. Additionally, KangaMoon revealed it will provide all holders of this meme coin with exclusive challenges for extra rewards.

Another primary focus of KangaMoon is giving back to its community. KangaMoon is now providing the most active community members with free KANG before its official launch. Thus, over 29,000 registered community members are now rushing to like and share KangaMoon's social media content.

This meme coin is currently in Stage 5 of its presale, which has raised over $5.8M and is on pace to hit $6M before April 2024 ends. One KANG now costs only $0.0196 - a 290% rise from its starting price. Experts are bullish, given its ties to the P2E gaming market, which may reach $885M by 2028. They forecast a jump to $0.5 once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in Q2 of 2024.

Pepe (PEPE): Now Trading on CoinbaseAfter encountering technical issues, Coinbase announced that the Pepe (PEPE) perpetual futures contracts are now in full-trading mode. After this bullish Pepe news, its value soared from $0.0000051 to $0.0000078 on the 1-week chart. This meme coin's market cap increased from $2.17B to $3.28B during that time.

Not only that, but the Pepe coin is now trading above its 21- and 50-day EMAs. For these reasons, prominent market analysts predict that the Pepe crypto will reach a value of $0.0042 before the end of Q2 2024. This makes Pepe one of the meme coins to watch this year.

Bitcoin vs. KangaMoon vs. Pepe - Which One Can Pump First? In this crypto battle, KangaMoon emerges as the victor with a low market cap of $19.6M. This means KANG needs fewer new funds for its price to rise compared to Bitcoin and Pepe. Thus, KangaMoon is one of the most promising meme coins to watch.
