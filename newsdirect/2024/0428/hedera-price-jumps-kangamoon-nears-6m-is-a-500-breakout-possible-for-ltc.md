Mixed reactions have trailed trading activities in the crypto space as investors contemplate projects to invest in. Hedera (HBAR) price has witnessed a massive rally after users misinterpreted the announcement involving the renounced crypto asset manager, BlackRock. Meanwhile, Litecoin (LTC) is among the best cryptos, and experts wonder if a breakout of $500 is possible for the top crypto coin.

In another development, KangaMoon (KANG) is offering new investors a 20% incentive on all purchases. Experts believe KangaMoon is one of the top crypto coins worth investing in the year.

When considering the best cryptos to buy in Q2, KangaMoon should top your list.

Hedera (HBAR) Price Skyrockets Amidst BlackRock Tokenization SagaHedera Price has surged massively after traders misinterpreted news of BlackRock Money market fund tokenization on the Hedera blockchain. While the initial news suggested that Blackrock chose Hedera for the project, which was not the case, the blockchain trading and infrastructure firms Archax and Ownera have debunked the news. In a tweet, they said that the choice of selecting Hedera came from them and not from BlackRock.

Meanwhile, data from CoinMarketCap showed that amidst the latest news, Hedera's price gained 66% in the past week and 45% in the past day. Also, the Hedera trading volume has surged by over 6000% in the past day, with the market cap hitting over $4.5B. While the coin has retraced after the news was clarified, analysts believe the Hedera price will hit $0.20 in May.

Litecoin's (LTC) bullish rally continues, Is a $500 breakout Possible?Litecoin is one of the top crypto coins on the market now. It has been on a bullish rally for some time, which has led to an inflow of investors. The latest Litecoin news has been positive, which might be the reason for the rally. A few weeks ago, it displaced other cryptos to become the most widely used crypto for payment in Bitpay.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Litecoin's price has increased by 11% in the past week. The Litecoin trading volume and market cap are surging, which could trigger another rally soon. Although the coin is trading below $100, some analysts believe a surge to $500 is possible in 2024.
