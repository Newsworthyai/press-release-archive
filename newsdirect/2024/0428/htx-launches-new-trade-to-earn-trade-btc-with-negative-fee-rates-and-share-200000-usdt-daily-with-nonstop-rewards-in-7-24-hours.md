# HTX Launches New “Trade to Earn”: Trade BTC with Negative Fee Rates and Share 200,000 USDT Daily with Nonstop Rewards in 7*24 Hours!

--News Direct--

On April 28, HTX officially launches the brand-new "Trade to Earn" event. While trading BTC with negative fee rates, users can share a daily $HTX prize pool worth 200,000 USDT with non-stop rewards in 7*24 hours. This upgraded event marks a significant innovation in HTX's user participation mechanism. HTX aims to provide more users with diverse and fair participation opportunities and improve their trading experience.

HTX's “Trade to Earn” event includes spot trading and futures trading. Users can trade BTC/USDT in spot and BTCUSDT perpetual in futures to share respective daily $HTX prize pools worth 100,000 USDT. Participants must have a Rocket count of ≥ 300 and successfully register on the event page. After registration, you'll receive a random airdrop reward ranging from 1 to 88 USDT in futures trial bonuses.

In addition to concurrent spot and futures trading, HTX's “Trade to Earn” proposes an innovative 24/7 reward mechanism. The daily prize pool is divided into 24 portions, with a new portion released every hour to ensure that users have equal participation opportunities at different times. It should be noted that rewards in the hourly prize pool every day are given on a first-come, first-served basis, determined by the actual fee generation time of participants' trades.

According to the announcement, the event runs from 12:00:00 (UTC) on April 28, 2024, to 11:59:59 (UTC) on May 5, 2024. The "Trade to Earn" event is on a daily basis. A day is defined from 12:00 (UTC) on Day T to 11:59 (UTC) on Day T+1. Event rewards will be calculated and updated starting on Day T+2 at 04:00 (UTC). Eligible users can claim their rewards of $HTX after the time.

Furthermore, the reward ratio for Maker orders is 110%, while the reward ratio for Taker orders is 105%. The maximum daily reward per participant is 3,000 USDT for Spot "Trade to Earn" and 5,000 USDT for Futures "Trade to Earn".

Notably, all net fees generated from trading BTC/USDT in spot and BTCUSDT perpetual in futures during the event will be used for $HTX buybacks and burns to support the stable $HTX appreciation.

It is reported that since HTX launched the Spot "Trade to Earn" event, it has garnered broad user participation and received positive feedback. In the recent Futures "Trade to Earn" - Bitcoin Halving Special Edition, 100,000 USDT trading rewards were distributed within 10 minutes. In the future, as one of the world's leading crypto exchanges, HTX will consistently adhere to the principle of prioritizing users, providing users with richer and higher-quality trading services through continuous innovation and optimization, thereby propelling the sustainable development of the cryptocurrency industry.
