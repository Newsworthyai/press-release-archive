Advantages of the First-Generation Member Program

In BDDAI's development strategy, the First-Generation Member (A) Program is considered key to team building. Rajesh Vaidya particularly emphasized the importance of increasing first-generation members: "The more first-generation members there are, the more people will join the team." He explained that inviting first-generation members not only brings substantial commissions but also forms a solid and rapidly expanding team network.

Specific advantages of the First-Generation Member Program include:

Expanding the Team Network: First-generation members (A) are the cornerstone of team development. Their joining will drive the recruitment of more second-generation members (B) and third-generation members (C), creating a stable and continuously expanding team structure.

Increasing Earnings: The growth of first-generation members will directly impact your team earnings. Increasing the number of first-generation members means more commission and income opportunities.

Enhancing Team Cohesion: A strong first-generation member team will enhance the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the entire team, promoting internal cooperation and support.

Successful Organization of Core Team In-Person Meeting

After the new office was established, Rajesh Vaidya swiftly organized an in-person meeting with core team members. This meeting was an important step in BDDAI's strategic development, aiming to strengthen the cohesion and execution of the core team. Rajesh engaged in in-depth discussions with the core team members about BDDAI's vision, development strategy, and how to achieve rapid team expansion through the First-Generation Member Program.

He emphasized the importance of teamwork and how to leverage BDDAI's platform resources to achieve a win-win situation for both individuals and the team. Through this meeting, the core team members gained a clearer understanding of BDDAI's development goals, and the morale and confidence of the entire team were significantly boosted.
