Stefano Marani, CEO of Renergen (JSE: REN) (ASX: RLT), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Renergen is an emerging helium and liquefied natural gas producer with existing production and sales of compressed natural gas. The company holds the first and only onshore petroleum production rights in South Africa, giving it a first-mover advantage in the distribution of domestic natural gas.

It has now brought online its brand new liquid helium and natural gas plant in South Africa, making it only one of eight countries in the world that produce the essential resource.
