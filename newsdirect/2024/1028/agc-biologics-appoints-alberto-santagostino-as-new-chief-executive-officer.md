# AGC Biologics Appoints Alberto Santagostino as new Chief Executive Officer

AGC Biologics, a leading global Biopharmaceutical Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), today announced the appointment of Alberto Santagostino to Chief Executive Officer and President of AGC Biologics, effective November 1st. Alberto has had a distinguished career in biotech, pharma and managing large-scale global CDMO operations. His expertise and knowledge will lead AGC Biologics’ next chapter as the company reemphasizes delivering reliable services to biopharmaceutical developers without unnecessary complications.

AGC Biologics will have a friendly business approach with customers and provide them with expert CDMO services to become an increasingly preferred service provider. AGC Biologics intends to be valued as collaborative, reliable and stable: it will be a safe harbor for those customers seeking to minimize geopolitical risks, intellectual property concerns, steep price expectations and transactional or confrontational supplier relationships. This direction builds on the company’s 30 years of biopharma CDMO experience, including serving more than 250 customers across over 400 different projects, with more than 90 successful regulatory inspections and 25 commercial products launched.

Alberto joins AGC Biologics after most recently serving as the Head of Cell and Gene Technology (CGT) at Lonza for six years. While there, his business unit grew four-fold in size by enabling clients to advance four new CGT therapies to commercial production and many more to late-stage clinical milestones, with now thousands of patients being cured annually. During his tenure, Alberto led the industrialization of CGT therapeutics manufacturing: from a “science workshop” into “industrial scale compliant operations” with several positive Pre-Approval Inspections (PAI) from the U.S. FDA and EMA that led to three CGT biomanufacturing sites becoming licensed for commercial supply.

Before Lonza, Alberto was a Partner in the Pharmaceutical & Medical Product practice at McKinsey & Co., serving more than 70 clients with over 200 projects. While there, Alberto developed a proprietary operational benchmark that analyzed the performance of more than 30 biomanufacturing sites and published books and articles about Biopharma operations. Alberto currently serves as a board member for the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM) and holds a degree in Industrial Biotechnology from the University of Milano-Bicocca and a Master of Business Administration from Politecnico di Milano.

“I am excited to announce Alberto is joining us to lead AGC Biologics and to set the tone for the coming years. We share the common vision of service, delivery and quality that is at the core of AGC Group’s business philosophy,” said Murano Tadashi, President of AGC Life Science Company. “I am confident Alberto will bring both a wide knowledge of the biopharma industry and the experience of successfully leading growth at scale. He will enhance AGC Biologics’ reputation as an increasingly preferable CDMO in the industry.”

“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve AGC Biologics and its team members and customers. We will have customers at the heart of our action and our technical talent as the enabler of our CDMO’s aspiration of friendly & expert services to the biopharma industry,” said Alberto Santagostino, new Chief Executive Officer at AGC Biologics. “Over the last several years our industry has faced more complexity. Chemistry Manufacturing Control (CMC), technical development and manufacturing have been a headache for the biopharma industry, also, and sometimes especially, when dealing with CDMOs. AGC Biologics aspires to become an easy choice. We will be a friendly CDMO to work with, expert and reliable in our technical role. We will leverage our technical talent, established centers of excellence, commercial track record, growing capacity at our global sites and the solidity of the parent company, to offer reliability while staying uncomplicated to work with. Ultimately, ‘#YourfriendlyCDMOexpert.’”
