# Greg Olsen's Youth Inc. Expands with New Podcast Season and Upcoming Commerce Platform

Youth Inc., the first digital media network dedicated exclusively to youth sports content and commerce, today announced that Season Two of its popular Youth Inc. Podcast will launch on Wednesday, Oct. 30. Following the company’s 2024 $4.5 million seed funding round, led by Will Ventures, Youth Inc. is developing a new centralized hub blending news, original content, and retail for the youth sports market.

Launched in 2022, Season One of the Youth Inc. Podcast featured conversations with iconic athletes like Jerry Rice, Russell Wilson, Jennie Finch, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. After a breakout debut season with more than 400,000 downloads, millions of impressions, and a nearly perfect viewership rating, Youth Inc. Is expanding its vision as it prepares to launch Season Two. Co-founded by Emmy Award-winning NFL analyst and Pro Bowl tight end Greg Olsen, former Fanatics executive Ryan Baise and Audacy, Inc.’s Tim Murphy, the podcast will feature acclaimed sports psychologist Dr. Michael Gervais as co-host, offering crucial insights for navigating today’s complex youth sports landscape.

“While there are more than 30 million young athletes in our country today, there has never been a platform designed to speak directly to families, coaches, and players about the challenges of today’s current state of play,” said Olsen. “Season one taught us invaluable lessons, and we're excited to bring even more insights and depth in Season Two. Partnering with Dr. Gervais, we’ll provide our audience with the tools and knowledge to succeed, all while making the journey engaging and enjoyable."

Season Two of the podcast will address the critical challenges young athletes face today including fostering resilience, managing the pressures of competition, and leveraging mindset training for long-term success. The six-episode season is presented by two Founding Partners: Players Health, a sports technology company offering digital risk management services and insurance products to ensure a secure environment for athletes, and MaxU, a cutting-edge platform providing personalized, 24/7 support to help young athletes build skills that enhance their mental performance and overall development.

As Youth Inc. enhances its content offerings, it is also set to launch a robust commerce platform in early 2025, designed to further support young athletes and their families. Led by former Fanatics head of new ventures, Ryan Baise, the platform will offer a range of products and services tailored specifically for youth sports families and coaches.

"The youth sports landscape is ripe for transformation, and we believe our platform will revolutionize how families access vital information and resources," said Baise. "Our aim is to create a comprehensive marketplace where parents, athletes, and coaches can discover rigorously vetted content and products that reflect the investment they make in their young athletes' futures."
