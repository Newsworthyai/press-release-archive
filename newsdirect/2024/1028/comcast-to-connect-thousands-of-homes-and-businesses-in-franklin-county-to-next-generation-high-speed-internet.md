# Comcast To Connect Thousands of Homes and Businesses in Franklin County to Next-Generation High Speed Internet

Comcast today announced plans for a major expansion of its fiber network to connect thousands of homes and businesses across Franklin County. With this expansion, residents and businesses in the cities of Preston and Franklin, and other nearby communities, will have access to fast, secure, reliable services, including Xfinity Internet and Mobile, and Comcast Business Internet and Mobile. The expansion is expected to be completed in early 2026 and is made possible through a public-private partnership agreement between Comcast and the State of Idaho, which includes grant award funding from the Idaho Capital Projects Fund Broadband Infrastructure Grant.

“Comcast’s expansion of its fiber network into the City of Preston will allow residents to have a choice for their Internet experience. It will further close the digital divide and connect residences to the larger global network and all of Franklin County, which sits at the northern end of Cache Valley,” said Chris Larsen Preston, Preston, Idaho City Council Member and City Public Relations, Liaison to County Commissioners. “We have already seen growth in this area and will continue to do so due to our geographic location. This infrastructure will ensure opportunities for growth in our business sectors and put us in a position to empower residents and entrepreneurs to stay connected now and into the future."

Once available, residential customers will have access to Comcast Xfinity’s full suite of products and services, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and managed home solutions. Local businesses will also have access to Comcast Business, which powers more small businesses in America and offers a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

“The Idaho Office of Broadband is excited for the expansion of broadband infrastructure in rural Idaho communities," said Ramon S. Hobdey-Sanchez, J.D., Idaho State Broadband Program Manager. “These public-private partnerships with Internet service providers – like Comcast – will help ensure every Idaho resident has access to reliable, high-speed Internet, regardless of where they live. Together, we can bridge the digital divide and empower people with the tools they need to survive in today's connected world.”

Comcast’s commitment to communities goes beyond network expansion and aims to increase economic mobility through programs that help bridge the digital divide like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households high-speed Internet for $9.95/month, and Internet Essentials Plus which is available for $29.95/month. Affordable computers are also available through Internet Essentials.

“Our fiber network expansion in Franklin County, Idaho represents a significant milestone in our commitment to connecting communities,” said Kyle Weaver, Sr. Director of Construction, Comcast Mountain West Region. “This project underscores the critical importance of public-private partnerships, which have been instrumental in bringing next-generation connectivity to this region. By working together with local leaders, we’re not just building infrastructure; we’re creating opportunities for residents and businesses to thrive in today’s digital world.”
