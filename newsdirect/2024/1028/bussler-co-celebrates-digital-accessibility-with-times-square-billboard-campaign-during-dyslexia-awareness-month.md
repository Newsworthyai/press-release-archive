The billboard, visible to hundreds of thousands of daily Times Square visitors, pairs high-contrast typography with recognized blue awareness ribbons, demonstrating how a billboard design can be inclusive. The clear message and dyslexic-friendly Comic Sans font create an eye-catching display while maintaining readability.

"We wanted our message about digital accessibility to exemplify best practices in accessible design," said Frederik Bussler, founder and CEO of Bussler & Co.
