# From Nuvalent to Nuvectis Pharma: New Report Highlights NXP900's Synergy in NSCLC and Anticipated NXP800 Data Update

A new report from PESG Research underscores Nuvectis Pharma’s (NASDAQ: NVCT) innovative approach to treatment resistance within precision oncology. The report highlights Nuvectis' NXP900 for its promising synergy in NSCLC and builds anticipation around an upcoming data update for NXP800, potentially positioning Nuvectis alongside notable industry players such as Nuvalent (NASDAQ: NUVL) and Summit Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SMMT), both highlighted in previous analyses.

According to the PESG report, NXP900—currently in Phase 1—showed strong synergy with market-leading ALK inhibitors by inhibiting ALK fusion-positive NSCLC cells resistant to alectinib (marketed by Roche) and lorlatinib (marketed by Pfizer). These results, presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Symposium, add significant momentum to Nuvectis’ growing pipeline, which is rapidly gaining industry attention. Readers are encourged to read the full report and its disclaimers and disclosures which are linked at the end of this update.

NXP900’s Targeted Approach in Overcoming ResistanceIn preclinical studies, NXP900 enhanced the effectiveness of ALK inhibitors by targeting SRC/YES1 kinases, which address resistance pathways often beyond the reach of standard ALK inhibitors. This mechanism could provide a vital option for patients with limited treatments, with PESG suggesting that NXP900’s synergy with existing therapies might make it a strong first-line combination candidate to reshape NSCLC treatment standards.

NXP800 Data Update Draws Broader AnticipationWhile NXP900 garners attention in NSCLC, Nuvectis is also preparing for a data update on NXP800, a candidate targeting platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancer. This update is highly anticipated, as it will likely provide insights not only into tumor shrinking capabilities but also into managing thrombocytopenia, a side effect seen in earlier trials. Positive findings here could further solidify Nuvectis’ role in precision oncology.

Drawing Comparisons: Nuvectis vs. Nuvalent and SummitThe PESG report places Nuvectis in comparison with notable oncology players, such as Nuvalent, whose ALK inhibitor programs target complex NSCLC cases and hold a current market cap of approximately $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Summit Therapeutics recently saw substantial growth with ivonescimab in another NSCLC subset, with its market cap reaching $15 billion. With a current valuation of $150 million, some suggest that Nuvectis has the potential to follow a similar trajectory as it approaches clinical milestones.

Experienced Leadership with a Stake in Nuvectis’ FutureNuvectis’ leadership team has garnered industry confidence through a track record of successful drug approvals and high-value milestones. CEO Ron Bentsur, along with CFO Shay Shemesh and COO Enrique Poradosu, collectively own approximately 35% of the company, aligning closely with shareholder interests. The team’s experience and proven performance in guiding oncology companies through IPOs and transformative growth cycles could potentially set a strong foundation for Nuvectis’ trajectory.

As the data for NXP900 and NXP800 unfolds, Nuvectis, if successful in its journey, could follow a path similar to Nuvalent and Summit, capturing market interest by addressing cancer resistance with precision.
