Global audio leader Audible has named the duo-language podcast series ‘Bistec’, the eight-part audio series about betrayal and redemption in Revolutionary Cuba, one of its 2024 “Lo Mejor del Año” Podcast Winners for Fiction.

Audible’s inaugural award is being widely promoted across its platform and as part of a media campaign that also highlights other best of 2024 audiobooks, podcasts, and Originals. The full list of winners can be found at https://www.audible.com/es_US.

“This is an awesome honor for me and the entire team of producers, actors, editors, and musicians who joined to tell this story,” said Manuel Ruiz-Barrera, who wrote and directed the historical drama and is co-founder of Nuestro Studios, a division of Nuestro Stories and Brilla Media that produced ‘Bistec.’ “This prestigious recognition, and the massive views and listens we’ve generated across digital platforms underscore why the timeless and timely story of ‘Bistec’ must come to the big screen, which is our ultimate goal.”

Following its sizzling summer debut, Bistec has generated more than 1.5 million views and listens across multiple digital platforms in Spanish and English, including YouTube in Spanish, and English, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Audible, Instagram, and more. (The visual trailer for the audio series, which represents the next stage of what producers believe will become a feature film, can be viewed here).

As part of the next stage of the ‘Bistec’ film project, the producers are about to launch pre-orders for the related photobook called ‘Surreal Cuba’ that will launch in early 2025.

The Story Behind ‘Bistec’Produced by Nuestro Studios, a division of Brilla Media Ventures, ‘Bistec’ is the riveting story of a longtime Cuban Revolutionary and what happens when one of the nation’s prominent dissidents moves into his neighborhood, exposing secrets, upending lives, and testing loyalties. Set during the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution in 2009, ‘Bistec’ unveils the contemporary world of Cuba’s enigmatic surveillance and snitches system, all within the framework of a compelling, emotional narrative filled with unexpected twists.

This is the first story to ever delve deeply into the secret world of Cuba’s widely despised but little known Comités de Defensa de la Revolución (CDR), the neighborhood government apparatus Fidel Castro cherished so much he branded “the vanguard of the Revolution.”

Bistec leans on events from the life of Micaela Ruiz, the late poet grandmother of writer Ruiz-Barrera, as well as the strange adventures he experienced during four documentary photography trips he made to Cuba in the early ‘90s. Prominent dissidents Amaury Pacheco del Monte, and his wife Iris Hernandez, co-founders of El Movimiento San Isidro, served as key story consultants and also play characters in the series.
