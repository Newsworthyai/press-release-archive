# Milemarker Empowers RIA’s, Family Offices & Broker Dealers with AI-Ready Data Solutions and Industry-Leading Data Model

Milemarker, a fintech firm revolutionizing wealth management technology, now offers a technology audit, data strategy service, and the industry-leading Milemarker Data Model as part of its comprehensive data solution. These enhancements are designed to help financial advisors maximize the success of their data strategy and unlock the full potential of their data warehouses, enabling them to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI).

Milemarker partners with leading cloud providers like Snowflake, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to deliver best-in-class data solutions that give financial advisors ownership and control of their data. By integrating and centralizing data from diverse sources such as Portfolio Accounting Systems, Financial Planning Systems, CRM systems, and Custodians, Milemarker ensures firms have clean, actionable data to fuel AI programs effectively.

“We’re not just offering tools; we’re creating clarity and strategy,” said Milemarker CEO Kyle Van Pelt. “Many firms are stuck in a cycle of fragmented data and disconnected systems, which limits their ability to make meaningful use of AI. With Milemarker, advisors can streamline their data ecosystem and take decisive steps toward becoming truly data-driven.”

Introducing the Milemarker Data Model

Central to Milemarker’s offering is the Milemarker Data Model, a proprietary, industry-best framework that helps financial firms connect all their data sources with their advisors, clients, and team members. Unlike generic data solutions, this model is:

• Uniquely Built for Wealth Management Firms: Designed around the ever-evolving needs of RIAs, IBDs, and advisor platforms.

• Tailored to Each Firm’s Data Rules: Provides firms with the flexibility to manage their data according to their unique operational requirements.

• Future-Proof: Adapts to the constantly changing needs of advisors, ensuring scalability and relevance over time.

• Universal User IDs: Milemarker’s Data Model allows your advisors, clients, and team members to unite their data through a universal user ID that allows you to connect all relevant data to each user, regardless of the system of origin.

By leveraging the Milemarker Data Model, firms can integrate disparate data sources into a cohesive system that supports better decision-making, delivers actionable insights, and enhances client outcomes.

A Holistic Approach to Data Strategy

Accenture’s study, AI in Wealth Management: A Financial Advisor Study,[1] revealed that 83% of financial advisors believe AI will have a direct, measurable, and consistent impact on client-advisor relationships. Additionally, 80% of advisors view AI as essential for automating manual and time-consuming tasks, and 90% believe AI can help grow their business by more than 20%. Despite this optimism, many firms lack the foundational data infrastructure—such as data lakes or warehouses—that enables AI to deliver actionable insights. Milemarker solves this challenge by combining proprietary data solutions with a robust technology audit, data strategy roadmap, and the Milemarker Data Model, helping advisors maximize the value of their existing systems while positioning them for long-term success.

Here’s how Milemarker helps financial advisors transform their data strategy:

• Comprehensive Technology Audits: Assess the firm’s tech stack and identify opportunities for optimization and integration.

• Data Strategy Roadmap: Provide a clear, written plan for leveraging data and technology to align with business goals.

• Milemarker Data Model: Connect advisors, clients, and teams with a unified, AI-ready data ecosystem.

• Data Warehousing Solutions: Integrate disparate data sources into a centralized, cloud-backed platform for easy access and AI enablement.

“To access the benefits of AI, advisors don’t need a magic bullet. They simply need clean, actionable data,” said Milemarker Co-founder and Partner Jud Mackrill. “With the Milemarker Data Model, firms gain a clear framework to organize their data in a way that reflects their unique business structure while unlocking insights to grow their firms.”

Turning Data into Actionable Insights

Milemarker’s platform, Firm Intelligence, seamlessly integrates with all major wealth-tech platforms, offering advisors:

• A single source of truth for their data.

• Automated workflows to save time and reduce inefficiencies.

• AI-ready data to unlock deeper client insights and growth opportunities.

Firms using Milemarker gain the confidence and control to:

• Identify profitable clients and optimize client acquisition strategies.

• Understand advisor and team capacity for better resource allocation.

• Benchmark internal teams to drive performance.

By simplifying complex workflows, leveraging the Milemarker Data Model, and enabling ownership of their data, Milemarker allows financial advisors to focus on what truly matters—growing their business and serving clients effectively.
