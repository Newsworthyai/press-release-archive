Over $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasury notes have now been tokenized on top of public blockchains. These are digital representations of bonds which can be traded as tokens on the blockchain, and as a result, interest in crypto investments has spiked. Out of the many cryptocurrencies available for trading, three have stood out the most, including Aptos (APT), Litecoin (LTC) and KangaMoon (KANG). To see which is the best crypto to invest in now, we will go over their on-chart data individually.

Aptos (APT) Grows 30% and Can Surge Above $26 SoonAptos (APT) has been a notable network which has reached significant growth during the past year, and this is evidenced from the year-to-date (YTD) climb of its native token by 25%. In the previous month alone, the Aptos price is up 30%, and at this rate could reach far more substantial gains.

During the previous week, the Aptos crypto moved up in value from $15.12 to a maximum value at $19.23, putting it nearer than before towards passing the $20 price range. If it does so, it can reach new heights, and according to the Aptos price prediction, by Q4, 2024, it can reach $26.37.

Litecoin (LTC) Breaks Above $100 – How Far Can It Move by Q4, 2024?Litecoin (LTC) is also showcasing signs of growth on the charts after a prolonged period of price-correction, as it's in the green zone across the 7-day, 14-day, 30-day and 1-year chart. Specifically, within the past two weeks, the Litecoin price spiked 25%.

In addition, throughout the past week, the Litecoin crypto saw a major upswing from $88.40 to $110.85, and by passing the $100 price barrier, is now positioned to experience far more substantial gains. According to the Litecoin price prediction, it can end 2024 at $163.30.

KangaMoon (KANG) Fuses Social-Fi Elements and Play-to-Earn (P2E) and Can Spike 80xKangaMoon (KANG) is a revolutionary platform that combines a community-driven approach with Social-Fi elements and Play-to-Earn (P2E) features to enable anyone the opportunity to get rewarded by interacting with the ecosystem.

Specifically, each ecosystem participant can create their own character and battle one-another, or enter tournaments to win rewards. These come in the form of KANG tokens or rare non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which can later-on get sold on the dedicated marketplace.

The presale has already raised over $4 million, and can raise $5.5 million by the end of April. In the meantime, the KANG token also spiked 290%, and at this rate is bound to reach far more substantial gains. According to the KangaMoon price prediction by analysts, it can spike by 80x following its launch and major exchange listing, making KANG the best crypto to invest in now.

SummaryWith such a major level of appeal and attention going towards the crypto industry, its clear why Aptos and Litecoin initially gained a lot of momentum. But now, KangaMoon can pass them in terms of growth, as it is a presale-stage project with massive ROI potential for early investors who jump into it. These aspects position KANG as the best new crypto to invest in.
