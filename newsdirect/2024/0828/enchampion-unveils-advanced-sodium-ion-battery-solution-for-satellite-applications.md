This recent development and innovation by Enchampion address the growing demand for efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective power solutions in space exploration, marking a significant leap forward in energy storage technology. Enchampion's sodium-ion battery solution has undergone a rigorous testing process to ensure its performance in space. The testing regimen included vibration tests, thermal vacuum tests, radiation tests, and cycle life tests. These tests are critical in simulating the conditions that the battery will face in space and ensuring that it can withstand these challenges.

Moreover, Enchampion's sodium-ion batteries offer several special advantages when compared to other battery technologies. Sodium-ion batteries are less prone to thermal runaway, a condition that can lead to overheating and potential failure in lithium-ion batteries. Enchampion's sodium-ion battery has completed 50,000 cycles at a 30% Depth of Discharge (DOD) during rigorous testing. This makes sodium-ion batteries a safer alternative for space applications.

Additionally, Enchampionâ€™s sodium-ion battery's cost-effectiveness and abundance of sodium resources make them a sustainable option. These batteries are designed to deliver high performance in extreme conditions. Enchampion offers a range of high-performance battery solutions for space and aviation applications. These include lithium-sulfur batteries, solid-state batteries, and advanced lithium-ion batteries, all designed to meet the specific needs of various industries.

Enchampion also provides cost-effective space solar panels and Photovoltaic Array (PVA) solutions, alongside a comprehensive range of products for aviation applications. These include solutions for commercial aircraft, helicopters, electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles, and High-Altitude Pseudo-Satellites (HAPS).
