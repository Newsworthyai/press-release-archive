# Loserball.com announces Launch of Unique Fantasy Football Game for Casual Fans

Loserball.com, a new fantasy football game that has taken an opposite approach by allowing users to win based on losing, launched its brand-new app through the Apple Store, Google Play, and on the web debuting a unique and fun way to enjoy professional football games. Understanding the power of strategic partnerships, Loserball.com immediately tapped industry-leading production house, Better Sports Network, to create content and promote through their iconic brand FantasyAlarm.com.

Loserball threads the needle between casual fans and dedicated fantasy players by simplifying the game to selecting just three (3) NFL teams each week. Using sixteen (16) categories of futility, from fumbles to incomplete passes, Loserball.com makes every play worth watching. Ultimately, this contrarian approach to fantasy football will create a true paradigm shift in how people watch and enjoy NFL games beginning this season.

Better Sports Network brings a powerhouse of resources and talent to cover the game from this opposite angle. With drive time radio on SiriusXM, over 450 content creators and a production staff that delivers written, audio, video and live-streaming content for hundreds of thousands of fantasy football players, BSN is ready to deliver content following this unique concept.

"Fantasy Alarm is the ultimate destination for all things fantasy, including Loserball’s wacky, yet innovative approach to the game. We couldn’t sit on the sidelines,” said Matt Deutsch, Co-Founder of Bettor Sports Network. "We're hooked on their vision of fumbles over field goals and penalties over points and look forward to entertaining NFL fans with this totally new approach to the sport we love."

"We are proud to deliver this unusual game concept so fantasy football players can now truly enjoy every play - whether it is a touchdown or a fumble," said Jonathan Gruber, Founding Loser. “Attaching ourselves to the leading private brand in the fantasy content space made sense and with the parent company’s production capabilities, we can entertain and inform all season long.”

With this partnership, Loserball.com and Bettor Sports Network are set to popularize this new concept together, and equally as important, entertain NFL fans in a unique way. As the excitement starts to build for a season of gaffes, goofs, and gridiron guffaws, Loserball will be there to start a new mantra, "May the Worst Team Win!"

About Loserball.com

Loserball began with humble roots, with Gruber rooting for teams to lose for decades. In June of 2023, Loserball won the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association's Elevator Pitch Award, and has since garnered top fantasy advisors such as Fantasy Hall of Famer Rick Wolf and Hot Paper Lantern's Ed Moed to join the fun. This year will have free-to-play games for anyone that wants to create or join a league, in addition to select prizes. In 2025, Loserball will add DFS-style player games for the NFL season.
