# Australia’s Beauty Innovators Shine at Cosmoprof North America 2024: Melbourne Debuts with Trailblazing Pavilion

The inaugural Melbourne Australia Beauty Pavilion made a powerful debut at Cosmoprof North America 2024, held from July 21-24 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. Showcasing six trendsetting Australian companies, the pavilion underscored Australia’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and global beauty standards. Victoria is home to many of the best-known brand names with more than one third of all Australian beauty and makeup exports originating from this dynamic region.

Global Victoria, is the driving force behind this initiative, having boosted the position of countless Australian companies in key markets around the world. “Victorian brands are strategically aligned with the growing demand from North American consumers. Our brands prioritize organic, natural, and ethically produced beauty products. They focus on ingredient transparency and sustainability, values that resonate strongly and meet consumer expectations”, said Mildred Ruiz, US Trade Manager for Consumer Goods in Global Victoria’s New York office. “Our hands-on approach enables us to connect our brands with every distribution channel. We support the participation of our brands in events like Cosmoprof.” Global Victoria's strategy is to identify partners and opportunities that connect Australian companies with relevant buyers, ensuring that Australia's innovative products reach global consumers. With a footprint of 23 offices around the world, Global Victoria is well placed to support Victorian brands grow their international presence.

Featured in the pavilion were Muk Professional Haircare, Australian Glow, Booby Tape, BYS Cosmetics, Botany Essentials, and Etoile Collective—companies selected for their market-ready capabilities and proven success in scaling international distribution. These brands represent the forefront of Australia’s beauty industry, with products emphasizing clean beauty, the use of indigenous plants, and a deep commitment to sustainability.

“Buyers from leading retailers such as Target, Urban Outfitters, CO Bigelow, Shoppers Drug Mart, Well.ca, and Salon Centric were notably impressed by the unique offerings from our pavilion,” said Elizabeth Moffat, Trade Manager Consumer Goods at Global Victoria. The enthusiastic reception at Cosmoprof North America is a testament to the global appeal of Australian beauty innovation, and we anticipate seeing these products on retail shelves across the U.S. very soon.”

The Melbourne Australia Beauty Pavilion was expertly hosted and managed by Access Beauty Insiders, a leading boutique agency for marketing and events with a focus on elevating beauty brands in international markets.
