U.S. stocks seem to be recovering following a recession scare in July that saw the S&P500 falling nearly 10% from its all-time high. The index has now risen almost 10% since the August 5 low, with the rebound partly driven by a series of economic reports this month on retail sales, inflation and producer prices, which have raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year.

However, with Vice President Kamala Harris set to square off against former president Donald Trump on November 5, analysts are warning that there could be more market turbulence yet to come, particularly with Harris leading in many polls after replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.

Election years typically bring volatility to global markets, and as election day looms, traders can expect to see intensifying fluctuations and shifts in investor sentiment. In fact, in a survey published by JPMorgan earlier this year, 20% of traders said they expected the election to be the biggest driver of stock movements this year.

Why Elections Affect The Stock MarketPresidential elections have wide-reaching ramifications for businesses and the economy, as they typically result in policy changes that can have a significant impact on various sectors. For instance, policy changes in healthcare can impact pharmaceutical stocks, while shifts in energy policy could affect oil and gas or renewables companies. Regulatory changes, fiscal policies, trade agreements and spending priorities can all be affected by election outcomes, creating both risks and opportunities for investors.

Additionally, with so much uncertainty surrounding the future of the economy, global markets tend to be highly volatile as investors react to the latest polling data and presidential debates. This can potentially mean big price swings, making it crucial for traders to stay up to date with all the latest developments.

During election periods, many traders tend to flock to commodities, indices and FX. In 2016, for example, after the UK’s referendum to leave the EU, the Germany Dax 40 index was the most traded instrument and the EUR-USD pair was the second most in demand instrument.

How To Trade During ElectionsA golden rule for traders and investors is never to allow your own political views to inform your investing decisions. According to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, Democrat-aligned voters view the country’s economic condition as good under a Democratic president, while Republican-aligned voters rate the economy positively under a Republican president. This is despite the fact that average annual returns on the S&P500 were similar under both Obama and Trump, at 16.3% and 16%, respectively.

Trading during an election year requires taking a strategic approach. With the right tools and strategies, investors can turn the heightened volatility into an opportunity to profit. Having access to reliable, real-time data and predictive analytics is crucial to making informed decisions. VantagePoint, a leader in A.I.-driven market forecasting software, can provide the insights needed to navigate the year of elections.
