Electric vehicle (EV) battery-swapping services are taking off as the industry seeks ways to overcome barriers to widespread adoption. Getting stuck because of a dead battery is a big one. The time it takes to get charged up is another.

Battery swapping fixes that, enabling drivers to have a full charge in minutes. It also makes owning an EV cheaper. The customer has to purchase the vehicle body and lease the battery pack. According to some estimates, that could save drivers thousands of dollars.

All of this is driving this burgeoning industry and its players. U Power Ltd (NASDAQ: UCAR), the Chinese EV power solution company, is one of them. It is going after the market with its advanced UOTTA technology that enables consumers and fleet operators to replace dead EV batteries with fully charged ones in under five minutes. That alone is a big deal, but U Power also offers a battery-swapping ecosystem which includes building the infrastructure through to managing it.

U Power Takes On The Competition U Power has some impressive competitors including Nio (NYSE: NIO) the Chinese EV maker, CATL, the leading Chinese EV battery producer and Ample, a San Francisco battery-swapping station start-up. But this isn't stopping U Power from seeing double-digit growth. The company credits that with its ecosystem of services, which it says its competitors donâ€™t have.

U Power is also differentiating itself with the customers it is courting. Last year, U Power's UOTTA ecosystem achieved industry-leading full product coverage for commercial vehicles. This coverage spans a wide range of vehicles from long-haul buses to light passenger vehicles, and container tractors to small trucks. U Power offers customized solutions tailored to customer needs.

Setting The Standards Then thereâ€™s U Powerâ€™s partnerships, which will be key to the growth of this market. Battery-swapping is in its infancy and in the beginning the government will play a role in helping develop the market, but eventually the private sector will take over. Companies with broad partnerships with vehicle manufacturers and operators will have a seat at the table when it comes to setting battery-swapping technology standards. That will give them a lead in the market and they could emerge as the company others look to. U Power is among those standard-setting companies, spearheading the initiative.

The companyâ€™s strong network of partnerships puts U Power in a position to expand the market. Those partnerships include a deal with Dutch electric vehicle company UNEX to provide battery-swapping vehicles and swapping station services to AssociaÃ§Ã£o Nacional dos Transportes RodoviÃ¡rios em AutomÃ³veis Ligeiros (ANTRAL), a partnership with Cornerstone Technologies Holdings Limited, a leading EV charging solution provider and charge point operator based in Hong Kong, to jointly explore and develop a strategic business relationship and an agreement with a Peruvian miner to evaluate electric heavy-duty vehicles on an established haulage route.

U Power also has a partnership with a major taxi company in China and is forging partnerships with Chinese automobile manufacturers to jointly develop commercial-use UOTTA-powered EVs, such as ride-hailing passenger EVs, small logistics EVs and light electric trucks.

At last check, U Power has already sold eleven battery swapping stations, and has 14 patents and 24 pending patent applications in China. All of that is leading to impressive revenue growth. For 2023, revenue increased by 153.5% while gross profit margins reached 61.6%, up from 34.1%.

Is U Power Undervalued?But you wouldnâ€™t know it from its stock price. U Powerâ€™s valuation pales in comparison to some of its rivals, including Ample, which designs EV battery-swapping stations specifically for Uber drivers. Its stations are optimized for urban settings, and take up a small footprint equivalent to two parking spaces.

Like U Power, Ample is forming partnerships within the industry. Back in 2021, Ample reached unicorn status, and while its valuation has come down a bit since then, it's still a highly valued player. U Power could follow a similar trajectory, as it is sporting a market cap of only $17.4 million, despite high growth, key partnerships and strong gross margins.

The EV battery-swapping services market is just taking off as the EV market itself grows. Last year the US sold a record 1.2 million EVs. Meanwhile, China forecasts an estimated 20 million EVs will be on the road as of the start of this year.

U Power is positioning itself to be a big player in the market and stand out from its rivals focused on battery swapping stations alone. With a broad portfolio of services, strong partnerships and a focus on the commercial market, U Power could be the next breakout stock in the evolving EV battery-swapping marketplace.
