# Emerging Telemedicine Leaders: Stocks Shaping Healthcare's Digital Future

The telemedicine market is not just growing; it's booming. Valued at USD 97.48 billion in 2022 and projected to surge to USD 430.72 billion by 2031, with a robust CAGR of 17.95%, telemedicine is revolutionizing healthcare delivery worldwide. This industry uses telecommunications technology to provide remote patient consultations, diagnostics, and treatment, effectively bridging geographical barriers and lowering healthcare costs. Investors are increasingly drawn to this dynamic and transformative segment as demand for telemedicine grows, owing to its proven benefits in terms of accessibility and efficiency.

Now, let's explore four stocks poised to capitalize on the potential growth in telemedicine.

Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX), also known as MangoRx, is a pioneering force in men’s health and wellness, leveraging a secure telemedicine platform to offer a diverse array of products. The company's focus spans from hair growth solutions to hormone replacement therapies, with recent strides into the nutraceutical market marking a transformative expansion.

Highlighting its commitment to innovation, MangoRx recently acquired a global patent portfolio aimed at preventing infections such as the common cold and HPV. This strategic move underscores MangoRx's pivot towards non-prescription, nutraceutical-based products featuring proprietary ingredients like GALALCOOL and zinc protoporphyrin IX. These components synergistically combat oral and respiratory infections, showcasing MangoRx’s dedication to preventive healthcare solutions.

Financially, MangoRx reported a remarkable 108% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2024, reaching $214,000 compared to $100,000 in the same period last year. This substantial increase reflects successful customer acquisition strategies and early market penetration initiatives. Notably, the introduction of a direct-to-clinic sales division has further solidified recurring revenue streams by enabling healthcare professionals to prescribe MangoRx products directly.

Securing DEA authorization for its HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform through Surescripts marks a significant regulatory milestone for MGRX. This authorization allows the company to expand its product offerings to include controlled medications such as hormone replacement therapies, positioning MGRX at the forefront of telemedicine innovation. Amanda Hammer, COO of MangoRx, emphasized the transformative impact of this milestone, stating, “This authorization through Surescripts propels MangoRx into a new phase of growth, empowering us to introduce innovative products while maintaining rigorous regulatory compliance.”

Internationally, MGRX has forged a strategic partnership with the International Society of Frontier Life Sciences and Technology (ISFLST), aimed at distributing its products in key markets including China, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America (excluding Mexico). This collaboration leverages ISFLST’s extensive network to introduce MangoRx’s advanced health solutions to burgeoning markets, aligning with the company’s global expansion strategy.

Innovation remains a cornerstone of MGRX's approach, highlighted by the initiation of efficacy studies on its patented respiratory illness prevention technology. These studies, announced on July 24, are conducted in collaboration with Vipragen Biosciences and IntraMont Technologies, Inc. They aim to validate the technology’s ability to prevent various viral infections, including H1N1 variants, Avian Flu, the common cold, and Coronavirus.

James Intrator, CEO of IntraMont Technologies, expressed confidence in the technology’s potential, highlighting its unique mechanism of binding to viral proteins and acting as a barrier against respiratory viruses. The composition being tested contains a select tannin (enhanced polyphenol) and zinc gluconate. Previous research at Moscow State University showed a 93% decrease in active virus compared to the control group.

The product is anticipated to be available as a lozenge or toothpaste, targeting the global influenza market valued at $8.28 billion in 2023.

Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX) continues to lead in men’s health and wellness through strategic acquisitions, innovative product development, and expansive international outreach. Jacob Cohen, co-founder and CEO of MangoRx, reiterated the company’s mission, stating, “We are dedicated to advancing global health through innovative solutions. Our ongoing efforts in research, strategic partnerships, and product diversification position MangoRx to address critical healthcare needs worldwide.”

Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE: HIMS) is a leading health and wellness platform committed to helping individuals feel great through better health. The company believes that how you feel in your body and mind transforms how you show up in life, driving its mission to build a future where nothing stands in the way of harnessing this power. By normalizing health and wellness challenges and innovating solutions, Hims & Hers makes feeling happy and healthy accessible. The company offers personalized care designed for effective results, acknowledging that no two people are the same.

HIMS shares have shown remarkable growth potential, with shares up 150% year to date. This impressive performance positions Hims & Hers as an attractive option for investors, thanks to its rapid expansion, vast addressable market, and reasonable valuation. In the first quarter, the company reported a 46% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $278.2 million. This growth was driven by a 41% increase in subscribers. With an impressive gross margin of 82%, Hims & Hers has the financial leeway to invest significantly in marketing, spending $130.6 million in the latest period.

The company's long-term growth is supported by its early mover advantage, which allows it to capitalize on economies of scale and potential network effects by monetizing anonymized user data. In May, Hims & Hers launched a compounded GLP-1 weight loss injection at $199 per month, which is 85% less than brand-name versions like Ozempic and Wegovy sold by Novo Nordisk.

Hims & Hers recently strengthened its leadership by appointing Kare Schultz to its Board of Directors. Schultz brings decades of leadership experience in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries from organizations like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Lundbeck, and Novo Nordisk. His experience is expected to be invaluable, as Hims & Hers aims to redefine health and wellness for its customers.

Andrew Dudum, CEO and co-founder of HIMS, expressed excitement about Schultz joining the board, stating, "We are in a transformative moment for healthcare with the opportunity to make life-changing treatments accessible to all who need them. Kare's experience gives us an incredible wealth of expertise." Schultz also shared his enthusiasm, saying, "Hims & Hers is on a trajectory to upend the healthcare industry. In my long career, this is the first company I have seen leveraging modern tools to break down barriers and change the status quo."

With a combination of rapid growth, strategic leadership appointments, and innovative product offerings, Hims & Hers is certainly a telehealth stock to watch this year.

GoodRx Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX) is the top prescription savings platform in the U.S., helping over 25 million consumers and 750,000 healthcare professionals each year. Since its inception in 2011, the company has facilitated nearly $75 billion in savings on medications. GoodRx offers affordable options for both generic and brand-name drugs at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide and provides valuable healthcare information.

Recently, analysts at TD Cowen reaffirmed their positive outlook on GRX by maintaining a buy rating and a $16.00 price target. This confidence follows GoodRx’s announcement of a new biosimilar to Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug. The biosimilar, produced by Boehringer Ingelheim, will be available exclusively on GoodRx’s platform at $550 per two-pack—a 92% discount compared to Humira’s list price.

This strategic move enhances GoodRx’s platform, positioning it as a key player in affordable medication options. The discount on Humira, a top-selling prescription drug globally, is expected to attract more users to GoodRx, potentially boosting its revenue and market position. Analysts view this as a significant growth opportunity within GoodRx’s business model.

In addition to the Humira biosimilar, GDRX has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim to provide the low-cost Adalimumab-adbm, now available at over 70,000 pharmacies. The company's upcoming quarterly report is anticipated to show 9% year-over-year growth in Monthly Active Consumers (MACs), supporting a positive revenue trajectory.

GDRX has also made strides by appointing tech veteran Simon Patterson to its Board of Directors and setting ambitious financial targets, including over $1 billion in revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%+ by 2026. With ongoing initiatives and a robust market presence, GoodRx continues to enhance its value proposition and growth potential.

Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) is at the forefront of virtual care, committed to enhancing the healthcare experience through personalized and comprehensive virtual services. Leveraging over two decades of expertise, Teladoc Health aims to support individuals throughout their entire health journey with advanced technology and data-driven insights.

Despite its leadership in whole-person virtual care, Teladoc Health has faced significant challenges this year. The stock has dropped 56% due to disappointing quarterly earnings and mixed guidance. For Q1 2024, the company reported a net loss of $81.9 million, or 49 cents per share, slightly worse than the anticipated 47-cent loss. Revenue for the quarter reached $646.13 million, up 2.7% from the previous year. However, the company is grappling with high marketing and operating costs.

On a brighter note, Teladoc is expanding its virtual nursing program, a strategic move to address the national nurse shortage. Additionally, its apps, which focus on managing diabetes, hypertension, and weight loss, are making strides in improving health outcomes by integrating physical and mental health activities.

Looking ahead, analysts are optimistic about Teladoc’s recovery, projecting a 73% upside with a target price of $16.28. The recent appointment of Chuck Divita as CEO brings renewed hope. With his extensive experience in the healthcare sector, Divita is expected to steer Teladoc toward realizing its growth potential.

Teladoc Health will report its Q2 2024 results on July 31, 2024, after market close, with a conference call scheduled at 4:30 p.m. E.T. to discuss the outcomes.
