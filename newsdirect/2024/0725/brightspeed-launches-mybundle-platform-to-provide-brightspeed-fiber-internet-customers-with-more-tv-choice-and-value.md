Brightspeed has deployed Find My Bundle, MyBundle’s critically acclaimed personalized recommendation tool to fiber internet service shoppers and customers. Brightspeed will also launch MyBundle’s suite of marketing tools and educational resources to help customers navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic streaming marketplace.

Brightspeed Fiber Internet customers now also have access to a co-branded version of MyBundle’s recently launched mobile app. The Brightspeed MyBundle mobile app makes it easy for those already streaming to make the most of their streaming services through optimized content search and recommendations.

“Our state-of-the-art multi-gig-speed fiber network has reached more than 1.2 million homes and businesses and counting, and now the launch of MyBundle will help more of those households transition from their current TV service provider to streaming with Brightspeed Fiber Internet,” said Brightspeed Vice President of Marketing Steve DeCaspers. “We tapped MyBundle for its depth and breadth of resources to help our customers across our 20-state footprint better navigate the ever-changing world of streaming and enable them to make a more seamless transition from traditional cable service to streaming channels.”

MyBundle now partners with 250 broadband providers, serving more than 13 million households in the United States.

“MyBundle is perfectly suited to work with broadband leaders serving a wide range of demographics and we are thrilled to share news of our launch with Brightspeed,” said MyBundle Co-Founder and CEO, Jason Cohen. “With 250 broadband partners, MyBundle is leading the way by helping broadband providers and streaming networks grow their businesses and educate and inform consumers on ways to optimize their video consumption. Find My Bundle and the new MyBundle mobile app are two of the vehicles MyBundle offers to increase value, and for most consumers, save lots of money compared to legacy pay TV.”
