NEW YORK—May 31, 2024— Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, has announced it will execute a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 2X Shares (Ticker: JDST) (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of this split, except with respect to the redemption of fractional shares, as outlined below.

After the close of the markets on June 28, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows:

Fund Name

Reverse Split Ratio

Approximate decrease in total number of outstanding shares

Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 2X Shares

1 for 10

90%

Please note the CUSIP change, effective July 1, 2024:

Current CUSIP

New CUSIP

Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 2X Shares

JDST

25460G807

25461A577

As a result of this reverse split, every ten shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately ten-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) on a split-adjusted basis on July 1, 2024.

The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-ten reverse split anticipated for the Fund:

Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split

As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NYSE Arca. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

“Odd Lot” Unit

Also, as a result of the reverse split, the Fund may have outstanding one aggregation of less than 50,000 shares to make a creation unit, or an “odd lot unit.” Thus, the Fund will provide one authorized participant with a one-time opportunity to redeem the odd lot unit at the split-adjusted NAV or the NAV on such date the authorized participant seeks to redeem the odd lot unit.

The Direxion Shares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region, which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives, such as futures contracts and swaps, are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Leverage Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Passive Investment and Index Performance Risk, and risks specific to investment in the securities of gold and silver mining companies and the mining and metal industry, which are included in the materials sector. Because the Index is concentrated in the gold mining industry, and may have significant exposure to assets in the silver mining industry, the Fund will be sensitive to changes in the overall condition of gold- and silver-related companies. Competitive pressures may have a significant effect on the financial condition of gold- and silver-related companies. Additional risks for the Fund include Shorting or Inverse Risk and Daily Inverse Index Correlation Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectus for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund.
