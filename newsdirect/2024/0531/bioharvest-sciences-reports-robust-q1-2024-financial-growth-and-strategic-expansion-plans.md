# BioHarvest Sciences Reports Robust Q1 2024 Financial Growth and Strategic Expansion Plans

BioHarvest Sciences CEO Ilan Sobel joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share the company's financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2024. The company reported significant revenue growth in Q1 2024, with revenues increasing by 147% to $5.34 million, compared to $2.2 million in the same period of the previous financial year. This also represents an 18% increase from the preceding Q4 2023. Previous guidance for Q1 2024 was $5.2-5.3 million. This impressive performance was driven by continued strong sales of VINIAÂ®, which fueled revenue growth in the Products division.

Sobel highlighted that gross margins in Q1 2024 improved to 56%, compared to 37% in the same period of the prior financial year. In the U.S., total subscribers increased by 122%, while marketing and sales expenditures rose by only 39% compared to the same period in the previous year. This indicates a highly efficient growth strategy that has maximized subscriber acquisition without a proportional increase in spending.

Management has set optimistic expectations for Q2 2024, projecting revenues in the range of $5.7 to $6.0 million. The company also anticipates reaching EBITDA break-even in the second half of 2024. This financial milestone is expected to be supported by the launch of a new Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) business unit. This unit has already signed two significant contracts: one to develop patentable, plant-based molecules for a Nasdaq-listed pharmaceutical company, and another for a leader in the nutrition and ingredients industry.

Furthermore, BioHarvest Sciences is on track to uplist to the Nasdaq exchange in the second half of 2024. This strategic move is expected to enhance the company's visibility and attract a broader base of investors, providing further growth opportunities.

Sobel expressed confidence in the company's direction and highlighted the importance of the new CDMO unit in diversifying BioHarvest Sciences' revenue streams. The development of plant-based molecules aligns with the company's commitment to innovation and sustainability, positioning it at the forefront of the biotech industry.
