# Greatland Gold Expands Exploration Portfolio with Mount Egerton Acquisition in Western Australia

Greatland Gold Managing Director Shaun Day joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the company's latest acquisition in Western Australia. Greatland Gold has successfully identified and acquired the Mount Egerton tenement, driven by extensive tectonic structural reviews conducted by its exploration team.

Situated in the northern region of Western Australia, adjacent to the Patterson and Yukon areas, Mount Egerton exhibits promising potential for gold and copper deposits. Leveraging their advanced understanding of geophysics and tectonics, Greatland Gold secured the tenement at minimal cost, covering only the application fee.

Mount Egerton represents a largely unexplored territory for gold, presenting a distinctive opportunity for Greatland Gold to uncover untapped mineral resources. The company intends to accelerate the exploration process by leveraging existing indigenous land use agreements, facilitating swift and efficient exploration activities.

Initial exploration efforts at Mount Egerton will involve desktop reviews and ground sampling, leveraging cost-effective and efficient methodologies. This strategic move aligns seamlessly with Greatland Gold's overarching strategy to actively pursue exploration opportunities and unlock high-value prospects.

Day emphasized the strategic significance of the Mount Egerton acquisition, strategically located south of the company's existing operations in the Patterson area and Panorama tenements. This expansion reinforces Greatland Gold's steadfast focus on the Pilbara crater region and underscores its commitment to enhancing its exploration portfolio with promising opportunities.
