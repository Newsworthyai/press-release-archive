NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINA, May 23, 2024 — On Wednesday, Spine Surgeon Jeffrey R. Carlson, MD, performed the first two-level cervical disc arthroplasty, using the Nuvasive Simplify® cervical disc implants. The surgery was performed at Coastal Virginia Surgery Center in Newport News, Virginia and was a first for the center and this region.

The two-level disc arthroplasties were performed on a 50-year-old female patient diagnosed with Foraminal Stenosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, and disc protrusion at levels C5-7. She had a multi-year history of chronic radiculopathy in the right arm, neck, and shoulder pain, which continued to worsen after conservative treatments. The patient tolerated the two-hour surgery very well and was released to go home after three hours of recovery.

“My patients truly benefit from the mobility a disc replacement offers”, said Dr. Carlson. “The Simplify® implant is leading the way as surgical and anesthetic techniques improve toward multi-disc replacement. It’s safe for MR scanners and its anatomical design gives me more options in surgery for varying disc height requirements. I like its high success rate which gives my patients better outcomes.”
