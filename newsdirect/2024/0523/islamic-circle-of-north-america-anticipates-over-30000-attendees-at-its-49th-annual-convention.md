# Islamic Circle of North America Anticipates Over 30,000 Attendees at its 49th Annual Convention

Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) will host its annual convention centered around the theme of unshakable faith: trusting the will of God on May 25th-27th. The event is expected to host more than 30,000 attendees and will feature a diverse group of speakers, workshops, and activities aimed at promoting unity and community building.

The convention is open to all people and families who seek to strengthen their understanding and connection to the Islamic faith.

Speakers and workshops will cover a range of topics, including but not limited to: Islamic principles, family dynamics, youth development, social justice, and interfaith relations. At the same time, attendees will have the opportunity to engage with scholars, activists, and leaders who are experts in these areas.

The ICNA Convention brings a surge of visitors to Baltimore, leading to increased hotel bookings, restaurant patronage, and overall spending in the city. This influx of attendees significantly benefits the tourism industry, with local hotels experiencing higher occupancy rates during the convention period. In addition, the increased foot traffic in restaurants, cafes, and eateries boosts revenue for local businesses and stimulates economic activity.

Furthermore, the ICNA Convention promotes community engagement and philanthropy. Attendees participate in various community service initiatives and charitable activities, contributing to local charities and nonprofit organizations. This not only strengthens Baltimore's social fabric but also supports its economic well-being.

“ICNA is thrilled to host this convention, an event that we have worked hard to make accessible and inclusive to everyone who wants to learn and grow in their faith,” said ICNA President Dr. Mohsin Ansari. “We are particularly proud of this year’s theme of unshakable faith and trusting the will of God. With the ongoing tragedy in Gaza weighing heavily on global consciousness, now more than ever, it's imperative for those with faith to stand steadfast in their beliefs as we persevere in the pursuit of justice."

Registration for the convention is open and can be completed through ICNA’s website. The organization has put measures in place to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all attendees. ICNA recently released a statement in support of the student protest taking place across College campuses across the United States, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza.
