# Makers of STEPN, take major leap with STEPN GO, a social-lifestyle app with new gaming token, GGT

FSL, the global gaming and development studio behind web3 lifestyle app STEPN, NFT marketplace MOOAR, and social-strategy game Gas Hero, has officially announced the launch of STEPN GO. The new product is a social lifestyle app that rewards your daily movement and social interactions. Today marks an exciting milestone with the release of the STEPN GO Whitepaper and Tokenomic model. The game introduces a new token, GO GAME TOKEN (GGT), which users can earn by walking, jogging, and running with digital NFT Sneakers. There will also be a PvP game feature that allows users to earn GMT, the FSL Ecosystem token.

The original STEPN app was launched in 2021 and remains the world’s leading ‘Move and Earn’ application, pioneering the genre of gamified web3 fitness applications. With over 5.6 million registered users and over 1 million Sneaker NFTs owned by players, STEPN achieved monumental success, acquiring a global community. STEPN has partnered with prolific brands over the years including ASICS, Steve Aoki, and most recently adidas. STEPN was also the first blockchain gaming app to integrate Apple Pay, creating a seamless onboarding experience for web2 native users.

Yawn Rong, Co-Founder of FSL commented, “The STEPN community has been requesting social features within the app since the early days of STEPN. Therefore, we’re so excited to reveal these new features, which will propel STEPN GO into mainstream adoption. In addition to the Haus Mechanism and Interactive Map, we will also implement PvP elements within the app. Community is at the heart of everything we do at FSL, and we are ecstatic to announce this monumental milestone today, reinforcing our commitment to empowering and engaging our users.”

Building on the success of STEPN, FSL has designed unique social features within STEPN GO. The first key social element is the ‘Haus System’, which is a lending system that allows users to share their Sneaker NFTs with friends and family members who are new to the app, and split their earnings. This system will enable easy onboarding for new users to enjoy the app and kickstart their fitness journey. Another unique feature will be the ‘Interactive Map’, which will allow users to see other players' avatars and even add them as friends within the platform. This Interactive Map will also allow users to drop messages that can be found by other players out doing STEPN GO runs.

Jerry Huang, Co-Founder of FSL added, “With STEPN GO, anyone can onboard their friends and family to web3 without needing to create a wallet or even buy NFTs. Exercise will be more fun and rewarding. We will combine fitness with many enjoyable experiences, including having your own customizable avatars with unique outfits!”

The Alpha Version of STEPN GO is set to launch by Q3 2024 with a Sneaker NFT Alpha Prize Draw lasting one month. A total of 3,000 Sneaker NFTs will be distributed within the app. To enter, users will be required to lock GMT. Access to the Alpha Prize Draw will be limited to FSL ID users, ensuring the most loyal FSL community members are rewarded. An additional 2,000 Sneakers will also be given away via the STEPN X account and STEPN GO Discord. Make sure to follow STEPN on X for your chance to win a Sneaker and gain early access.
