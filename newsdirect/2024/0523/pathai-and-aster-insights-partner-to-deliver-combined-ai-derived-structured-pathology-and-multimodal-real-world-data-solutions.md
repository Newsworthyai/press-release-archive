# PathAI and Aster Insights Partner to Deliver Combined AI-Derived Structured Pathology and Multimodal Real-World Data Solutions

PathAI, a global leader in AI-powered pathology, and Aster Insights, the leading provider of scientific and clinical intelligence for oncology discovery, today announced a multi-year strategic partnership to develop curated multimodal datasets that pair PathAI’s PathExplore1 artificial intelligence (AI) tumor microenvironment (TME) quantification panel with Aster Insights’ Avatar clinical, molecular, and digital pathology imaging data. By combining their respective best-in-class platforms, PathAI and Aster Insights will be able to expedite the development of novel insights to accelerate the discovery and development of new treatments for patients with cancer.

The partnership will allow PathAI to utilize digital whole slide imaging (WSI) from Aster Insights’ Oncology Research Information Exchange Network® (ORIEN). ORIEN® members participate in Total Cancer Care® (TCC), the world’s largest and longest-running observational research study in oncology, which has accrued over 400,000 patients to date.

Digital pathology images contain a wealth of untapped data, and PathAI’s PathExplore is the world’s first structured, standardized, and scalable product that leverages AI to characterize the TME from routinely available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained digital WSIs. PathExplore exhaustively detects and classifies the millions of cell and tissue regions across H&E WSIs to provide researchers access to important insights, such as patterns of immune cell infiltration and presence of complex tissue structures. These data are critical for better understanding existing treatments and the development of novel therapeutics.

PathExplore features are paired with Aster’s Avatar multimodal data including tumor whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing, which allows researchers to follow a patient throughout their cancer journey and access rich information about their cancer biology. Avatar provides a powerful set of data, allowing for a deeper understanding of disease pathology, and what happens to patients when they are exposed to certain treatments.

“Analysis of histopathology images uniquely allows researchers to define and quantify spatial changes in the tumor microenvironment resulting from treatment or disease progression,” said Andy Beck, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of PathAI. “Our collaboration with Aster Insights is empowering researchers with robust multimodal datasets to explore hypotheses such as identifying and analyzing novel histological biomarkers correlated with patient treatment, outcomes, and gene expression.”

“Our approach to leveraging AI with multimodal data will lead to new information and deeper insights than currently possible,” said Anand Shah, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Aster Insights. “Together with PathAI, we are creating new knowledge that is critical for researchers and life sciences partners to expand therapeutic options.”

PathAI and Aster Insights are offering these joint solutions to biopharma customers to support targeted and pan-cancer initiatives across the drug development lifecycle.
