# DB Schenker Americas Earns IATA Lithium Battery Transport Certification

DB Schenker, a global leader in logistics and supply chain solutions, is proud to announce the successful acquisition of the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Lithium Batteries Certification for its United States airfreight operations from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This significant achievement underscores DB Schenker's commitment to setting the standard for safely and efficiently handling lithium battery shipments, a critical component in today’s technology-driven market.

John McDonald, EVP of Americas for Airfreight, DB Schenker, said, “The CEIV Lithium Batteries program, crafted by IATA, is an industry-recognized certification that represents a company's ability to meet the stringent guidelines and standards for the logistics of lithium batteries. The certification confirms DB Schenker's proficiency in the safe transport of these items, which are essential for powering a vast array of devices and systems essential to modern life and commerce.”

DB Schenker embarked on a rigorous certification journey marked by a series of in-depth training sessions, self-assessments, and meticulous documentation reviews. Barbara England, Sr. Director of Operations for Airfreight, DB Schenker, said, “The process began with comprehensive training, where Air Export Operations personnel and Air Product Management teams completed the IATA Lithium Battery Logistics Safety Management Certification Program. Following this, DB Schenker conducted a thorough self-assessment to ensure alignment with IATA’s exacting standards.”

Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, said, "Congratulations to DB Schenker for achieving CEIV Lithium Batteries Certification for their operations in the United States. This accomplishment underscores the company's unwavering commitment to excellence in logistics within the rapidly growing sector. DB Schenker’s dedication to the safe handling of shipments is something their customers will undoubtedly value. Furthermore, the industry stands to benefit from the quality benchmark that they are helping to establish.”

The assessment phase took place at DB Schenker's facility in Franklin Park, IL, where an IATA assessor meticulously evaluated the company's operations, processes, and adherence to the CEIV Lithium Batteries audit checklist. This checklist, featuring over 200-line items, required DB Schenker to demonstrate the highest level of precision and commitment to safety standards.

Upon completion of the assessment, the findings underwent a rigorous validation process by IATA, culminating in the certification being awarded on January 29, 2024, with the notable distinction of zero non-conformities – a testament to DB Schenker's diligent preparation and dedication to excellence.

The implications of receiving the CEIV Lithium Batteries certification are far-reaching for DB Schenker. This certification is not only a validation of DB Schenker’s unwavering dedication to safety and quality but also positions the company to meet the surging demand for the transportation of lithium battery products. Clients and partners can now have even greater confidence in DB Schenker’s capabilities to handle their shipments with the utmost care and expertise.

Looking to the future, DB Schenker views this certification as a cornerstone of its ongoing strategy to expand its specialty in transporting dangerous goods. The company is already planning to extend the CEIV Lithium certification to additional global sites and is confident in pursuing further certifications for other dangerous goods, irrespective of the mode of transport.

This certification aligns with DB Schenker's strategic vision to lead the logistics industry in safety, efficiency, and reliability. With the growing reliance on lithium batteries across multiple sectors, DB Schenker is well-prepared to support its customers with the highest level of service.

The CEIV Lithium Batteries certification is valid for two years, during which DB Schenker will engage in continuous improvement and compliance to maintain this status. Refresher training for key personnel will be conducted, and new assessments will ensure ongoing adherence to the rigorous standards set forth by IATA.
