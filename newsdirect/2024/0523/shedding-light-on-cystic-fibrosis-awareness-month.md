# Shedding Light on Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, progressive, and genetic disease that currently affects about 40,000 people in the United States. CF is the result of a defective gene, inherited from each parent, and the disease can impact people of all races and ethnicities. Recently, KC White, Board Chair of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, participated in a nationwide satellite media tour to discuss the disease, her personal journey, and how the Foundation is helping progress care and treatment options.

CF is a life-shortening disease that prevents our bodies from clearing mucus. This can lead to lung infections, poor nutrition, lung disease, and a host of unique challenges that can impact every aspect of a person’s life. When it was first discovered, it was considered a fatal pediatric disease. But due to transformative advancements in treatments and high-quality care, the life-expectancy for someone born with CF today is 56. While that number is climbing there is still a long way to go and unfortunately, not all people with CF equally benefit from this progress.

KC White was elected chair of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s Board of Trustees in 2022 after serving on the Board since 2005. Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at age 3, White has been a committed volunteer and inspiring advocate for the Foundation since childhood and is the first person with CF to serve as board chair. When she was diagnosed, she wasn’t expected to live past high school age, but her family refused to accept that fate, which prompted their dedication to the Foundation’s work.

Because of recent treatments known as modulators, about 90% of the CF population (including KC) experienced an incredible transformation in their health. With this though, comes navigating unplanned challenges including careers, finances, family, and more. In addition to fueling the research, particularly in genetic therapies, that will lead to transformative treatments for the entire CF population, the CF Foundation works to support the CF community in all aspects of their lives through support programs and fostering connection opportunities.

Every May, the cystic fibrosis community comes together for CF Awareness Month to educate the public about the rare disease, share personal stories, and encourage people to get involved and unite behind a shared mission: finding a cure for all people with CF. The CF Foundation is committed to finding a cure and providing all people with CF the opportunity to lead long, fulfilling lives. The Foundation is aggressively funding research and drug development, advancing high-quality, specialized care, and partnering with and advocating for the CF community.
