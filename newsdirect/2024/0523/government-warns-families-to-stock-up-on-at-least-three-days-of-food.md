# Government Warns Families to Stock Up on At Least Three Days of Food

ReadyWise, a leader in emergency preparedness, is here to help households prepare for what's coming. Oliver Dowden recently urged families to stockpile at least three days' worth of food and water to build national resilience. Dowden highlighted the global fears of prolonged power cuts, cyber-attacks, and floods, emphasizing the critical necessity of preparedness. He noted, "But as we have been increasing our defenses, the threats we face have been proliferating. Geopolitical tensions have risen to heights not seen for decades… climate change has compounded the risk from natural disasters…"

The time to prepare is now, and ReadyWise is here to help families face these potential crises. Americans can prepare at great prices during ReadyWise’s Memorial Day Sale with up to 60% off emergency food supplies.
