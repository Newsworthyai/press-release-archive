YCloud has recently launched the Click to WhatsApp ads (CTWA) service, which allows users to initiate WhatsApp conversations directly from ads on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. This new feature eliminates the need for a landing page, shortening user journeys and boosting ad conversions.

In the future, YCloud aims to be a fully automated marketing platform, providing end-to-end services. This includes not just marketing and customer service interactions but also leveraging AI to facilitate transactions such as shopping, ordering, and payment within WhatsApp," said Dylan, Founder of YCloud.
