Founded with a vision to reinvent community-based care, Tuktu Care is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to create a platform that is not only efficient but highly personalized.

Tuktu Care offers a comprehensive range of services, from companionship and personal care to specialized support for conditions like dementia and Alzheimer's. The flexibility of the platform allows seniors to receive the care they need in the comfort of their own homes, promoting independence and well-being.

Laurie Lathem, VP of Growth at Tuktu Care, emphasizes the potential of the platform to reach underserved populations. "Our technology and community-driven approach enable us to connect with large groups of people, especially those in remote or disadvantaged areas. This is just the beginning; we're committed to expanding our reach and impact."
