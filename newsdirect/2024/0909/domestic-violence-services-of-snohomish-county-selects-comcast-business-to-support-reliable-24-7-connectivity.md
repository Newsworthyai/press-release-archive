# Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County Selects Comcast Business to Support Reliable 24/7 Connectivity

Comcast Business is providing Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County (DVS) – a private, non-profit organization that provides emergency shelter and comprehensive, confidential services to victims of domestic violence – with Comcast Business Ethernet Dedicated Internet (EDI) and Comcast Business Voice Mobility Solutions. The services provide reliability and speed for the organization's network, and serve as a technological backbone that supports DVS’ growing operations and survivor-first approach.

Founded in 1976, DVS has a 52-bed confidential emergency shelter for those in imminent danger from intimate partner violence (IPV). It is the only program in Snohomish County, WA that provides emergency shelter and related services to victims of domestic abuse regardless of age, gender, race, religion, culture, national origin, sexual orientation or income level. DVS also offers individual and community awareness programs that focus on eliminating domestic violence in the area. Dedicated to fostering a safe, judgment-free atmosphere that promotes healing and growth for individuals and families impacted by domestic violence, DVS requires top-notch technology services to do so effectively and efficiently.

“It is crucial for our organization to be connected to survivors in need 24/7. To do so, we depend on a reliable, fast internet connection and phone service, which Comcast Business has been able to seamlessly provide,” said Lauren Stiger, Development and Volunteer Manager of DVS. “The technology they provide helps us ensure that survivors have a safe place to turn to at all times, no matter the situation. Comcast Business has been very accommodating and has played a big role in our continued success as an organization.”

Because using forms of online contact, such as email, is not always the safest option for survivors, DVS’ phone system is the leading tool the organization uses to stay connected to those affected by domestic violence. Comcast Business Voice Mobility Solutions are crucial, as DVS’ needs its crisis hotline to be available 24/7, seven days a week.

Meanwhile, Comcast Business EDI provides the speed to tackle high bandwidth needs, such as DVS’ individual and community awareness programs. These programs are a growing aspect of DVS’ operations, geared toward eliminating cases of domestic violence. The organization’s team attends local events and visits locations such as schools to better inform the community about the importance of building healthy relationships, and to spread the word that DVS is readily available to help survivors. The awareness programs also consist of various online webinars and virtual meetings, further emphasizing the need for DVS to work with a reliable connectivity provider.

“Reliable connectivity is critical to the day-to-day operations of organizations, like DVS, that are building healthier, happier communities by caring for individuals and families in need,” said Rob Brenner, Vice President of Comcast Business for Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “Comcast Business is proud to provide quality solutions for quality organizations that share our vision of bettering our community. We look forward to continuing to support DVS with technology that helps enable their team to further ease the healing process for survivors.”
