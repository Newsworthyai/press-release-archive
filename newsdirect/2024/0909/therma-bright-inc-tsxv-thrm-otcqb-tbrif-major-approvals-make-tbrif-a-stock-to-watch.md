# Therma Bright Inc. (TSXV: THRM) (OTCQB: TBRIF): Major Approvals Make TBRIF A Stock To Watch

The medical device sector is experiencing rapid growth, driven by technological advancements and rising global healthcare needs. According to Statista, the global market is set to expand at an annual rate of 5.71%, reaching $673.10 billion by 2029. In 2024 alone, the United States is expected to generate $179.80 billion in medical device revenues, underscoring the sector’s substantial potential.

In this burgeoning market, Therma Bright Inc. (TSXV: THRM) (OTCQB: TBRIF) stands out as an emerging leader. The company has made notable progress in diagnostics and health-tech solutions, with recent milestones such as the approval of reimbursement for its Venowave VW5 device. These developments highlight Therma Bright’s strong growth potential and its ability to open new revenue streams in the healthcare and medical technology sectors.

Reimbursement Approval: A Game-Changer for RevenueOn August 19, 2024, Therma Bright announced a landmark achievement with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granting permanent Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code E0683 to its Venowave VW5 device. This approval signifies a major breakthrough, as it not only provides a specific reimbursement code but also sets a precedent for the device's integration into the U.S. healthcare system.

Rob Fia, CEO of Therma Bright, expressed his enthusiasm about the development: "We're pleased that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have approved our permanent code request, as well as the reimbursement pricing and the new HCPCS Level II designation for our Venowave VW5 device." This approval ensures that Venowave VW5 will be reimbursed for up to $1,199 per device or $78.05 per month for rental, totaling up to $819.55 over 13 months. The device addresses critical circulatory issues, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition affecting over 900,000 U.S. citizens annually.

The reimbursement approval opens a major revenue channel for Therma Bright. Market research projects that the global market for DVT-related treatments will reach $1.5 billion by 2032. With the Venowave VW5 device being the first of its kind to receive a permanent HCPCS code, Therma Bright is poised to capture a significant share of this expanding market.

Strategic Investments and Expanding Market ReachIn addition to the reimbursement milestone, Therma Bright has been actively expanding its footprint through strategic investments and partnerships. On August 22, 2024, the company announced the securing of a nationwide U.S. distribution partner for the Venowave VW5. This partner will launch an initial sales program to assess Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement timelines and billing procedures, with a commitment to acquire inventory valued at up to $2.38 million post-program success.

The partnership is a testament to the confidence in Venowave’s market readiness and the anticipated success of the reimbursement process. Rob Fia highlighted the significance of this deal: "We are thrilled to welcome our nationwide distribution partner to our team... We expect the program to be successful, leading to a significant increase in Venowave orders on a monthly basis and accelerating our revenue growth."

Innovative Technological AdvancementsTherma Bright’s innovative approach extends beyond Venowave. On August 16, 2024, the company revealed that its AI-powered Digital Cough Technology (DCT) is under consideration for a clinical trial involving a new chronic cough drug. This AI-driven platform aims to enhance data collection and clinical decision-making, showcasing Therma Bright’s commitment to advancing healthcare technology.

Additionally, Therma Bright continues to make strategic investments in cutting-edge solutions. On August 6, 2024, the company increased its investment in InStatin, a firm developing an inhaled statin for chronic lung conditions. This move not only boosts Therma Bright’s stake but also positions the company to benefit from potential breakthroughs in asthma and COPD treatments.

Leadership and Future ProspectsThe company’s progress is further supported by recent additions to its advisory board. On August 13, 2024, Therma Bright welcomed Michael Raimondo, a seasoned expert in medical sales and operations, to its advisory board. Raimondo’s extensive experience is expected to drive sales growth and navigate the complexities of U.S. healthcare reimbursement processes.

Rob Fia commented on Raimondo’s appointment: "We are pleased that Michael has agreed to join Therma Bright's Advisory Board, where his skills and experience in sales and operations will aid in the company’s sales efforts of its health-tech and med-tech devices."

ConclusionTherma Bright Inc. (TSXV: THRM) (OTCQB: TBRIF) is poised for significant growth following the approval of the HCPCS code for its Venowave VW5 device. This milestone opens up opportunities in the large DVT treatment market. With strategic investments, new partnerships, and technological advancements, TBRIF is well-positioned for future success, potentially making it a compelling stock for investors
