# NEWPORT NEWS SPINE SURGEON PERFORMS FIRST TWO INTRACEPT® BASIVERTEBRAL NERVE ABLATIONS IN HAMPTON ROADS

Mark McFarland, DO, Performs Outpatient Procedure for Vertebrogenic Back Pain

NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINA / ThriveNewsWire / June 10, 2024 /  On Thursday, Spine Surgeon Mark W. McFarland, DO, performed the first two Intraosseus Basivertebral Nerve Ablation procedures, using the Intracept® device by Relievant Medsystems, Inc., a subsidiary of Boston Scientific. The outpatient procedures were performed at Mercy Bon Secours Mary Immaculate Hospital in Newport News, Virginia and were a first for this region.

The first procedure was performed on a 91year-old man with a history of chronic vertebrogenic back pain, on levels L3-S1. The second procedure was performed on a 53-year-old man who also had a long-standing history of vertebrogenic back pain, on levels L3-5. Both patients did very well during their procedures and were discharged to go home after spending a few hours in recovery.

“With the Intracept Procedure, we are embarking on a paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of vertebrogenic pain,” said Dr. McFarland, who practices at Orthopaedic and Spine Center in Newport News, Virginia. “Not only is the procedure proven to be safe and durable, but it also provides patients with the opportunity to get back to living without the burden of chronic low back pain.”
