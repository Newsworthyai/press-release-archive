OneMeta Inc. (OTCQB: ONEI), the AI-powered translation and transcription services company, is making strides in removing language barriers for businesses and consumers. The company recently announced its Verbum for Microsoft Teams was added to all of Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) app stores, including Teams Store, Microsoft AppSource and directly via the Azure Marketplace.

That’s a big deal for Bountiful, Utah-based OneMeta, which is busy churning out advanced technology that translates and transcribes spoken and written words in seconds across multiple languages. Being added to the Microsoft app stores validates OneMeta’s technology and gives it access to a larger potential customer base. After all, over one million businesses use Teams, including 91% of Fortune 100 companies.

“Since OneMeta achieved Microsoft co-sell-ready status, we have seen significant interest from customers who want to apply the Verbum software to their usage of Microsoft Teams in the 140+ languages we offer,” said Saul Leal, CEO of OneMeta. “The certification by Microsoft brings confidence to our clients and to the great work that OneMeta is pioneering in the space. We can bring our AI for translation and transcription to all enterprises without compromising privacy, compliance, and data security.”

Crashing Language Barriers Thanks to the internet, businesses big and small are increasingly global. Whether customers are based around the globe or employees are living in far-flung corners of the world, being able to communicate regardless of their language is key to growing and thriving. It's why the AI translation and transcription industry is growing. In 2023, the global natural language processing market was valued at $24.10 billion. By 2032, it is expected to reach $158.04 billion, growing at a CAGR of 23.2% during the forecast period.

OneMeta wants to be a leading player in the space, translating in near real-time whether users are attending a live event, participating in an online meeting, or talking on the phone. Thanks to its proprietary NLP technology, the company specializes in breaking down linguistic barriers in a multilingual world. It ensures fast and accurate translations and transcriptions. OneMeta recently reduced the translation and transcription speed of over 150 languages and dialects to less than 200 milliseconds.

Augmenting Microsoft Teams While Microsoft Teams provides live captioning capabilities in various languages, OneMeta said Verbum enhances that by delivering simultaneous interpretation across over 140 languages by harnessing state-of-the-art AI. With Verbum for Teams, multilingual groups can truly come together in meetings. Each attendee chooses the language they are speaking in and the language they want to see captions and chat in. As each person speaks in their preferred language from a list of 95+ languages, it is translated in near real-time for the rest of the group.

OneMeta says Verbum for Teams is meticulously designed for seamless integration with Microsoft Teams to ensure all participants in video conferences and collaborative engagements can interact smoothly, transcending language barriers. That can empower organizations to cultivate more inclusive and engaging interactions, augmenting the inherent functionalities of Microsoft Teams and expanding the scope of communication possibilities while maintaining an optimal user experience, said OneMeta.

"Now that Verbum for Teams is available on the Teams store, AppSource Marketplace, the Azure Marketplace, and the Microsoft Certification has been published, we expect to see Verbum's adoption and growth by organizations that need multi-language translation and transcription,” Alessandro Balzarelli, Director at Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering, said. “Verbum empowers Microsoft Teams users to be more efficient and more inclusive within their own organizations and with their own customers."

Communications are the backbone of businesses, whether they are local or operating internationally. OneMeta recognizes that and is developing products to help people do that regardless of their language or platform. Verbum for Teams is a perfect example of that effort. Being part of the Microsoft family goes a long way in showcasing OneMeta’s AI prowess.
