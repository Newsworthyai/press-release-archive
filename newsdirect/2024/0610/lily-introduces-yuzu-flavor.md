# Lily Introduces YUZU Flavor

Lily, the emerging New York-based beverage brand, knows non-alcoholic consumers want something more than just a seltzer and lime. This pushed them to create their latest offering, the vibrant and tart new flavor harnessing the adaptogenic power of the Egyptian Water Lily, YUZU. Starting today, Lily YUZU will launch on the brand’s website and will be available to ship directly to Lily fans nationwide.

Lily’s Latinx co-founder, Isaac Lliguin, who oversees testing of the brand’s flavors, sought to create something memorable for consumers resulting in this anxiety soothing and mood enhancing beverage. The result is a complex, zesty blend with a tart citrus burst accompanying every sip.

“Our first flavor, BLOOD ORANGE, was designed to be sweet and refreshing, while YUZU is for those pallets who prefer a sharp crisp taste that grabs their attention,” says Lliguin. “We had to blend the zestiness of this Japanese citrus with subtle notes of apricot, to get the balance right with the unique flavor of our star ingredient: the Egyptian Water Lily.”

There’s more than just flavor to get excited about here. Lily’s YUZU formula contains adaptogens, nootropics, and antioxidants designed to support a healthy lifestyle, keeping Lily’s brand mission to support comprehensive wellness in mind. With only 35 calories, 7 grams of sugar, and no artificial ingredients, each can is something you can feel good about. Bursting with refreshing zest and brightness, this invigorating blend features Yuzu, mood-boosting Egyptian Water Lily, soothing Ashwagandha, and energizing Green Tea.

After their inaugural flavor, BLOOD ORANGE, sold out just 5 months after launch, Lily is excited to announce an exclusive deal with New York City based NA distributor, Tristate Zero Proof. All Lily’s are sold in a 12 fl. oz. aluminum can with a suggested retail price of $5.00/unit in stores and $108 for a 24-unit case via e-commerce.

“I’ve always loved drinks that give your taste buds a complex sensory experience. With each sip of YUZU you’ll be greeted by that invigorating citrus zing” says Lliguin. “We were shocked by how quickly our first flavor sold out, and even more so, by the demand for more flavors and we are excited to bring this addition to offer more versatility to our customers.”

Lily is a sparkling non-alcoholic functional beverage infused with powerful adaptogens and nootropics, designed to give you a guilt-free energy boost and a clean buzz. Lily was created for all of life's situations—whether it's soothing anxiety before a big meeting, boosting energy before a workout class, or providing a light buzz during a night out with friends. Its unique extraction process places Lily as the sole beverage in the market utilizing the calming and mood-enhancing properties of the Egyptian Water Lily. Lily is sold online at www.drinklily.com and in select retailers in the New York metropolitan area.
