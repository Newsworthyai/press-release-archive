# AmeriLife and Succession Capital Alliance Partner to Expand Distribution Platform for Advanced Life Insurance Solutions

AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), a national leader in developing, marketing, and distributing life and health insurance, annuities, and retirement planning solutions, announced today that it has partnered with Succession Capital Alliance (“SCA”), the innovator behind premium financing for life insurance and a leading provider of advanced life insurance solutions for financial professionals and their high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients. Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Succession Capital Alliance stands out in our industry for its unique approach to serving the high-net-worth life insurance market,” said Scott R. Perry, chairman and CEO of AmeriLife. “I’m excited to welcome Julian Movsesian and his team to AmeriLife as our newest partners. Succession represents a powerful addition to our growing distribution, and I look forward to working together.”

Founded in 2004, SCA is known industrywide for its proprietary, nationally recognized Capital Maximization Strategy℠, an innovative strategy that finances policy premiums through custom loans tailored to each client’s unique circumstances to maximize the value of their life insurance assets. This approach – coupled with deep relationships with top carriers and financial institutions – has set SCA apart in the high-net-worth space and has helped financial professionals place more than $60 billion of life insurance and $6 billion of financed life premium since inception.

Now, alongside AmeriLife, SCA will gain access to best-in-class shared services and one of the largest wealth distribution networks in the industry to expand its market opportunities and accelerate its already impressive growth.

“Over the past 20 years, Succession Capital Alliance has grown into the premier partner for elite advisors across the nation in the advanced life insurance space,” said president and CEO Julian Movsesian. “Our partnership with AmeriLife will enable us to get to the next level, as it offers SCA the ability to expand our distribution channels and leverage AmeriLife’s technology, shared services, and deep analytical capabilities. I couldn’t be more excited for our team and the financial professionals we serve.”

As AmeriLife Wealth Group continues to break through traditional distribution models, the addition of Succession Capital Alliance will help drive and fortify its wealth protection business, arming AmeriLife’s growing wealth affiliate network with advanced life, tax, estate, and succession planning solutions in service to the company’s holistic approach to the markets it serves.

“Today’s announcement is another critical milestone achieved for AmeriLife Wealth Group and our ability to grow and sustain the next generation of wealth firms and their financial professionals,” said Mike Vietri, Chief Distribution Officer for AmeriLife Wealth Group. “SCA provides a distinctive offering that will not only elevate our life insurance business, but also expand protection solutions for more agents and their clients.”
