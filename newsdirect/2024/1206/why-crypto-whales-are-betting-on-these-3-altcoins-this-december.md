While most majors are seeing incredible surges, Ethereum (ETH) and Toncoin (TON) have recorded modest increases when compared to their counterparts. This is exactly why large wallets are accumulating both as their charts are flashing signs of imminent upward moves.

Cutoshi has also hit the radar of whales on the lookout for undervalued projects that have yet to enter real price discovery. With meme coin season firing on all cylinders and the incoming rotation into utility-driven projects, Cutoshi is set to hit the markets at the best possible time as it merges meme culture with DeFi in a future-proof success formula.

Can Ethereum Reach $4,000 Before The End Of The Year?Ethereum has been ranging around the $3,500 mark for a few weeks now, as it failed to breach the $3,800 resistance level. Today, Ethereum sells for $3,500 with a 1.7% intraday decrease and $40 billion in daily volume. Although Ethereum raked in over 45% in monthly gains, its performance has somewhat lagged when taking into account the rallies that competitor Layer 1 platforms have experienced, with Solana and Cardano being the most glaring examples.

This could soon change, however, as analyst Venturefounder points out that Ethereum has reached the tip of a multi-year triangle formation. He draws a parallel with Ethereum’s price action during the 2016-2017 cycle, where Ethereum broke out of a similar pattern and went out to reach a new all-time high. This means that if this scenario plays out again, Ethereum could soon surge to $4,000 and enter an ascending channel that could see it reach a 5-figure peak in 2025.

Through on-chain data, Ali Martinez reveals that whales continue to accumulate grandiose amounts of Ethereum. Over the last week, they have amassed over 280,000 ETH, worth approximately $1 billion.

Toncoin Gearing Up For The Next Rally?Toncoin has been demonstrating remarkable strength in the past few days as shown by the 10% weekly increase. At the time of writing, Toncoin trades at $6.88 with a 6.6% increase. After bottoming out at around $4.70, Toncoin has entered an ascending channel with the next big target being the $8.24 all-time high that it reached in summer.

Toncoin’s current price action seems to be following the chart reading that CryptoBullet shared last week. He shows that Toncoin has been moving in a multi-year 5-wave pattern that is close to completion, with a final impulse that could see TON skyrocket to $12.

Toncoin is essentially Telegram’s blockchain extension. As such, it directly taps into the nearly 1 billion-strong Telegram user base. This almost automatically guarantees that Toncoin is set to become one of the top Layer 1 platforms in the crypto space and could realistically outclass other projects such as Tron and Avalanche in terms of usage. However, low-cap entries such as Cutoshi could yield greater gains as they have much greater room for growth.
