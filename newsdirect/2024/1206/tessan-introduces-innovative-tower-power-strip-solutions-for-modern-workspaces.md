# TESSAN Introduces Innovative Tower Power Strip Solutions for Modern Workspaces

TESSAN, a power solution major, releases this week the newest achievements for Tower Power Strip technology, with solutions tailored to the increasing need for the safe, effective, and space-integrated power management in houses and Offices.

As a trendsetter, TESSAN is continuing to make breakthroughs with its unique power distribution thinking. Tower Power Strips are built by the company to make the task of charging messy equipment easier while providing the best possible safety and reliability.

Addressing Modern Power Challenges

With the proliferation of various electronic apparati in homes and offices, power distribution control has emerged as a key issue. Conventional power strips lack universality in supporting multiple devices, which can result in messy work stations as well as safety hazards. TESSAN’s Tower Power Strips are carefully designed to address these constraints, providing a compact, space-efficient solution.

Key Features of TESSAN Tower Power Strips

TESSAN's Tower Power Strips offer a distinctive blend of usability and convenience. Some of the standout features include:

14-in-1 Power Capability

To simultaneously manage multiple devices, the power strip design allows us to have 11 AC outlets and 3 USB ports (of 2 usb-A and 1 usb-c). This makes it ideal for powering laptops, smartphones, tablets, monitors, and more—all from a single, compact unit.

Surge and Overload Protection

Safety is a top priority in TESSAN’s designs. Internal surge protection protects electronics from unexpected surges in electricity and overload protection protects against excessive power draws.

Wide-Spaced Outlets

Due to the wide spacing, plugs and adapters do not get in each other's way, allowing for easy and hassle-free connections to most bulkier adapters, typically employed with larger devices.

Compact Vertical Design

In contrast to traditional power strips, which occupy horizontal space, TESSAN's Tower Power Strip has a vertically aligned design. Not only does this save space, but it also contributes to neat, organized, and aesthetically pleasing work areas.

Flat Plug with Extension Cord

Flat plug configuration enables insertion into compressing spaces, for example, in places behind furniture or in corners, As for the extension cord, this offers more flexibility for positioning.

These characteristics also qualify the Tower Power Strip as a professional, family, and all-around standard-choice power management solution.

Bridging Safety and Aesthetics

The focus on innovation at TESSAN is paralleled by the dedication to user safety and product dependability. The built-in safety elements on the Tower Power Strip, such as fire resistant materials and short circuit prevention, are result of the brand's commitment to providing reliable solutions. On the other hand, its design is very modern and adapts perfectly to interior decorations for home or office, as such efficient and decorative item.

Meeting Diverse Needs

From home offices, shared work areas or travel, the TESSAN Tower Power Strip is a chameleon device that fits in many situations. It makes complex charging configurations easier by combining power supplies, thereby eliminating users' hassles with disorderly cords and overloaded plugs.

Families with multiple devices, tech enthusiasts with advanced setups, and travelers in need of a portable power solution will find the TESSAN Tower Power Strip indispensable.

Innovation and Sustainability

Apart from product development, TESSAN is also dedicated to sustainability and a saving of energy. Through design solutions that maximize power efficiency and decrease electronic waste, the company helps the planet become greener. Such endeavor is in harmony with global carbon footprint reduction activities and sustainability efforts.
