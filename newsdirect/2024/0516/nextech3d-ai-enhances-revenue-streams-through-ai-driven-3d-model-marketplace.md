# Nextech3D.ai Enhances Revenue Streams Through AI-Driven 3D Model Marketplace

--News Direct--

Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce significant enhancements to the companyâ€™s revenue streams through a strategic partnership with sister company Toggle3D. This collaboration introduces an innovative AI-driven marketplace featuring over 200,000 3D models, available for purchase in millions of colors and configurations, with prices ranging from $20 to $95 per model.

Gappelberg explained that these models, which include a diverse array of 3D models, quad meshes, and parts, have been meticulously crafted over several years, generating millions in revenue for Nextech3D.ai. By leveraging Toggle3D.ai's advanced generative AI platform, Nextech3D.ai aims to significantly boost this revenue. The company expects a 30% royalty fee on sales through the Toggle3D.ai marketplace to further contribute to this growth.

3D models in e-commerce allow customers to visualize products in high detail from every angle, greatly enhancing decision-making confidence. This shift leads to higher conversion rates, as customers are more likely to purchase when they can thoroughly explore a product. Additionally, interactive 3D models increase customer engagement, keeping them on the site longer, which directly correlates with increased sales.
