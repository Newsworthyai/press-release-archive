# ISC Reports Strong First Quarter Growth in 2024, Launches Five-Year Growth Strategy

--News Direct--

ISC CEO Shawn Peters joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's impressive financial performance in the first quarter of 2024, coinciding with the launch of its ambitious five-year growth plan. The company recorded a revenue of $56.4 million, marking a 15 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to fee adjustments within the Saskatchewan Registries division implemented in the third quarter of 2023, as well as consistent customer and transaction growth in the Services’ Regulatory Solutions division and the advancement of project work on both existing and new solutions in the Technology Solutions division. Peters also highlighted that the Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose to $19.4 million, up from $14.5 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned fee adjustments in the Registry Operations’ Saskatchewan Registries division, in line with the Extension Agreement and annual CPI adjustments. Additionally, the Technology Solutions division saw an increase in its Adjusted EBITDA, which grew due to increased revenue from ongoing and new solution definition and implementation contracts. The Adjusted EBITDA margin significantly improved to 34.5 percent, up from 29.5 percent in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the positive impact of the pricing strategies implemented.
