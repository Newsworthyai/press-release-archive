# Sabre Resources advances key uranium and lithium projects

--News Direct--

Sabre Resources Ltd CEO Jon Dugdale joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the company’s continued progress in its exploration and advancement of key energy metals and gold projects. The company is progressing projects in various significant Australian locations. Today saw the company define key lithium-pegmatite drilling targets along strike of the world-class Andover discovery. Further drone-magnetics data and imagery defined an outstanding target zone for the discovery of lithium-bearing pegmatites, only 5 kilometres northeast along strike from Azure Minerals’ Andover discovery (where intersections include 209.4m @ 1.42% Li2O1). The priority targets are located within Sabre's extensive approximate 300 sq.km tenement holdings in WA's highly prospective northwest Pilbara region. Sabre is in a strong financial position, with $5.3 million in cash at the quarter's end to support ongoing exploration efforts. Key recent developments include following up on high-grade uranium results at Dingo Uranium Project, where previous drilling identified substantial uranium concentrations. In the Northwest Pilbara, drone magnetics surveys over the Andover East and Northeast targets identified potential lithium-bearing pegmatite-hosting fault corridors. Similarly, in the Eastern Goldfields, new lithium anomalies were detected over a 5 x 5-kilometre area, indicating significant exploration potential in regions associated with notable lithium deposits. Additionally, Sabre's Ninghan Gold Project in the southern Murchison district also showed promising results with two strongly anomalous zones of gold mineralisation identified. Overall, Sabre’s extensive and strategically targeted exploration activities across multiple projects demonstrate its robust operational and financial footing, positioning it to effectively pursue these promising mineral opportunities.
