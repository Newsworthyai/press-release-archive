# Unusual Machines CEO Discusses Growth and Strategic Plans Post-IPO

--News Direct--

Unusual Machines CEO Allan Evans joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the companyâ€™s origins and future plans. Emerging from the drone segment companies Rotary and Fat Shark, which were acquired from Red Cat Holdings after a successful IPO, Unusual Machines is now listed on the NYSE American, providing significant capital for expansion.

Rotary, an e-commerce store with a strong YouTube following, generates $5 million in annual revenue and is growing by 20-30% annually. Fat Shark, a premium brand, focuses on high-quality products. Unusual Machines aims to further develop these brands by leveraging their established customer channels and diverse product offerings.

The company is also targeting the defense sector, driven by initiatives such as the Chips Act, and aims to integrate drone supply chains within the US, inspired by Ukraine's successful use of drones. Unusual Machines seeks Blue UAS certification through collaboration with the Department of Defense, opening new opportunities with American companies.

Upcoming initiatives include the Rotor Riot Rampage event and the launch of an American-made flight controller by June or July, which is expected to gain Blue UAS listing and subsequent US government orders. These developments are anticipated to have a significant impact by the fall.
