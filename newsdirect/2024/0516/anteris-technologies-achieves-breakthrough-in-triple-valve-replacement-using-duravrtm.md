# Anteris Technologies achieves breakthrough in triple valve replacement using DurAVR™

--News Direct--

Anteris Technologies Ltd (ASX:AVR, OTC:AMEUF) CEO Wayne Paterson sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss a complex 'valve-in-valve-in-valve' procedure completed using its DurAVR™ transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system. This innovative biomimetic valve is made from a single piece of native-shaped tissue. The procedure was performed at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, by Dr Andreas Rück, Dr Magnus Settergren and Dr Nawzad Saleh. The patient, receiving a third valve replacement, had previously undergone a surgical valve replacement and a subsequent TAVR valve insertion, both of which failed. Due to the patient's high risk for surgical intervention and the inadequacy of existing TAVR devices, the heart team opted for the DurAVR™ system under compassionate use approval. The procedure was successful. Paterson highlights the ease of use and effectiveness of DurAVR™, noting its superior performance even in complex cases. He emphasises the unique capability of DurAVR™ to function in challenging environments, improving the patient’s condition significantly and points out the broader implications of biomimetic technology in achieving normal pre-disease hemodynamics in clinical trials. Paterson underscores DurAVR™'s unique profile and its potential as a valuable alternative in challenging cases.
