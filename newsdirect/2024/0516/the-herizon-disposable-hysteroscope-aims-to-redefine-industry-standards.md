--News Direct--

Minerva Surgical announces the immediate and exclusive distribution of a new disposable hysteroscope that will be displayed at the Annual Clinical & Scientific Meeting of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in San Francisco, CA. The company plans to soon rebrand the new disposable hysteroscope as HERizon, and their goal is to redefine the standards of efficiency and accessibility in gynecological care.

“This marks a significant milestone in the company’s mission to address the needs of gynecologists and further advance Women’s Health,” states Minerva Surgical Chief Medical Officer Eugene Skalnyi, M.D. “HERizon embodies versatility as a hysteroscope, facilitating an array of procedures both in the operating room and office settings. It is one of a few technologies that our team plans to launch to better serve the evolving patterns in Gynecology.”

The HERizon Disposable Hysteroscope is a cutting-edge system that is introduced in alignment with ACOG and AAGL's advocacy for the elimination of blind assessment practices in the uterine cavity. Several key features of the HERizon Disposable Hysteroscope include.

1. Disposable Design: Single-use hysteroscope eliminates the need for traditional hysteroscope reprocessing, reduces the risk of cross-contamination, and ensures compliance with sterility standards.

2. Angled Cannula Tip: Provides rigidity to help enter the cervical canal and articulation to navigate an array of uterine cavity positions.

3. Compact Footprint: 4.8mm outer diameter sheath requires minimal or no dilation and 6Fr working channel allows for a broad spectrum of procedures such as direct visualization polypectomy, endometrial biopsy, D&C, and IUD removal.

4. User-Friendly Interface: High-Definition image technology, two LED lights provide bright and clear visualization, and the intuitive interface enables seamless system navigation.

Dr. David Glassman, DO FACOG EMIGS, a prominent gynecologist in Phoenix, Arizona, shared his excitement about the new HERizon Disposable Hysteroscope, stating, “HERizon is a revolutionary advancement in hysteroscopy technology. Designed with precision and patient comfort in mind, HERizon offers unparalleled clarity and control, providing healthcare professionals with a clearer view and easier access to the uterine cavity. Its innovative features enhance procedural efficiency, reducing both patient discomfort and procedure times. With HERizon, healthcare providers can elevate their practice, delivering superior care and empowering women to take control of their health with confidence.”

The introduction of the HERizon Disposable Hysteroscope underscores Minerva Surgical’s commitment to providing gynecologists with solutions that improve patient outcomes.
