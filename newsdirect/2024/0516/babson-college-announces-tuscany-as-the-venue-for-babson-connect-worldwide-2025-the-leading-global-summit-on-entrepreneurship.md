Babson College announced that it will host its ninth Babson Connect Worldwide (BCW) conference in the picturesque Tuscan countryside of Italy, on March 27–29, 2025. The conference will take place at Castelfalfi, an alumni-owned five-star hotel that recently reopened after multi-million-dollar renovations that turned an 800-year-old abandoned village into an exquisite vacation destination.

BCW is a renowned global event that convenes founders, executives, and emerging stars within the entrepreneurial sphere, along with Babson alumni, faculty, and students. The summit is a platform for exchanging knowledge and insights, enabling participants to excel in their entrepreneurial pursuits.

“Babson Connect Worldwide is a vital component in our global effort to support and inspire entrepreneurial leaders to impact communities everywhere,” said Babson College President Stephen Spinelli Jr. MBA’92, PhD. “Babson alumni and friends around the world make us an everywhere institution, and BCW is the premier summit for our community of entrepreneurial leaders to recommit to lifelong learning and forge new and meaningful connections.”

The summit agenda features keynote speeches and panel discussions with prominent leaders addressing the most pressing issues faced by today’s global entrepreneurial leaders. Babson’s distinguished faculty will lead executive education workshops designed to provide current insights and practical tools, equipping participants to navigate and excel in the rapidly evolving business landscape.

The conference also offers attendees an immersive experience into Tuscan culture through planned excursions and signature after-hours events. The itinerary includes visits to iconic towns such as Siena, San Gimignano, and Volterra, and cultural activities like wine tastings, truffle hunting, scenic hikes, and bike rides. Additionally, a special “Green-Tie” gala is scheduled to take place in Florence.

Set against the backdrop of a region renowned for its crucial role in the Renaissance, Tuscany is the perfect example of the transition from traditional business frameworks to modern entrepreneurial achievements. This setting highlights the enduring impact of innovation, creativity, and the human spirit and aligns with the summit's emphasis on pioneering business practices.

Since its inception in 2015, BCW has served as a catalyst for uniting Babson’s extensive network of 45,000 alumni and friends from 129 countries. Registration will open in June 2024.
