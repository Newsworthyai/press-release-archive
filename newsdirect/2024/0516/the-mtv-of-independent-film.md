--News Direct--

The 6th Annual Transparent Film Festival is set to take place at the iconic Producers Club in midtown Manhattan's Theatre District on June 13th, this festival will not only feature some of the best in Indie Film from over 1000 submissions world-wide but will also include the launch of ABFAB.COM, it’s digital app free streaming platform.

ABFAB.COM aims to be the go-to hub for indie filmmakers, akin to what MTV did for musicians when it debuted in 1981, but with an expanded scope. With a commitment to showcasing diverse talents from across the globe, ABFAB.COM is not only partnering with festivals like Transparent Film Festival but also welcoming submissions directly from content creators. Phase 2 of its launch will broaden its scope to include comedians, theater groups, musicians, and more, in line with the original MTV ethos of celebrating creativity in all its forms.

Brian McLane, the founder of Transparent Film Festival, emphasizes the need for platforms like ABFAB.COM to provide exposure and recognition to independent filmmakers, echoing the success of the festival in highlighting the abundance of talent in the indie film scene. Through ABFAB.COM's 24-hour streaming network, every content creator will have a chance to display their work without the clutter of an app.

“We want to do everything we can to promote independent filmmaking and independent filmmakers, so having been around when MTV first came out and seeing what that did for the music world, we wanted to create ABFAB.COM so all types of films from all over the world will have a home and a place to get exposure”, said McLane.

Embracing the spirit of MTV's on-air VJs, ABFAB.COM is gearing up for worldwide auditions to find presenters who embody unity and individualism, much like the iconic personalities of MTV's golden era.

Festival Co-Founder, Michael Farr said “It’s a cool time for content creators and on-air personalities so in addition to in-house productions like “Director’s Spotlight hosted by James Ylisela,” other ABFAB.COM original programming, plus the amazing content that gets submitted to us, we will pay homage to the MTV era by casting VJ’s to intro films and host content on the channel.

As submissions for the 6th Annual Transparent Film Festival are now closed, the festival's commitment to reviewing every film in its entirety sets it apart, providing valuable feedback to content creators and ensuring a fair evaluation process. ABFAB.COM seeks to offer viewers an alternative to mainstream platforms, focusing on independent content creation and delivering a quality viewing experience.

Festival Judge, Marc Mifsud said “We take great pride in the fact that we review each and every film that is submitted and provide direct feedback to filmmakers, I think the people who submit feel good knowing that their film will be reviewed and not just end up in a pile of films that never get a chance to be truly judged.“
